Ladies and Gentlemen:

In connection with that certain Equity Purchase Agreement, dated as of the
date hereof, by and among Ardi BidCo Ltd., a Delaware corporation (the "
_Buyer_ "), and RTI Surgical Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "
_Parent_ ") (as amended, amended and restated, supplemented, or otherwise
modified from time to time, the " _Agreement_ "), subject to the terms and
conditions herein, the undersigned private equity investment funds, (the "
_Investors_ ") are pleased to offer this commitment to purchase, directly or
indirectly, through one or more parent companies of Buyer or otherwise,
securities of Buyer subject to the terms and conditions herein, for an
aggregate purchase price in cash not to exceed $480,000,000 (as such amount
may be reduced in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 1_ hereof), that is
sufficient, after taking into account the proceeds of other cash sources
(including the cash of Parent) available to Buyer, to permit Buyer (x) to
consummate the transactions contemplated by the Agreement (collectively, the "
_Transaction_ ") on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein,
(y) to satisfy Buyers obligation to pay the aggregate amount payable
pursuant to and in accordance with Section 4.2 of the Agreement and any other
amounts payable by Buyer pursuant to the terms of the Transaction Agreements
and (z) to pay related fees and expenses pursuant to and in accordance with
the Agreement (such amount, the " _Aggregate Commitment_ "). Capitalized terms
used but not otherwise defined herein shall have the respective meanings given
to them in the Agreement. 

1\. _Commitment_. Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, each Investor
hereby irrevocably commits and agrees severally (and not jointly or jointly
and severally) to acquire, directly or indirectly, equity and/or debt
securities of the Buyer for an aggregate purchase price in cash not to exceed
an amount equal the percentage of the Aggregate Commitment set forth opposite
such Investors name on _Schedule A_ hereto, _multiplied_ by the



   

Aggregate Commitment (such amount with respect to each Investor is such
Investors " _Maximum Investor Commitment_ "). For the avoidance of doubt,
the issuer and type of securities shall be determined by each Investor in its
sole discretion. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this letter, (a)
to the extent the Buyer is relieved, in whole or in part, for any reason of
its payment obligations in connection with the Closing under the Agreement,
the corresponding obligation of the Investors to fund their respective Maximum
Investor Commitment hereunder shall be similarly relieved or reduced on a
_pro rata_ basis (and without duplication), and (b) each Investor is entitled
to any and all rights, remedies, set-offs and defenses that the Buyer could
assert pursuant to the terms of the Agreement or pursuant to any applicable
Laws in connection therewith. The proceeds from the Investors investment up
to the Aggregate Commitment shall be used for funding the aggregate amount
payable pursuant to and in accordance with Section 4.2 of the Agreement, any
other amounts payable by Buyer pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and the
payment of related fees and expenses, and for no other purpose. No Investor
shall be obligated to fund the commitment evidenced hereby except in
accordance with Section 2 hereof. No Investor will be under any obligation to
contribute, or cause there to be contributed, pursuant to this letter, or
otherwise have any obligation or liability under this letter for, an amount
in excess of such Investors Maximum Investor Commitment. Each Investor may
allocate all or a portion of its Maximum Investor Commitment to other
investors, and its Maximum Investor Commitment hereunder will be
reduced dollar for dollar by any amounts actually contributed to the Buyer,
or to any Affiliate of the Buyer organized to consummate the Transaction, in
each case to the extent such amounts are used (or, without duplication,
available for use) in order to satisfy the obligations of such Investor
hereunder. Solely in the event that, prior to the Closing, Parent agrees, as
evidenced by a writing executed by an officer of Parent, to accept Buyers use
of a "committed funds" financing arrangement pursuant to and in accordance
with Section 6.4 of the Agreement, then the Aggregate Commitment shall be
reduced by the amount of such "committed funds" financing arrangement (and the
corresponding obligation of the Investors to fund their respective Maximum
Investor Commitment hereunder shall be similarly relieved or reduced on a _pro
rata_ basis (and without duplication)).

 

2\. _Conditions Precedent_. Each Investors obligations to fund its Maximum
Investor Commitment shall be conditioned upon:

 

a. the execution and delivery of the Agreement by Parent;

 

b. the satisfaction or waiver of all conditions precedent to the Closing set
forth in Articles IX and X of the Agreement (except those conditions that by
their nature cannot be satisfied except by actions to be taken at the Closing,
provided that such conditions are actually satisfied or validly waived at the
Closing, or such conditions that have not been satisfied as a result of
a breach of the Agreement by Buyer); and

c. the consummation of the Closing or the occurrence of the time at which the
Closing would be required to occur in accordance with Article IV of the
Agreement.

3\. _No Recourse_.

 

a. Notwithstanding anything that may be expressed or implied in this letter to
the contrary, by its acceptance hereof, Buyer acknowledges and agrees that
all claims, obligations, liabilities, causes of action, actions, or
proceedings (in each case, whether in contract or in tort, at law or in
equity, or pursuant to statute or otherwise) that may be based upon, in
respect of, arise under, out or by reason of, be connected with, or relate in
any manner to this letter, or the negotiation, execution, performance, or
breach of this letter (each, a " _Claim_ "), including, without limitation,
any representation or warranty made in, in connection with, or an as
inducement to, this letter may be made or asserted only against (and are
expressly limited to) the Investors, as expressly identified in the preamble
to and signature page of this letter. No Person who is not Buyer or an
Investor (including, without limitation, (i) any past, present or future
director, officer, employee, incorporator, member, partner, manager,
management company, stockholder, equityholder, Affiliate (other than Buyer),
agent, assignee, attorney, or representative of, and any past, present or
future financial advisor or lender to (collectively " _Affiliated Persons_ ")
an Investor, and (ii) any Affiliated Persons of such Affiliated Persons (the
Persons in subclauses (i) and (ii), together with their respective
successors, assigns, heirs, executors or administrators, collectively, the "
_Non-Parties_ ")) shall have any liability or obligation in respect of any
Claims.

b. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, to the maximum extent
explicitly permitted or otherwise conceivable under applicable Laws, (i)
Buyer hereby waives, releases and disclaims any and all Claims against all
Non-Parties, including, without limitation, any Claims to avoid or disregard
the entity form of an Investor or otherwise impose any liability arising out
of, relating to or in connection with a Claim on any Non-Parties, whether a
Claim granted by statute or based on theories of equity, agency, control,
instrumentality, alter ego, domination, sham, single business enterprise,
piercing the veil, unfairness, undercapitalization, or otherwise, and (ii)
Buyer disclaims any reliance upon any Non-Parties with respect to the
performance of this letter or any representation or warranty made in, in
connection with, or as an inducement to this letter.

 

4\. _Term_. The Aggregate Commitment (and each Investors Maximum Investor
Commitment) set forth herein shall become effective on the date and time at
which the Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by all parties
thereto, including, without limitation, by Buyer, whereupon this commitment
letter will constitute the commitment of each Investor to provide the
aforementioned financing to Buyer on the terms and conditions set forth
herein.

5\. _Termination_. All obligations of each Investor arising out of or in
connection with this letter shall terminate automatically and immediately upon
the earliest to occur of: (a) the consummation of the Closing (including the
payment of all amounts payable by Buyer under Section 4.2 of the Agreement);
(b) the valid termination of the Agreement in accordance with its terms; and
(c) the assertion by Parent or its controlled Affiliates, of any Claim against
any Investor or any Non-Party (other than any Claim by Parent as a third-
party beneficiary of this letter pursuant to, and upon the terms and
conditions set forth in, the proviso of the first sentence of _Section_ __ _
9_ of this letter ).

6\. _Indemnification_.

 

a. Buyer agrees to indemnify and to hold harmless each Investor and the Non-
Parties (collectively, the " _Indemnified Persons_ ") from and against any
and all actions, suits, proceedings (including any investigations or
inquiries), losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses of any kind or
nature whatsoever that may be suffered, incurred by or asserted against or
involve the Indemnified Persons as a result of or arising out of or in any way
related to the transactions described in this letter (including those
resulting from any Indemnified Persons negligence);  _provided_ , _however_
, that the foregoing will not apply to the extent found by a final decision of
a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted solely from the gross
negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnified Person. Buyer further
agrees to pay to or reimburse any Indemnified Person upon demand any legal or
other expenses incurred by such Indemnified Person in connection with
investigating, defending, or preparing to defend any such action, suit, claim
or proceeding (including any inquiry or investigation). The provisions of
this _Section_ __ _ 6_ are independent of all other obligations of Buyer
hereunder and shall survive termination or expiration of this letter pursuant
to  _Section_ __ _ 5_ above.

b. BUYER HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THE FOREGOING INDEMNITY SHALL BE APPLICABLE
TO ALL CLAIMS, LIABILITIES, LOSSES, DAMAGES OR EXPENSES THAT HAVE RESULTED
FROM OR ARE ALLEGED TO HAVE RESULTED FROM THE ACTIVE OR PASSIVE OR THE SOLE,
JOINT OR CONCURRENT ORDINARY NEGLIGENCE OF ANY INVESTOR OR ANY OTHER
INDEMNIFIED PERSON.

 

7\. _Assignment_. Each Investors Maximum Investor Commitment evidenced by
this letter shall be assignable by each Investor;  _provided_ , _however_ ,
that neither such assignment by such Investor nor any other assignment by such
Investor shall relieve such Investor of its obligations under this letter
(including such Investors obligation to fund its Maximum Investor Commitment
to Buyer) except by any amounts actually contributed to Buyer by payment in
cash by such assignees on or before the Closing, as contemplated in _Section_
__ _ 1_ above, that are available to fund the consummation of the
Transaction at the Closing, and each Investor shall remain liable in full for
any unsatisfied portion of its obligations under this letter.

 

8\. _Entire Agreement; Amendments_. This letter contains the entire
understanding of the parties hereto with regard to the subject
matter contained herein or therein, and supersede all other prior
representations, warranties, agreements, understandings or letters of intent
between or among any of the parties hereto. This letter shall not be amended,
modified or supplemented except by a written instrument signed by an
authorized representative of each of the parties hereto and Parent. Any term
or provision of this letter may be waived, or the time for its performance may
be extended, in writing by Parent and the party or parties entitled to the
benefit thereof. Any such waiver shall be validly and sufficiently authorized
for the purposes of this letter if, as to any party, it is authorized in
writing by an authorized representative of such 

 



-4- 

    

 party. For this purpose, an email, even if it includes a signature block of
the sender, shall not be considered a "writing", although an electronic copy
of a document duly executed on behalf of a party hereto shall be considered a
"writing" even if transmitted by email or other electronic means. The failure
of any party hereto to enforce at any time any provision of this letter shall
not be construed to be a waiver of such provision, nor in any way to affect
the validity of this letter or any part hereof or the right of any party
thereafter to enforce each and every such provision. No waiver of any breach
of this letter shall be held to constitute a waiver of any other or
subsequent breach.

9\. _Third Party Beneficiary_. Except for the Non-Parties (pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 3_ hereof), the Indemnified Persons (pursuant to _Section_ __
_ 6_ hereof) and Parent (pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 9_), no Person
other than Buyer shall be entitled to rely upon or enforce this letter, and
this letter shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of each
party hereto and nothing herein or in any other agreement (including, without
limitation, the Agreement), express or implied, is intended to or shall
confer upon any other Person any rights, benefits or remedies whatsoever under
or by reason of this letter; _provided_ , _however_ , that, subject to the
terms and conditions set forth in this letter and in Section 13.12 of the
Agreement, Parent is hereby made an express third party beneficiary of this
letter and may enforce this letter solely for the purpose of (and for no other
purpose, including, without limitation, any claim for damages) seeking
specific performance of Buyers right to cause an Investor to fund its portion
of the Aggregate Commitment (solely to the extent that Buyer is permitted to
enforce the Aggregate Commitment (and each Investors Maximum
Investor Commitment) pursuant to the terms and conditions of this letter and
Parent is permitted to obtain specific performance against Buyer pursuant to
Section 13.12 of the Agreement). In furtherance of the foregoing, no creditor
of Buyer or any of its Affiliates, or any Person claiming by, through or on
behalf of any of them, shall have any right to enforce this letter or to cause
Buyer or any other Person to seek to enforce this letter. For the avoidance of
doubt, in no event shall Parent (except solely pursuant to the first sentence
of this _Section_ __ _ 9_), any of its stockholders or equityholders or any
of its or their Affiliates, or any Person claiming by, through or on behalf of
any of them, be entitled to enforce this letter, and Parent (except solely
pursuant to the first sentence of this _Section_ __ _ 9_) and the
stockholders and equityholders of any of the foregoing and its or their
Affiliates, and any Person claiming by, through or on behalf of any of them,
are expressly disclaimed as third-party beneficiaries hereof. Each Investor
(i) waives (x) any defenses in any action for specific performance, including,
without limitation, the defense that a remedy at law would be adequate and
(y) any requirement under any law to post a bond or other security as a
prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief and (ii) agrees not to assert that
a remedy of specific performance or other equitable relief is unenforceable,
invalid, contrary to law or equity for any reason. Without limiting, and
subject in all respects to, Buyers rights against Parent under the Agreement,
Buyer agrees that it will not take any actions that would, or
would reasonably be expected to, interfere with or delay Parents exercise of
its rights as a third party beneficiary of this letter agreement pursuant to
this _Section_ __ _ 9_.

10\. _Governing Law, Submission to Jurisdiction_. This letter and all claims
or causes of action (whether in contract, tort or statute) that may be based
upon, arise out of or relate to this letter or the negotiation, execution or
performance of this letter (including any claim or cause of action based upon,
arising out of or related to any representation or warranty made in or in
connection with this letter or as an inducement to enter into this letter),
shall be governed by and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of
Delaware applicable to contracts made and performed in such State, without
giving effect to any laws of the State of Delaware that would require or
permit the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction. The parties
hereby irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware (or in the event, but only in the event,
that such court does not have subject matter jurisdiction over such action or
proceeding, the Superior Court of the State of Delaware (Complex Commercial
Division) or, if subject matter jurisdiction over the action or proceeding is
vested exclusively in the federal courts of the United States of America, the
United States District Court for the District of Delaware) over any dispute
based on, arising out of or relating to this letter or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby and each party hereby irrevocably agrees that
all claims in respect of such dispute or any suit, action or proceeding
related thereto may be heard and determined in such courts. The parties
hereby irrevocably waive, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law,
any objection which they may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of
any such dispute brought in such court or any defense of inconvenient forum
for the maintenance of such dispute. Each of the parties hereto agrees that a
judgment in any such dispute may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on
the judgment or in any other manner provided by law. Each of the parties
hereby consents to process being served by any party to this letter in any
suit, action or proceeding by the delivery of a copy thereof in accordance
with the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 10_.

 

11\. _Waiver of Jury Trial_. Each party hereto waives the right to a trial by
jury in any Proceeding in connection with or relating to this letter. Each
party hereto (a) certifies that no representative, agent or attorney of any
other party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other party
would not, in the event of a dispute, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver,
and (b) acknowledges that it and the other parties hereto have been induced
to enter into this letter and the other transaction agreements by, among other
things, the mutual waivers and certifications in this _Section_ __ _ 11_. 

12\. _Severability_. Wherever possible, each provision hereof shall be
interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable law,
but in case any one or more of the provisions contained herein shall, for any
reason, be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such
provision shall be ineffective to the extent, but only to the extent, of
such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability without invalidating the
remainder of such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision or provisions or
any other provisions hereof, unless such a construction would be unreasonable;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that this letter may not be enforced without giving
effect to the provisions in _Sections_ _1_ , _2_ , _4_ , _6_ and _7_ hereof.
No party hereto shall assert, and each party hereto shall cause
its respective Affiliates not to assert, that this letter or any part hereof
is invalid, illegal or unenforceable.

13\. _Execution in Counterparts_. This letter may be executed in one or more
counterparts, each of which shall be considered an original instrument, but
all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement, and shall become
binding when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the parties
hereto and delivered to Parent and Buyer.

 



-6- 

    

14\. _Confidentiality_. This letter shall be treated as strictly confidential
and is being provided to Buyer solely in connection with the Agreement and
the Transaction. This letter may not be used, circulated, quoted or otherwise
referred to in any document, except with the written consent of each Investor.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, this letter may be provided to Parent and each
of its representatives and advisors who have been directed to treat this
letter as confidential, and on the condition that any such recipient agrees to
treat, and shall direct its Affiliates, representatives and advisors to so
treat, this letter as confidential.

15\. _Representations and Warranties_. Each Investor hereby represents and
warrants that (a) it has the requisite corporate or limited partnership, as
applicable, power and authority to execute, deliver and perform this letter,
(b) the execution, delivery and performance of this letter by it has been
