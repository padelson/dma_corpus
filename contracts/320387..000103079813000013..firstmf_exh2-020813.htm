(ii)

  |  

Subject to the other provisions of this Article II, in the event each issued
and outstanding share of Seller CDCI Preferred Stock is not redeemed or
purchased prior to or contemporaneously with the Parent Merger, then each
share of Seller CDCI Preferred Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time (other than any shares of Seller CDCI Preferred Stock to
be canceled in accordance with Section 2.1(a)(v)) shall thereupon be converted
automatically into and shall thereafter represent the right to receive one
share (the "CDCI Preferred Stock Consideration"; for purposes of this
Agreement, references to the "Merger Consideration" shall mean, as the case
may be, the Common Stock Merger Consideration when referring to the
consideration for shares of Seller Common Stock and the CDCI Preferred Stock
Consideration when referring to the consideration for shares of Seller CDCI
Preferred Stock) of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Acquiror to
be designated, prior to the Closing Date, as Fixed Rate Cumulative Perpetual
Preferred Stock, Class B Non-Voting, Series CD, stated liquidation amount
$1,000 per share (the "Acquiror CDCI Preferred Stock" and, together with the
Acquiror Common Stock, the "Acquiror Capital Stock"), and otherwise having
rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers such that the rights,
preferences, privileges and voting powers of the Seller CDCI Preferred Stock
are not adversely affected by such conversion and having rights, preferences,
privileges and voting powers, and limitations and restrictions that, taken as
a whole, are not materially less favorable than the rights, preferences,
privileges and voting powers, and limitations and restrictions of the Seller
CDCI Preferred Stock immediately prior to such conversion, taken as a whole;
provided, that the voting powers of the Acquiror CDCI Preferred Stock shall be
substantially the same as the voting powers of the Seller CDCI Preferred
Stock.

  |  

(iii)

  |  

Certificates previously evidencing shares of Seller Capital Stock shall be
exchanged for certificates evidencing the applicable Merger Consideration.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, no fractional shares of Acquiror
Common Stock shall be issued, and, in lieu thereof, a cash payment shall be
made pursuant to Section 2.1(b).

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

(iv)

  |  

If at any time during the period between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time, any change in the number of outstanding shares of capital
stock of Acquiror or Seller, respectively, shall occur (or for which the
relevant record date will occur) as a result of any reclassification,
recapitalization, stock split (including a reverse stock split) or other
subdivision, combination or readjustment of shares, or as a result of any
stock dividend or stock distribution with a record date during such period,
the Exchange Ratio shall be equitably and proportionately adjusted, if
necessary and without duplication, to reflect such change.

  |  

(v)

  |  

Each share of Seller Capital Stock held in the treasury of Seller and each
share of Seller Capital Stock owned by Acquiror or any subsidiary of Acquiror
or Seller (other than in a fiduciary capacity or as a result of debts
previously contracted) immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
automatically be cancelled and extinguished without any conversion thereof and
no consideration shall be issued with respect thereto.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

(b) No certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Acquiror Common
Stock will be issued as a result of the Parent Merger. In lieu of the issuance
of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.1(a) of this Agreement, cash
adjustments (without interest) will be paid to the holder of Seller Common
Stock in respect of any fraction of a share of Acquiror Common Stock that
would otherwise be issuable to such holder of Seller Common Stock, and the
amount of such cash adjustment shall be determined by multiplying the fraction
of a share of Acquiror Common Stock otherwise issuable by the average of the
closing price of one share of Acquiror Common Stock for the 10 trading days
immediately preceding the last trading day immediately prior to the Closing
Date as reported by the Nasdaq Global Select Market, and no such holder shall
be entitled to dividends, voting rights or any other right of stockholders in
respect of any fractional share.

  

  

2.2 Exchange of Seller Capital Stock Certificates.

  

  

(a) Acquiror has appointed Registrar and Transfer Company to serve as exchange
agent in connection with the Parent Merger for the purpose of exchanging
certificates of Seller Capital Stock for the Merger Consideration (the
"Exchange Agent"). As of the Effective Time, Acquiror shall deposit in trust
with the Exchange Agent for the benefit of Seller's stockholders the aggregate
number of shares of Acquiror Capital Stock equal to the aggregate Merger
Consideration (such shares of Acquiror Capital Stock, together with cash
sufficient to make payments required with respect to fractional shares of
Acquiror Capital Stock in accordance with Section 2.1(b) above and to pay any
dividends or distributions with respect to such Acquiror Capital Stock in
accordance with Section 2.5 below, the "Exchange Fund"). Acquiror shall
deposit such shares of Acquiror Capital Stock with the Exchange Agent by
delivering to the Exchange Agent certificates representing, or providing to
the Exchange Agent an uncertificated book-entry for, such shares and
immediately available funds for such cash in accordance with Section 2.1(b)
and Section 2.5.

  

  

(b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the Exchange
Agent shall mail to the former record holders of the shares of Seller Capital
Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that have
been converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration a letter of
transmittal (which letter shall specify that the delivery of the Merger
Consideration shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only
upon proper delivery of a certificate or certificates formerly representing
shares of Seller Capital Stock to the Exchange Agent and shall otherwise be in
form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Acquiror and the Exchange Agent)
and instructions for use in effecting the surrender to the Exchange Agent of
certificates of Seller Capital Stock in exchange for the Merger Consideration.
After the Effective Time, upon surrender to the Exchange Agent by the holder
thereof of the certificate(s) representing shares of Seller Capital Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that have been
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, together with a
letter of transmittal duly executed and completed in accordance with the
instructions thereto and any other documents reasonably required by the
Exchange Agent or Acquiror, the Exchange Agent on behalf of Acquiror shall
deliver the Merger Consideration to each such holder in exchange for each such
share plus a check in the amount (if any) equal to any cash that such holder
has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.1(b) or Section 2.5 hereof,
without interest. Holders of record of shares of Seller Capital Stock who hold
such shares as nominees, trustees or in other representative capacities (a
"Representative") may submit multiple letters of transmittal, provided that
such Representative certifies that each such letter of transmittal covers all
the shares of Seller Capital Stock held by each such Representative for a
particular beneficial owner. Each certificate for Seller Capital Stock so
surrendered and all transmittal materials shall be duly completed and endorsed
as the Exchange Agent may require. The Exchange Agent shall not be obligated
to deliver the Merger Consideration to which any former holder of Seller
Capital Stock is entitled as a result of the Merger until such holder
surrenders his certificate or certificates representing shares of Seller
Capital Stock for exchange as provided in this Section 2.2. After the
Effective Time, each certificate that represented outstanding shares of Seller
Capital Stock prior to the Effective Time shall be deemed for all corporate
purposes (other than the payment of dividends and other distributions to which
the former stockholders of Seller Capital Stock may be entitled) to evidence
only the right of the holder thereof to receive the Merger Consideration in
exchange for each such share or as provided in Section 2.1 of this Agreement.
Acquiror shall instruct the Exchange Agent to timely pay the Merger
Consideration following the receipt of each letter of transmittal.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

5  

  

 

 

 

  

(c) Any portion of the Exchange Fund held by the Exchange Agent that remains
undistributed to the former stockholders of Seller for 6 months after the
Effective Time shall be delivered to Acquiror upon demand, and any former
stockholders of Seller who have not theretofore complied with this Section 2.2
shall thereafter look only to Acquiror for payment of their claims for
Acquiror Capital Stock, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Acquiror
Common Stock or any dividends or distributions with respect to Acquiror
Capital Stock (all without any interest thereon). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, none of Acquiror, any subsidiary thereof or the Exchange Agent
shall be liable to any former holder of Seller Capital Stock for shares of
Acquiror Capital Stock (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) or
cash in lieu of fractional shares of Acquiror Capital Stock delivered in good
faith to public officials pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Law.

  

  

(d) From and after the Effective Time, the holders of certificates of Seller
Capital Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect to shares of Seller
Capital Stock represented thereby except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement or by applicable Law. All rights to receive the Merger Consideration
issued upon conversion of the shares of Seller Capital Stock pursuant to this
Article II shall be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to such shares of Seller Capital Stock.

  

  

(e) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be issued to a person
other than the person in whose name a stock certificate for shares of Seller
Capital Stock (each a "Seller Stock Certificate") so surrendered is
registered, it shall be a condition to such issuance that such Seller Stock
Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for
transfer, and the person requesting such issuance shall pay to the Exchange
Agent any transfer or other similar Taxes (as defined in Section 3.7(c))
required as a result of such issuance to a person other than the registered
holder of such Seller Stock Certificate, or establish to the reasonable
satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Taxes have been paid or are not
payable. Acquiror or the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold, without duplication, from the consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Seller Capital Stock such amounts
as Acquiror or the Exchange Agent is required to deduct and withhold under the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), or any provision of
Tax Law, with respect to the making of such payment and shall further be
entitled to sell Acquiror Capital Stock otherwise issuable pursuant to this
Agreement to satisfy any such withholding requirement (which Acquiror Capital
Stock will be valued with respect to such withholding at the average of the
high and low trading prices thereof on the day of such sale). To the extent
the amounts are so withheld by Acquiror or the Exchange Agent and paid over to
the applicable Governmental Entity, such withheld amounts shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of shares of
Seller Capital Stock in respect of whom such deduction and withholding was
made by Acquiror or the Exchange Agent.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

6  

  

 

 

 

  

(f) In the event any of the Seller Stock Certificate(s) shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
person claiming such Seller Stock Certificate(s) to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if required by Acquiror or the Exchange Agent, the posting by
such person of a bond in such sum as either of them may reasonably direct as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it or the Surviving
Corporation with respect to such Seller Stock Certificate(s), the Exchange
Agent shall issue the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect of the
shares of Seller Capital Stock represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed
Seller Stock Certificate(s) (together with a check in the amount (if any) of
any dividends or distributions payable in accordance with Section 2.5).

  

  

(g) The Exchange Agent shall invest the cash balances in the Exchange Fund in
a demand deposit account or as directed by Acquiror. Any interest and other
income resulting from such investments shall be paid to the Acquiror upon
termination of the Exchange Fund pursuant to Section 2.2(c).

  

  

2.3 [Intentionally omitted.]

  

  

2.4 Additional Actions. If at any time after the Effective Time the Surviving
Corporation shall consider that any further assignments or assurances in Law
or any other acts are necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement, Seller and its proper officers and directors shall be deemed to
have granted to the Surviving Corporation an irrevocable power of attorney to
execute and deliver all such proper deeds, assignments and assurances in Law
and to do all acts necessary or proper to vest, perfect or confirm title to
and possession of such rights, properties or assets in the Surviving
Corporation and otherwise to carry out the purposes of this Agreement; and the
proper officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation are fully
authorized in the name of Seller or otherwise to take any and all such action.

  

  

2.5 Rights as Stockholders. All shares of Acquiror Capital Stock to be issued
as Merger Consideration shall be deemed issued and outstanding as of the
Effective Time. Former stockholders of Seller and any other persons who or
which are entitled to receive Acquiror Capital Stock as a result of the Parent
Merger will be able to vote (as to holders of Acquiror CDCI Preferred Stock,
to the extent provided under the designation therefor) after the Effective
Time at any meeting of Acquiror stockholders or pursuant to any written
consent procedure the number of whole shares of Acquiror Capital Stock into
which their shares of Seller Capital Stock are converted, regardless of
whether they have exchanged their Seller Stock Certificates. In addition,
whenever a dividend is declared by Acquiror on the Acquiror Capital Stock
after the Effective Time, the declaration shall include dividends on all
shares of Acquiror Capital Stock issuable hereunder, but no stockholder will
be entitled to receive his distribution of such dividends until physical
exchange of such stockholder's Seller Stock Certificates shall have been
effected. Upon exchange of a stockholder's Seller Stock Certificates, any such
person shall be entitled to receive from Acquiror an amount equal to all
dividends (without interest thereon less the amount of any taxes, if any, that
may have been withheld, imposed or paid thereon) declared, and for which the
payment has occurred, on the shares represented thereby; provided, however,
that former stockholders of Seller shall not be entitled to receive any
dividend on their Acquiror Capital Stock with respect to any period for which
Acquiror paid a dividend prior to the Effective Time.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

7  

  

 

 

 

  

2.6 Stock Transfer Records. Prior to the Effective Time, Seller shall continue
to maintain its stock transfer records and to transfer and replace stock
certificates in accordance with its existing policies and past practices with
regard to such transfers and replacements. From and after the Effective Time,
there shall be no further registration or transfers on the stock transfer
books of Seller or Acquiror of shares of Seller Capital Stock which were
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If after the
Effective Time, the Seller Stock Certificates are presented to the Surviving
Corporation, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the Merger
Consideration in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Article II.

  

  

2.7 Subsidiary Merger. At the effective time of the Subsidiary Merger, each
share of common stock, $5,000.00 par value per share, of Seller Sub (the
"Seller Sub Common Stock") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
effective time of the Subsidiary Merger shall automatically be cancelled and
there shall be no conversion or exchange of, or consideration paid or issued
for, such Seller Sub Common Stock. The certificate or certificates for such
Seller Sub Common Stock shall be surrendered and cancelled. All of the shares
of Acquiror Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time
of the Subsidiary Merger shall remain issued and outstanding after the
effective time of the Subsidiary Merger and shall be unaffected by the
Subsidiary Merger.

  

  

2.8 Seller Stock Options and Related Matters; Seller Warrant.

  

  

(a) As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Parent Merger and without any
action on the part of the holders thereof, all rights with respect to Seller
Common Stock issuable pursuant to the exercise of stock options or similar
rights granted by Seller (collectively, "Seller Stock Options") under Seller's
2005 Equity Incentive Plan (the "Seller Incentive Plan") or any other equity
incentive plan which are outstanding at the Effective Time, whether or not
such Seller Stock Options are then exercisable, shall cease to represent a
right to acquire shares of Seller Common Stock and, subject to this Section,
be assumed by Acquiror in accordance with the terms of the Seller Incentive
Plan and the agreement by which such Seller Stock Options are evidenced,
except that from and after the Effective Time (i) Acquiror and its
Compensation Committee shall be substituted for Seller and Seller's
Compensation Committee as administrators of the Seller Incentive Plan, (ii)
each Seller Stock Option assumed by Acquiror hereunder may be exercised solely
for Acquiror Common Stock, (iii) the number of shares of Acquiror Common Stock
subject to such Seller Stock Option shall be equal to the number of shares of
Seller Common Stock subject to such Seller Stock Option immediately prior to
the Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio (rounded down to the
nearest whole share), and (iv) the per share exercise price under each such
Seller Stock Option shall be adjusted by dividing the per share exercise price
under each such Seller Stock Option by the Exchange Ratio (rounded up to the
nearest cent). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section
2.8(a), the number of shares of Acquiror Common Stock subject to any converted
Seller Stock Option, and the exercise price per share of any converted Seller
Stock Option, shall be determined in a manner that (x) will not result in such
conversion being treated as a new grant of stock options or deferred
compensation under Section 409A of the Code, (y) with respect to each Seller
Stock Option intended to qualify as an "incentive stock option" under Section
422 of the Code, will not result in such conversion being treated as a
modification, extension or renewal of such Seller Stock Option within the
meaning of Section 424(h) of the Code and (z) most closely reflects the
economics of the adjustment pursuant to this Section 2.8(a).

  

  

(b) Before the Effective Time, (i) Seller's Board of Directors (or, if
appropriate, any committee administering the Seller Incentive Plan) shall
adopt such resolutions or take such other actions as may be required to effect
the transactions described in this Section 2.8. At all times after the
Effective Time, Acquiror shall reserve for issuance such number of shares of
Acquiror Common Stock as shall be necessary to permit the exercise of any
converted or substitute Seller Stock Options. As soon as practicable after the
Effective Time, if Acquiror has not already done so, and to the extent Seller
shall have a registration statement in effect or an obligation to file a
registration statement, Acquiror shall file a registration statement on Form
S-3 or Form S-8 (or any successor or appropriate form) with respect to the
Acquiror Common Stock subject to the assumed Seller Stock Options and shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such
registration statement (and maintain the current status of the prospectus or
prospectuses contained therein) for so long as such assumed Seller Stock
Options remain outstanding.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

8  

  

 

 

 

  

(c) The number of shares of Acquiror Common Stock subject to the converted or
substituted Seller Stock Options and the exercise price therefor shall, from
and after the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, be subject to
appropriate adjustment in the event of the occurrence of any transaction
described in Section 2.1(a)(iv) hereof if the record date with respect to such
transaction is on or after the date of this Agreement or the Effective Time,
respectively.

  

  

(d) Prior to the Effective Time, Seller shall deliver all required notices
(which notices shall have been approved by Acquiror, in its reasonable
discretion) to each holder of Seller Stock Options, setting forth each
holder's or participant's rights pursuant to the Seller Incentive Plan and
stating that such Seller Stock Options shall be treated in the manner set
forth in this Section 2.8.

  

  

(e) In the event that certain warrant issued on February 27, 2009 to the
United States Department of the Treasury (the "Treasury Department") in
connection with the issuance of Seller's Fixed Rate Cumulative Perpetual
Preferred Stock, Class B Non-Voting, Series A (which the Treasury Department
exchanged for the Seller CDCI Preferred Stock) (the "Seller Warrant") is not
redeemed or purchased prior to or contemporaneously with the Parent Merger,
the Seller Warrant shall, by virtue of the Parent Merger and without any
action on the part of the holder thereof, cease to represent a warrant to
purchase Seller Common Stock and will be converted automatically into a
warrant to purchase Acquiror Common Stock (the "Acquiror Warrant") in
accordance with the terms of the Seller Warrant (including appropriate
adjustments to the number of shares of Acquiror Common Stock purchasable
thereunder and the exercise price thereof), and Acquiror will assume such
warrant subject to its terms. At all times after the Effective Time, Acquiror
shall reserve for issuance such number of shares of Acquiror Common Stock as
shall be necessary to permit the exercise of the Acquiror Warrant.

date hereof to Acquiror and Acquiror Sub as set forth in this Article III,
except as set forth in the disclosure schedule provided to Acquiror herewith
(the "Seller Disclosure Schedule"). The Seller Disclosure Schedule is arranged
in sections corresponding to the numbered and lettered sections contained in
this Article III. Nothing in a section of the Seller Disclosure Schedule
referenced in a representation or warranty shall be deemed adequate to
disclose an exception to a representation or warranty made herein unless the
Seller Disclosure Schedule identifies the exception with particularity and
describes the relevant facts in detail. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the mere listing (or inclusion of a copy) of a document or other
item shall not be deemed adequate to disclose an exception to a representation
or warranty made herein (unless the representation or warranty has to do with
the existence of the document or other item itself). The phrase "provided to
Acquiror", "delivered to Acquiror" or "made available to Acquiror" or any
phrase of similar import means that Seller or Seller Sub has delivered,
provided access to or made certain items available for review and copying, or
that such items are available on www.sec.gov, to Acquiror, Acquiror Sub or
their counsel. For purposes of this Article III, the phrase "to the Knowledge
of Seller" or any phrase of similar import shall be deemed to refer to the
actual knowledge of the senior executive officers of Seller and Seller Sub
(i.e., the senior vice president level and above) after reasonable
investigation.

business, operations, assets or financial condition of Seller and Seller Sub,

omissions of Seller or any of the Subsidiaries (as defined below) taken with

would not have a Seller Material Adverse Effect.

  

  

(c) Each of the Subsidiaries (other than Seller Sub, which is addressed in
Section 3.1(b)), is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing
under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization. Each of the Subsidiaries
has the corporate, limited liability company or trust power and authority, as

stockholders of Seller and Seller Sub, Seller and Seller Sub have all
requisite corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement

thereof. The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Merger Documents

Seller's stockholders of this Agreement, the Parent Merger Document and the

availability of equitable remedies (including specific performance and
injunctive relief) is within the discretion of the court before which any
proceeding may be brought), and is in full force and effect. Seller and Seller
Sub have duly performed in all respects all of their material obligations
under Risk Management Instruments to the extent such obligations to perform
have accrued; and there are no breaches, violations or defaults, or
allegations or assertions thereof by any party thereunder. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, as of the date hereof no events or

loans and extensions of credit that have been made by Seller Sub that are
subject to Section 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act, as amended, and
Regulation O (12 C.F.R. Part 215) promulgated thereunder comply therewith.
Neither the terms of such loans nor any of the loan documentation nor the
manner in which such loans have been originated, administered and serviced nor

such loan is enforceable against the obligor(s) thereunder in accordance with
its terms, in each such case subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,

generally (or the enforcement of the rights of creditors of FDIC-insured
institutions in particular), and except that the availability of equitable
remedies (including specific performance and injunctive relief) is within the
discretion of the court before which any proceeding may be brought. All such
loans will continue in full force and effect immediately after the Effective
Time, other than any loans that are paid or otherwise satisfied in full after
the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time. For purposes of this Section
3.23, the term "loans" includes, without limitation, the documents relating in
any way to such loans, including, without limitation, loan applications,
notes, security agreements, deeds of trust, appraisals, credit reports,
disclosures, titles to collateral, verifications (including employment
verification, deposit verification, etc.), mortgages, loan agreements,
including building and loan agreements, guarantees, pledge agreements,
financing statements, intercreditor agreements, participation agreements,
sureties and insurance policies (including title insurance policies) and all

time. With respect to all repurchase agreements of which Seller or any of the
Subsidiaries is a party, Seller or such Subsidiary, as the case may be, has a
valid, perfected first lien or security interest in or evidence of ownership
in book entry form of the government securities or other collateral securing
each such repurchase agreement, and the value of such collateral equals or
exceeds the amount of the debt secured thereby under such agreement.

Seller Insurance Company being commercially domiciled in any state.

  

  

(c) (i) All policy forms issued by the Seller Insurance Companies, and all
policies, binders, slips, certificates and participation agreements and other
agreements of insurance, whether individual or group, in effect as of the date

applications, brochures, illustrations and certificates pertaining thereto,
and any and all marketing materials, are, to the extent required under
applicable Law, on forms approved by applicable insurance regulatory
authorities or which have, where required by applicable Law, been approved by
any applicable state insurance department or other Governmental Entities or
filed with and not objected to (or such objection has been withdrawn or

comply in all material respects with, and have been administered in all
material respects in accordance with, applicable Law, and (ii) all premium
rates established by the Seller Insurance Companies that are required to be

premium rating plans and underwriting methodologies so filed or approved and
comply (or complied at the relevant time) in all material respects with all
applicable anti-discrimination laws, federal or state, and all applicable
insurance Laws.

  

  

(d) Without limiting the generality of Section 3.11, each Seller Insurance
Company is, where required, (i) duly licensed or authorized as an insurance
company or reinsurer in the Domiciliary Jurisdiction, and (ii) except as would
not reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have a Seller
Material Adverse Effect, duly licensed or authorized as an insurance company
and, where applicable, a reinsurer, in each other jurisdiction where it is
required to be so licensed or authorized. Each Seller Insurance Company and
its affiliates have made all required notices, submissions, reports or other
filings under applicable insurance holding company statutes, and all
contracts, agreements, arrangements and transactions in effect between such
Seller Insurance Company and any affiliate are in material compliance with the
requirements of all applicable insurance holding company statutes. Each Seller
Insurance Company has marketed, administered, sold and issued insurance
products in compliance with all applicable Laws in all material respects,

relating to the disclosure of the nature of insurance products and policies,
(iii) all applicable requirements relating to insurance product projections
and illustrations, (iv) suitability requirements and (v) all applicable
requirements relating to the advertising, sales and marketing of insurance
products (including licensing and appointments). No proceeding or customer
complaint has been filed with the insurance regulatory authorities which could
reasonably be expected to lead to the revocation, failure to renew,
limitation, suspension or restriction of any such license or authorization.

  

  

(e) Neither Seller Insurance Company nor any of their affiliates have engaged
in, or colluded with or assisted any other persons with, the paying of
contingent commissions to steer business to them or colluded with brokers or
agents to "rig bids" or submit false quotes to customers.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

29  

  

 

 

 

  

(f) There are no unpaid claims and assessments against the Seller Insurance
Companies, whether or not due, by any state insurance guaranty association (in
connection with that association's fund relating to insolvent insurers), joint
underwriting association, residual market facility or assigned risk pool. No
such claim or assessment is pending, the Seller Insurance Companies have not
received notice of any such claim or assessment, and, to the Knowledge of
Seller, there is no basis for the assertion of any such claim or assessment
against the Seller Insurance Companies by any state insurance guaranty
association, joint underwriting association, residual market facility or
assigned risk pool.

  

  

(g) Seller has provided Acquiror with a list of any investment assets (whether
or not required by GAAP or SAP to be reflected on a balance sheet), including,
without limitation, bonds, notes, debentures, mortgage loans, real estate,
collateral loans, derivatives and all other instruments of indebtedness,
stocks, partnership or joint venture interests and all other equity interests,
certificates issued by or interests in trusts, derivatives and all other
assets acquired for investment purposes that are beneficially owned by the
Seller Insurance Companies as of December 31, 2012 (such investment assets,
together with all investment assets acquired by the Seller Insurance Companies
between December 31, 2012 and the Closing Date are referred to herein as the
"Investment Assets") . Each Seller Insurance Company has good and marketable
title to all of the Investment Assets it purports to own, free and clear of
all encumbrances. None of the Investment Assets is in default in the payment
of principal or interest or dividends and, to the Knowledge of Seller, there
has occurred no event which (whether with notice or lapse of time or both)
will result in a default under, or cause the permanent impairment of, any of
the Investment Assets. All of the Investment Assets comply with, and the
acquisition thereof complied with, any and all investment restrictions under
applicable Law in all material respects.

  

  

(h)(i) Seller has provided Acquiror a complete and correct list of all
reinsurance, coinsurance or retrocession treaties, agreements, slips, binders,
cover notes or other arrangements of any kind (each, a "Reinsurance
Agreement") in effect as of the date of this Agreement to which each Seller
Insurance Company is a party as a cedent and any terminated or expired treaty
or agreement under which there remains any outstanding liability.

  

  

    

  |  

(ii)

  |  

Each Reinsurance Agreement is a valid and legally binding agreement of the
applicable Seller Insurance Company, and, to the Knowledge of Seller, the
counterparty or counterparties thereto, is enforceable in accordance with its
terms (except as such enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws affecting
creditors' rights generally, and except that the availability of equitable
remedies (including, without limitation, specific performance and injunctive
relief) is within the discretion of the court before which any proceeding may
be brought) and is in full force and effect. The applicable Seller Insurance
Company has duly performed all material obligations required to be performed
by it prior to the date hereof under each such Reinsurance Agreement. Neither
Seller Insurance Company nor, to the Knowledge of Seller, any counterparty or
counterparties, is in breach of any provision of any such Reinsurance
Agreement. No event or condition exists that constitutes, after notice or
lapse of time or both, will constitute, a breach, violation or default on the
part of a Seller Insurance Company under any such Reinsurance Agreement or
provide any party thereto with the right to terminate such contract. Since
December 31, 2011, (A) the Seller Insurance Companies have not received any
notice from any applicable reinsurer that any amount of reinsurance ceded by a
Seller Insurance Company will be uncollectible or otherwise defaulted upon,

impaired to the extent that a default thereunder is reasonably anticipated,
(D) no notice of intended cancellation has been received by the Seller
Insurance Companies from any such reinsurer, (E) there are no disputes under
any Reinsurance Agreement and (F) each Seller Insurance Company is entitled
under the law of the Domiciliary Jurisdiction to take full credit in its
Statutory Statements for all amounts recoverable by it pursuant to any
Reinsurance Agreement, and all such amounts recoverable have been properly
recorded in its books and records of account and are properly reflected in its
Statutory Statements. No such Reinsurance Agreement contains any provision
providing that any such party thereto (other than a Seller Insurance Company)
may terminate, cancel, or commute the same by reason of the consummation of
the Merger.

the assuming reinsurer that would under any circumstances reduce, limit,
mitigate or otherwise affect any actual or potential loss to the parties under
any such Reinsurance Agreement, other than inuring contracts that are

items which ought to be established in accordance with applicable Law and
regulations and in accordance with prudent insurance practices generally
followed in the insurance industry. To the Knowledge of Seller, no facts or
circumstances exist which would necessitate any adverse change in the
statutorily required reserves or reserves above those reflected in the most
recent balance sheet. Complete and correct copies of all reports and opinions
of independent actuaries relating to the reserves of Seller as of any date
since December 31, 2011, including all attachments, addenda, supplements and

which they arose and such payments, credits or provisions were not delinquent
and were paid or credited (or will be paid or credited) without fines or
penalties.

consolidated financial statements referred to in the first sentence of Section
4.4(a) or the notes thereto or immaterial liabilities incurred since September
30, 2012 in the ordinary course of business and consistent with past practice
(none of which arises from breach of any contract or agreement, breach of
warranty, tort, infringement, violation of any applicable Law or any
litigation or other proceeding or is otherwise a "loss contingency" within the
meaning of Accounting Standards Codification Topic 450, Contingencies),
neither Acquiror nor Acquiror Sub has any obligation or liability, whether
absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise, material to the business, results
of operations, assets or financial condition of Acquiror and Acquiror Sub,
taken individually or as a whole.

nor, to the Knowledge of Acquiror, any director, officer, employee, auditor,
accountant or representative of it or any of its subsidiaries has received or
otherwise had or obtained knowledge of any material complaint, allegation,
assertion or claim, whether written or oral, regarding the accounting or
auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or methods of Acquiror or any of
its subsidiaries or their respective internal accounting controls, including
any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim that Acquiror or any of
its subsidiaries has engaged in questionable accounting or auditing practices,

35  

  

 

 

 

  

4.6 Legal Proceedings. Except as set forth in Acquiror Disclosure Schedule
4.6, none of Acquiror or Acquiror Sub is a party to any, and there are no
pending or, to the Knowledge of Acquiror, threatened, legal, administrative,
arbitration or other proceedings, claims, actions or governmental

routine litigation arising in the ordinary course of business which could not
reasonably be expected to adversely affect the business, results of
operations, prospects, assets or financial condition of Acquiror and Acquiror
Sub taken individually or as a whole. Neither Acquiror nor Acquiror Sub is a
party to any judgment, order, writ, decree or injunction which adversely
affects the business, results of operations, prospects, assets or financial
conditions of Acquiror and Acquiror Sub taken individually or as a whole.

  

  

4.7 Taxes and Tax Returns. Except, as to each statement below, where the
inaccuracy of such statement would not result in an Acquiror Material Adverse
Effect:

  

  

(a) Each of Acquiror and its subsidiaries has duly filed (and until the
Effective Time will so file) all Returns required to be filed or sent by or
with respect to them in respect of any Taxes and has duly paid (and until the
Effective Time will so pay) all Taxes due and payable other than Taxes or
other charges which (i) are being contested in good faith and (ii) have not
finally been determined. Acquiror and Acquiror Sub have established (and until
the Effective Time will establish) on their books and records reserves that
are adequate for the payment of all Taxes not yet due and payable, whether or
not disputed or accrued, as applicable. Except as set forth in Acquiror
Disclosure Schedule 4.7, (i) the federal income tax returns of Acquiror and
Acquiror Sub have not been examined by the IRS (or are closed to examination
due to the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations), and (ii) the
Mississippi franchise tax returns of Acquiror and Acquiror Sub, as applicable,
respectively, have not been examined by applicable authorities (or are closed
to examination due to the expiration of the statute of limitations), and in
the case of both (i) and (ii) no deficiencies were asserted as a result of
such examinations which have not been resolved and paid in full. All Returns
filed (and until the Effective Time to be filed) are or will be, as
applicable, complete and accurate in all respects. There are no audits or
other administrative or court proceedings presently pending nor any other
disputes pending, or claims asserted in writing for, Taxes or assessments upon
Acquiror or Acquiror Sub, and no taxing authority has given written notice of
the commencement of any audit, examination or deficiency action or made a
claim in writing that Acquiror or Acquiror Sub is required to file a Return in
such taxing authority's jurisdiction. There is no currently outstanding
waiver, extension or comparable consents regarding the application of the
statute of limitations with respect to any Taxes or Returns with respect to
Acquiror or Acquiror Sub.

  

  

(b) No liens for Taxes exist with respect to any of the assets or properties
of Acquiror or any of its subsidiaries, except for liens for Taxes not yet due

4.8 Securities Documents and Regulatory Reports.

  

  

(a) Since January 1, 2009, Acquiror has filed or furnished on a timely basis
with the Commission all final registration statements, prospectuses, annual,
quarterly or current reports and definitive proxy statements or other
communications (other than general advertising materials), forms, reports,
schedules, statements or other documents required to be filed or furnished by
it pursuant to the 1933 Act, the 1934 Act, or the rules and regulations
promulgated by the Commission (all such filed or furnished documents, together
with all exhibits and schedules thereto and all information incorporated
therein by reference, the "Acquiror SEC Documents"). Acquiror has previously
delivered or made available to Seller an accurate and complete copy of such
Acquiror SEC Documents. As of their respective filing dates (and, in the case
of registration statements and proxy statements, as of the dates of their
effectiveness and the dates of mailing, respectively), except to the extent
that any Acquiror SEC Document has been amended by a subsequently filed
Acquiror SEC Document prior to the date hereof, in which case, as of the date
of such amendment, each such final registration statement, prospectus, annual,
quarterly or current report and proxy statement or other communication, form,
report, schedule, statement or other document, as of its date, complied in all
material respects with all applicable Laws (including, without limitation, the
1933 Act, the 1934 Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended) and did
not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading; provided, that information as of a later date filed
publicly prior to the date hereof shall be deemed to modify information as of
an earlier date. To the Knowledge of Acquiror, there is no fact or
circumstance that, individually or in the aggregate, materially and adversely
has affected, is so affecting or could reasonably be expected in the future to
so affect, the business, financial condition, results of operations or
prospects of Acquiror and Acquiror Sub, taken individually or as a whole, that
is required to be disclosed under the 1933 Act or the 1934 Act but has not
been disclosed in such final registration statement, prospectus, annual,
quarterly or current reports and definitive proxy statement or other
communications, forms, reports, schedules, statements or other documents. None
of Acquiror's subsidiaries is required to file periodic reports with the
Commission.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

36  

  

 

 

 

  

(b) Since January 1, 2009, Acquiror and Acquiror Sub have duly filed all
monthly, quarterly and annual reports, forms, correspondence, registrations
and statements, together with any amendments required to be made with respect
thereto, that they were required to file with the MCB, the FDIC, the FRB and
any other federal or state Governmental Entity having jurisdiction over
Acquiror and/or Acquiror Sub, and have paid all fees and assessments due and
payable in connection therewith. To the extent not prohibited by Law, Acquiror
has delivered or made available to Seller accurate and complete copies of such
reports, forms, correspondence, registrations and statements.

  

  

4.9 Acquiror Information. None of the information relating to Acquiror and
Acquiror Sub to be provided by Acquiror or Acquiror Sub for use in the
Registration Statement will, as of the date such Registration Statement is
mailed to the stockholders of Seller and at the time of the Special Meeting,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading (except that this representation
shall not apply to any information in the Registration Statement supplied by
Seller for use therein), provided that information as of a later date shall be
deemed to modify information as of an earlier date.

  

  

4.10 Compliance with Applicable Law.

  

  

(a) Each of Acquiror and Acquiror Sub has all permits, licenses, certificates
of authority, orders and approvals of, and has made all filings, applications
and registrations with Governmental Entities that are required in order to
permit it to carry on its business as it is presently being conducted; all
such permits, licenses, certificates of authority, orders and approvals are in
full force and effect; and to the Knowledge of Acquiror, no suspension or
cancellation of any of the same is threatened.

  

  

(b) Neither Acquiror nor Acquiror Sub is (i) in material violation of (A) its
respective articles of incorporation or bylaws (or comparable organizational
documents) or other governing instrument or (B) any Law of any Governmental
Entity or (ii) in default with respect to any judgment, order, writ, decree or
injunction of any court or other Governmental Entity. Neither Acquiror nor
Acquiror Sub has received any written notice from any Governmental Entity
asserting that Acquiror or Acquiror Sub is in violation of any of the
foregoing. Neither Acquiror nor Acquiror Sub is subject to any regulatory or
supervisory cease and desist order, agreement, written directive, memorandum
of understanding or written commitment (other than those of general
applicability to all banks issued by Governmental Entities), and neither of
them has received any written communication requesting that it enter into any
of the foregoing.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

37  

  

 

 

 

  

4.11 Deposit Insurance and Other Regulatory Matters. The deposit accounts of
Acquiror Sub are insured by the FDIC to the maximum extent permitted by the
FDIA, and Acquiror Sub has paid all premiums and assessments required by the
FDIA and the regulations thereunder. No action, suit or proceeding is pending
or, to the Knowledge of Acquiror, has been threatened by the FDIC against
Acquiror or Acquiror Sub with respect to the termination of such insurance.

  

  

4.12 Properties and Insurance. Except, as to each statement below, where the
inaccuracy of such statement would not result in an Acquiror Material Adverse
Effect:

  

  

(a) All real property and material items of personal property owned by
Acquiror or any of its subsidiaries or presently used by any of them in their
respective business is in good condition (ordinary wear and tear excepted) and
is sufficient to carry on the business of Acquiror and Acquiror Sub in the
ordinary course consistent with past practices. Acquiror and each of its
subsidiaries have good and, as to owned real property, marketable title to all
material assets and properties, whether real or personal, tangible or
intangible, reflected in Acquiror's consolidated unaudited balance sheet as of
September 30, 2012 or owned and acquired subsequent thereto (except to the
extent that such assets and properties have been disposed of for fair value in
the ordinary course of business since September 30, 2012), subject to no
encumbrances, liens, mortgages, security interests or pledges, except (i)
those items that secure liabilities that are reflected in said consolidated
balance sheet or the notes thereto or have been incurred in the ordinary
course of business after the date of such consolidated balance sheet; (ii)
statutory liens for amounts not yet delinquent or which are being contested in
good faith; (iii) such encumbrances, liens, mortgages, security interests,
pledges and title imperfections that are not in the aggregate material to the
business, results of operations, assets or financial condition of Acquiror and
Acquiror Sub, taken individually or as a whole; and (iv) with respect to owned
real property, (x) easements, rights-of-way, covenants, consents,
restrictions, encroachments, variations and other restrictions, charges or
encumbrances (whether recorded or not) that do not interfere materially with
the ordinary course of Acquiror's business or the business of any its
subsidiaries, (y) building restrictions, zoning laws and other Laws, now or at
any time hereafter adopted by any Governmental Entity having jurisdiction that
do not materially interfere with the ordinary course of Acquiror's or Acquiror
Sub's business, or (z) title imperfections noted in title reports delivered to
Acquiror prior to the date hereof. Acquiror and each of its subsidiaries as
lessees have the right under valid and subsisting leases to occupy, use,
possess and control all property leased by them in all respects as presently
occupied, used, possessed and controlled by Acquiror and its subsidiaries.
Neither Acquiror nor any of its subsidiaries has any legal obligation,
absolute or contingent, to any other person to sell or otherwise dispose of
any substantial part of its assets or to sell or dispose of any of its assets
except in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practices.

  

  

(b) The business operations and all insurable properties and assets of
Acquiror and its subsidiaries are insured for their benefit against all risks
(including flood) which, to the Knowledge of Acquiror, should be insured
against, in each case, under valid, binding and enforceable policies or bonds
issued by insurers of recognized responsibility, in such amounts with such
deductibles and against such risks and losses as are, to the Knowledge of
Acquiror, adequate for the business engaged in by Acquiror and its
subsidiaries. As of the date hereof, neither Acquiror nor any of its
subsidiaries has received any written notice of cancellation or written notice
of a material amendment of any such insurance policy or bond or is in default
under such policy or bond, no coverage thereunder is being disputed, and all
material claims thereunder have been or will be filed in a timely fashion.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

38  

  

 

 

 

  

4.13 Allowance for Loan Losses and Real Estate Owned. The allowance for loan
losses reflected on Acquiror's consolidated balance sheets included in the
consolidated financial statements referred to in Section 4.4 hereof was, at
the time recorded, or will be in the case of subsequently delivered financial
statements, as the case may be, adequate in all material respects as of their
respective dates under the requirements of GAAP to provide for reasonably
anticipated losses on outstanding loans net of recoveries. The real estate
owned reflected on the consolidated balance sheets included in the
consolidated financial statements referred to in Section 4.4 hereof was, at
the time recorded, or will be in the case of subsequently delivered financial
statements, as the case may be, carried at the lower of cost or fair value, or
the lower of cost or net realizable value, as required by GAAP.

  

  

4.14 Broker Fees. Except as set forth in Acquiror Disclosure Schedule 4.14,
neither Acquiror nor Acquiror Sub nor any of their respective directors or
officers has employed any consultant, broker or finder or incurred any
liability for any consultant's, broker's or finder's fees or commissions in
connection with any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

  

4.15 Loans. To the Knowledge of Acquiror, and to the extent a failure to
comply could not, alone or with any other failure, have an Acquiror Material
Adverse Effect, all of the loans and other evidences of indebtedness
(including commitments to extend credit) on the books of Acquiror and Acquiror
Sub in the original principal amount of $5,000,000 and above are valid and
properly documented in all material respects and were solicited and originated
in the ordinary course of business, and the security therefor, if any, is
valid and properly perfected in all respects, and no collateral has been
released from the lien granted to Acquiror and Acquiror Sub with respect to
any such loans unless approved by Acquiror and Acquiror Sub and documented in
their files. To the Knowledge of Acquiror, and to the extent a failure to
comply could not, alone or with any other failure, have an Acquiror Material
Adverse Effect, all loans and extensions of credit that have been made by
Acquiror Sub that are subject to Section 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act, as
amended, and Regulation O (12 C.F.R. Part 215) promulgated thereunder comply
therewith. Neither the terms of such loans nor any of the loan documentation
nor the manner in which such loans have been originated, administered and
serviced nor Acquiror's procedures and practices of approving or rejecting
loan applications, to the Knowledge of Acquiror, and to the extent a violation
could not, alone or with any other violation, have an Acquiror Material
Adverse Effect, violates in any material respect any Law applicable thereto.
Acquiror and Acquiror Sub have full power and authority to hold such loans and
have good and valid title to all such loans, free and clear of any liens, and
the principal balance of each such loan as shown on the books and records of
Acquiror and Acquiror Sub is true and correct as of the last date shown
thereon. To the Knowledge of Acquiror, and to the extent a failure to comply
could not, alone or with any other failure, have an Acquiror Material Adverse
Effect, Acquiror and Acquiror Sub have complied in all material respects with
all of their obligations under such loans as to which compliance is required
as of the Effective Time, and each such loan is enforceable against the
obligor(s) thereunder in accordance with its terms, in each such case subject
to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other
similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally (or the enforcement of the
rights of creditors of FDIC-insured institutions in particular), and except
that the availability of equitable remedies (including specific performance
and injunctive relief) is within the discretion of the court before which any
proceeding may be brought. All such loans will continue in full force and
effect immediately after the Effective Time, other than any loans that are
paid or otherwise satisfied in full after the date hereof and prior to the
Effective Time. For purposes of this Section 4.15, the term "loans" includes,
without limitation, the documents relating in any way to such loans,
including, without limitation, loan applications, notes, security agreements,
deeds of trust, appraisals, credit reports, disclosures, titles to collateral,
verifications (including employment verification, deposit verification, etc.),
mortgages, loan agreements, including building and loan agreements,
guarantees, pledge agreements, financing statements, intercreditor agreements,
participation agreements, sureties and insurance policies (including title
insurance policies) and all modifications, waivers and consents relating to
any of the foregoing.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

39  

  

 

 

 

  

4.16 Investment Securities. Except for securities pledged for reverse
repurchase agreements, interest rate swap, cap and floor contracts or pledged
to secure public trust funds, none of the investments reflected in the audited
consolidated balance sheet of Acquiror as of December 31, 2011 under the
heading "Securities available for sale," and none of the investments by
Acquiror and its subsidiaries since December 31, 2011, and none of the assets
reflected in the audited consolidated balance sheet of Acquiror as of December
31, 2011 or in any unaudited consolidated balance sheet of Acquiror furnished
to Seller after December 31, 2011 under the heading "Cash and due from banks"
is subject to any restriction, whether contractual or statutory, that impairs
the ability of Acquiror or any of its subsidiaries freely to dispose of such
investment at any time, except to the extent for any impairment that could
not, alone or with any other such impairment, have an Acquiror Material
Adverse Effect. With respect to all repurchase agreements of which Acquiror or
any of its subsidiaries is a party, Acquiror or such subsidiary, as the case
may be, has a valid, perfected first lien or security interest in or evidence
of ownership in book entry form of the government securities or other
collateral securing each such repurchase agreement, and the value of such
collateral equals or exceeds the amount of the debt secured thereby under such
agreement.

  

  

4.17 Regulatory Matters. Neither Acquiror nor Acquiror Sub has taken or agreed
to take any action which would or could reasonably be expected to materially
impede or delay receipt of any consents of regulatory authorities referred to
in Section 5.7 or result in failure of the condition in Section 7.1(c).

  

  

4.18 Regulatory Capital; Acquiror Shares. Acquiror Sub is, and on the Closing
Date, Acquiror Sub will be, "well capitalized" as such term is defined in the
rules and regulations promulgated by the FDIC, and on the date hereof,
Acquiror is, and on the Closing Date, Acquiror will be, "well capitalized" as
such term is defined in the rules and regulations promulgated by the FRB. The
shares of Acquiror Capital Stock to be issued to pay the aggregate Merger
Consideration pursuant to this Agreement (i) will have been duly authorized,
and (ii) when issued in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, will be
(A) validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable, (B) free and clear of all
liens, encumbrances, charges, restrictions or rights of third parties of any
kind whatsoever, excluding restrictions under the 1933 Act, (C) issued in
material compliance with all applicable securities Laws, and (D) in addition,
such issuances shall not be subject to any preemptive right of stockholders of
Acquiror or to any right of stockholders of Acquiror or to any right of first
refusal or other right in favor of any person which has not been observed or
waived.

  

  

4.19 Material Contracts. Neither the Acquiror nor Acquiror Sub is in default
under any contract filed as an exhibit to its Annual Report on Form 10-K for
the year ended December 31, 2011, or its Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for
the fiscal quarters ended March 31, June 30, or September 30, 2012, other than
defaults which are not reasonably likely to have, individually or in the
aggregate, an Acquiror Material Adverse Effect.

  

  

4.20 NASDAQ. Acquiror is in compliance in all material respects with the
rules, regulations and policies of NASDAQ applicable to Acquiror.

  

  

4.21 Full Disclosure. No representation or warranty of Acquiror or Acquiror
Sub contained in this Agreement, the Acquiror Disclosure Schedule or in any
agreement, document or certificate delivered by Acquiror to Seller pursuant to
this Agreement (i) contains or at the Closing will contain any untrue
statement or a material fact or (ii) omits or at the Closing will omit to
state a material fact necessary to make the statements herein or therein, as
applicable, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were or
will be made, not misleading.

---|--- 
 

  

  

5.3 No Solicitation.

  

  

(a) Neither Seller nor Seller Sub shall, nor shall Seller or Seller Sub
authorize or permit any other Subsidiary or any of their respective directors,
managers, trustees, officers or employees or any investment banker, financial
advisor, attorney, accountant or other representative of Seller or Seller Sub
to, directly or indirectly, solicit or hold discussions or negotiations with,
or provide any information to, any person, entity or group (other than
Acquiror or Acquiror Sub) concerning any Acquisition Transaction (as defined
below); provided, however, that nothing contained in this Agreement shall
prevent Seller (on behalf of itself and Seller Sub) or the board of directors
of Seller prior to receipt of approval by the stockholders of Seller of this
Agreement and the Parent Merger Document from (i) providing information in
response to a request therefor by a person who has made an unsolicited bona
fide written proposal to engage in an Acquisition Transaction (an "Acquisition
Proposal") if the board of directors of Seller receives from the person so
requesting such information an executed confidentiality agreement on customary
terms and conditions; (ii) engaging in any negotiations or discussions with
any person who has made an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal;
(iii) failing to recommend or withdrawing its recommendation of this Agreement
to its stockholders and/or failing to hold the Special Meeting (as defined in
Section 5.8) to consider this Agreement; or (iv) recommending such an
Acquisition Proposal to the stockholders of Seller, if and only to the extent
that, in each such case referred to in clause (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) above,
(A) Seller's board of directors determines in good faith (after consultation
with outside legal counsel) that such action would be required in order for
its directors to comply with their respective fiduciary duties under
applicable Law and (B) Seller's board of directors determines in good faith
(after consultation with its financial advisor) that such Acquisition
Proposal, if accepted, is reasonably likely to be consummated, taking into
account all legal, financial and regulatory aspects of the proposal and the
person making the proposal and would, if consummated, result in a transaction
more favorable to Seller's stockholders from a financial point of view than
the Mergers. An Acquisition Proposal which is received and considered by
Seller in compliance with this Section 5.3 and which meets the requirements
set forth in clauses (A) and (B) of the preceding sentence is herein referred
to as a "Superior Proposal". Seller will communicate to Acquiror in writing
(the "Notice") as promptly as practicable (and in no event more than 48 hours
after receipt) the terms of any proposal which it may receive in respect of
any Acquisition Transaction (including amendments thereto) and shall provide
Acquiror with copies of (x) all such written inquiries or proposals and (y) an
accurate and complete written synopsis of all such oral inquiries or
proposals. For purposes of this Agreement, "Acquisition Transaction" means any
offer or proposal by a person or entity other than Acquiror or Acquiror Sub
for (i) a merger, tender offer, recapitalization or consolidation, or any
similar transaction, involving the Seller or Seller Sub; (ii) a purchase,
lease or other acquisition or assumption of all or a substantial portion of
the assets of the Seller or Seller Sub; (iii) a purchase or other acquisition
(including by way of merger, consolidation, share exchange or otherwise) of
beneficial ownership (the term "beneficial ownership" for purposes of this
Agreement having the meaning assigned thereto in Section 13(d) of the 1934
Act, and the rules and regulations thereunder) of securities representing 20%
or more of the voting power of the Seller; or (iv) any substantially similar
transaction.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

45  

  

 

 

 

  

(b) During the 10 days immediately following the Acquiror's receipt of the
Notice, Acquiror (on behalf of itself and Acquiror Sub) shall be entitled to
match or better the terms of the Superior Proposal described in the Notice. If
Acquiror advises Seller in writing during such 10 day period that it has
elected to match or better the terms of the Superior Proposal, (i) Seller,
Seller Sub, Acquiror and Acquiror Sub within two days of such election by
Acquiror, shall amend this Agreement and the Merger Documents to reflect the
matched or bettered terms of the Superior Proposal as proposed by Acquiror and
(ii) Seller (on behalf of itself and Seller Sub) shall not terminate this
Agreement, and Seller promptly shall notify the person that made or conveyed
the Superior Proposal that Acquiror has matched or bettered the Superior
Proposal and this Agreement has been amended to reflect the matched or
bettered terms. From and after the date on which Acquiror and Acquiror Sub
execute an amendment which matches or betters the Superior Proposal, Seller
and Seller Sub shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated, and cause
its officers, directors, employees, investment bankers, financial advisors,
attorneys, accountants and other representatives to, immediately cease and
caused to be terminated, all discussions and negotiations regarding the
Superior Proposal that has been matched or bettered by Acquiror with any
person other than Acquiror. A person that has made a Superior Proposal that
has been matched or bettered by Acquiror may make further Acquisition
Proposals. During the period commencing on the date that Seller determines
that the Acquisition Proposal meets the requirements set forth in clauses (A)
and (B) above and ending on the eleventh day after Acquiror's receipt of the
Notice, Seller and Seller Sub shall not terminate this Agreement unless Seller
receives written notice from Acquiror that it does not intend to exercise its
right to match or better the Superior Proposal. If Acquiror does not notify
Seller of its election by the eleventh day after Acquiror's receipt of the
Notice, Seller may terminate this Agreement and proceed with the Superior
Proposal as provided in this Agreement.

  

  

(c) Except as expressly permitted by this Section 5.3 and Section 5.8, neither
the board of directors of Seller nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw,
modify or qualify, or propose publicly to withdraw, modify or qualify, in a
manner adverse to Acquiror, the approval of the Agreement and the Parent
Merger Document or the Seller Recommendation (as defined in Section 5.8) or
take any action or make any statement in connection with the Special Meeting
inconsistent with such approval or the Seller Recommendation (collectively, a
"Change in the Seller Recommendation"); (ii) approve or recommend, or propose
publicly to approve or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal; or (iii) cause
Seller to enter into any letter of intent, agreement in principle, acquisition
agreement or other similar agreement (each, a "Seller Acquisition Agreement")
related to any Acquisition Transaction. For purposes of this Agreement, a
Change in the Seller Recommendation shall include any approval or
recommendation (or public proposal to approve or recommend), by Seller's Board
of an Acquisition Proposal, or any failure by Seller's board of directors to
recommend against an Acquisition Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
board of directors of Seller, to the extent that it determines in good faith,
after consultation with outside counsel, that the failure to terminate this
Agreement in light of a Superior Proposal would constitute a breach of its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law, may terminate this Agreement in order
to concurrently enter into a Seller Acquisition Agreement with respect to such
Superior Proposal, but only at a time that is after the compliance by Seller
with the terms of Sections 5.3(a), 5.3(b) and 7.4.

  

  

(d) Upon the execution of this Agreement, Seller and Seller Sub shall
immediately cease and cause to be terminated, and cause its and the other
Subsidiaries' officers, directors and employees, investment bankers, financial
advisors, attorneys, accountants and other representatives to immediately
cease and cause to be terminated, all discussions and negotiations, if any,
that have taken place prior to the date hereof with any persons with respect
to any Acquisition Proposal and, upon request by Acquiror, shall request the
return and destruction of all confidential information provided to any such
person.

  

  

5.4 Negative Covenants of Acquiror. Except as expressly provided in this
Agreement, or as set forth in Acquiror Disclosure Schedule 5.4, during the
period from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time, each of
Acquiror, Acquiror Sub and their respective board of directors shall not (i)
other than in connection with this Agreement, and except as would not have a
material adverse effect on the ability of Acquiror and Acquiror Sub to perform
their obligations hereunder, fail to conduct its business in the ordinary and
usual course consistent with past practices and prudent banking practice, or
fail to maintain and preserve intact its business organization, properties,
leases, employees and advantageous business relationships and retain the
services of its officers and key employees; (ii) knowingly take any action or
knowingly fail to take any action which would be reasonably expected to
adversely affect or delay the ability of Acquiror or Acquiror Sub to perform
their respective covenants and agreements on a timely basis under this
Agreement or to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
(iii) knowingly take any action or knowingly fail to take any action that
would reasonably be expected to result in any of its representations and
warranties contained in Article IV of this Agreement not being true and
correct in any material respect at the Effective Time; (iv) knowingly take any
action which would be reasonably expected to adversely affect or delay the
ability of the Acquiror or Acquiror Sub to obtain any necessary approvals,
consents or waivers of any Governmental Entity required for the transactions
contemplated hereby or which would reasonably be expected to result in any
such approvals, consents or waivers containing any condition or restriction
that would materially impair the value of the transaction to Acquiror; (v)
agree to, or make any commitment to, take, or adopt any resolutions of board
of directors of Acquiror or Acquiror Sub in support of, any of the actions
prohibited by this Section 5.4; or (vi) except as expressly permitted by
Section 5.8, withdraw, modify or qualify, or propose publicly to withdraw,
modify or qualify, in a manner adverse to Seller, the approval of the
Agreement and the Parent Merger Document or the Acquiror Recommendation (as
defined in Section 5.8) or take any action or make any statement in connection
with a Special Meeting of Acquiror, inconsistent with such approval or the
Acquiror Recommendation (collectively, a "Change in the Acquiror
Recommendation").

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

46  

  

 

 

 

  

5.5 Current Information. During the period from the date hereof to the
Effective Time, the parties will cause one or more of each of their designated
representatives to confer on a monthly or more frequent basis with
representatives of the other party regarding each of their businesses, results
of operations, prospects, assets and financial condition and matters relating
to the completion of the transactions contemplated hereby. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, (i) in such conferences, the designated
representative(s) of Seller and Seller Sub shall provide updates with respect
to loan charge-offs and sales of other real estate owned since the last
conference, (ii) within 10 days after the end of each calendar month, Seller
shall provide Acquiror with (A) an unaudited consolidated balance sheet as of
the end of such month, together with unaudited consolidated statements of
income for the month and year-to-date period, and (B) a schedule of loans
charged-off during such month and other real estate owned sold during such
month, and (iii) within 10 days after the end of each calendar quarter, Seller
shall provide Acquiror with unaudited consolidated statements of changes in
stockholders' equity and cash flows for the quarter and year-to-date period.
Within 30 days after the end of each fiscal quarter, Seller shall provide
Acquiror with a copy of the FDIC Call Report filed with the FDIC.

  


 

  

5.6 Access to Properties and Records; Confidentiality.

  

  

(a) Each of the parties shall permit the other party and its representatives
reasonable access to their properties and shall disclose and make available to
such party all books, papers and records relating to the assets, properties,
operations, obligations and liabilities of such party, including, but not
limited to, all books of account (including the general ledger), tax records,
minute books of directors' and stockholders' meetings, organizational
documents, bylaws, material contracts and agreements, filings with any
regulatory authority, litigation files, plans affecting employees, and any
other business activities in which Acquiror may have an interest. No party
shall be required to provide access to or to disclose information where such
access or disclosure would violate or prejudice the rights of any customer or
would contravene any Law, order or judgment. The parties will use their best
efforts to obtain waivers of any such restriction and in any event make
appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which
the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply. The parties shall make their
respective executive officers available to confer with the other party's
representatives, provided that such access shall be reasonably related to the
transactions contemplated hereby and not unduly interfere with normal
operations.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

47  

  

 

 

 

  

(b) All information furnished previously by Acquiror, Acquiror Sub, Seller or
any of the Subsidiaries, or hereafter furnished prior to the Effective Time,
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or pursuant
hereto shall be treated as the sole property of the party furnishing the
information until consummation of the Mergers and, if such Mergers shall not
occur, the party receiving the information shall, at the request of the party
which furnished such information, either return to the party which furnished
such information or destroy all documents or other materials containing,
reflecting or referring to such information; shall use its best efforts to
keep confidential all such information; shall use such information only for
the purpose of consummating the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
and shall not directly or indirectly use such information for any competitive
or commercial purposes. The obligations of Acquiror, Acquiror Sub, Seller and
Seller Sub to keep such information confidential shall continue for three
years (except for any confidential customer information, which shall be kept
confidential indefinitely) from the date the proposed Mergers are abandoned
but shall not apply to (i) any information which (A) was already in the
possession of the party receiving the information prior to the disclosure
thereof to it by the party furnishing the information; (B) was then generally
known to the public; (C) became known to the public through no fault of the
party receiving the information; or (D) was disclosed to the party receiving
the information by a third-party not known by the receiving party to be bound
by an obligation of confidentiality; or (ii) disclosures pursuant to a legal
requirement or in accordance with an order of a court of competent
jurisdiction or any other Governmental Entity with authority to compel
disclosure.

  

  

(c) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, each party is
permitted to disclose the Tax treatment and structure of the transactions
contemplated hereby at any time on or after the earliest to occur of (i) the
date of public announcement of discussions relating to the transactions
contemplated hereby, (ii) the date of public announcement of the transactions
contemplated hereby and (iii) the date of execution of this Agreement (it
being understood by the parties that a "public announcement" shall mean a
public announcement permitted by this Agreement (or otherwise permitted by
agreement of the parties) as distinguished from a third-party announcement or
a leak). This Agreement shall not be construed to limit in any way either
party's ability to consult any advisor regarding the Tax treatment or
structure of the Mergers. These provisions are meant to be interpreted so as
to prevent the Mergers from being treated as offered under "conditions of
confidentiality" within the meaning of the Code and the Treasury Regulations
thereunder.

  

  

5.7 Regulatory Matters.

  

  

(a) Each of the parties hereto shall use their respective reasonable best
efforts to (i) take, or cause to be taken, and assist and cooperate with the
other party in taking, all actions necessary, proper or advisable to comply
promptly with all legal requirements with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby, including obtaining any third-party consent or waiver
that may be required to be obtained in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby, and, subject to the conditions set forth in Article VI,
to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby (including actions required
in order to effect the Subsidiary Merger simultaneously with the Effective
Time and to continue any contract or agreement of Seller or Seller Sub
following Closing or to avoid any penalty or other fee under such contracts
and agreements, in each case arising in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby) and (ii) subject to the conditions set forth in Article
VI, obtain (and assist and cooperate with the other party in obtaining) any
permit, consent, waiver, approval and authorization of, or any exemption by,
any Governmental Entity that is required or advisable in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Mergers. The
parties hereto shall cooperate with each other and prepare and file, as
promptly as possible after the date hereof, all necessary documentation, and
effect all applications, notices, petitions and filings, to obtain as promptly
as practicable all permits, consents, waivers, approvals and authorizations of
all third parties and Governmental Entities that are necessary or advisable to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each of the
parties shall use their reasonable best efforts to resolve any objections that
may be asserted by any Governmental Entity with respect to this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything set
forth in this Agreement, under no circumstances shall a party be required, and
Seller and Seller Sub shall not be permitted (without Acquiror's written
consent in its sole discretion), to take any action, or commit to take any
action, or agree to any condition or restriction, in connection with obtaining
the foregoing permits, consents, waivers, approvals and authorizations, that
would have, or would be reasonably likely to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Seller Material Adverse Effect or an Acquiror Material Adverse
Effect, as the case may be (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any
determination by a Governmental Entity that the Subsidiary Merger may not be
consummated as contemplated herein, including simultaneously with the
Effective Time); provided, that, if requested by Acquiror, then Seller and
Seller Sub will take or commit to take any such action, or agree to any such
condition or restriction, so long as such action, commitment, agreement,
condition or restriction is binding on Seller and Seller Sub only in the event
the Closing occurs.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

48  

  

 

 

 

  

(b) Subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information,
Acquiror and Seller shall, upon request, furnish each other with all
information concerning Acquiror, Seller, Acquiror Sub and the Subsidiaries and
their respective directors, officers and stockholders and such other matters
as may be reasonably necessary in connection with any statement, filing,
notice or application made by or on behalf of Acquiror, Seller, Acquiror Sub
and Seller Sub to any Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. In exercising the foregoing right, each of the
parties hereto shall act reasonably and as promptly as practicable.

  

  

(c) Subject to applicable Laws (including those relating to the exchange of
information), Seller and Acquiror shall keep each other apprised of the status
of matters relating to the completion of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, subject to
applicable Laws, the parties shall (i) promptly furnish each other with copies
of notices or other communications received by the other party (or written
summaries of communications received orally), from any third party or
Governmental Entity with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (ii) provide the other party a reasonable opportunity to review in
advance, and accept the reasonable comments of the other party in connection
with, any proposed communication to, including any filings with or other
written materials submitted to, any Governmental Entity, and (iii) consider in
good faith the other party's views with respect to, and confer in good faith
with the other party to resolve, any disagreement as to strategy with respect
to any communication by the other party with any Governmental Entity or third
party relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The parties
shall not, and shall cause their respective subsidiaries to not, participate
in any meeting or substantive discussion, either in person or by telephone,
with any Governmental Entity in connection with the proposed transactions
unless it consults with the other party in advance and, to the extent not
prohibited by applicable Laws, gives the other party the opportunity to attend
and participate. Any such disclosures or rights to participate may be made on
an outside counsel-only basis to the extent required under applicable Laws.

  

  

5.8 Preparation of Registration Statement; Stockholder Approval.

  

  

(a) The parties hereto shall jointly prepare and file with the Commission as
promptly as practicable a proxy statement/prospectus to be mailed to the
stockholders of Seller who are to vote upon this Agreement and the Parent
Merger Document in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and to
be part of the Registration Statement to be filed by Acquiror with the
Commission pursuant to the 1933 Act with respect to the shares of Acquiror
Common Stock to be issued in connection with the Parent Merger. The parties
shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause the Registration Statement to
be declared effective by the SEC as promptly as practicable after its filing.
The proxy statement/prospectus, and any amendment thereto, shall include the
Seller Recommendation. The parties shall notify each other promptly of the
receipt of any comments from the Commission or its staff and of any request by
the Commission or its staff for amendments or supplements to the proxy
statement/prospectus or the Registration Statement or for additional
information and shall supply each other with copies of all correspondence
between such party or any of its representatives, on the one hand, and the
Commission or its staff, on the other hand, with respect thereto. If, at any
time prior to the Special Meeting, any event occurs with respect to any party
hereto, or any change occurs with respect to other information supplied by a
party for inclusion in the proxy statement/prospectus or the Registration
Statement, which is required to be described in an amendment of, or a
supplement to, the proxy statement/prospectus or the Registration Statement,
such party shall promptly notify the other party of such event, and cooperate
in the prompt filing with the Commission of any necessary amendment or
supplement thereto and, to the extent required by applicable Laws, in
disseminating the information contained in such amendment or supplement to the
stockholders of Seller. Acquiror will advise Seller promptly after it receives
notice thereof of the time when the Registration Statement has become
effective or any supplement or amendment thereto has been filed, of the
issuance of any stop order, of the suspension of the qualification of the
Acquiror Common Stock issuable in connection with the Merger for offering or
sale in any jurisdiction, of the initiation or threat of any proceeding for
any such purpose, or of any request by the Commission for the amendment or
supplement of the Registration Statement or for additional information. When
the Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment thereto shall
become effective, and at all times subsequent to such effectiveness, up to and
including the time of the last stockholder meeting with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby, such Registration Statement and all
amendments or supplements thereto, with respect to all information set forth
therein furnished or to be furnished by Acquiror and Acquiror Sub relating to
Acquiror and Acquiror Sub and by Seller and Seller Sub relating to Seller and
or any of the Subsidiaries, (i) will comply in all material respects with the
provisions of the 1933 Act and the rules and regulations of the Commission
thereunder and (ii) will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements contained therein not misleading.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

49  

  

 

 

 

  

(b) Each party shall, subject to the provisions of Section 5.3 (as it relates
to Seller) and this Section 5.8, (i) take all steps (including participation
in the preparation of the Registration Statement in accordance with all
applicable requirements and having the Registration Statement cleared by the
Commission and mailed to its stockholders) necessary to duly call, give notice
of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders (including any
adjournments, the "Special Meeting(s)") as soon as reasonably practicable for
the purposes of securing the approval of such stockholders of this Agreement
and the Parent Merger Document, (ii) recommend to its stockholders the
approval of this Agreement and the Parent Merger Document and the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby (as it relates to Seller, the "Seller
Recommendation" and, as it relates to Acquiror, the "Acquiror
Recommendation"), and (iii) use its best efforts to obtain, as promptly as
practicable, such approval; provided, however, that (i) the board of directors
of Seller may fail to hold such Special Meeting, fail to make such
recommendation, or withdraw, modify or change any such recommendation, if such
board of directors, after having consulted with and considered the advice of
outside counsel, has determined in good faith that the holding of such Special
Meeting, the making of such recommendation or the failure to withdraw, modify
or change such recommendation, either as a result of an Acquisition Proposal
that has not been withdrawn or otherwise, would constitute a breach of the
fiduciary duties of such directors under applicable Law; and (ii) the board of
directors of Acquiror may fail to hold such Special Meeting, fail to make such
recommendation, or withdraw, modify or change any such recommendation, if such
board of directors, after having consulted with and considered the advice of
outside counsel, has determined in good faith that the holding of such Special
Meeting, the making of such recommendation or the failure to withdraw, modify
or change such recommendation would for any reason constitute a breach of the
fiduciary duties of such directors under applicable Law. The parties will
reasonably cooperate in the preparation of the Registration Statement.
Promptly following approval of this Agreement and the Parent Merger Document
by the stockholders of Seller, Seller, as the sole stockholder of Seller Sub,
will approve and consent to this Agreement and the Subsidiary Merger Document
in such capacity, whether at a meeting or by written consent.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

50  

  

 

 

 

  

5.9 Further Assurances. Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided,
each of the parties hereto agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to take,
or cause to be taken, all reasonable action and to do, or cause to be done,
all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws to satisfy the
conditions to Closing contained herein and to consummate and make effective
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Merger Documents.

  

  

5.10 Disclosure Supplements. From time to time prior to the Effective Time,
each party will supplement or amend its respective Disclosure Schedules
delivered pursuant hereto with respect to any matter hereafter arising which,
if existing, occurring or known as of the date hereof, would have been
required to be set forth or described in such Schedules or which is necessary
to correct any information in such Schedules which has been rendered
inaccurate thereby; provided, however, that the inclusion of any information
in any such amendment or supplement not included in the original Disclosure
Schedules shall not limit or impair any right which a party may have to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(d) due to failure to satisfy
the conditions set forth in Section 6.2(a) or Section 6.3(a), as the case may
be.

  

  

5.11 Public Announcements. Prior to the Effective Time, the parties hereto
shall approve in advance the substance, and cooperate with each other in the
development and distribution, of all news releases and other public
disclosures with respect to this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby, except as may be otherwise required by Law and as to
which the parties releasing such information have used their reasonable
efforts to discuss with the other parties in advance.

  

  

5.12 Failure to Fulfill Conditions. In the event that either of the parties
hereto determines that a condition to its respective obligations to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby cannot be fulfilled on or prior to August
31, 2013 and that it will not waive that condition, it will promptly notify
the other party. Acquiror (on behalf of itself and Acquiror Sub) and Seller
(on behalf of itself and Seller Sub) will promptly inform the other of any
facts applicable to them, or their respective directors or officers, that
would be likely to prevent or materially delay unqualified approval of the
Mergers by any Governmental Entity or which would otherwise prevent or
materially delay completion of such Mergers or the other transactions
contemplated hereby.

  

  

5.13 Certain Post-Merger Agreements.

  

  

The parties hereto agree to the following arrangements following the Effective
Time:

  

  

(a) Employee Benefit Plans.

  

  

    

  |  

(i)

  |  

Subject to the provisions of this Section 5.13, all employees of Seller or any
of the Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time who become
employed by Acquiror, Acquiror Sub or any subsidiary or affiliate thereof (as
the case may be, "Employer") immediately following the Effective Time
("Transferred Employees") will be covered by the Employer employee benefit
plans on substantially the same basis as other employees of Employer
performing services primarily on behalf of Employer in a comparable position.
Following the Effective Time, Acquiror will provide continuation coverage
under Section 4980B of the Code and Section 601 of ERISA to all qualified
beneficiaries who were entitled to such coverage under Seller's or any
Subsidiary's group health plan immediately prior to the Effective Time.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Employer may determine to continue any of the
Seller Plans for Transferred Employees in lieu of offering participation in
the Employer benefit plans providing similar benefits (e.g., medical and
hospitalization benefits). Alternatively, after the Effective Time, Employer
may elect to terminate or amend any of the Seller Plans or to merge any such
benefit plans with the Employer benefit plans. Except as otherwise
specifically provided in this Section 5.13 and/or as otherwise prohibited by
Law, Transferred Employees' service with Seller or any of the Subsidiaries
shall be recognized as service with the Employer for purposes of eligibility
to participate and vesting under the Employer benefit plans, policies or
arrangements for which they may be eligible on or after the Effective Time
(including but not limited to, vacation, sick and other leave policies),
subject to applicable break-in-service rules, and provided that such service
shall not operate to duplicate any benefit. Acquiror and Acquiror Sub agree
that, to the extent waived, satisfied or inapplicable to any Transferred
Employee under the terms of any group health, group term life insurance or
long-term disability plan maintained by Seller or any of the Subsidiaries at
the Effective Time, any preexisting condition or similar limitation or
exclusion contained in an Employer's group health, long-term disability or
group term life insurance plans shall not apply to Transferred Employees or
their covered dependents who are covered under similar plans maintained by
Seller or any of the Subsidiaries at the Effective Time and who then change
coverage to the Employer's group health, group term life insurance or long-
term disability plan at the time such Transferred Employees are first given
the option to enroll. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, after
the Effective Time, nothing herein shall restrict the ability of the Employer
to amend or terminate such Seller Plans in accordance with their terms,
provided that such amendment or termination affects all covered employees
equally.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

51  

  

 

 

 

  

    

  |  

(ii)

  |  

As of the Effective Time, Acquiror shall assume and honor and shall cause the
appropriate Employer to assume and honor in accordance with their terms all
employment agreements existing immediately prior to the Effective Time which
are between Seller or any of the Subsidiaries and any officer which have been
disclosed in Seller Disclosure Schedule 3.13(a), in the form in effect as of
the date hereof.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

(iii)

  |  

Following the Effective Time, Acquiror and Acquiror Sub may determine to
continue, amend or terminate any deferred compensation plan, policy, program
or arrangement listed on Seller Disclosure Schedule 3.8(a); provided, that any
amendment, termination or continuance does not impair the benefits due
thereunder as of the date hereof and that any such amendment, termination or
continuance is permitted under such plans, policies, programs or arrangements
or otherwise required by applicable Law.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

(iv)

  |  

Prior to the Closing Date, Seller's board of directors shall adopt corporate
resolutions as may be necessary to (i) terminate any Qualified Seller Plan
identified by Acquiror, including any Seller Plan intended to comply with
Section 401(k) of the Code ("Seller Terminated Plans"), effective as of the
date preceding the date on which the Effective Time occurs; (ii) fully vest
the account balances of the participants and beneficiaries in Seller
Terminated Plans no later than the termination date; (iii) reserve the power
to amend Seller Terminated Plans after the date of termination to the extent
reasonably necessary to comply with applicable Law or to facilitate the
termination thereof; and (iv) provide for the distribution of benefits from
Seller Terminated Plans in accordance with their terms and as permitted under
applicable Law.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

52  

  

 

 

 

  

    

  |  

(v)

  |  

No provision in this Agreement shall amend or modify or be deemed to modify or
amend any Seller Plan or any similar plan, policy, arrangement or agreement
maintained by Acquiror. Nothing contained herein shall be deemed a guarantee
of employment for any Transferred Employee or to restrict the right of
Acquiror, Acquiror Sub or affiliate thereof to terminate the employment of any
Transferred Employee or a guarantee of any type or amount of compensation or
benefits.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

(b) Indemnification. Acquiror shall indemnify and hold harmless each present
and former director and officer of Seller (determined as of the Effective
Time) and any of the Subsidiaries (determined as of the effective time of the
Subsidiary Merger), all of whom are identified on Seller Disclosure Schedule
5.13(b), and their heirs, personal representatives and estates (collectively,
the "Indemnified Parties") against, and shall promptly upon request advance or
reimburse, any and all costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys'
fees), judgments, interest, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities or
amounts paid in settlement (collectively, "Costs") as they are incurred in
connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether
civil, criminal, administrative, arbitrative or investigative ("Proceeding"),
whether or not the Indemnified Party is a party to such Proceeding, based upon
or arising from the Indemnified Party's acts or omissions as an officer or
director of Seller and/or any of the Subsidiaries, whether threatened,
asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time (collectively,
"Claims"), to the same extent as the Indemnified Parties would have been
indemnified under the articles of incorporation and/or bylaws (or comparable
organizational document) of Acquiror as such documents were in effect on the
date of this Agreement as if the Indemnified Parties were officers or
directors of Acquiror at all relevant times, except to the extent any Claim
arises on account of an Indemnified Party's service as an officer or director
of another for-profit entity. This indemnity shall be provided for three years
following the Effective Time; or if there shall be any proceeding pending or
threatened on the third anniversary of the Effective Time, such indemnity
shall continue in full force and effect until such pending or threatened
Proceeding is finally resolved.

  

  

The rights to indemnification granted by this Section 5.13(b) are subject to
the following limitations: (i) the total aggregate indemnification provided by
Acquiror pursuant to this Section 5.13(b) shall not exceed, as to all
Indemnified Parties as a group, a sum equal to the Indemnification Cap, and
Acquiror shall have no responsibility to the Indemnified Parties for the
manner in which such sum is allocated among that group; (ii) a director or
officer who would otherwise be a member of the Indemnified Parties under this
Section 5.13(b) shall not be entitled to the benefits hereof unless such
director or officer has executed a Joinder Agreement in the form of Schedule
5.13(b) hereto; and (iii) amounts otherwise required to be paid by Acquiror to
the Indemnified Parties pursuant to this Section 5.13(b) shall be reduced by
any amounts that such Indemnified Parties recover from any third party. For
purposes of this Agreement, "Indemnification Cap" shall mean an amount equal
to the sum of (i) $5,000,000 and (ii) the policy limits of the insurance
coverage obtained by Seller in accordance with Section 5.13(c) below.

  

  

Acquiror agrees that the Indemnification Cap limit set forth in this Section
5.13(b) shall not apply to any damages, liabilities, judgments and claims (and
related expenses, including, without limitation, attorneys' fees and amounts
paid in settlement) insofar as they arise out of or are based upon the matters
for which indemnification is provided in Section 5.21 hereof.

  

  

(c) Insurance. Seller shall obtain on or prior to the Effective Time a three-
year "tail" prepaid directors' and officers' liability insurance policy(ies)
covering the persons listed on Seller Disclosure Schedule 5.13(b) at no cost
to the beneficiaries thereof with respect to claims arising from facts or
events which occurred prior to the Effective Time, in the same coverage amount
as in effect under Seller's directors' and officers' liability insurance
policies (both primary and excess) immediately prior the Effective Time,
provided, that if the aggregate premium Seller would be required to pay for
such "tail" policy(ies) is in excess of 200% of the premium for such coverage
set forth in Seller Disclosure Schedule 3.14, then Seller shall purchase as
much coverage as reasonably practicable for such premium, unless otherwise
agreed in advance in writing by Acquiror. Such policy(ies) shall survive the
Mergers.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

53  

  

 

 

 

  

(d) Subsequent Events. In the event that the Surviving Corporation or any of
its respective successors or assigns shall (i) consolidate with or merge into
any other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfer all or substantially
all its properties and assets to any person, then, and in each such case, the
Surviving Corporation shall cause proper provision to be made so that the
successor and assign of the Surviving Corporation assumes the obligations set
forth in Sections 5.13(b) and (c). The provisions of Sections 5.13(b) and (c)
shall survive consummation of the Mergers and are intended to be for the
benefit of, and will be enforceable by each Indemnified Party, his or her
heirs and his or her legal representatives.

  

  

5.14 Takeover Laws; No Rights Triggered. If any Takeover Law may become, or
may purport to be, applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby, each of
Seller, Seller Sub, Acquiror and Acquiror Sub and the members of their
respective Boards of Directors will grant such approvals and take such actions
as are necessary so that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may
be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and
otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of any Takeover Law on any
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

  

5.15 Affiliates. Prior to the Effective Time, Seller shall deliver to Acquiror
a letter identifying all persons whom it believes to be "affiliates" of Seller
for purposes of Rule 145(c) or Rule 144 (as applicable) under the 1933 Act.
Seller shall use its best efforts to cause each person so identified to
deliver to Acquiror prior to the Effective Time a written agreement in
substantially the form of Schedule 5.15 hereto providing, among other things,
that such person will not dispose of Acquiror Common Stock received in the
Parent Merger except in compliance with the 1933 Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder.

  

  

5.16 Adoption of Accounting Policies. As soon as practicable after the
satisfaction or waiver of all conditions to the Closing set forth in Article
VI of this Agreement and at such time as consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement seems reasonably assured and in any event prior
to the Effective Time (unless this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Article
VII hereof), Seller and Seller Sub shall take any and all necessary or
appropriate actions to adopt all Acquiror accounting procedures and policies
(including, without limitation, those policies pertaining to charged-off and
non-accrual assets); provided, however, that no such action taken by Seller or
Seller Sub at the request of Acquiror pursuant to this section shall be deemed
to be, or be deemed to cause, a breach of any representation or warranty made
by Seller or Seller Sub herein.

  

  

5.17 Section 16 Matters. Prior to the Effective Time, if Seller provides
Acquiror the Section 16 Information reasonably in advance of the Effective
Time, the parties will each take such steps as may be reasonably necessary or
appropriate to cause any disposition of shares of Seller Common Stock or
conversion of any derivative securities in respect of shares of Seller Common
Stock in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the 1934 Act.
"Section 16 Information" shall mean information accurate in all respects
regarding Seller Insiders, the number of shares of Seller Common Stock held by
each such Seller Insider and the number and description of the Seller Stock
Options held by each such Seller Insider. "Seller Insiders" shall mean those
officers and directors of Seller who are subject to the reporting requirements
of Section 16(a) of the 1934 Act.

  

  

5.18 Operating Functions. Seller and Seller Sub shall cooperate with Acquiror
and Acquiror Sub in connection with planning for the efficient and orderly
combination of the parties and the operation of the Subsidiary Surviving Bank
after the Subsidiary Merger, and in preparing for the consolidation of
appropriate operating functions to be effective on the Closing Date or such
later date as Acquiror may decide. Seller shall take any action Acquiror may
reasonably request prior to the Effective Time to facilitate the combination
of the operations of Seller Sub with Acquiror Sub. Without limiting the
foregoing, Seller shall provide office space and support services (and other
reasonably requested support and assistance) in connection with the foregoing,
and senior officers of Seller and Acquiror shall meet from time to time as
Seller or Acquiror may reasonably request, to review the financial and
operational affairs of Seller and Seller Sub, and Seller shall give due
consideration to Acquiror's input on such matters, with the understanding
that, notwithstanding any other provision contained in this Agreement, (i)
neither Acquiror nor Acquiror Sub shall under any circumstance be permitted to
exercise control of Seller, Seller Sub or any of Seller's other Subsidiaries
prior to the Effective Time, (ii) neither Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries
shall be under any obligation to act in a manner that could reasonably be
deemed to constitute anti-competitive behavior under federal or state
antitrust laws and (iii) neither Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be
required to agree to any material obligation that is not contingent upon the
consummation of the Merger.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

54  

  

 

 

 

  

5.19 Covenant to Close. At such time as is deemed appropriate by the parties
hereto or as otherwise set forth in this Agreement, and upon satisfaction or
waiver of each of the conditions to Closing of the Mergers, the parties agree
to take such actions as are reasonably necessary or appropriate to effect the
Closing and the Mergers.

  

  

5.20 Certain Agreements. As promptly as practicable after the date hereof (but
no later than ten days following the date of this Agreement), Seller and
Seller Sub shall have each director of Seller and Seller Sub who is not an
employee of Seller or Seller Sub, respectively, execute a Lock-Up and Non-
Competition Agreement in substantially the form of Schedule 5.20A hereto and
have each executive officer of Seller and Seller Sub who is also a director of
Seller or Seller Sub, respectively, execute a Lock-Up Agreement in
substantially the form of Schedule 5.20B hereto.

  

  

5.21 Hold Harmless. Acquiror will indemnify and hold harmless Seller, Seller
Sub, each of the directors and officers and each person, if any, who controls
Seller or Seller Sub within the meaning of the 1933 Act against any losses,
claims, damages or liabilities, joint, several and solidary, to which they or
any of them may become subject, under the 1933 Act or otherwise, insofar as
such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof)
arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement
of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, or in any
amendment or supplement thereto, or arising out of or based upon the omission
or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will
pay or promptly reimburse such person for any legal or other expenses
reasonably incurred by such person in connection with investigating or
defending any such action or claim; provided, however, that Acquiror shall not
be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or
liability (or actions in respect thereof) arises out of or is based upon any
untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission,
that is subsequently confirmed in a court of competent jurisdiction or
alternative dispute resolution forum, made in the Registration Statement or
any such amendment or supplement in reliance upon and in conformity with
information furnished to Acquiror by Seller or Seller Sub for use therein.
Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party hereunder of notice of the
commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in
respect thereof is to be made against Acquiror under this Section 5.21, notify
Acquiror in writing of the commencement thereof. In case any such action shall
be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify Acquiror of the
commencement thereof, Acquiror shall be entitled to participate therein; and
to the extent that it shall wish to assume the defense thereof with counsel
satisfactory to such indemnified party, and, after notice from Acquiror to
such indemnified party of its election to so assume the defense thereof,
Acquiror shall not be liable to such indemnified party under this Section 5.21
for any legal expenses of other counsel or of any other expenses subsequently
incurred by such indemnified party.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

55  

  

 

 

 

  

5.22 Seller Indebtedness. Acquiror will execute and deliver, or cause to be
executed and delivered, by or on behalf of the Surviving Corporation, at or
prior to the Effective Time, one or more supplemental indentures and other
instruments required for the due assumption of Seller's (i) Fixed/Floating
Rate Junior Subordinated Deferrable Interest Debentures Due 2036 and (ii)
obligations under the related Guaranty Agreement by and between Seller and
Wilmington Trust Company dated as of February 16, 2006.

  

  

5.23 Investment Advisory Consents. Seller shall cause its applicable
Subsidiaries to use their reasonable best efforts to obtain the consents and
approvals necessary to satisfy the consents and approvals required under
applicable Laws to effect the assignment or continuation of each investment
advisory, sub-advisory, investment management, trust or similar agreement with
any investment advisory client in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby, including with respect to any change of control of any
person or entity in connection therewith. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, as soon as reasonably practicable after the date of this
Agreement, Seller shall (or shall cause its applicable Subsidiary to) mail a
letter to each relevant client, in a form reasonably acceptable to Acquiror,
with respect to such process, and approximately 30 days after the mailing of
such letter, to mail a second letter to each such client, in a form reasonably
acceptable to Acquiror. Acquiror and Seller shall agree on an approach to
obtaining such necessary consents and approvals with respect to any investment
advisory clients required to give a "positive consent" to assignment, in
accordance with applicable Laws.

  

  

5.24 Stock Exchange De-listing. Seller shall use its reasonable best efforts
to take such actions prior to the Effective Time of the Parent Merger to cause
Seller's securities to be de-listed from the Nasdaq Global Select Market and
de-registered under the 1934 Act as soon as practicable following the
Effective Time.

  

  

5.25 Preferred Stock Held By U.S. Treasury. Seller and Acquiror shall each use
its reasonable best efforts to cause or facilitate either (i) the repurchase
or redemption by Seller of, or (ii) the purchase by Acquiror or one of its
subsidiaries of, all of the issued and outstanding shares of Seller CDCI
Preferred Stock and the Seller Warrant prior to or concurrently with the
consummation of the Parent Merger from the Treasury Department or other
holders thereof. The method of funding the redemption or purchase, as the case
may be, shall be mutually agreed to by Acquiror and Seller, subject to any
formal or informal Treasury Department requirements. In furtherance of the
foregoing, Seller shall provide, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to provide,
all reasonable cooperation and take all reasonable actions as may be requested
by Acquiror in connection with such redemption or purchase, including by (x)
furnishing all information concerning Seller and its Subsidiaries that
Acquiror or any applicable Governmental Entity may request in connection with
such redemption or purchase or with respect to the effects of such purchase on
Acquiror or its pro forma capitalization, (y) assisting with the preparation
of any analyses or presentations Acquiror deems necessary or advisable in its
reasonable judgment in connection with such redemption or purchase or the
effects thereof, and (z) entering into any agreement with such holder
(including any letter agreement among Seller, Acquiror and such holder) to
effect the redemption or purchase of such shares as Acquiror may reasonably
request (provided, that neither Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be
required to agree to any obligation that is not contingent upon the
consummation of the Parent Merger).

CLOSING CONDITIONS

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

56  

  

 

 

 

  

6.1 Conditions to the Parties' Obligations under this Agreement. The
respective obligations of the parties under this Agreement shall be subject to
the fulfillment at or prior to the Effective Time of the following conditions:

  

  

(a) (i) Each party shall have received the approval or consent, or waiver of
approval or consent, of the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated
hereby from any and all Governmental Entities whose consent or approval (or
waiver thereof) must be received in order to consummate the Mergers and the
transactions contemplated hereby, which consents or approvals shall not impose
any condition or requirement which, in the opinion of Acquiror, in its sole
reasonable discretion, would materially adversely impact the economic or
business benefits of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (ii)
any statutory or regulatory waiting period necessary to effect the Mergers and
the transactions contemplated hereby shall have expired. Such consents and
approvals and the transactions contemplated hereby shall not have been
contested by any Governmental Entity or any third party by formal proceeding.
It is understood that, if any such contest is brought by formal proceeding,
Acquiror and Seller may, but shall not be obligated to, answer and defend such
contest or otherwise pursue the Mergers and the transactions contemplated
hereby over such objection. All notices, reports and other filings required to
be made with any Governmental Entity in connection with the Parent Merger
prior to the Effective Time by Acquiror or Seller or in connection with the
Subsidiary Merger prior to the Effective Time by Acquiror Sub or Seller Sub
shall have been made and become final.

other transactions contemplated hereby.

  

  

(d) All consents or approvals of all persons (other than Governmental
Entities) required for consummation of the Mergers shall have been obtained

Acquiror Sub.

ARTICLE VII

  

  

TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER, ETC.

  

  

7.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the
Effective Time, whether before or after approval of this Agreement and the
Merger Documents by the stockholders of Seller and Seller Sub:

  

  

(a) by mutual written consent of the parties hereto;

  

  

(b) by Acquiror (on behalf of itself and Acquiror Sub) or Seller (on behalf of
itself and Seller Sub) (i) if the Effective Time shall not have occurred on or
prior to September 30, 2013, unless approval by a Governmental Entity pursuant
to Section 6.1(a) is pending and has not been finally resolved, in which event
such date shall be automatically extended to December 31, 2013; or (ii) if a
vote of the stockholders of Seller or Acquiror is taken and such stockholders
fail to approve this Agreement and the Parent Merger Document at the Special
Meeting of Seller or the meeting of Acquiror's stockholders to vote on this
Agreement and the Parent Merger Document; unless the failure of such
occurrence shall be due to the failure of the party seeking to terminate this
Agreement to perform or observe its agreements set forth herein to be
performed or observed by such party at or before the Effective Time or such
vote, as the case may be;

  

  

(c) by Acquiror (on behalf of itself and Acquiror Sub) or Seller (on behalf of
itself and Seller Sub) upon written notice to the other (i) 30 or more days
after the date upon which any application for a regulatory or governmental
approval necessary to consummate the Mergers and the other transactions
contemplated hereby (including the redemption or repurchase of the issued and
outstanding shares of Seller CDCI Preferred Stock and the Seller Warrant prior
to or contemporaneously with the Parent Merger) shall have been denied or
withdrawn at the request or recommendation of the applicable Governmental
Entity, unless within such 30-day period a petition for rehearing or an
amended application is filed or noticed, or 30 or more days after any petition
for rehearing or amended application is denied; provided, however, that no
party hereto shall have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 7.1(c)(i) if such denial or request or recommendation for withdrawal
shall be due to the failure of the party seeking to terminate this Agreement
to perform or observe the covenants and agreements of such party set forth
herein; and in each case the time period for appeals and requests for
reconsideration has run; or (ii) if any Governmental Entity of competent
jurisdiction shall have issued a final non-appealable order enjoining or
otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the Mergers or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

  

  

(d) by Acquiror (on behalf of itself and Acquiror Sub) in writing if Seller or
Seller Sub has, or by Seller (on behalf of itself and Seller Sub) in writing
if Acquiror or Acquiror Sub has, breached (i) any covenant or undertaking
contained herein, which breach would result in the failure to satisfy the
closing condition set forth in Section 6.2(a) or 6.3(a), as the case may be,
and such breach cannot be or has not been cured within 30 days after the
giving of written notice of such breach to the non-terminating party, or (ii)
any representation or warranty contained herein, which breach would result in
the failure to satisfy the closing condition set forth in Section 6.2(a) or
6.3(a), as the case may be, and such breach cannot be or has not been cured
within 30 days after the giving of written notice of such breach to the non-
terminating party;

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

59  

  

 

 

 

  

(e) by Acquiror (on behalf of itself and Acquiror Sub) if (i) Seller shall
have failed to make the Seller Recommendation in the Registration Statement,
(ii) Seller shall have effected a change in the Seller Recommendation, (iii)
Seller shall have breached its obligations under this Agreement by reason of a
failure to call or convene the Special Meeting in accordance with Section 5.8,
or (iv) Seller shall have approved or recommended, or proposed publicly to
approve or recommend, any Acquisition Transaction;

  

  

(f) by Seller (on behalf of itself and Seller Sub) (i) in accordance with the
terms and conditions of Section 5.3(c) or (ii) under the circumstances
described in the proviso of Section 5.8(b); or

  

  

(g) by Seller (on behalf of itself and Seller Sub) if (i) Acquiror shall have
failed to make the Acquiror Recommendation in the Registration Statement, (ii)
Acquiror shall have effected a Change in the Acquiror Recommendation, or (iii)
Acquiror shall have breached its obligations under this Agreement by reason of
a failure to call or convene the Special Meeting in accordance with Section
5.8.

  

  

7.2 Effect of Termination. In the event of termination of this Agreement by
either Acquiror or Seller as provided above, this Agreement shall forthwith
become void (other than Sections 5.6(b), this Section 7.2, Section 7.4 and
Article VIII hereof, which shall remain in full force and effect), and there
shall be no further liability on the part of the parties or their respective
officers or directors except for the liability of the parties under Sections
5.6(b), 5.6(c), 7.4 and Article VIII hereof and except for liability for any
willful breach of any covenant, undertaking, representation or warranty in
this Agreement giving rise to such termination.

  

  

7.3 Amendment, Extension and Waiver. Subject to applicable Law, at any time
prior to the consummation of the Parent Merger, whether before or after
approval thereof by the stockholders of Seller, the parties may (a) amend this
Agreement and the Merger Documents; (b) extend the time for the performance of
any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties hereto; (c) waive
any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained herein or in
any document delivered pursuant hereto; or (d) waive compliance with any of
the agreements or conditions contained herein (other than required stockholder
and regulatory approval); provided, however, that after any approval of the
Parent Merger by the stockholders of Seller, there may not be, without further
approval of such stockholders, any amendment or waiver of this Agreement or
the Parent Merger Document which (i) modifies either the amount or the form of
the Merger Consideration to be delivered to stockholders of Seller (for the
avoidance of doubt, excluding adjustments in the Exchange Ratio pursuant to
Section 2.1(a)(iv) of this Agreement), or (ii) is reasonably likely to
materially delay or jeopardize receipt of any required regulatory approvals or
materially impair or prevent the satisfaction of any other condition to the
obligations of Acquiror, Acquiror Sub, Seller or Seller Sub set forth in
Sections 6.1, 6.2 and 6.3 hereof or may materially delay the Effective Time.
This Agreement and the Merger Documents may not be amended except by an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto. Any
agreement on the part of a party hereto to any extension or waiver shall be
valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such
party and which has been authorized by or under the direction of its board of
directors; but such waiver or failure to insist on strict compliance with such
obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver of,
or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure.

  

  

7.4 Termination Fees.

  

  

(a) In the event that (A) a Pre-Termination Takeover Proposal Event (as
defined in subsection (c)) shall occur after the date of this Agreement and
thereafter this Agreement is terminated by either Acquiror or Seller pursuant
to Section 7.1(b)(ii) or by Acquiror pursuant to Section 7.1(d) as a result of
a willful breach by Seller or Seller Sub and (B) prior to the date that is 12
months after the date of such termination Seller consummates an Acquisition
Proposal, then Seller shall, on the date such Acquisition Proposal is
consummated, pay Acquiror a fee equal to $5,800,000 (the "Termination Fee").
The Termination Fee shall be paid by wire transfer of same-day funds.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

60  

  

 

 

 

  

(b) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Acquiror pursuant to
Section 7.1(e) or by Seller pursuant to Section 7.1(f), then concurrently with
such termination, Seller shall pay to Acquiror the Termination Fee by wire
transfer of same-day funds, and such termination shall not be deemed effective
hereunder until receipt by Acquiror of such fee. For the avoidance of doubt,
if Seller fails to hold the Special Meeting, fails to make the Seller
Recommendation, or withdraws, modifies or changes the Seller Recommendation
either as a result of an Acquisition Proposal that has not been withdrawn or
otherwise, and this Agreement is terminated by Acquiror pursuant to Section
7.1(e) or by Seller pursuant to Section 7.1(f), then Seller shall pay the
Termination Fee as provided in this Section 7.4(b). In no event shall Seller
be required to pay the Termination Fee under both this Section 7.4(b) and
Section 7.4(a).

  

  

(c) For purposes of this Section 7.4, a "Pre-Termination Takeover Proposal
Event" shall be deemed to occur if, prior to the event giving rise to the
right to terminate this Agreement, an Acquisition Proposal shall have been
made known to the senior management or the board of directors of Seller or
shall have been made directly to its stockholders generally, or any person
reasonably qualified to consummate an Acquisition Proposal shall have publicly
announced an intention (whether or not conditional) to make an Acquisition
Proposal, and such Acquisition Proposal or public announcement shall not have
been irrevocably withdrawn not less than five Business Days prior to the
Special Meeting (with respect to a termination pursuant to Section 7.1(b)(ii))
or the date of termination (with respect to a termination pursuant to Section
7.1(d). Seller acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 7.4
are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
that, without these agreements, Acquiror would not enter into this Agreement;
accordingly, if Seller fails promptly to pay the amount due pursuant to this
Section 7.4 and, in order to obtain such payment, Acquiror commences a suit
which results in a judgment against Seller for the fee set forth in this
Section 7.4, Seller shall pay to Acquiror its costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) in connection with such suit,
together with interest on the amount of the fee at a rate per annum equal to
the prime rate published in The Wall Street Journal on the date such payment
was required to be made, plus 300 basis points.

Acquiror and Seller shall each bear one-half of all costs of printing, mailing
and filing the Registration Statement and all filing and similar fees relating
to the Mergers.

  

  

8.2 Survival The respective representations, warranties and covenants of the
parties to this Agreement shall not survive (i) the Effective Time or (ii) the

Sections 5.13 and 5.21 and this Article VIII which shall survive the Effective
Time, and (ii) Sections 5.6(b), 5.6(c), 7.4 and this Article VIII which shall

8.6 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts,
all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and each of which
shall be deemed an original. Transmission by facsimile of an executed
counterpart of this Agreement shall be deemed to constitute due and sufficient
delivery of such counterpart, and such facsimile shall be deemed to be an
original counterpart of this Agreement.

  

  

8.7 Governing Law; Venue; Waiver of Jury Trial.

  

  

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Mississippi,
without giving effect to the principles of conflicts of laws thereof.

  

  

(b) Each party agrees that it will bring any action or proceeding in respect
of any claim arising out of or related to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby exclusively in any federal or state court sitting in the
State of Mississippi, and, solely in connection with claims arising under this
Agreement or the Mergers that are the subject of this Agreement, (i)
irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of such Mississippi courts,
(ii) waives any objection to laying venue in any such action or proceeding in
the Mississippi courts, (iii) waives any objection that the Mississippi courts
are an inconvenient forum or do not have jurisdiction over any party and (iv)

proceeding will be effective if notice is given in accordance with Section
8.3.

  

  

(c) Each party acknowledges and agrees that any controversy which may arise
under this Agreement is likely to involve complicated and difficult issues,
and therefore each such party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives,
to the extent permitted by applicable Law at the time of institution of the
applicable litigation, any right such party may have to a trial by jury in
respect of any litigation directly or indirectly arising out of or relating to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each party
certifies and acknowledges that: (i) no representative, agent or attorney of
any other party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other party
would not, in the event of litigation, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver;
(ii) each party understands and has considered the implications of this
waiver; (iii) each party makes this waiver voluntarily; and (iv) each party
has been induced to enter into this Agreement by, among other things, the
mutual waivers and certifications in this Section 8.7.

  

  

8.8 Interpretation. For the purposes of this Agreement, (i) words in the
singular shall be held to include the plural and vice versa and words of one
gender shall be held to include the other gender as the context requires, (ii)
the terms "hereof," "herein," and "herewith" and words of similar import
shall, unless otherwise stated, be construed to refer to this Agreement as a
whole (including all of the Disclosure Schedules and Exhibits to this
Agreement) and not to any particular provision of this Agreement, and Article,
Section, Disclosure Schedule and Exhibit references are to the Articles,
Sections, Disclosure Schedules and Exhibits to this Agreement unless otherwise
specified, (iii) whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are
used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words
"without limitation," (iv) the word "or" shall not be exclusive and (v) all
references to any period of days shall be deemed to be to the relevant number
of calendar days unless otherwise specified. This Agreement shall not be
interpreted or construed to require any person or entity to take any action,

63  

  

 

 

 

  

The parties intend that each representation, warranty and covenant contained
herein shall have independent significance. If any party has breached any
representation, warranty, or covenant contained herein in any respect, the
fact that there exists another representation, warranty or covenant relating
to the same subject matter (regardless of the relative levels of specificity)
that the party has not breached shall not detract from or mitigate the fact
that the party is in breach of the first representation, warranty or covenant.
Further, it is understood and agreed that the specification of any dollar
amount in the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement or
the inclusion of any specific item in the Seller Disclosure Schedule or
Acquiror Disclosure Schedule is not intended to imply that such amounts or
higher or lower amounts, or the items so included or other items, are or are
not material, and neither party shall use the fact of the setting of such
amounts or the fact of the inclusion of any such item in the Seller Disclosure
Schedule or Acquiror Disclosure Schedule in any dispute or controversy between
the parties as to whether any obligation, item or matter not described in this
Agreement or included in the Seller Disclosure Schedule or Acquiror Disclosure
Schedule is or is not material for purposes of this Agreement.

  

  

8.9 Enforcement. The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the
event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is
accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement, this being in addition to any
other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. The parties agree
to waive any requirements for the securing or posting of any bond in
connection with any remedy described in this Section 8.9 (except to the extent
required by Law).

  

  

8.10 Severability. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid or
unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction, be
ineffective only to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without
rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this
Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of any of the terms or
provisions of this Agreement in any other jurisdiction. If any provision of
this Agreement is so broad as to be unenforceable, the provision shall be
interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable.

  

  

8.11 Alternative Structure. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, before the Effective Time, Acquiror may revise the
structure of the Parent Merger and/or the Subsidiary Merger or otherwise
revise the method of effecting the Parent Merger and/or the Subsidiary Merger
and related transactions, provided, that (i) such revision does not alter or
change the kind or amount of the Merger Consideration, (ii) such revised
structure or method is reasonably capable of consummation without significant
delay in relation to the structure contemplated herein and (iii) such revision
does not otherwise cause any of the conditions set forth in Article VI not to
be capable of being fulfilled unless duly waived by the party entitled to the
benefits thereof. This Agreement and any related documents will be
appropriately amended in order to reflect any revised structure or method as
contemplated by this Section 8.11.

JOINDER AGREEMENT

  


 

  

THIS AGREEMENT is made and executed as of __________, 2013 between Renasant
Corporation, a Mississippi corporation ("Acquiror"), and the undersigned
individual officer and/or director ("MandF Official") of First MandF Corporation,
a Mississippi corporation ("MandF"), and/or Merchants and Farmers Bank, a
Mississippi banking corporation ("MandF Bank").

  

  

RECITALS:

  


 

  

WHEREAS, Acquiror, Renasant Bank, a Mississippi banking corporation (the
"Acquiror Bank"), MandF and MandF Bank have entered into an Agreement and Plan of
Merger (the "Merger Agreement") pursuant to which MandF will be merged into
Acquiror and Acquiror shall be the surviving entity on the terms and subject
to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement and MandF Bank will be
merged into Acquiror Bank and Acquiror Bank shall be the surviving entity on
the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in such Merger Agreement;
and

  

  

WHEREAS, in consideration of the agreements made by MandF in connection with the
Merger Agreement, Acquiror has agreed to indemnify the MandF Official under
certain circumstances set forth in the Merger Agreement.

  

  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of Acquiror's agreement to indemnify the MandF
Official and the expenses and costs that may be incurred by Acquiror in
connection with such indemnification, the MandF Official hereby agrees as
follows:

  

  

1. Assumption of and Cooperation in Defense.

  


 

  

1.1 Notice and Assumption of Defense. In the event a claim arises for which
indemnification is or may be sought by the MandF Official, the MandF Official
shall promptly notify Acquiror, in writing at the address set forth in Section
3 hereof, of the commencement of such legal action or existence of and facts
relating to such claim. Upon receipt of such notice, or at any time
thereafter, Acquiror shall be entitled to participate therein and, in its sole
discretion, to assume the defense of such claim, with counsel of its choice,
subject to the reasonable approval of the MandF Official, and to consider and
decide on any proposed settlement, subject to the reasonable approval of the
MandF Official. In any and all events, Acquiror shall have the right to
reasonable control over the nature and extent of expenses incurred in
connection with such claim(s). Acquiror shall notify the MandF Official of its
assumption of the defense of such claim; and after such notice from Acquiror
to the MandF Official, Acquiror shall not be liable to the MandF Official for
indemnification under Section 5.13(b) of the Merger Agreement for any legal
expenses of other counsel or any other expenses of defense subsequently
incurred by such indemnified party.

  

  

1.2 Cooperation in Defense. The MandF Official agrees to cooperate in the
defense of any action for which indemnification is sought under Section
5.13(b) of the Merger Agreement. Such cooperation shall include, but not be
limited to, providing Acquiror and its counsel copies of any and all relevant
documents relating to the claim, consulting with Acquiror and its counsel with
regard to the claim, providing testimony, either in deposition or at trial or
both, regarding the facts relating to the claim, making himself available at
reasonable times for consultation, testimony and fact-finding and otherwise
furnishing such information to Acquiror and its counsel as the MandF Official
would provide to his own counsel in the event he were defending the action
himself. Except as expressly permitted by Acquiror, the MandF Official shall not
object to the production or use of any documents heretofore prepared by or of
information provided to Acquiror legal counsel on the basis of any claim of
privilege that is available only to MandF or Acquiror; provided, however, that
Acquiror agrees that it will not, without the consent of the MandF Official,
waive any applicable privilege of the MandF Official. Such cooperation shall be
provided regardless of whether Acquiror assumes the defense of the action.

  

  

2. Duplication of Payment; Limitations; Presumptions.

  


 

  

2.1 No Duplication of Payments. Acquiror shall not be liable under this
Agreement to make any payment in connection with any claim against the MandF
Official to the extent the MandF Official has otherwise actually received
payment (under any insurance policy, certificate of incorporation, bylaw
provision or otherwise) of amounts otherwise indemnifiable hereunder.

  

  

2.2 Limitation on Liability. The MandF Official hereby expressly acknowledges
and agrees that Acquiror shall not be liable in the aggregate for more than
the Indemnification Cap (as defined in the Merger Agreement) in connection
with its obligations under Section 5.13(b) of the Merger Agreement. The MandF
Official further acknowledges and agrees that he shall have no claim against
Acquiror for any amount that, when aggregated with indemnification amounts
paid by Acquiror to other MandF Officials that would be subject to the
Indemnification Cap as provided in the Merger Agreement (the "Capped Amount"),
exceeds the Indemnification Cap. Any claim for reallocation of the amounts
paid by Acquiror among MandF Officials shall be made against the other MandF
Official(s) involved, and Acquiror shall not be liable in any way for the
allocation of such Capped Amount among MandF Officials.

  

  

2.3 No Presumption. For purposes of this Agreement, the termination of any
claim, action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement (whether with
or without court approval) shall not of itself create a presumption that the
MandF Official did or did not meet any particular standard of conduct or have
any particular belief or that a court has determined that indemnification is
not permitted by applicable law.

  

  

3. Notices. All notices or other communications which are required or permitted hereunder shall be delivered in accordance with Section 8.3 of the Merger Agreement, at the addresses listed below:

Gentlemen:

  


 

  

This letter agreement is given in connection with the closing of the merger
(the "Merger") of First MandF Corporation ("Seller") with and into Renasant
Corporation ("Acquiror"). I am aware and acknowledge that, as a member of the
board of directors or an officer of Seller or the beneficial owner of a
substantial amount of the outstanding common stock of Seller, I may be an
"affiliate" of Seller as that term is defined in the Securities Act of 1933,
as amended (the "Securities Act"), and the regulations thereunder.

  

  

I understand the resales or other dispositions of Acquiror's common stock,
$5.00 per share par value ("Acquiror Common Stock"), acquired by me as a
result of the Merger may be governed by Rules 144 and 145 of the Securities
Act.

  

  

On the basis of the foregoing, and in consideration of the delivery to me of
the Acquiror Common Stock into which my Seller common stock will be converted,
I agree that I will not, directly or indirectly, sell, transfer, pledge or
otherwise alienate or encumber any of the Acquiror Common Stock held by me in
violation of the Securities Act or the rules or regulations promulgated
thereunder. In addition, I expressly agree to the placement of a restrictive
legend on any and all certificates representing Acquiror Common Stock of which
I am the beneficial owner reflecting the restrictions described above.

LOCK- UP AND NON-COMPETITION AGREEMENT

  


 

   
 

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

   
 

LOCK-UP AND NON-COMPETITION AGREEMENT

  


 

  

This Agreement is made and executed as of the ____ day of _______, 2013,
between Renasant Corporation, a Mississippi corporation ("Acquiror"), and the
undersigned non-employee director ("MandF Official") of First MandF Corporation, a
Mississippi corporation ("MandF"), or Merchants and Farmers Bank, a Mississippi
banking corporation ("MandF Bank").

  

  

Acquiror, Renasant Bank, a Mississippi banking corporation ("Acquiror Bank"),
MandF and MandF Bank have entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Plan
of Merger"), pursuant to which the parties thereto agree that (i) MandF will
merge (the "Merger") with and into Acquiror, and Acquiror shall be the
surviving entity of the Merger, and (ii) MandF Bank and Acquiror Bank will merge
(the "Bank Merger") with and into Acquiror Bank, and Acquiror Bank shall be
the surviving entity of the Bank Merger. In consideration of the expenses that
Acquiror will incur in connection with the transactions contemplated by the
Plan of Merger, and in order to preserve the value of the franchise to be
purchased by Acquiror and induce Acquiror to proceed to incur such expenses,
the MandF Official makes the following agreements in favor of Acquiror:

  

  

1. Undertakings of MandF Official.

  


 

  

1.1 The MandF Official agrees and undertakes to vote or cause to be voted in
favor of the approval of the Plan of Merger all shares of common stock of MandF,
$5.00 par value per share (the "MandF Stock"), as to which he has voting power
(other than shares held in a fiduciary capacity), which amount of shares is
shown on the schedule attached hereto and made a part hereof, at any meeting
or meetings (including any and all adjournments thereof) held on or before
September 30, 2013. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that nothing in
this section or this Agreement is intended to dictate or require that the MandF
Official vote as a director in any manner.

  

  

1.2 The MandF Official further agrees that he will not transfer any of the
shares of MandF Stock over which he has dispositive power, which number of
shares is shown on the schedule attached hereto and made a part hereof, until
the vote upon the Plan of Merger by MandF's stockholders has been taken or until
the Plan of Merger has been terminated pursuant to the provisions thereof,
except (i) for transfers by operation of law, and (ii) for transfers in
connection with which Acquiror has consented to the transfer and the
transferee shall agree in writing with Acquiror to be bound by this Agreement
as fully as the undersigned.

  

  

1.3 This Agreement shall terminate at such time as the Plan of Merger
terminates.

  

  

2. Noncompetition Obligations of MandF Official.

  


 

  

2.1 MandF Official will not:

  

  

(a) directly or indirectly, for himself or in affiliation with any business or
entity in which he owns an equity or financial interest (except as to not more
than five percent (5%) of the outstanding stock of any corporation, the
securities of which are regularly traded on a nationally recognized securities
exchange or over-the-counter market), carry on or engage in any Competitive
Business (as hereinafter defined) within the Restricted Area (as hereinafter
defined); or

  

  

(b) directly or indirectly, in affiliation with any individual or any business
or entity not covered by (a) above, whether as a partner, employee,
contractor, consultant or otherwise, carry on or engage in any Competitive
Business in the Restricted Area; or

  

  

(c) directly or indirectly, solicit or cause to be solicited any customers of
the Acquiror or Acquiror Bank, with respect to any Competitive Business in the
Restricted Area; or

  

  

(d) directly or indirectly, solicit or cause to be solicited any employees,
contractors or agents of the Acquiror or the Acquiror Bank to terminate their
employment, contract or relationship with the Company.

  

  

For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Restricted Area" shall mean the
State of Mississippi, and the term "Competitive Business" shall mean the
business of banking through, or as a part of, or as an agent for, an FDIC-
insured financial institution, including, without limitation, checking and
savings accounts, business and personal loans, interim construction and
residential loans, student loans, automated tellers machines, internet banking
services and accounts receivable financing. For the avoidance of doubt,
"Competitive Business" shall exclude equipment leasing, insurance agency
services, insurance services, trust services and investment advisory services
and any entity in which the MandF Official has an ownership interest in on the
date of this Agreement.

  

  

2.2. The noncompetition obligations set forth in Section 2.1 shall extend
until the second anniversary of the Closing (as defined in the Plan of Merger)
(the "Restricted Period").

  

  

2.3. The Acquiror and the MandF Official agree that the foregoing restrictions
are reasonable under the circumstances and that any breach of the covenants
contained in this Section 2 would cause irreparable injury to the Acquiror.
The MandF Official understands that the foregoing restrictions may limit the MandF
Official's ability to engage in certain businesses during the period provided
for above in the Restricted Area, but acknowledges that the MandF Official will
receive sufficient remuneration and other benefits under the Plan of Merger to
justify such restriction. Further, the MandF Official acknowledges that his
skills are such that he can be gainfully employed in non-competitive
employment, and that the agreement not to compete will in no way prevent him
from earning a living. If any of the aforesaid restrictions are found by a
court of competent jurisdiction to be unreasonable, or overly broad as to
geographic area or time, or otherwise unenforceable, the parties intend for
the restrictions therein set forth to be modified by the court making such
determination so as to be reasonable and enforceable and, as so modified, to
be fully enforced. By agreeing to this contractual modification prospectively
at this time, the parties intend to make this provision enforceable under the
laws of Mississippi in the Restricted Area so that the entire agreement not to
compete and this Agreement as prospectively modified shall remain in full
force and effect and shall not be rendered void or illegal.

  

  

2.4. The MandF Official acknowledges that money damages would not be sufficient
remedy for any breach of this Section 2 by the MandF Official, and the Acquiror
shall be entitled to seek to enforce the provisions of this Section 2 by
specific performance and injunctive relief as remedies for such breach or any
threatened breach. Such remedies shall not be deemed the exclusive remedies
for a breach of this Section 2, but shall be in addition to all remedies
available at law or in equity to the Acquiror, including, without limitation,
the recovery of damages from the MandF Official and his or her agents involved
in such breach.

  

  

3. Miscellaneous.

  


 

  

3.1 The provisions of this Agreement shall be enforceable through an action
for damages at law or a suit for specific performance or other appropriate
extraordinary relief, the MandF Official acknowledging that remedies at law for
breach or default might be or become inadequate.

  

  

3.2 The MandF Official acknowledges and agrees that this Agreement is executed
in connection with the sale of all of the business of MandF. The MandF Official
further acknowledges and represents that the provisions of this Agreement will
not work a hardship on him and will not prevent him from engaging in his
occupation.

  

  

3.3 To the extent permitted under applicable law, any provision of this
Agreement may be amended or modified at any time, either before or after its
approval by an agreement in writing among the parties hereto.

  

  

3.4 This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which shall be
deemed to constitute an original. Each such counterpart shall become effective
when one counterpart has been signed by each party hereto.

  

  

3.5 This Agreement shall be governed by, and interpreted in accordance with,
the laws of the State of Mississippi applicable to agreements made and
entirely to be performed within such State, except as federal law may be
applicable.

  

  

3.6 The MandF Official may not assign any of his rights or obligations under
this Agreement to any other person.

  

  

3.7 This Agreement supersedes any and all oral or written agreements and
understandings heretofore made between the parties hereto relating to the
subject matter hereof and contains the entire agreement of the parties
relating to the subject matter hereof; provided, however, that notwithstanding
the foregoing, this Agreement does not modify or amend any stock option
agreement, employment agreement, option or similar employee benefit agreement
between MandF or an affiliate of MandF and the MandF Official. The terms and
conditions of this Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon
the parties hereto and their respective successors, heirs and legatees.

  

  

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have signed this Agreement effective as of the
date first set forth above.

MandF and MandF Bank have entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Plan
of Merger"), pursuant to which the parties thereto agree that (i) MandF will

surviving entity of the Merger, and (ii) MandF Bank and Acquiror Bank will merge
(the "Bank Merger") with and into Acquiror Bank, and Acquiror Bank shall be

the MandF Official makes the following agreements in favor of Acquiror:

  

  

1. Undertakings of MandF Official.

(other than shares held in a fiduciary capacity), which amount of shares is
shown on the Schedule attached hereto and made a part hereof, at any meeting
or meetings (including any and all adjournments thereof) held on or before
September 30, 2013. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that nothing in
this Section or this Agreement is intended to dictate or require that the MandF
Official vote as a director in any manner.

  

  

1.2 The MandF Official further agrees that he will not transfer any of the
shares of MandF Stock over which he has dispositive power, which number of
shares is shown on the Schedule attached hereto and made a part hereof, until
the vote upon the Plan of Merger by MandF's stockholders has been taken or until
the Plan of Merger has been terminated pursuant to the provisions thereof,
except (i) for transfers by operation of law, and (ii) for transfers in
connection with which Acquiror has consented to the transfer and the
transferee shall agree in writing with Acquiror to be bound by this Agreement
as fully as the undersigned.

breach or default might be or become inadequate.

  

  

3.2 The MandF Official acknowledges and agrees that this Agreement is executed
in connection with the sale of all of the business of MandF. The MandF Official
further acknowledges and represents that the provisions of this Agreement will
not work a hardship on him and will not prevent him from engaging in his

3.3 To the extent permitted under applicable law, any provision of this
Agreement may be amended or modified at any time, either before or after its
approval by an agreement in writing among the parties hereto.

understandings heretofore made between the parties hereto relating to the
subject matter hereof and contains the entire agreement of the parties
relating to the subject matter hereof; provided, however, that notwithstanding
the foregoing, this Agreement does not modify or amend any stock option
agreement, employment agreement, option or similar employee benefit agreement
between MandF and the MandF Official. The terms and conditions of this Agreement
