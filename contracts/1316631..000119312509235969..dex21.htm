 authority for providing Merger Clearance has stopped the clock or required
the Purchaser to extend the investigation phase. For the avoidance of doubt,

undertake and shall cause _(daf ur einstehen)_ its Affiliates to take any and

antitrust, competition or trade regulation law that may be asserted by
any authority, except where such steps would cause an unreasonable hardship (
_Unzumutbarkeit_ ) for the Purchaser and its Affiliates (taken as a whole).
Except if and to the extent this would cause an unreasonable hardship (
_Unzumutbarkeit_ ) for the Purchaser and its Affiliates (taken as a whole),
such undertaking and responsibility of the Purchaser shall include, without
limitation, accepting any obligations or conditions ( _Auflagen und
Bedingungen_ ), and making - including measures which qualify under the

the sale, divestiture or disposition of such of its or its Affiliates
assets, properties or businesses or of the assets, properties or businesses of
the Group Entities and the entrance into such other arrangements, as are
necessary or desirable to avoid that the consummation of the
transactions contemplated under this Agreement is materially delayed or
prohibited. The Purchaser  

---|--- 



 

20   ![LOGO](g40729g04j18.jpg)



      |

 undertakes not to, and shall cause _(daf ur einstehen)_ its Affiliates not
to, and the Seller undertakes not to and shall cause ( _daf ur einstehen_) the
Group Entities not to enter into any transaction, or any agreement to effect
any transaction (including any merger or acquisition), that might reasonably
be expected to make it more difficult, or to materially increase the time
required, to obtain the Merger Clearance. If the consummation of the
transactions contemplated under this Agreement is prohibited by any authority
or court, upon request of the Seller, the Purchaser shall, at the Purchasers
cost and indemnifying the Seller for any reasonable costs and expenses
incurred by the Seller in connection therewith, contest such decision
(including by way of litigation) and use all other reasonable efforts to
ensure that the Closing may be consummated as contemplated by this Agreement
and as timely as reasonably practicable (including the application of a
ministerial permit), provided that the obligations to contest such decision
shall lapse upon a valid termination of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Purchaser shall inform the Seller in writing without undue
delay if it becomes reasonably likely that the Closing Condition set forth in
_Section 6.1.1_. (Merger Clearance) above will not be satisfied or will not
be satisfied in a timely manner or that conditions will or are likely to be
imposed by an authority which may affect the Sellers interests.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Purchaser shall not be obliged to contest
such decision through litigation if (i) in the event of a filing with the EU,
the European Commission has finally prohibited the concentration, or (ii) in
the event of a referral by the EU to the German FCO, the German FCO has
prohibited the concentration and the Minister for Economic Affairs has
rejected a ministerial permit. In either case, the Parties will agree to
negotiate in good faith and make all reasonable efforts to agree to terminate
the Agreement as soon as possible prior to September 30, 2010. 

---|--- 


   6.2.4 | _No Adjustment of the Purchase Price_. For the avoidance of
doubt, the Purchaser may not request any adjustment of the Purchase Price or
other amendment to this Agreement as a result of any divestiture or other
action required pursuant to _Section 6.2.3 _above or pursuant to any decision
made by a competent authority with a view to the grant of a clearance by such
authority for the transaction contemplated hereby. 
---|--- 



   6.3 | _Consequences of Non-Satisfaction of the Closing Condition_ 
---|--- 

In the event that the Closing Condition set forth in _Section 6.1.1 _(Merger
Clearance) is not satisfied or waived in accordance with this Agreement at the
latest on September 30, 2010, (i) unless such non-satisfaction was caused by
a breach of the obligations of the Seller provided for under _Section 6.2_
above, Seller may terminate this Agreement by giving written notice thereof to
the Purchaser, and (ii), unless such non-satisfaction was caused by a breach
of the obligations of the Purchaser provided for under _Section 6.2_ above,
the Purchaser may terminate this Agreement by giving written notice thereof to
the Seller.

_Purchaser s Termination Right_. The Purchaser shall be entitled to terminate
this Agreement by giving written notice thereof to the Seller no later than
at 24:00 hours CET on the third (3rd) Business Day following the date hereof,

validly terminated their commitments to provide, or declined to provide, the
Debt Financing to the Purchaser for purposes of the transactions contemplated
under this Agreement under the Debt Financing Documents on the sole basis and
as a direct result of a Market Disruption (as defined below). 

---|---

at 24:00 hours CET on the third (3rd) Business Day following the date
hereof. 

A "Market Disruption" shall be deemed to have occurred only if during the
first three (3) Business Day period following the date hereof, there has
occurred a material disruption in the financing or capital markets that
renders the financing sources unable to place, sell or resell the Debt
Financing prior to the expiration of such period at any price. 

In the event this Agreement is terminated pursuant to this _Section 6.4.1_,

towards the respective other Party except that (i) any liability of any Party
for damages already due on the date of termination or for damages for a

   6.4.2 | _Agreement re Statutory Termination Rights of Purchaser_. In
the event that despite the limitation on Purchasers remedies provided for
under  _Section 11.5_ the Purchaser becomes entitled to a termination right
under mandatory statutory law (other than as a result of a willful ( _vors
atzlich_) material breach of this Agreement by the Seller), it is agreed that
Purchaser may exercise such termination right only if the Purchaser is not
itself in material breach of the provisions of this Agreement and has given
Seller 15 days prior written notice of its intention to exercise the
termination right, without the Seller having cured the breach of this
Agreement during such 15 days period. With respect to any termination right of
the Seller other than those pursuant to this _Section 6_, the preceding
sentence shall apply _mutatis mutandis_.

_Section 11_, if any Sellers Representation is incorrect or if the Seller is
in breach of any other covenant, representation, provision, agreement or
undertaking contained in this Agreement (a "Breach"), the Purchaser shall be
entitled to request from the Seller compensation in cash ( _Schadensersatz in
Geld_ ) for any Losses (as defined below) incurred by the Purchaser or any
Group Entity, provided that (save with respect to any claims pursuant to
_Section 8.1_) Purchasers sole and exclusively remedy or recourse shall be
to make a claim against the Escrow Account and only to the extent determined
by the Single Arbitrator in accordance with _Section 11.4_. Any indemnity
payments made by the Seller pursuant to this Agreement shall be treated by the
Parties as adjustments to the Purchase Price. The Purchaser shall at any time
offer the Seller the opportunity to cure the breach, including, without
limitation, by putting the Purchaser or, at the Sellers election, the Group
Entity concerned, into the same position it would be in had the Breach not
occurred ( _Naturalrestitution_ ). 
---|--- 



   11.1.2 | _Definition of Losses_. "Losses" shall mean all actual
damages (within the meaning of Sections 249 _et seq._ of the German Civil
Code ( _BGB_ )) incurred, excluding (i) any potential or actual reduction in
value ( _Minderung_ ) of the Company or the respective Subsidiary (as the case
may be) beyond the actual damage incurred, (ii) any indirect ( _mittelbare_
) or consequential damages ( _Folgesch aden_), (iii) any lost profits (
_entgangener Gewinn_ ), (iv) any frustrated expenses ( _vergebliche
Aufwendungen_ ) within the meaning of Section 284 of the German Civil Code (
_BGB_ ), (v) any internal administration and overhead costs and (vi) any
argument that the Purchase Price was calculated upon incorrect assumptions. 
---|--- 


   11.1.3 | _Pro-rata principle_. Any Losses incurred at the level of a
Group Entity which is not (directly or indirectly) wholly owned by the Seller
shall be taken into account only on a _pro rata_ basis in proportion to the
respective direct or indirect shareholding of the Seller ( _durchgerechnete
indirekte Beteiligung_ ) as of the Closing Date. 
---|--- 


   11.1.4 | _Computation of Losses_. The present value of any benefits
received by the Purchaser or the Group Entities in connection with or as
result of the Breach (including, without limitation, avoided losses, tax
benefits and savings, and increases in the value of any asset owned by the
Group Entities ( _Abzug Neu f ur Alt_) shall be deducted for the purpose of
computing the Losses ( _Vorteilsausgleich_ ) in accordance with Section 252
of the German Civil Code ( _BGB_ ).

    11.1.5 | _Exclusions of Seller s Liability_. The Seller shall not
be liable for any Breach, and the Purchaser shall not be entitled to bring any
claim under or in connection with this Agreement, if and to the extent that: 
---|--- 



     | (i) | either the Purchaser, or (following the Closing Date) the
Group Entities or their respective representatives have caused or participated
in causing ( _verursacht oder mitverursacht_ ) or have aggravated such Breach
or any Losses resulting therefrom or failed to mitigate Losses pursuant to
Section 254 of the German Civil Code ( _BGB_ ); 
---|---|--- 


     | (ii) | the matter underlying the Breach has been taken into
account in the financial statements of the Group Entities set forth in
_Exhibit 11.1.5 (ii)_, as a write-off ( _Abschreibung_ ), value adjustment (
_Wertberichtigung_ ), liability ( _Verbindlichkeit_ ) or provision ( _R
uckstellung_), including general adjustments ( _e.g._ ,
_Pauschalwertberichtigungen_ ) or provisions were made therein for the
relevant risk category; 
---|---|--- 



     | (iii) | the Losses were actually recovered from a third party
(other than any of the Group Entities) or under an insurance policy in force
until the Closing Date (including in the event that such policy was not
maintained after the Closing Date); it being understood that Purchaser shall
(and shall cause the Group Entities to) apply all reasonable efforts to
recover Losses from third parties (including insurances) and that Purchaser
undertakes to (and to cause the Group Entities to) assign and transfer any
claims the Purchaser or the Group Entities may have against third parties
(including insurances) to the Seller, where Purchaser (or the Group Entities)
are compensated by the Seller for Losses; 
---|---|--- 



     | (iv) | the facts and circumstances underlying the Breach were
known by the Purchaser, the Guarantor or their representatives and
professional advisors as of the date hereof, provided that the Purchaser and
the Guarantor shall in any event be deemed to have knowledge of all matters

limitations set forth in this para. (iv) shall not apply to breaches of the
Sellers representation in Section 8.1.3; 
---|---|--- 



     | (v) | the Losses result from or are increased by the passing of,
or any change in, after the Closing Date, any law, statute, ordinance, rule,
regulation, common law rule or administrative practice of any government,
governmental department, agency or regulatory body including (without
prejudice to the generality of the foregoing) any increase in the rates of
Taxes or any imposition of Taxes or any withdrawal or relief from Taxes not

---|---|--- 



 

36   ![LOGO](g40729g04j18.jpg)



      | (vi) | the Losses were caused or increased by the Purchasers
failure to comply with the obligations under _Section 11.2_, unless the
Purchaser can prove that Seller was not prejudiced thereby. 
---|---|--- 



   11.2 | _Procedures_ 
---|--- 



   11.2.1 | _Breach Notice; Access to Information_. If the Purchaser or
any Group Entity becomes aware after the date hereof of any facts or
circumstances which indicate that there has been a Breach, the Purchaser
shall give the Seller written notice thereof promptly and no later than thirty
(30) Business Days following the discovery of such facts and circumstances
(the "Breach Notice"). The Breach Notice shall state in reasonable detail the
nature of the alleged Breach and, to the extent feasible, the amount of Losses
resulting therefrom. To the extent required by the Seller to assess the
alleged Breach and the resulting Losses, the Purchaser shall provide, and
shall cause the Group Entities to provide, to the Seller and its professional
advisors reasonable access during normal business hours to their relevant
books, records, assets, premises, employees and their management (as well
as copies of relevant documents and other information), without substantial
disruption of business operation. 
---|--- 



   11.2.2 | _Third-party Claims_. If the facts and circumstances which
indicate that a Breach has occurred include the receipt by the Purchaser or
any Group Entity of a (written or oral) notice from a third party (including
without limitation any court or governmental authority) stating (i) that such
third party may have a claim against a Group Entity or the Purchaser, or (ii)
that an audit or examination is being or will be conducted by any court or
governmental authority (each ((i) and (ii)) a "Third-Party Claim"), the
Purchaser shall, without prejudice to its obligations under _Section 11.2.1_,
provide, and shall cause the Group Entities to provide, to the Seller,
together with the Breach Notice or as soon as possible thereafter, copies of
all documents setting forth the Third-Party Claim, afford Seller the control
over the defense, fully cooperate with Seller in this respect (and cause the
Group Entities to do so as well) and keep Seller fully informed of the
developments. The Purchaser shall and shall cause the Group Entities to defend
or settle each Third-Party Claim upon the request and in accordance with the
instructions of the Seller or, if legally permitted and requested by the
Seller, the Purchaser shall give the Seller the opportunity to defend or
settle such claim, at the Sellers sole discretion. The Purchaser shall not
and shall cause the Group Entities not to acknowledge or settle the Third
Party Claim without the Sellers prior consent. 
---|--- 



   11.3 | _Limitations of Seller s Liability_ 
---|--- 



   11.3.1 |

_De Minimis Amount; Deductible Amount_. The Seller shall be liable for Losses

Minimis  

---|--- 



 

37   ![LOGO](g40729g04j18.jpg)



      |

 Amount") and the aggregate amount of all Losses resulting from individual
Breaches which have resulted in Losses above the De Minimis Amount exceeds EUR
15,000,000 (in words: Euro fifteen million) (the "Deductible Amount"), in
which case only the excess amount shall be recoverable ( _Freibetrag_ ). 

---|--- 



   11.3.2 | _Caps_. The Sellers aggregate liability for Breaches of all
Sellerss Representations, indemnities, covenants, representations,
provisions, agreements or undertakings of the Seller under this Agreement,
except for Breaches of the Sellers Representations in _Section 8.1_, shall
be limited to an aggregate amount equal to the Escrow Amount (the "General
Cap"). The Sellers aggregate liability for Breaches of all Sellers
Representations, indemnities, covenants, representations, provisions,
agreements or undertakings of the Seller under this Agreement, including for
Breaches of the Sellers Representations in _Section 8.1_, shall in any
event be limited to an aggregate amount of 100 % (in words: one hundred
percent) of the Purchase Price (the "Overall Cap"). 
---|--- 


   11.3.3 | _Limitation Period for Title Claims_. Claims of the Purchaser
which result from Breaches of the Sellers Representations in _Section 8.1_
shall become time-barred ( _verj ahren_) five (5) years following the Closing

---|--- 


   11.3.4 | _Lapse of Other Claims_. Any other claims of the Purchaser
under this Agreement (including for Breaches of all Sellerss Representations,

undertakings) which do not result from Breaches of the Sellers
Representations in _Section 8.1_, shall lapse ( _erl oschen_) at the end of
the Purchaser Notification Date (as defined below) except to the extent
raised in the Purchasers Notification (as defined below) and, if and to the
extent raised in the Purchasers Notification, shall lapse on the Decision
Date, except if and to the extent awarded in the Single Arbitrators award. 
---|--- 



   11.3.5 |

_Limited Recourse_. From and after the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall not
be entitled to pursue or seek any recoveries relating to the transaction or
in respect of claims pursuant to this Agreement for a Breach (save with
respect to any claims pursuant to _Section 8.1_) from any source other than
the Escrow Account (including without limitation not from any other assets of
Seller, its shareholders and their respective Affiliates) and under no
circumstances shall Purchaser pursue or seek any recoveries, individually or
in the aggregate, in excess of the Escrow Amount or following hundred and
twenty (120) days following the Closing Date; and, save with respect to any
claims pursuant to _Section 8.1_, the Purchaser hereby expressly and
irrevocably waives any right to do so; _provided_ , for the avoidance of
doubt, any claims pursuant to  _Section 8.1_ shall first be paid from the

particular for the payment of any amount owing in  

---|--- 



 

38   ![LOGO](g40729g04j18.jpg)



      |

 respect of this Agreement) against any officer, member, director, employee,
shareholder or incorporator of Seller, of its shareholders and their
respective Affiliates or their respective successors or assigns. No action
may be brought against any officer, member, director, employee, shareholder or
incorporator of Seller, of its shareholders or of their respective Affiliates
personally. The Purchaser acknowledges that Seller plans to liquidate,
dissolve and distribute all assets (including the Purchase Price) promptly
following the Closing Date and, in the absence of any claims pursuant to
_Section 8.1_, agrees to take no action that would impair, impede or delay
the foregoing. 

---|--- 



   11.4 | _Dispute Resolution - Fast Track Arbitration_ 
---|--- 

Any dispute, controversy or claim arising from or in connection with this
Agreement



     | (i) | whose subject matter are claims of the Purchaser against the
Seller for a Breach (other than claims of the Purchaser as a result of a
Breach of the Sellers Representation in _Section 8.1_, for which only
_Section 14.10_ shall apply) which are made or continue to be made by the
Purchaser after the Closing (irrespective of whether the underlying Breach
occurred during the time period prior to or after the Closing Date); _and/or_ 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | whose subject matter are claims of the Seller against the
Purchaser and/or the Guarantor (other than (1) claims of the Seller for
payment of all or a portion of the Purchase Price or (2) claims which result
from a breach of this Agreement by the Purchaser which occurred after Closing
Date, for which (1) and (2) only _Section 14.10 shall apply)_, which are
being made or continue to be made by the Seller after the Closing, 
---|---|--- 

shall be finally settled in a fast-track arbitration proceeding (the "Fast
Track Arbitration Proceeding") in accordance with the following provisions of
this _Section 11.4_ (instead of the provisions of _Section 14.10_) without
recourse to the ordinary courts of law.

 

It being clarified (i) that as long as the Closing has not occurred the
provisions of _Section 14.10_ shall apply (in particular for any claims of a
Party against the other Party relating to such other Partys failure to take
the Closing Actions, in particular for any claims for specific performance
such as payment of the Purchase Price plus interest), (ii) that for any
claims of the Purchaser against the Seller (other than claims of the Purchaser
as a result of a Breach of the Sellers Representation in _Section 8.1_, for
which _Section 14.10_ shall continue to apply) which may have been raised
prior to the Closing in a proceeding under the provisions of _Section 14.10_
the arbitral tribunal provided for under _Section 14.10 _shall, upon Closing,
cease to be competent for such claims and the Purchaser hereby withdraws such
claims, without prejudice to 



 

39   ![LOGO](g40729g04j18.jpg)



 

 Purchasers right to bring such claims thereafter in the Fast Track
Arbitration Proceeding and (iii) that Seller shall be under no obligation to
bring any claims for payment of the Purchase Price (and related interest) or
other claims in the Fast Track Arbitration Proceeding.

The place of arbitration for the Fast Track Arbitration Proceeding shall be
Frankfurt am Main/Germany. The language of the Fast Track Arbitration
Proceeding shall be English, provided, however, that written evidence may be
submitted in either the English or the German language. The Parties confirm
explicitly their knowledge of the content of Section 319 of the German Civil
Code (BGB) and mutually confirm that such provision shall not be applicable to
this Agreement.



   11.4.2 | _Single Arbitrator_. One of the persons listed on _Exhibit
11.4.2_ shall serve as single arbitrator ( _Einzelschiedsrichter;_ the
"Single Arbitrator") for purposes of the Fast Track Arbitration Proceeding.
Promptly following the date hereof the parties shall contact each of such
persons to confirm their willingness to serve as Single Arbitrator hereunder,
shall provide such persons with a copy of this Agreement and enter into a
customary engagement letter with such persons to so serve if so requested (not
to provide for a retainer in excess of EUR 20,000 (in words: Euro twenty
thousand) per person). Any such retainer shall be borne equally by the
parties. In the event that any such person cannot so confirm, the parties
shall promptly jointly select another renowned international arbitrator for
the list acting reasonably. 
---|--- 


   11.4.3 |

_Initiation of Fast Track Arbitration_. On or before the ninety-fifth (95th)
calendar day following the Closing Date (the "Purchaser Notification Date"),
the Purchaser shall notify the Seller, in a single writing and in reasonable
detail, of any claims for Breaches (the "Purchasers Notification"). Within
eight (8) calendar days thereafter, the Seller shall provide the Purchaser
with its preliminary view on each of the items raised in the Purchasers
Notification and with any claims it may have against the Purchaser or the
Guarantor relating to this Agreement that it chooses to bring under the
process set out in this Section (the "Sellers Notification"). Immediately
after delivery of the Sellers Notification, the Seller and the Purchaser
(and/or the Guarantor, as the case may be) shall negotiate in good faith to
attempt to resolve any disagreements with respect to items included in the
Purchasers Notification or the Sellers Notification. It is agreed and
understood that in no event shall either Party be entitled to delay under this
Section, including any delay in making the Single Arbitrator Submissions (as
defined below). Failing such a resolution, any disagreements shall be
definitively resolved by the Single Arbitrator, who shall be instructed to
render his or her decision by the specified date (the "Decision Date"), as
hereinafter set forth in this _Section 11.4_. No later than the second (2nd)
calendar day following Purchasers receipt of the Sellers Notification (
_i.e._ , no later than on the one hundred and fifth (105th) day following
the Closing Date), the Seller and the Purchaser (and/or the  

---|--- 



 

40   ![LOGO](g40729g04j18.jpg)



      |

 Guarantor, as the case may be) shall submit to the first person named in
_Exhibit 11.4.2_ , as the Single Arbitrator, their aggregate position on all
items raised in the Purchasers Notification or the Sellers Notification (
_i.e._ , a single number that represents the value of all such items),
together with any other documents reasonably relevant to the disputed items
that they would like to submit to the Single Arbitrator, in each case with a
copy (delivered not later than 9.00 a.m. (CET), on the following calendar day)
to the other Party and its lawyers (the "Single Arbitrator Submissions"). The
Single Arbitrator shall be instructed that the Decision Date shall be not
later than the one hundred nineteenth (119th) calendar day following the
Closing Date, _i.e._ that he or she must render his or her decision by no
later than 5 p.m.(CET), on such date. The Single Arbitrator upon rendering his
or her decision by the one hundred nineteenth (119th) calendar day after the
Closing Date shall be entitled to a success fee of EUR 150,000 (in words: Euro
one hundred fifty thousand), which shall be borne by the Parties on a _pro
rata_ basis in proportion to their respective degree of success or
unsuccessfulness in the Fast Track Arbitration Proceeding. The Single
Arbitrators shall be utilized in the order listed in _Exhibit 11.4.2_. In the
event that any person listed in _Exhibit 11.4.2_ is unable, unavailable or
unprepared to act as the Single Arbitrator when designated to do so pursuant
to the foregoing, such person shall not be so designated and instead the next
person on _Exhibit 11.4.2_ shall on the same day be designated as the Single
Arbitrator. The Parties shall be precluded from, and hereby waive any right
to, directly or indirectly, delay or extend, or seek to delay or extend, the
timeframe for the above described process for any reason including grounds of
unfairness, insufficient time or insufficient record. The Purchaser shall and
shall cause the Group Companies to provide the Seller and its professional
advisers access to all information (including personnel) that may be relevant
for the Seller under the Fast Track Arbitration, upon reasonable request, at
all times following the Closing Date. For the avoidance of doubt, under no
circumstances shall the above process extend beyond the one hundred nineteenth
(119th) calendar day following the Closing Date. The above provisions shall
apply mutatis mutandis to any claims that the Seller raises against the
Purchaser which are subject to the Fast Track Procedure. 

---|--- 



   11.4.4 |

_Single Arbitrator s Rights_. The Single Arbitrator shall be permitted to
assess all relevant facts and circumstances with respect to a dispute
properly submitted to him or her and the Parties shall, and shall cause the
Group Companies, to comply with all requests for personnel and documents by
the Single Arbitrator. The Single Arbitrator may use whatever process
including submissions from or appearances by the Parties (or others, to the
extent possible) as the Single Arbitrator requires, but shall afford the
Parties the opportunity to state their positions in at least one oral hearing.
If and to the extent legal (or accounting) issues are in dispute or are
otherwise relevant in the judgment of the Single Arbitrator, the Single
Arbitrator may consult with a lawyer or law firm (or accountant or accounting
firm) in Germany (as well as, if the  

---|--- 



 

41   ![LOGO](g40729g04j18.jpg)



      |

 Single Arbitrator deems appropriate, in Luxembourg or the United States),
all of whom shall be independent of the Parties. However, in rendering its
decision and any award with respect to any item, the Single Arbitrator shall
only be permitted to choose between the Sellers and the Purchasers
respective single amounts set forth in the Single Arbitrator Submissions, and
shall not be permitted to render a decision that does not conform in all
respects with either Sellers or Purchasers respective amounts sought, except
in case where the Single Arbitrator concludes in his sole discretion that such
outcome would be contrary to fundamental principles of justice and fairness
and would constitute an unreasonable hardship ( _Unzumutbarkeit_ ) for either
Party. 

---|--- 



   11.4.5 | _Costs and Penalty_. The cost of involving the Single
Arbitrators, including any costs incurred by the Single Arbitrators pursuant
to _Section 11.4.4_, shall be paid by the loser of the Fast Track
Arbitration Proceeding. The loser of the Fast Track Arbitration proceeding
shall pay to the other Party a penalty (as a discouragement to bring losing
claims) equal to 50% of the difference between the amounts sought in the
Parties Single Arbitrator Submissions. The loser of the Fast Track
Arbitration shall (i) be the Party whose claim is not awarded, or (ii), in
case of an award that does not simply choose between the single amounts set
forth in the Single Arbitrator Submissions, the Party whose relative portion
of success is lower than the portion of success of the other Party. 
---|--- 



   11.4.6 | _Payments_. Any amounts payable to the Seller as a result of
the Fast Track Arbitration Proceeding set forth in this _Section 11.4_ shall
be paid upon order by the Single Arbitrator within two (2) Business Days of
the relevant final determination in the manner set forth in _Section 5_. Any
amounts due to Purchaser as a result of the award under this _Section 11.4_
shall only be payable to Purchaser from the Escrow Account. 
---|--- 



   11.5 | _No Additional Rights or Remedies_ 
---|--- 

The remedies which the Purchaser and the Guarantor may have against the Seller
for breach of any obligations set forth in this Agreement (including for
Breaches of Sellerss Representations, indemnities covenants, agreements or
undertakings) shall solely be governed by this Agreement and shall be the
exclusive remedies available to the Purchaser and the Guarantor. To the extent
permitted by law, any claims and remedies other than those explicitly
provided for in this Agreement, regardless of their nature, amount or legal
basis, are hereby expressly waived and excluded.

Without limiting the generality of the preceding sentence, any right of the
Purchaser and/or the Guarantor to lower the Purchase Price ( _Minderung_ ), to
withdraw ( _R ucktritt_) from this Agreement or to require the winding up of
the transaction contemplated hereunder on any other legal basis ( _e.g.,_ by
way of _gro ßer Schadenersatz_), any claims for breach of pre-contractual
obligations ( _culpa in contrahendo_ ), or ancillary 



 

42   ![LOGO](g40729g04j18.jpg)



 

 obligations ( _positive Forderungsverletzung_ ) are hereby expressly
excluded and waived by Purchaser and Purchasers Guarantor. The provisions of
this _Section 11.5_ shall not apply to any rights and remedies for willful
deceit ( _arglistige T auschung_) or willful misconduct ( _Vorsatz_ ) by the
Seller; for the avoidance of any actions of persons acting or declarations
made by advisers (including  _Erf ullungsgehilfen_) of the Seller shall not
be attributed to the Seller.

Section 12

Purchasers Covenants and Indemnities; Access to Information; Cooperation



   12.1 | _Payoff of Indebtedness_ 
---|--- 

The Purchaser undertakes to satisfy or to enable the Group Entities to satisfy
and ensure that they satisfy all obligations for indebtedness which become due
on or after the Closing Date (including, without limitation, as a result of
the change of control in the Group Entities resulting from the consummation
of the transactions hereunder), set forth in _Exhibit 12.1_.



   12.2 | _Release and Indemnities_ 
---|--- 



   12.2.1 | _Release from Commitments_. The Purchaser shall cause that,
from the Closing Date, all members of the Sellers Group are unconditionally,
finally and irrevocably released from any indemnities, suretyships, comfort
letters, guarantees or other commitments they may have given or made for the
benefit of any Group Entity as a security for or the Group Entities
liabilities (the "Sellers Commitments" and each a "Sellers Commitment"). If
and to the extent that the Purchaser and the Seller, despite having used their
best efforts, are unable to effect a full release of a member of the Sellers
Group under a Sellers Commitment including, without limitation, due to the
fact that the contract partner is unwilling to agree to a substitution by the
Purchaser or an Affiliate of the Purchaser, then the Purchaser on the one
hand and the Seller or its Affiliate on the other hand shall place each other
in a position they would be in if the Sellers Commitment had been transferred
to the Purchaser on the Closing Date. The Purchaser shall, in this event,
indemnify and hold harmless ( _freistellen_ ) the Seller and its Affiliates
from all obligations and liabilities under or resulting from such Sellers
Commitments and shall provide the Seller on the Closing Date with an
unconditional and irrevocable on first demand bank guarantee ( _Bankgarantie
auf erstes Anfordern_ ) in the amount of the aggregate amount of the
liabilities secured by those Sellers Commitments for which no release could
be obtained as security for such indemnification obligation. 
---|--- 



   12.2.2 |

_Further Indemnity_. Without prejudice to any other indemnification obligation
of the Seller and the Purchaser contained in this Agreement, the Purchaser
shall further indemnify and hold harmless the Seller, its shareholders and
their respective Affiliates  

---|--- 



 

43   ![LOGO](g40729g04j18.jpg)



      |

 (and their respective managers, officers, employees, board members and
shareholders) from any liability _vis- a-vis_ any Group Entity or third party
relating to the Sellers its shareholders or its Affiliates direct or
indirect shareholding or interest in, or any action taken as shareholder,
partner, managing director or employee of, any such Group Entity prior to the
Closing Date. 

---|--- 
 



   12.3 | _Access to Information_ 
---|--- 



   12.3.1 | _Access_. From the Closing Date, the Purchaser will afford to
the Seller and its advisors, legal counsel and representatives reasonable
access, upon reasonable advance notice and without substantial disruption of
business operations, to books and records (including copies thereof), as well
as to other information, management, employees and auditors of the Group
Entities as long as and to the extent necessary or useful to the Seller in
connection with any audit, investigation, dispute, or litigation or any other
reasonable business purpose of the Seller, against reimbursement of external
costs reasonably incurred by the Purchaser in connection therewith. 
---|--- 



   12.3.2 | _Maintenance_. The Purchaser shall cause the Group Entities
to keep all books and records relating to any period prior to the Closing Date
for the periods provided for under applicable mandatory law. The Purchaser
shall cause the Group Entities to give the Seller reasonable advance notice
prior to destroying any books and records relating to matters which may be
relevant with respect to an indemnification obligation of the Seller under
this Agreement and, if the Seller so requests, to deliver such books and
records to the Seller at the Sellers expense. These provisions shall apply
_mutatis mutandis_ should the Purchaser intend to dispose of a Group Entity. 
---|--- 



   12.4 | _Cooperation_ 
---|--- 



   12.4.1 | _Execution of Documents_. The Purchaser agrees to execute, or
cause to be executed, at the Sellers request, all agreements and documents
and to take, or cause to be taken, all other actions necessary under
applicable laws and regulations to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, unless the execution of such agreements and documents or the
taking of such actions would cause an unreasonable hardship (
_Unzumutbarkeit_ ) to the Purchaser. 
---|--- 



   12.4.2 | _No Interferences_. The Purchaser shall not, and shall cause
its Affiliates not to, enter into any transaction, which may prevent, delay or
interfere with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. 
---|--- 



   12.4.3 |

_Debt Financing Cooperation_. Prior to the Closing Date, the Seller agrees to
use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Group Entities (and members of
their senior management) to provide to the Purchaser and its financing sources
such cooperation reasonably requested by Purchaser in connection with the Debt
Financing, including:  

---|--- 



 

44   ![LOGO](g40729g04j18.jpg)



      |

 (1) participation by senior management of the Group Entities in investor
meetings, road shows, due diligence sessions and rating agencies meetings
customary and necessary or advisable for the consummation of the Debt
Financing on the terms described in the Debt Financing Documents on reasonable
advance notice to the extent practicable, (2) assistance with the preparation
of offering and marketing documents and materials reasonably required in
connection with the Debt Financing (including materials for rating agency,
lender and investor presentations), and (3) using their reasonable best
efforts to obtain customary accountants comfort letters and
accountants consents from the Companys (or any other member of the Group
Entities) independent auditors, and to have officers of the Company (and any
applicable other members of the Group Entities) execute, without personal
liability, officers certificates or management representation letters to the

   14.8.1 | _Exhibits_. All Exhibits to this Agreement constitute an
integral part of this Agreement. 
---|--- 


   14.8.2 | _Language_. This Agreement is written in the English language

translation has been added shall be interpreted within the meaning assigned

    14.8.3 | _Exchange Rate_. For purposes of any thresholds, any

following the date hereof. 
---|--- 
 



   14.8.4 | _Disclosure_. The disclosure of any matter in this Agreement
(including all Exhibits hereto) shall be deemed to be a disclosure for all
purposes of this Agreement. The fact that a matter has been disclosed in an
Exhibit shall not be used to construe the extent to which disclosure is
required pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement. 
---|--- 


   14.8.5 | _Usage_. The term "including" shall mean "including without
limitation" whenever used. 
---|---

United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods
(CISG). 



   14.10 | _Jurisdiction_ 
---|--- 

Without prejudice to the provisions of _Section 11.4_ (Fast Track Arbitration
Proceeding), which if applicable shall prevail and supersede the following,
the Parties agree as follows:

Any dispute, controversy or claim arising from or in connection with this
Agreement or its validity shall be finally settled by three arbitrators in
accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the German Institution of Arbitration
e.V. ( _DIS_ ) being in force at the time of the commencement of the
arbitration proceedings without recourse to the ordinary courts of law. The
place of arbitration shall be Frankfurt am Main. The language of the arbitral
proceedings shall be English, provided, however, that written evidence may be
submitted in either the English or the German language. In the event that
mandatory applicable law requires any dispute, controversy or claim arising
from or in connection with this Agreement or its validity to be decided upon
by an ordinary court of law, the competent courts in Frankfurt am Main shall
have the exclusive jurisdiction.

 



 

51   ![LOGO](g40729g04j18.jpg)



    14.11 | _Severability_ 
---|--- 

Should any provision of this Agreement be or become, or be deemed to be or
become, invalid or unenforceable as a whole or in part, the validity and
enforceability of the remaining provisions shall not be affected thereby. Any
such invalid or unenforceable provision shall, to the extent permitted by
law, be deemed replaced by such valid and enforceable provision as comes
closest to the economic intent and purpose of such invalid or unenforceable
provision. The same shall apply in the event that this Agreement contains any
gaps ( _Vertragsl ucken_). The Parties are aware of the decision of the
Federal Supreme Court ( _Bundesgerichtshof_ ) of September 24, 2002. However,
it is the express intent of the Parties that this _Section 14.11_ shall not
be construed as a mere reversal of the burden of proof ( _Beweislastumkehr_ )
but rather as a contractual exclusion of Section 139 of the German Civil Code
( _BGB_ ) in its entirety.
