the Transfer Agreement will not be imputed to the Seller. To Seller's 
knowledge, Seller has received no written notices, orders, demands or other

disclosed on **_Exhibit  G_**   attached  hereto and made a part hereof,

over any aspect of the Facilities or over the operation thereof) necessary 
for  the use, operation and maintenance of the applicable Facility and the
conduct  of  Seller's business therein other than those the failure to have
obtained or  maintain could not reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect.  Seller has obtained and to Seller's knowledge, is in good
standing with respect  to any and all material Provider Agreements under
which the Seller and/or  the  applicable Facility is entitled to receive
payment or reimbursement under  Medicare, Medicaid or any Third Party Payor
Programs.

knowledge, there are no current, pending or outstanding Medicaid,  Medicare
or other Third Party Payor Programs' audits or appeals pending at the 
Facilities other than those, if any, identified on **Exhibit  H** ,

Seller shall have no  responsibility or liability, the same to be assumed by
the Tenant.

be  held liable under applicable law, or the Property, or any part of it,
could  be  subject to liens or claims, with respect to any period on or
prior to the  Closing Date, under applicable law.

 

 

**5.10.** **Material  Adverse Effect.**   The  words " **Material  Adverse
Effect** "  when  utilized in this _Section  5_   shall  mean only a
material adverse effect with respect to the physical condition  of  the
Facilities  that is  caused  by conditions beyond Seller's control
including, but not limited to Acts of God,  wars, insurrections and/or any
other cause beyond the reasonable control  of the  party whose performance
is affected, taken as a whole, that exceeds Five  Million  Dollars
($5,000,000.00) in aggregate damage that is not covered by any  applicable
insurance, exclusive of any applicable insurance deductible. 

 

 

**5.11.** **Indemnification**.  Seller  hereby agrees and does indemnify and
hold the Buyer and Tenant harmless from  and  against any and all losses,
damages, claims, causes of action, judgments,  costs  and expenses
(including, reasonable fees of attorneys) (collectively, " **Losses** ") 
that  may be suffered or incurred by or asserted or awarded against Buyer
arising  out  of any breach by Seller of any representations and warranties
of Seller  contained in this Agreement. The aggregate liability of the Seller
to the  Buyer  or Tenant for indemnification under this Agreement shall be
limited to an  amount  equal to $5,000,000 (the " **Cap** ").  The  Buyer
shall take all reasonable steps to mitigate all liabilities and claims, 
including availing itself as reasonably directed by Seller of any defenses, 
limitations, rights of contribution, claims against third parties and other 
rights at law, and shall provide such evidence and documentation of the
nature  and extent of any liability as may be reasonably requested by the
Seller.  The  Buyer and Tenant shall act in a commercially reasonable manner
in addressing  any  liabilities that may provide the basis for an
indemnifiable claim and shall  respond to such liability in the same manner
that it would respond to such  liability in the absence of the
indemnification provided for in this Agreement.  Any request for
indemnification of specific costs shall include invoices  and  supporting
documents containing reasonably detailed information about the  Losses  for
which indemnification is being sought. All payments made pursuant to  this 
_Section  5.12_   shall be  treated as adjustments to the Purchase Price
for the Facilities for income  tax  purposes.

 

 

Notwithstanding  the foregoing, Buyer shall not be entitled to
indemnification for any Losses  until the aggregate amount of all Losses
exceeds One Hundred Thousand Dollars  ($100,000), and then only to the extent
such Losses exceed $100,000. Moreover,  a  claim for indemnification shall
only valid to the extent delivered from Buyer  to  Seller within twelve (12)
months of the Closing Date. Seller shall defend  any  claims for which Buyer
might be entitled to indemnification under this Agreement  with counsel
selected by Seller and reasonably acceptable to Buyer and any  out  of
pocket expenses incurred by Seller in so defending shall be charged against 
the Cap and will be deemed to be Losses for which Buyer has received
indemnity.  Buyer will not settle any claim for which Buyer is or may be
entitled to  indemnity hereunder, without Seller's prior consent so long as
the Seller  performs its indemnification and defense obligations with respect
to such  claims. Seller has the right to settle any such claim in its sole
discretion  so  long as such settlement imposes no burdens, limitations or
obligations on  Buyer,  and Buyer agrees to reasonably cooperate and assist
Seller with any such  defense  or settlement discussions or arrangements.

and warrants to Seller that the following matters are true as  of the

real estate taxes and assessments currently due and payable  for the
Facilities in Cuyahoga County for the period of January 1, 2005 thru  June
30, 2005 shall be paid by the Seller at the Closing. To the extent that 
the  Seller and the Wind Down Agent do not pro-rate or otherwise address
such  items  pursuant to the Assignment Agreement, the  following shall be
prorated and adjusted between Seller and the Buyer as  of the  Closing Date,
except as otherwise specified:

 

 

**12.1.** **Revenues  and Expenses**.  Except  as  otherwise provided in
the Assignment Agreement, all  revenues  (including, but  not  limited to,
payments due from the residents of the Facilities or under the  Provider
Agreements) and expenses related to the operation of the Facilities  shall be
prorated as of the Closing Date, with Seller entitled to such revenues  and
responsible for such expenses arising out of the operation of the Facilities 
for periods prior to the Closing Date, and Tenant, as the case may be, shall 
be  entitled to the revenues and responsible for the expenses arising out
of  its  operation of the Facilities on and after the Closing Date.

 

 

**12.2.** **Utilities**.  Water,  electricity, sewer, gas, telephone and
other utility charges not paid directly  by the Seller, if any, based, to the
extent practicable, on final meter readings  and final invoices.

 

 

**12.3.** **Taxes**.  All  accrued general real estate, personal property
and ad valorem taxes for the  current year (January 1, 2005 through December
31, 2005) applicable to the  Property shall be prorated on an accrual basis
with the Seller responsible  for  each day of the year prior to Closing and
with the Buyer responsible for  each  day of the year on and after Closing.
As the tax bills for the current year  may  not be issued (in whole or in
part, i.e. partial period tax bills may be  issued)  until 2006, such taxes
shall be prorated for the Property for the period  of  January 1, 2004
through December 31, 2004. Prior to or at Closing, Seller  shall  pay or
have paid all tax bills that are due and payable prior to or on the  Closing
Date and shall furnish evidence of such payment to Buyer and the  Title 
Company.

 

 

**12.4.** **Assessments**.  All  assessments, general or special, shall be
prorated as of the Closing Date,  with  Seller being responsible for any
installments of assessments which are due  prior  to the Closing Date and
Buyer being responsible for any installments of  assessments which are due on
or after the Closing Date.

 

 

**12.5.** **Bed  Taxes**.  All bed  taxes due under Ohio Revised Code §§
3721.50 - 3721.99 or provider franchise  fees for the current year applicable
to the Facilities shall be prorated  on an  accrual basis utilizing actual
final tax bills, if available, with the Seller  responsible for each day of
the year prior to the Closing and with the Buyer  responsible for each day of
the year on and after the Closing. If such tax  bills  are not available,
such taxes shall be prorated on the basis of the most  currently available
tax bills for the Facilities. Prior to or at Closing,  Seller  have paid all
such tax bills that are due or will pay any amount accrued  as of  that date
to the Buyer, by means of a credit against the Purchase Price due  at 
Closing.

 

 

**12.6.** **General  Proration Provisions.** For  purposes of calculating
prorations, the Buyer at its direction and election  or  Tenant shall be
deemed to be in title to the Property, and therefore entitled  to  the
income therefrom and responsible for the expenses thereof, for the entire 
day upon which the Closing occurs. All such prorations shall be made on the 
basis of the actual number of days of the year and month that shall have 
elapsed  as of the Closing Date. The amount of such prorations shall be
adjusted in  cash  after Closing, as and when complete and accurate
information becomes available.  Seller and the Buyer agree to cooperate and
use their good faith and diligent  efforts to make such adjustments no later
than thirty (30) days after the  Closing, or as soon as is reasonably
practicable if and to the extent that  the  required final proration
information is not available within such thirty  (30)  day period. Items of
income and expense for the period prior to the Closing  Date  will be for
the account of Seller and items of income and expense for the  period  on
and after the Closing Date will be for the account of the Buyer or its 
designee, all as determined by the accrual method of accounting. Bills
received  after Closing that relate to expenses incurred, services performed
or other  amounts allocable to the period prior to the Closing Date shall be
paid by  Seller. The obligations of the parties pursuant to this _Section 
12_   shall  survive the Closing and shall not merge into any documents of
conveyance  delivered at Closing.

 

 

**13.**   Intentionally omitted.

 

 

**14.** **Casualty  and Condemnation.**

 

 

**14.1.** **Casualty. ** If  prior  to the Closing one or more of the
Facilities shall be damaged by fire or  other  casualty, then Buyer shall
take the Property as it is and Seller hereby assigns  all insurance proceeds
(including casualty and business interruption insurance),  or the right to
receive the same, and the rights to any other claims arising  as  a result
of the damage.

 

 

**14.2.** **Condemnation**.

 

 

**A.** Intentionally  omitted.

 

 

**B.** If  prior  to the Closing (a) less than substantially all of a
Facility shall be taken  by  condemnation or eminent domain, (b) there is
any material taking of land  lying  in the bed of any street or highway,
open or proposed, in front of or adjoining  all or any part of the Land, or
(c) there is any change of grade or closing  of  any such street or highway
abutting or adjacent to the Land, that in any  such  case would materially
impair access to and from the Land or otherwise materially  interfere with
its occupancy and use as a skilled nursing facility, then  the  Buyer
shall  be  entitled to no abatement of the Purchase Price by reason of such
taking,  change  of grade, or closing, and the proceeds of, or right to any
proceeds of, any  award or payment in respect of such taking, change of
grade, or closing are  hereby assigned to the Buyer at the Closing.

 

 

**15.** **_Closing  Expenses_**.  Seller  will pay at Closing, all closing
costs and expenses, pertaining to the release  of the indebtedness described
on **_Exhibit  I_** **** and  of  any mortgages, security interests or
liens on the Property, including any  fees  or premiums of any nature,
associated with prepayment of that indebtedness,  the  cost of an 
owner's  title  insurance policy to be issued to Buyer at Closing with
respect to the Property  (excluding the cost of any endorsements thereto that
may be requested by  Buyer),  the fees of Seller's attorneys, and one-half
(1/2) of any documentary and state,  county and municipal transfer taxes
relating to the instruments of conveyance  contemplated herein and any
escrows hereunder. In turn, the Buyer will be  responsible for, and will pay
at or prior to Closing, all closing costs and  expenses related to its due
diligence including, without limitation, the  cost of  any surveys or
environmental site assessments procured by Buyer in connection  with its due
diligence, the fees of Buyer's attorneys, the cost of procuring any 
endorsements to its owner's  title  guaranty  insurance policy  , the 
cost of any title insurance policy to be issued to any lender providing 
financing for the Buyer's acquisition of the Property, and all other costs
and  expenses associated with procuring such financing and one-half (1/2) of
any  documentary and state, county and municipal transfer taxes relating to
the  instruments of conveyance contemplated herein and any escrows
hereunder.  The  Buyer and Seller will each pay one-half (½) of any closing
or escrow fee that  may be charged by the Escrow Agent.

 

 

**16.** **_Successors  and Assigns_**. **** The  terms, conditions and
covenants of this Agreement shall be binding upon and  shall inure to the
benefit of the parties and their respective nominees,  successors,
beneficiaries and assigns.

the contrary, the obligations of the parties  under _Sections _ _5,  6, 
11, 12,_ _20,  22.8,_ _and _ _22.9_   shall  survive Closing and the
delivery of any conveyance documentation for a period  of  one (1) year; and
the provisions of _Sections  4.1, 20 and 22.8_   shall  survive any
termination of this Agreement for a period of one (1) year. This  Agreement

agreements, understandings, letters of intent and proposals, in each  case

be  waived, modified, amended, discharged or terminated except by an

such waiver,  modification, amendment, discharge or termination is sought,
and then only  to  the extent set forth in such instrument.

means  any state or federal holiday for which financial institutions or post
offices  are generally closed for observance thereof in the State of Ohio.

sections in this Agreement are for convenience only,  and  are not to be

into this Agreement and it is of  no  further use, effect or value
whatsoever.

 

 

**22.8.** **Confidential  Information**.  The  parties acknowledge that the
transaction described herein and any information  obtained by Buyer or its

except to Permitted Outside Parties or as required by law. In  connection
with the negotiation of this Agreement and the preparation for  the 
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, each party
acknowledges  that it will have access to confidential information relating
to the other  party. Each party shall treat such information as confidential,
preserve  the  confidentiality thereof, and not duplicate or use such
information, except  deliveries to Permitted Outside Parties in connection
with the transactions  contemplated hereby. In the event of the termination
of this Agreement for  any  reason whatsoever, Buyer shall return to Seller,

foregoing, the Seller acknowledges  that  the Buyer has informed the Seller

announce the entry of the Buyer into this Agreement  and to file this
Agreement, together with a description thereof, with the  Securities and

parties  hereby waive any right they may have to transfer or change the venue
of any  litigation brought in accordance herewith.

 

 

**22.10.** **Waiver  of Trial by Jury**.  The  parties hereto knowingly,
voluntarily and intentionally waive (to the fullest  extent permitted by
