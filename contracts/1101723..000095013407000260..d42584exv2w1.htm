number of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding or issuable upon the conversion, exchange or

enter into a paying agent agreement, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Company,
with such Paying Agent to act as agent for the payment of the Merger Consideration in respect of
Certificates upon surrender of such Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof)

specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass,
only upon proper delivery of the Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to
the Paying Agent, and shall otherwise be in a form and have such other provisions as the Surviving

terms and conditions as the Paying Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in
accordance with normal exchange practices. If payment is to be remitted to a Person other than the
Person in whose name the Certificate surrendered for payment is registered, it shall be a condition

date of this Agreement, the Debt Commitment Letter, in the form so delivered, is in full force and
effect and is a legal, valid and binding obligation of Acquisition and, to the knowledge of Parent,
the other parties thereto. As of the date of this Agreement, no event has occurred which, with or
without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a default or breach on the part of Parent
under any term or condition of the Equity Commitment Letters and neither Parent nor Acquisition has
any reason to believe that it will be unable to satisfy by the Termination Date any term or
condition of closing to be satisfied by it contained in the Equity Commitment Letters. As of the
date of this Agreement, no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both,
would constitute a default or breach on the part of Acquisition under any term or condition of the
Debt Commitment Letters. As of the date of this Agreement, neither Parent nor Acquisition has any
reason to believe that it will be unable to satisfy on a timely basis any term or condition of
closing to be satisfied by it contained in the Debt Commitment Letters. There are no conditions
precedent or other contingencies related to the funding of the full amount of the Financing other
than as set forth in the Financing Letters. Parent has fully paid any and all commitment fees or
other fees incurred in connection with the Financing Letters that have become due and payable.
Subject to its terms and conditions, the Financing, when funded in accordance with the Financing
Letters, will provide funds at the Closing and at the Effective Time sufficient to consummate the
Merger upon the terms contemplated by this Agreement
 and to pay all related fees and expenses
associated therewith, including payment of all amounts under Article&nbsp;II of this Agreement and any
fees and expenses payable under the Equity Commitment Letters.

that the representations and warranties of the Company contained in this Agreement (and the bring
down thereof in any certificate delivered by the Company pursuant to Section&nbsp;6.2(a)) are true and

Adverse Effect or similar qualifier), and after giving effect to all of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the Financing, any Alternative Financing, the payment of
the aggregate Merger Consideration, any repayment or refinancing of debt contemplated in the Debt
Financing Letters and payment of all related fees and expenses, each of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation will be Solvent (as hereinafter defined). For the purposes of this Section&nbsp;3.2(i), the
term &#147;<U>Solvent</U>&#148; when used with respect to any Person, means that, as of any date of

applicable federal laws governing determinations of the insolvency of debtors, and (y)&nbsp;the amount
that will be required to pay the probable liabilities of such Person on its existing debts
(including contingent liabilities) as such debts become absolute and matured, (b)&nbsp;such Person will
not have, as of such date, an unreasonably small amount of capital for the operation of the
businesses in which it is engaged or proposed to be engaged following such date, and (c)&nbsp;such
Person will be able to pay its liabilities, including contingent and other liabilities, as they

operation of the businesses in which it is engaged or proposed to be engaged&#148; and &#147;able to pay its
liabilities, including contingent and other liabilities, as they mature&#148; means that such Person

hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, between the parties hereto with respect to the subject
matter hereof (other than the confidentiality and nondisclosure provisions of the Confidentiality
Agreement which shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement). This Agreement shall
be binding upon and inure to the benefit of each party hereto and to their respective successors
and permitted assigns, and, except as provided in Sections&nbsp;5.3(b), 5.3(d), 5.3(f) and 5.5, nothing
in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any
other right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.

written agreement of Parent, Acquisition and the Company at any time prior to the Effective Time

Stockholder Approval is obtained, no term or condition contained in this Agreement shall be amended
or modified in any manner that by Law requires further approval by the stockholders of the Company
without so obtaining such further stockholder approval.

extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts required hereby, (b)
waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained herein or in any document
delivered pursuant hereto and (c)&nbsp;waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions
contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall

any party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof
nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or
the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The rights and remedies herein provided shall
be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by Law.

complete subject matter jurisdiction, any other court of the State of Delaware or the United States

venue of any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the
negotiation or performance hereof in the Delaware Court of Chancery or, if such court does not have

illegal or incapable of being enforced, all other terms and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as neither the economic nor legal substance of
the transactions contemplated herein is affected in any manner materially adverse to any party
hereto. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable
of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as
to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable
