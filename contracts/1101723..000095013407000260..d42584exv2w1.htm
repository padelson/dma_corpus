RECITALS 

   

 WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of each of Parent, Acquisition and the Company (in the case of the Company acting on the recommendation of a special committee (the " _Special Committee_ ") formed for the purpose of representing the Company in connection with the possible transactions contemplated hereby) has deemed it advisable and in the best interests of their respective stockholders for Acquisition to merge with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ ") pursuant to Section 251 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the " _DGCL_ ") upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein; 

  

 WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of each of Parent, Acquisition and the Company has each adopted resolutions approving and declaring advisable this Agreement, the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; 

  

 WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, and as a condition to the willingness of the Company to enter into this Agreement, Welsh, Carson, Anderson and Stowe X, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (" _WCAS_ "), has provided the Company with an executed copy of its limited guarantee (the " _Guarantee_ "); and 

  

 WHEREAS, Parent, Acquisition and the Company desire to make certain representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe various conditions to the Merger. 

  

AGREEMENT 

   

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements herein contained, the parties hereto, intending to be legally bound, hereby agree as follows: 

  

ARTICLE I 

   

THE MERGER  

  

 1.1. _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the DGCL, Acquisition shall be merged with and into the Company at the Effective Time (as hereinafter defined). At the Effective Time, the separate corporate existence of Acquisition shall cease and the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation under the name "United Surgical Partners International, Inc." (the " _Surviving Corporation_ ") and shall succeed to and assume all of the rights and obligations of the Company and Acquisition in accordance with the DGCL. 

   ##### 

  

  

 1.2. _Closing_. Unless this Agreement shall have been terminated and the Merger shall have been abandoned pursuant to Section 7.1, the consummation of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place as promptly as practical following the satisfaction or waiver (subject to applicable Law (as hereinafter defined)) of all of the conditions (other than those conditions which by their nature are to be satisfied at Closing, but subject to the fulfillment or waiver of those conditions at Closing) set forth in Article VI (and, in any event, not more than two business days following the satisfaction or waiver of all such conditions), at the offices of Ropes and Gray LLP, 45 Rockefeller Plaza, New York, New York 10111, unless another date, time or place is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VI, none of the parties hereto shall be required to close prior to the earlier of (i) a date during the Marketing Period (as hereinafter defined) specified by Parent on no less than three business days notice to the Company, (ii) the final day of the Marketing Period and (iii) the Termination Date. The date on which the Closing actually occurs is hereinafter referred to as the " _Closing Date_ ". 

  

 1.3. _Effective Time of the Merger_. At Closing, the parties hereto shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing a certificate of merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware as provided in the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective upon such filing or at such time thereafter as Parent, Acquisition and the Company shall agree and specify in the Certificate of Merger (the " _Effective Time_ "). 

  

 1.4. _Effects of the Merger_. 

  

 (a) The Merger shall have the effects set forth in this Agreement, the Certificate of Merger and the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all property, rights, privileges, immunities, powers, franchises, licenses and authorities of the Company and Acquisition shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities, obligations, restrictions and duties of each of the Company and Acquisition shall become the debts, liabilities, obligations, restrictions and duties of the Surviving Corporation. 

   

 (b) The directors of Acquisition and the officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, from and after the Effective Time, be the initial directors and officers, respectively, of the Surviving Corporation until their successors have been duly elected or appointed and qualified, or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the Surviving Corporations certificate of incorporation and bylaws. 

   

 (c) At the Effective Time, (i) the Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company shall be amended in its entirety to be the same as the Certificate of Incorporation of Acquisition as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that the name of the Surviving Corporation shall be United Surgical Partners International, Inc., the provision in the Certificate of Incorporation of Acquisition naming its incorporator shall be omitted and the provisions relating to the Companys registered agent and indemnification and advancement of expenses and exculpation from liability in the Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation shall be unchanged from that in effect as of the date hereof, and, as so amended, shall be the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation following the Effective Time until thereafter amended in accordance with its terms and the DGCL, and (ii) the Amended and Restated Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended so as to read in their entirety as the Bylaws of Acquisition as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time,   ##### 

  

  

  

except that the references to Acquisitions name shall be replaced by
references to United Surgical Partners International, Inc., and, as so
amended, shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation following the
Effective Time until thereafter amended in accordance with its terms,
the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation and the DGCL. 

   

ARTICLE II 

   

EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE OUTSTANDING SECURITIES 
 OF THE COMPANY AND ACQUISITION; EXCHANGE PROCEDURES  

  

 2.1. _Effect on Capital Stock_. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Acquisition, the holder of any shares of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of the Company (the " _Company Common Stock_ "), the holder of any shares of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of Parent, or the holder of any shares of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of Acquisition (" _Acquisition Common Stock_ "): 

  

 (a) _Common Stock of Acquisition_. Each share of Acquisition Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation. 

   

 (b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Company Common Stock Owned by Parent or Acquisition_. Each share of Company Common Stock that is owned by Parent or Acquisition or held in the treasury of the Company (collectively, the " _Excluded Shares_ "), shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no cash or other consideration shall be delivered or deliverable in exchange therefor. For the avoidance of doubt, Excluded Shares shall not include any shares of Company Common Stock held in a rabbi trust for the benefit of any Company Plan (as hereinafter defined) (the " _Rabbi Trust Shares_ "). 

   

 (c) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time other than Excluded Shares and Dissenting Shares (as hereinafter defined) shall be canceled and converted into the right to receive in cash an amount equal to $31.05 (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). 

   

 (d) _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by a holder who was entitled to and has validly demanded appraisal rights in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (" _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration unless and until such holder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such holders appraisal rights under the DGCL, but instead shall be converted into the right to receive payment from the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the DGCL. If any such holder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such appraisal right pursuant to the DGCL, each Dissenting Share of such holder shall be treated as a share of Company Common Stock that had been converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 2.1(c). The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of any demands, attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL received by the Company for appraisal of shares of Company Common Stock, and Parent shall have the right to participate in and direct all   ##### 

  

  

  

negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. The Company shall
not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with
respect to, settle, offer to settle, or approve any withdrawal of any such
demands. 

   

 (e) _Cancellation and Retirement of Company Common Stock_. As of the Effective Time, all shares of Company Common Stock (other than Dissenting Shares, but including Rabbi Trust Shares) that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate representing any shares of Company Common Stock (a " _Certificate_ ") being converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1(c) shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares of Company Common Stock, except the right to receive a cash amount equal to the Merger Consideration per share multiplied by the number of shares so represented, to be paid in consideration therefor in accordance with Section 2.2(b). 

   

 (f) _Certain Adjustments_. In the event that after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time, solely as a result of a reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split), combination or exchange of shares, stock dividend or stock distribution which in any such event is made on a pro rata basis to all holders of Company Common Stock, there is a change in the number of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding or issuable upon the conversion, exchange or exercise of securities or rights convertible or exchangeable or exercisable for shares of Company Common Stock, then the Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted to eliminate the effects of such event. 

   

 2.2. _Exchange of Certificates_. 

  

 (a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall (i) appoint a bank or trust company that is reasonably acceptable to the Company (the " _Paying Agent_ ") and (ii) enter into a paying agent agreement, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Company, with such Paying Agent to act as agent for the payment of the Merger Consideration in respect of Certificates upon surrender of such Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) in accordance with this Article II from time to time after the Effective Time. At the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit (or cause to be deposited) with the Paying Agent, for the benefit of the holders of such surrendered Certificates, for use in the payment of the Merger Consideration in accordance with this Article II, cash sufficient to make all payments pursuant to Section 2.1(c) (such cash consideration being hereinafter referred to as the " _Merger Fund_ "). The Paying Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions of the Surviving Corporation given on the Closing Date, make payments of the Merger Consideration out of the Merger Fund. The Merger Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. 

   

 (b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail or deliver to each Person (as hereinafter defined) who was, at the Effective Time, a holder of record of Company Common Stock and whose shares are being converted into the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1(c) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to the Paying Agent, and shall otherwise be in a form and have such other provisions as the Surviving Corporation may reasonably specify) containing instructions for use by holders of Company Common Stock to effect the exchange of their shares of Company   ##### 

  

  

  

Common Stock for the Merger Consideration as provided herein. Upon surrender
to the Paying Agent of such Certificate or Certificates (or effective
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) and such letter of transmittal duly
executed and completed in accordance with the instructions thereto (together
with such other documents as the Paying Agent may reasonably request) (or, if
such shares are held in book-entry or other uncertificated form, upon the
entry through a book-entry transfer agent of the surrender of such shares of
Company Common Stock on a book-entry account statement (it being understood
that any references herein to "Certificates" shall be deemed to include
references to book-entry account statements relating to the ownership of
shares of Company Common Stock)), be entitled to payment of an amount of cash
(payable by check) equal to the Merger Consideration per share multiplied by
the number of shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificate
or Certificates. The Paying Agent shall accept such Certificates upon
compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Paying Agent may
impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal
exchange practices. If payment is to be remitted to a Person other than
the Person in whose name the Certificate surrendered for payment is
registered, it shall be a condition of such payment that the Certificate so
surrendered shall be properly endorsed, with signature guaranteed, or
otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such
payment shall pay to the Paying Agent any transfer or other taxes required by
reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the
registered holder of the Certificate so surrendered, or shall establish to
the satisfaction of the Paying Agent that such tax either has been paid or is
not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.2(b), at
any time after the Effective Time, each Certificate shall be deemed to
represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration upon such
surrender as contemplated by Section 2.1. No interest will be paid or will
accrue on any cash payable as Merger Consideration. 

   

 (c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock Exchanged for Cash_. All cash paid upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates representing shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms of this Article II shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock exchanged for cash theretofore represented by such Certificates, and after the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock which were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for transfer, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Article II. 

   

 (d) _Termination of Merger Fund_. Any portion of the Merger Fund which remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates for twelve months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation upon demand, and any holders of Certificates who have not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation and only as general creditors thereof for payment of the Merger Consideration, subject to escheat and abandoned property and similar Laws. 

   

 (e) _No Liability_. None of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any cash from the Merger Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. 

   

 (f) _Investment of Merger Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest any cash in the Merger Fund, as directed by the Surviving Corporation; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) no such   ##### 

  

  

  

investment or losses thereon shall affect the Merger Consideration payable to
the holders of Company Common Stock and following any losses Parent shall
promptly provide (or cause to be provided) additional funds to the Paying
Agent for the benefit of the stockholders of the Company in the amount of any
such losses and (ii) such investments shall be in short-term obligations
of the United States of America with maturities of no more than 30 days or
guaranteed by the United States of America and backed by the full faith and
credit of the United States of America or in commercial paper obligations
rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and
Poors Corporation, respectively. Any interest and other income resulting from
such investments shall be paid to the Surviving Corporation. 

  

(g) _Withholding Rights_. The Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall
be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock
such amounts as the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent is required to
deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder (the " _Code_ "), or any provision of state, local or
foreign tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld by
the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, such withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder
of the shares of Company Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent. 

  

(h) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond in customary
amount as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect
to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration payable pursuant to
this Agreement. 

   

 2.3. _Effect of the Merger on Company Stock Options; Restricted Shares and Company RSUs_. (a) At, or immediately prior to, the Effective Time the Board of Directors of the Company or any committee administering each of the Companys equity-based compensation or stock option plans (collectively, the " _Stock Plans_ ") shall use commercially reasonable efforts to take all actions necessary, and obtain any consents necessary, so that all outstanding options to acquire shares of Company Common Stock under the Stock Plans (the " _Company Stock Options_ ") heretofore granted under any Stock Plan shall become fully vested and exercisable at the Effective Time and shall be cancelled in exchange for the right to receive a cash payment by the Surviving Corporation of an amount equal to (i) the excess, if any, of (x) the Merger Consideration over (y) the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option, multiplied by (ii) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option. Reasonably promptly (but in no event more than five (5) days) after the Effective Time the Surviving Corporation shall pay the holders of Company Stock Options the cash payments specified in this Section 2.3(a). 

  

 (b) At, or immediately prior to, the Effective Time the Board of Directors of the Company or any committee administering each of the Stock Plans shall use commercially reasonable efforts to take all actions necessary, and obtain any consents necessary, so that each share of Company Common Stock granted subject to vesting or other lapse restrictions pursuant to any Stock Plan (collectively, " _Restricted Shares_ ") which is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall vest and become free of such restrictions as of the Effective Time to the 

     ##### 

 

  

extent provided by the terms thereof (as such plans may be amended prior to
the Effective Time in accordance with the terms hereof) and, at the Effective
Time, the holder thereof shall, subject to this Article II, be entitled to
receive the Merger Consideration with respect to each such Restricted Share
in accordance with Section 2.1(c). 

   

 (c) At, or immediately prior to, the Effective Time the Board of Directors of the Company or any committee administering each of the Stock Plans shall use commercially reasonable efforts to take all actions necessary, and obtain any consents necessary, so that all outstanding (as determined by the Board of Directors of the Company or any committee administering each of the Stock Plans) restricted stock units (the " _Company RSUs_ ") granted under any Stock Plan (except with respect to Company RSUs that the holders thereof and Parent shall have otherwise agreed) shall become fully vested at the Effective Time and shall be cancelled in exchange for the right to receive a cash payment by the Surviving Corporation of an amount equal to (i) the Merger Consideration, multiplied by (ii) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company RSU. Reasonably promptly (but in no event more than five (5) days) after the Effective Time the Surviving Corporation shall pay the holders of Company RSUs the cash payments specified in this Section 2.3(c). 

   

 (d) The provisions of clause (a) of this Section 2.3 shall not apply to the Companys Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the " _Company ESPP_ "). The Company shall, prior to the Effective Time, take all actions necessary to terminate the Company ESPP effective as of the Effective Time and all outstanding rights thereunder at the Effective Time. The offering period currently in effect as of the date of this Agreement shall end in accordance with the terms of the Company ESPP and the Board of Directors of the Company or any committee administering the Company ESPP shall use commercially reasonable efforts to take all actions necessary so that no new offering period begins prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ that on the last day of the current offering period, each participant in the Company ESPP will be credited with the number of shares of Company Common Stock purchased for his or her account under the Company ESPP in respect of the offering period in accordance with the terms of the Company ESPP. 

   

 (e) The Stock Plans shall terminate as of the Effective Time, and the provisions in any other agreement, arrangement or benefit plan providing for the issuance, transfer or grant of any capital stock of the Company or any interest in respect of any capital stock of the Company shall be deleted as of the Effective Time, and the Company shall take such actions to ensure that following the Effective Time no holder of a Company Stock Option, Restricted Share or Company RSU or any participant in any Stock Plan or other agreement, arrangement or benefit plan shall have any right thereunder to acquire any capital stock or any interest in respect of any capital stock of the Surviving Corporation. 

   

 (f) The Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Section 2.3 to any holder of Company Stock Options or Company RSUs such amounts as the Surviving Corporation is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld by the Surviving Corporation, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Company Stock Options or Company RSUs in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation. 

    #####

    ##### 

  

     

 (d) In the event of any termination of this Agreement by Parent or the Company under Section 7.1(h) under circumstances in which the Termination Fee is not payable at the time of such termination pursuant to this Section 5.3, then the Company shall reimburse WCAS Management as promptly as practicable (but in any event within two business days) following receipt of an invoice therefor all of Parents actual and reasonably documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses (including reasonable legal fees and expenses) actually incurred by Parent and its affiliates after October 4, 2006 and prior to the termination of this Agreement in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the " _Parent Expenses_ "); _provided_ that in no event shall the amount of Parent Expenses to be reimbursed by the Company hereunder exceed $5,000,000. Notwithstanding anything in this paragraph (d) to the contrary, the existence of circumstances that could require the Termination Fee to become subsequently payable by the Company pursuant to Section 5.3(b)(iii) shall not relieve the Company of its obligations to pay the Parent Expenses pursuant to this Section 5.3(d) and the payment by the Company of the Parent Expenses pursuant to this Section 5.3(d) shall not relieve the Company of any subsequent obligation to pay the Termination Fee pursuant to Section 5.3(b)(iii) except to the extent indicated in this Section 5.3. Any Parent Expenses reimbursed by the Company pursuant to this Section 5.3(d) shall be made in cash, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by WCAS Management.

In addition, if the Company shall fail to pay the Termination Fee and/or Expenses when due or Parent shall fail to pay the Termination Fee when due, the Company or Parent, as the case may be, shall also pay to such other party all of such other partys costs and expenses (including attorneys fees and expenses) in connection with efforts to collect the Termination Fee and/or Parent Expenses, as the case may be. The Company and Parent acknowledge that the Termination Fee, the reimbursement of Parent Expenses and the other provisions of this Section 5.3 are an integral part of the Merger and that, without these agreements, neither the Company nor Parent would have entered into this Agreement 

   

 (g) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Termination Fee_ " means (i) $14,700,000, in the event that the Agreement is terminated by (A) the Company pursuant to Section 7.1(g) in order to enter into a Permitted Alternative Agreement with an Excluded Party or (B) Parent pursuant to Section 7.1(f) in a circumstance in which the event giving rise to the right of termination is based on an Adverse Recommendation Change having occurred in

event that the Termination Fee is payable by Parent pursuant to Section

 5.4. _Brokers or Finders_. 

  

 (a) The Company represents, as to itself, and its Subsidiaries, that no agent, broker, investment banker, financial advisor or other firm or Person is or will be entitled to any brokers or finders fee or any other commission or similar fee in connection with any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of the Company, except for the Financial Advisor, whose fees and expenses will be paid by the Company in accordance with the Companys agreements with such firm. The Company has disclosed to Parent all material terms of the engagement of the Financial Advisor, including the amount of such fees and any "tail" provisions.

 5.5. _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_. 

  

 (a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to also advance expenses as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law; _provided_ that the Person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such Person is not entitled to indemnification), each present and former director and officer of the Company and its Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Indemnitees_ ") against any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or related to such Indemnitees service as a director or officer of the Company or its Subsidiaries or services performed by such Indemnitee at the request of the Company or its Subsidiaries at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, including the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

   

 (b) The certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving Corporation shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of the Indemnitees than are presently set forth in the Companys Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated Bylaws, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six years from the Effective Time in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any of the Indemnitees. 

   

 (c) The Surviving Corporation shall either (i) obtain and maintain "tail" insurance policies with a claims period of at least six years from the Effective Time with respect 

    #####

insurance in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time, to the extent available covering Indemnitees who are
currently covered by the Companys existing officers and directors
or fiduciary liability insurance policies or (ii) maintain such type of
insurance (the " _D andO Insurance_") for a period of six years after the
Effective Time, in each case in amount and scope, and on other terms no less
advantageous in the aggregate to such Indemnitees than such existing
insurance (copies of which policies have been made available to Parent and
Acquisition);  _provided_ , that the Surviving Corporation will not be
required to pay an annual premium therefor in excess of 300% of the last
annual premium paid prior to the date hereof, which the Company represents
and warrants to be $722,000 (the " _Current Premium_ "); _provided_ , 
_further_ , that if the existing DandO Insurance expires, is terminated or
canceled during such six-year period, the Surviving Corporation will use
reasonable efforts to obtain as much DandO Insurance as can be obtained for the
remainder of such period for a premium on an annualized basis not in excess
of 300% of the Current Premium. 

   

 (d) In the event the Surviving Corporation or any of its respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person (including by dissolution), proper provisions shall be made so that such Person assumes the obligations set forth in this Section 5.5. In addition, the Surviving Corporation shall not distribute, sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of any of its assets in a manner that would reasonably be expected to render the Surviving Corporation unable to satisfy its obligations under this Section 5.5. 

   

 (e) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (wither arising before, at or after the Effective Time) is made against any Indemnitee on or prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the provisions of this Section 5.5 shall continue in effect until the final disposition of such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation. 

   

 (f) This Section 5.5, which shall survive the consummation of the Merger at the Effective Time and shall continue for the periods specified herein, is intended to benefit the Company, the Surviving Corporation and the Indemnitees, each of whom may enforce the provisions of this Section 5.5 (whether or not parties to this Agreement). The indemnification provided for herein shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which an Indemnitee is entitled, whether pursuant to Law, contract or otherwise. Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, honor and perform under all indemnification agreements entered into by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

including presentations with rating agencies, (ii) furnishing Parent,
Acquisition and their financing sources with, as soon as such financial

its Subsidiaries and its and their respective businesses and properties
as may be reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the Debt
Financing or Alternative Financing and as customarily included in offering
circulars or memoranda relating to private placements under Rule 144A
promulgated under the Securities Act to consummate the offerings of
debt securities contemplated by the Debt Financing or Alternative Financing
at the time during the Companys fiscal year such offerings will be made,
including all historical and pro forma financial statements and financial
data of the type and form required by Regulation S-K and Regulation S-X under

the Securities Act and audits thereof to the extent so required (which audits
shall be unqualified) (the " _Required Financial Information_ "), (iii)
assisting Parent, Acquisition and their financing sources in (A)
the preparation of offering documents, private placement memoranda,

reasonable best efforts to obtain accountants comfort letters, legal
opinions, ratings from rating agencies and such other matters as
reasonably requested by Parent; _provided_ that nothing herein shall require
such cooperation to the extent it would unreasonably interfere with the
business or operations of the Company or its Subsidiaries. Parent shall,
promptly upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company for all expenses
incurred by the Company or its Subsidiaries in connection with such
cooperation and shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its
Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives from and against any and
all losses or liabilities suffered or incurred by them in connection with
the arrangement of the Debt Financing and any information utilized in
connection therewith. The Company hereby consents to use of its and its
Subsidiaries logos in connection with the Financing;  _provided_ that such
logos are used solely in a manner that is not intended to or
reasonably likely to harm or disparage the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
or the reputation or goodwill of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and
its or their marks. All non-public or otherwise  confidential information
regarding the Company obtained by Parent, Acquisition or
their Representatives pursuant to this Section 5.3(b) shall be kept
confidential in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement. 

   

 (c) Parent and Acquisition shall use reasonable best efforts to arrange the Debt Financing as promptly as practicable taking into account the Marketing Period and the Termination Date on the terms and conditions described in the Debt Commitment Letter, including their reasonable best efforts to (i) negotiate and enter into definitive agreements with 

    ##### 

  

 

respect thereto on the terms and conditions contained therein (including the
related flex provisions) or on other terms and conditions no less favorable
to Parent and Acquisition, including with respect to conditionality (as
determined in the reasonable judgment of Parent), (ii) maintain in effect the
Financing commitments, (iii) satisfy all conditions applicable to Parent
and Acquisition in such definitive agreements that are within their
respective control (including by consummating the Equity Financing pursuant
to the terms of the Equity Commitment Letters), and (iv) consummate the
Financing at or prior to the Closing. In the event that (i) all closing
conditions contained in Article VI shall have been satisfied or waived (other
than with respect to the delivery of officers certificates), (ii) any Debt
Financing comprised of high yield debt securities shall not be capable of
being consummated by the last day of the Marketing Period, and (iii) any Debt
Financing comprised of interim or bridge financing to such high yield
debt securities is available on the terms and conditions set forth in the
Debt Commitment Letter, then Parent and Acquisition shall use the proceeds of
such interim or bridge financing to replace such high yield financing no
later than the last day of the Marketing Period. If any portion of the Debt
Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions described in the
Debt Commitment Letter, then Parent and Acquisition shall use their
reasonable best efforts to obtain alternative financing in an amount
necessary to replace any such unavailable Debt Financing (such
alternative financing, " _Alternative Financing_ ") as promptly as
practicable following the occurrence of such event but in no event later than
the last day of the Marketing Period; _provided_ , that Parent and
Acquisition shall be under no obligation to obtain such Alternative Financing
unless it can be obtained on terms which are in the aggregate not materially
less favorable to Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the stockholders of
Parent than the terms of the Debt Commitment Letter (as determined in the
reasonable judgment of Parent). Parent shall give the Company prompt
written notice of any material breach by any party of any of the Financing
Letters of which it has knowledge or any termination of any of the Financing
Letters. Parent shall keep the Company informed on a reasonably current basis
of the status of its efforts to arrange the Debt Financing. Neither Parent
nor Acquisition shall, without the prior written consent of the Company, agree
to or permit any amendment of any of the conditions to the Financing as set
forth in the Financing Letters or the definitive agreements relating to the
Financing (it being understood that Parent and Acquisition may amend,
restate, modify, supplement or replace the Financing Letters to add
and appoint additional arrangers, bookrunners, underwriters, agents, lenders
and similar entities, to provide for the assignment and reallocation of a
portion of the financing commitments due to such additions and to grant
customary approval rights to such additional arrangers and other entities
in connection with such appointments). Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, one or more Debt Financing Letters may be
superseded at the option of Parent after the date of this Agreement but prior
to the Effective Time by instruments (the " _New Financing Letters_ ") which
replace existing Debt Financing Letters and/or contemplate co-investment by or
financing from one or more other or additional parties; _provided_ , that the
terms of the New Financing Letters (a) shall not expand upon the conditions
precedent to the Financing as set forth in the Debt Financing Letters in any
material respect, (b) shall not reasonably be expected to delay the Closing,
(c) shall not increase the indebtedness to be incurred pursuant the Debt
Financing  by more than 10% of the amount of indebtedness to be incurred as
contemplated by the Debt Financing Letters delivered on the date hereof and
(d) are no less favorable to Parent, the Surviving Corporation or Acquisition
in any material respect than the terms set forth in the Debt Financing
Letters. In such event, the term "Debt Financing Letters" as used herein
shall be deemed to include the Debt Financing Letters that are not so
superseded at the time in question and the New Financing Letters to the
extent then in effect. For purposes of this Agreement, the " _Marketing
Period_ " shall mean the first period of 20 consecutive business days after
the date hereof (A) throughout which 

  ##### 

  

   

(1) Parent shall have the Required Financial Information, (2) nothing has
occurred and no condition exists that would cause any of the conditions set
forth in Sections 6.1 and 6.2 not to be satisfied assuming the Closing were
to be scheduled for any time during such consecutive 20 business day period,
and (3) the applicable auditors shall not have withdrawn their audit opinions
for any applicable Required Financial Information, and (B) at the end of
which the conditions set forth in Section 6.1 shall be satisfied; _provided_
that if the financial statements included in the Required Financial
Information that is available to Parent on the first day of any consecutive
20 business day period would not be sufficiently current on any day during
such consecutive 20 business day period for such financial statements to be
customarily included in an offering circular or memorandum relating to a
private placement under 144A promulgated under the Securities Act and the
Company, prior to the end of such consecutive 20 business day period,
delivers updated Required Financial Information that would be
sufficiently current to be included in such materials then, subject to the
satisfaction of the conditions set forth in clauses (A) and (B) above, the
Marketing Period shall not end until the later of (x) the last day of such
consecutive 20 business day period and (y) 10 business days after Parent
has received such updated Required Financial Information. 

   

 5.7. _Publicity_. Except with respect to any Adverse Recommendation Change or any action taken pursuant to, and in accordance with, Section 5.2 or Article VII, so long as this Agreement is in effect, the parties will consult with each other before issuing any press release or other public announcement pertaining to the Merger, the Financing or this Agreement and shall not issue any such press release or make any such public announcement prior to such consultation, except as may be required by applicable Law, in which case the party proposing to issue such press release or make such public announcement shall use its reasonable best efforts to consult in good faith with the other party before issuing any such press release or making any such public announcement. The parties have agreed that the Company may issue the press release attached hereto as _Exhibit A_ promptly following the execution and delivery of this Agreement. 

  

 5.8. _Consents and Approvals; State Takeover Laws_.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of the parties hereto shall file or cause to be filed with the Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ ") and the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (the " _Antitrust Division_ ") any notification required to be filed by it or its "ultimate parent" company under the HSR Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Such parties will use their reasonable best efforts to make such filings promptly (but in any event, with respect to the filing with the FTC and the Antitrust Division, no later than 10 business days after the date hereof) and to respond on a timely basis to any requests for additional information made by either of such agencies. Each of the parties hereto agrees to furnish the other with copies of all correspondence, filings and communications (and memoranda setting forth the substance thereof) between it and its affiliates and their respective Representatives, on the one hand, and the FTC, the Antitrust Division or any other Governmental Entity or members or their respective staffs, on the other hand, with respect 

    #####

best efforts to obtain early termination of the waiting period provided for

 (b) Each party hereto shall cooperate and use its reasonable best efforts to promptly prepare and file all necessary documentation to effect all necessary applications, notices, petitions, filings and other documents, and use its reasonable best efforts to obtain (and will cooperate with each other in obtaining) any consent, acquiescence, authorization, order or approval of, or any exemption or nonopposition by, any Governmental Entity or any third parties required to be obtained or made by Parent, Acquisition or the Company or any of their respective affiliates in connection with the Merger or the taking of any other action contemplated by this Agreement. 

   

 (c) Each party hereto agrees to furnish the other with such necessary information and reasonable assistance as such other party and its affiliates may reasonably request in connection with their preparation of necessary filings, registrations or submissions of information to any Governmental Entities, including any filings necessary under the provisions of the HSR Act. 

   

 (d) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties contained above in this Section 5.8, if any objections are asserted with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby under any Law or if any suit is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) by the FTC, the Antitrust Division or any other applicable Governmental Entity or any private party challenging any of the transactions contemplated hereby as violative of any Law or which would otherwise prevent, materially impede or materially delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, each of Parent, Acquisition and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to resolve any such objections or suits so as to permit consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including in order to resolve such objections or suits which, in any case if not resolved, would reasonably be expected to prevent, materially impede or materially delay the consummation of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby; provided, however, that no party shall be required to, and the Company may not (without the prior written consent of Parent) take any such actions to resolve any such objections or suits which actions would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. 

   

 (e) Without limiting the foregoing, the Company and its Board of Directors shall (i) use their commercially reasonable efforts to take all action necessary or otherwise reasonably requested by Parent or Acquisition to exempt the Merger from the provisions of any applicable takeover, business combination, control share acquisition or similar Law and (ii) if any takeover, business combination, control share acquisition or similar Law becomes applicable to this Agreement or the Merger, use their reasonable best efforts to take all action necessary to ensure that the Merger may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such statute or regulation on the Merger. 

   

 5.9. _Notification of Certain Matters_. From and after the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the Effective Time or termination of this Agreement pursuant to and in accordance with Article VII, each party shall give prompt oral and written notice to each other party of (a) any written notice or other written communication, or other notice or communication of which 

   ##### 

  

    

the Companys officers identified on _Section 8.4_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule have knowledge, in each case, from any Person alleging that the
consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby, (b) notice or communication from any
Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby,
(c) the failure of such party to comply with or satisfy any covenant,
condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it pursuant to
this Agreement or the inaccuracy of a representation or warranty made by such
party which, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to
result in any condition to the obligations of such party to effect the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement not to be satisfied
or (d) the commencement of any Company Litigation or any other action, suit,
arbitration, mediation, appraisal, investigation, inquiry or proceeding, in
any forum, which relates to the consummation of the transactions contemplated

respective properties or assets, in either case which, if pending or issued,
as the case may be, on or prior to the date of this Agreement, would have
been required to have been disclosed pursuant to Section 3.1. The delivery of
any notice pursuant to this Section 5.9 is for informational purposes and
shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to any
party or parties receiving such notice.

 (a) Until the first anniversary of the Effective Time the Surviving Corporation will, with respect to each employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries who continues to be employed by the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries (a " _Continuing Employee_ ") maintain the base salary and incentive bonus opportunity of each such Continuing Employee and will maintain pension, health and welfare benefits and severance policies that, in the aggregate, are no less favorable than such benefits and policies under the Company Plans as in effect prior to the Effective Time (other than modifications to any employee benefit plans in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice and other than with respect to any equity-based compensation). Nothing in this Section 5.10(a) shall be deemed to prevent the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries from making any change required by applicable Law or require the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries to provide equity based compensation or issue equity of the Surviving Corporation or Parent after the Effective Time. To the extent not paid prior to the Effective Time, for fiscal year 2006, the Surviving Corporation shall pay to Continuing Employees their bonuses, if any, in accordance with the Companys 2006 bonus plan on the date hereof (which plan is consistent with bonus plans of the Company for prior years), with such bonuses, if any, to be paid by the Surviving Corporation in accordance with the terms of such plan. 

   

 (b) To the extent permitted under applicable Law, each employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries shall be given credit for all service with the Company or its Subsidiaries (or service credited by the Company or its Subsidiaries) under all employee benefit plans, programs, policies and arrangements maintained by the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries in which they participate or in which they become participants for purposes of eligibility, vesting and benefit accrual including, for purposes of determining (i) short-term and long-term disability benefits, (ii) severance benefits, (iii) vacation benefits and (iv) benefits under any retirement plan.

Company Plans, as in effect prior to the Effective Time. 

   

 (c) This Section 5.10 shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of each of the parties to this Agreement and nothing in this Section 5.10, expressed or implied, is intended to confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Section 5.10. Nothing contained in this Section 5.10 shall create any third party beneficiary rights in any employee or former employee (including any dependent thereof) of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or the Surviving Corporation with respect to continued employment for any specified period of any nature or kind whatsoever. Nothing in this Section 5.10 is intended to amend any Company Plan or interfere with Parents or the Surviving Corporations right from and after the Effective Time to amend or terminate any Company Plans.

The Company will use its reasonable best efforts to have the Proxy Statement cleared by the SEC and mailed to its stockholders as promptly as reasonably practicable after such filing, and the parties hereto will use their reasonable best efforts to have the Schedule 13E-3 cleared by the SEC as promptly as practicable after such filing. The Company will as promptly as reasonably practicable notify Parent of (i) the receipt of any oral or written comments from the SEC and (ii) any request by the SEC for any amendment to the Proxy Statement or the Schedule 13E-3 or for additional information. The parties hereto shall provide each other with reasonable opportunity to review and comment on drafts of the Proxy Statement (including each amendment or supplement thereto) and the Schedule 13E-3 (including each amendment or supplement thereto) and all responses to requests for additional information by and replies to comments of the SEC (provided that the Company shall (i) include in any such documents or responses all comments reasonably proposed by Parent and (ii) not file, mail or otherwise deliver such document or respond to the SEC or the staff of the SEC over Parents reasonable objection), prior to filing such with or sending such to the SEC, and the parties hereto will provide each other with copies of all such filings made and correspondence with the SEC. If at any time prior to the Effective Time, any information should be discovered by any party hereto which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement or the Schedule 13E-3 so that the Proxy Statement or the Schedule 13E-3 would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party which discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties hereto and, to the extent required by applicable Law, the parties will cooperate with each other in connection with the preparation of an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information, which amendment or supplement will be promptly filed by the Company with the SEC and disseminated by the Company to the stockholders of the Company.

 (b) The Company shall, acting through its Board of Directors and in accordance with applicable Law and the Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and the Amended and Restated Bylaws of the Company, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a special meeting of its stockholders (the " _Special Meeting_ ") as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date hereof for the purpose of considering and taking action upon this Agreement and the Merger and, subject to Section 5.2(d), shall solicit proxies in favor of approval of this Agreement and the Merger; _provided_ , that the parties acknowledge that the Companys goal is to hold the Special Meeting within 45 days after mailing the Proxy Statement to the stockholders of the Company and that if it does not hold the Special Meeting within such period, its senior executives shall discuss the reasons for not meeting such goal with the senior executives of Parent. Subject to Section 5.2(d), the Board of Directors of the Company shall recommend approval of this Agreement and the Merger by the Companys stockholders and shall include such recommendation, together with a copy of the opinion referred to in Section 3.1(m), in the Proxy Statement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Companys obligations to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold the Special Meeting pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 5.11(b) shall not be affected by (i) the commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or communication to the Company of any Company Acquisition Proposal or (ii) an Adverse Recommendation Change. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Company properly exercises its right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(g), the Companys obligations under this Section 5.11(b) shall terminate. 

   

 5.12. _Consequences If Rights Are Triggered_.

 5.13. _Stockholder Litigation_. The Company shall give Parent the opportunity to participate in the defense and settlement of any stockholder litigation brought or threatened against the Company and/or its directors relating to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and no such settlement shall be agreed to without Parents prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

   ##### 

  

  

 8.5. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts (and may be delivered by facsimile), each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument. 

  

 8.6. _Entire Agreement; No Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement, including the schedules and exhibits hereto, together with the confidentiality and nondisclosure provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement and the Guarantee, constitutes the entire agreement of the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, between the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof (other than the confidentiality and nondisclosure provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement which shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement). This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of each party hereto and to their respective successors and permitted assigns, and, except as provided in Sections 5.3(b), 5.3(d), 5.3(f) and 5.5, nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any other right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement. 

  

 8.7. _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended, modified or supplemented, only by written agreement of Parent, Acquisition and the Company at any time prior to the Effective Time with respect to any of the terms contained herein; _provided_ , that, after Company Stockholder Approval is obtained, no term or condition contained in this Agreement shall be amended or modified in any manner that by Law requires further approval by the stockholders of the Company without so obtaining such further stockholder approval. 

  

 8.8. _Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors, may, to the extent legally allowed (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts required hereby, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed by such party. No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The rights and remedies herein provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by Law. 

  

 8.9. _Governing Law_. This Agreement, and all claims arising hereunder or relating hereto or to the negotiation or performance hereof, shall be governed and construed and enforced in accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to the principles of conflicts of Law thereof. 

  

 8.10. _Submission to Jurisdiction_. Each of the parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for itself and its property, to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the Delaware Court of Chancery or, in the event (but only in the event) such court does not have complete subject matter jurisdiction, any other court of the State of Delaware or the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the negotiation or performance hereof. Each of the parties hereto agrees that, subject to rights with respect to post-trial motions and rights of appeal or other 

   ##### 

  

    

avenues of review, a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be
conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment
or in any other manner provided by Law. Each of the parties hereto
irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent it may legally
and effectively do so, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the
laying of venue of any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating
to this Agreement or the negotiation or performance hereof in the Delaware
Court of Chancery or, if such court does not have complete subject matter
jurisdiction, any other state court of the State of Delaware or the
United States District Court for the District of Delaware. Each of the
parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent
it may legally and effectively do so, the defense of an inconvenient forum to
the maintenance of such action or proceeding in any such court. Each party to
this Agreement irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner
provided for notices in Section 8.3. Nothing in this Section 8.10 shall
affect the right of any party to this Agreement to serve process in any other
manner permitted by Law. 

  

 8.11. _Assignment_. No party hereto shall assign or otherwise transfer this Agreement or any of its rights, interests or obligations hereunder (whether by operation of Law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other parties hereto. Any attempted assignment or transfer in violation of the foregoing shall be null and void. 

  

 8.12. _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction, by final judgment no longer subject to review, to be invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, all other terms and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as neither the economic nor legal substance of the transactions contemplated herein is affected in any manner materially adverse to any party hereto. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner.
