THIS MEMBERSHIP INTEREST PURCHASE AGREEMENT (the "Agreement") is dated as of
May 1, 2015, by and among Thor Industries, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the
"Buyer"), and Postle Aluminum Company, LLC, a Delaware limited liability
company (the "Seller"). The Buyer and the Seller are sometimes respectively
referred to as "Party", and collectively referred to as the "Parties."
Capitalized terms used in this Agreement and not otherwise defined are
defined in _Section 7.1_.

RECITALS

 

1. The Seller is the sole owner of Postle Operating, LLC, an entity that extrudes aluminum and distributes aluminum extrusions and steel parts (the "Business"). 

 

2. The Seller desires to sell to the Buyer, and the Buyer desires to purchase from the Seller, all of the issued and outstanding membership units of the Company (collectively the "Company Interests") for the consideration set forth below, on the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement. 

 

3. The Seller further agrees to assign to the Buyer certain other rights and interests, including, but not limited to, the rights in the name "Postle" and any other intangible rights owned by the Seller. 

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the representations, warranties,
covenants, and agreements contained in this Agreement and other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt of which is hereby acknowledged, the
Parties agree as follows:

Article 1. THE TRANSACTION

 

Section 1.1 Purchase and Sale of Company Interests; Other Actions. On the
terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, at the Closing (as
defined below), the Seller shall sell, transfer, convey, assign, and deliver
to the Buyer, and the Buyer shall purchase, acquire, and accept from the
Seller, the Company Interests. Immediately prior to the Closing, the Seller
shall assign and transfer to the Company: (a) the Employee Non-Competes; (b)
all other contracts, rights and other general intangibles owned or held by
Seller and used in the Business; and (c) all of the issued and outstanding
membership interests of Postle Real Estate, LLC, a Delaware limited liability
company (together, the "Assignments"). At the Closing, the Seller shall
deliver to the Buyer evidence that the Assignments have been consummated, in
form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Buyer.

Section 1.2 Purchase Price. The purchase price to be paid by the Buyer to the
Seller by electronic wire to be released prior to 10:00 a.m. on the Closing
Date for the Company Interests shall be One Hundred Forty Million Dollars
($140,000,000.00) (the "Closing Purchase Price). The Closing Purchase Price
shall be subject to adjustment as set forth in _Section 1.4_ below (as
adjusted, the "Purchase Price"). At Closing, One Hundred Thirty-Five Million
Dollars ($135,000,000.00) of the Closing Purchase Price, plus the amount of
the Estimated Cash Balance

 



     |  | 
---|---|--- 
  MEMBERSHIP INTEREST PURCHASE AGREEMENT |  |

1  (which may be a positive or a negative number) (the "Cash Payment") shall be
paid by the Buyer by wire transfer to the accounts designated by the Seller in
Exhibit 1.2 hereof and Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000.00) of the Closing
Purchase Price (the "Escrow Amount") shall be paid by the Buyer to JP Morgan
Chase Bank, N.A. (the "Escrow Agent") to be held pursuant to the provisions
of  _Section 1.5_ (the "Escrow").

Section 1.3 Target Net Assets. The Target Net Assets shall be Forty-Four
Million Six Hundred Thirty-Three Thousand Six Hundred Thirty-Five Dollars
($44,633,635.00) (the "Target Net Assets"). Net Assets were, and for the post-
closing adjustment shall be, determined and calculated using the practices,
policies and methodologies described on the attached Exhibit 1.3. To the
extent that Exhibit 1.3 does not address any procedure necessary for the post-
closing adjustment, then such procedures shall be determined using the
past practices of the Seller provided that such practices are in accordance
with GAAP. To the extent that such past practices are not consistent with
GAAP, then GAAP shall govern.

 

Section 1.4 Purchase Price Adjustment; Cash Balance Adjustment.

 

(a) The Seller shall deliver to the Buyer the Sellers good faith
estimate of (i) the Net Assets (the "Estimated Net Assets") on or before April
27, 2015, and (ii) the Actual Cash Balance (the "Estimated Cash Balance") at
least two (2) days prior to the Closing, in each case, as of the Effective
Time, along with the Sellers backup for Estimated Net Assets and Estimated
Cash Balance and any additional related materials as the Buyer may reasonably
request. The Cash Payment shall be (i) _increased_ dollar-for-dollar by the
amount by which the Estimated Net Assets exceeds the Target Net Assets or (ii)
_decreased_ dollar-for-dollar by the amount by which the Estimated Net Assets
is less than the Target Net Assets.

(b) As promptly as practicable, but no later than sixty (60) days
after the Closing Date, the Seller will cause to be prepared and delivered to
the Buyer a certificate (the "Closing Certificate") setting forth the Sellers
calculation of the Net Assets as of the Effective Time (the "Closing Net
Assets") and the Actual Cash Balance, which, as applicable, shall be prepared
in accordance with the practices outlined in _Section 1.3_. The Closing
Certificate shall present fairly in all Material respects the Net Assets of
the Company and the Actual Cash Balance as of the Effective Time. The Buyer
and the Company will assist the Seller in the preparation of the Closing
Certificate and will provide the Seller and the Sellers
independent accountants and other representatives access at all reasonable
times to the Companys personnel and properties, books, and records for such
purpose. The Buyer shall have thirty (30) days from the date on which the
Closing Certificate is due or delivered to Buyer, whichever is later, to
review the certificate (the "Review Period"). The Buyer and its accountants
and/or other representatives shall be provided with customary access to the
work papers of the Seller and its accountants in connection with such review,
subject to the execution of customary confidentiality and other undertakings.
If the Buyer disagrees in any respect with any item or amount shown or
reflected in the Closing Certificate or with the calculation of the Closing
Net Assets and/or the Actual Cash Balance, the Buyer may, on or prior to the
last day of the Review Period, deliver a notice to the Seller setting forth,
in reasonable detail, each disputed item or amount the ("Disputed Items") and
the basis for the Buyers disagreement therewith (the "Dispute Notice"). The
Dispute Notice shall set forth, in reasonable detail the Buyers position as
to the proper Closing Net Assets and Actual

 



     |  | 
---|---|--- 
  MEMBERSHIP INTEREST PURCHASE AGREEMENT |  |

2  Cash Balance. If no Dispute Notice is received by the Seller on or prior to
the last day of the Review Period, the Closing Certificate shall be deemed
accepted by the Buyer, whereupon (i) the Closing Net Assets reflected on the
Closing Certificate shall be deemed to be the "Final Net Assets," (ii) the
Actual Cash Balance shall be deemed final, and (iii) the Buyer or the Seller,
as the case may be, will pay to the other Party the amounts owing in
accordance with _Section 1.4(e)_ hereof. In the event that the Buyer timely
delivers a Dispute Notice to the Seller, the Buyer or the Seller, as the case
may be, will pay to the other Party any undisputed portion of the amount
determined under _Section 1.4(b)_ (the "Undisputed Amount"). Unless otherwise
agreed, all Undisputed Amounts shall be paid on the 5th Business Day
following the expiration of the Review Period or the 5th Business Day after
the Parties agree that any item is an Undisputed Amount, whichever date is
later.

(c) For fourteen (14) days after the Sellers receipt of a Dispute
Notice, if any, the Parties shall endeavor in good faith to resolve by mutual
agreement all Disputed Items. In the event that the Parties are unable to
resolve by mutual agreement all Disputed Items within such 14-day period, the
Buyer and the Seller hereby agree that they shall engage RSM McGladrey LLP or
such other firm as the parties may mutually agree upon in writing
(the "Independent Accounting Firm") to resolve the remaining Disputed Items.
The Seller and the Buyer shall submit the remaining Disputed Items, together
with such arguments as either of them choose to make in support of only
the Disputed Items, in writing to the Independent Accounting Firm within
twenty (20) days after the Independent Accounting Firms engagement or such
longer period as mutually agreed to by the Parties.

 

(d) The Seller and the Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to cause the Independent Accounting Firm to resolve the remaining Disputed
Items based upon the materials submitted to it pursuant to the last sentence
of _Section 1.4(c)_ within thirty (30) days following the submission of such
materials. The Independent Accounting Firm shall determine, based solely on
presentations by the Seller and the Buyer, and not by independent review, only
those unresolved issues in dispute specifically set forth in the Dispute
Notice and shall render a written report to the Seller and the Buyer (the
"Adjustment Report") in which the Independent Accounting Firm shall, after
considering all unresolved matters set forth in the Dispute Notice, determine
what adjustments, if any, should be made to the Closing Certificate solely as
to the unresolved Disputed Items and shall determine the appropriate Final Net
Assets and Actual Cash Balance on that basis. The Adjustment Report shall set
forth, in reasonable detail, the Independent Accounting Firms determination
with respect to each of the remaining Disputed Items or other unresolved
amounts specified in the Dispute Notice, and the revisions, if any, to be made
to the Closing Certificate and the Closing Net Assets, together with
supporting calculations. In resolving any Disputed Item, the Independent
Accounting Firm: (i) shall be bound to the principles of this Agreement,
including those stated in this _Section 1.4,_ (ii) shall limit its review to
unresolved matters specifically set forth in the Dispute Notice, and (iii)
shall not assign a value to any item higher than the highest value for such
item claimed by either Party or less than the lowest value for such
item claimed by either Party. The costs and fees related to such
determination by the Independent Accounting Firm, including the costs relating
to any negotiations with the Independent Accounting Firm with respect to the
terms and conditions of such 

 



     |  | 
---|---|--- 
  MEMBERSHIP INTEREST PURCHASE AGREEMENT |  |

3  Independent Accounting Firms engagement, will be paid by the Buyer and the
Seller on an inversely proportional basis, based upon the relative portions of
the Disputed Items that have been submitted to the Independent Accounting
Firm for resolution that ultimately are awarded in favor of the Buyer and the
Seller (e.g., if $100,000 is in dispute, and of that amount the Independent
Accounting Firm awards $75,000 in favor of the Buyer and $25,000 in favor of
the Seller, then the Buyer will be responsible for 25%, and the Seller 75%, of
the costs and fees), which proportionate allocation will also be determined by
the Independent Accounting Firm and be included in the Adjustment Report. The
Adjustment Report, absent fraud, shall be final and binding upon the Buyer and
the Seller, shall be deemed a final arbitration award that is binding on each
of the Buyer and the Seller, and no Party shall seek further recourse to
courts, other tribunals or otherwise, other than to enforce to the Adjustment
Report. Judgment may be entered to enforce the Adjustment Report in any court
of competent jurisdiction.

 

(e) Effective upon the end of the Review Period (if a timely Dispute
Notice is not delivered), or upon the resolution of all Disputed Items by
mutual agreement of the Parties or by the issuance of the Adjustment Report
(if a timely Dispute Notice is delivered):

 

(i) the Closing Purchase Price shall be (A) _increased_ dollar-for-
dollar by the amount by which the Final Net Assets exceeds the Estimated Net
Assets or (B) _decreased_ dollar-for-dollar by the amount by which the Final
Net Assets is less than the Estimated Net Assets.

(ii) The Buyer shall be obligated to pay the Seller the amount by
which the Actual Cash Balance exceeds the Estimated Cash Balance or the Seller
shall be obligated to pay the Buyer the amount by which the Actual Cash
Balance is less than the Estimated Cash Balance.

 

(iii) Any payment due as a result of an adjustment to the Closing
Purchase Price or the Actual Cash Balance pursuant to this _Section 1.4_
shall be paid by the Buyer or the Seller, as the case may be, as follows:

 

(A) if a timely Dispute Notice is not delivered, on the fifth (5th)
Business Day following the end of the Review Period, or

 

(B) if a timely Dispute Notice is delivered, (1) with respect to
Undisputed Amounts paid pursuant to the last sentence of _Section 1.4(b)_, on
the fifth (5th) Business Day following the delivery of a Dispute Notice to the
Seller, and (2) on the fifth (5th) Business Day following the resolution of
all Disputed Items by mutual agreement of the Parties or on the fifth (5th)
Business Day following the date on which the Adjustment Report has been
received by the Seller and the Buyer less any payment made by the Buyer or
the Seller, as the case may be, as described in (1) under this _Section
1.4(e)(iii)(B)_.

Any such payments shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to an account or accounts designated by the Buyer or the Seller, as the
case may be, at least two (2) Business Days prior to the applicable payment
date. Any amounts payable by Seller under this _Section 1.4_ shall not be
paid from the Escrow.

 



     |  | 
---|---|--- 
  MEMBERSHIP INTEREST PURCHASE AGREEMENT |  |

4 (f) Immediately following the Closing, the Company shall commence a
complete physical identification of its inventory and count thereof as of the
Closing. The Seller and the Buyer, and each of their respective
representatives and accountants, shall be entitled (i) to have unrestricted
access to observe, and make inquiries with regard to, the foregoing inventory
count, and (ii) to test and sample such inventory during the course of such
inventory count. Any disagreement between the Parties with respect to the
inventory count, but not the value of such inventory, shall be resolved at the
time of the inventory count, subject to the ability of the Seller to provide
an inventory count listing as of the end of the inventory count procedures
on that date. This inventory count will be utilized by the Parties in the
determination of the Closing Net Assets. The Buyer and the Seller agree to use
their commercially reasonable efforts to adjust any inventory count that is,
or appears to be, incorrect based on a review of the inventory compilation
prepared by the Company utilizing the counts from the inventory count
procedures. Such count shall not prejudice any Partys ability to set, dispute
or adjust the value of such inventory in connection with the calculation of
the Final Net Assets.

Section 1.5 Escrow. Prior to 10:00 a.m. on the Closing Date, the Buyer shall
deliver by electronic wire in an amount equal to the Escrow Amount to the
Escrow Agent for deposit into an escrow account (the "Escrow Account")
established pursuant to the terms of an escrow agreement in the form attached
to this Agreement as _Exhibit 1.5_ among the Buyer, the Seller, and the
Escrow Agent (the "Escrow Agreement"). The Escrow Amount shall be held in an
interest-bearing account pursuant to the Escrow Agreement and, together with
all income earned thereon, will serve as security to satisfy claims for
indemnity pursuant to _Article 4_ and any other obligations of the Seller
allowable under this Agreement. The Escrow Amount shall be disbursed in
accordance with the Escrow Agreement.

Section 1.6 The Closing.

 

(a) The closing of the purchase and sale of the Company Interests
contemplated herein (the "Closing") shall take place at Thor Industries, Inc.,
601 East Beardsley, Elkhart, IN, on May 1, 2015, or at such place or other
date as the Parties may mutually agree in writing (the "Closing Date"). The
Closing shall be deemed effective as of 12:01 a.m. on the Closing Date (the
"Effective Time").

 

(b) At the Closing:

 

(i) the Seller shall deliver (or cause to be delivered) to the Buyer
the various certificates, instruments, agreements, and documents required to
be delivered by the Seller pursuant to this Agreement;

 

(ii) the Buyer shall deliver (or cause to be delivered) to the Seller
the various certificates, instruments, agreements, and documents required to
be delivered by the Buyer pursuant to this Agreement;

 

(iii) the Seller shall deliver (or shall cause to be delivered) to the
Buyer the minute books, ledgers and registers, corporate seals, and other
similar corporate records of the Company; and

 

(iv) the Buyer shall deliver the Cash Payment and the Escrow Amount as
specified in _Section 1.2_.

contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 4.3 Claims for Indemnification.

 

(a) All claims for indemnification made under this _Article 4_
resulting from a third-party claim against an Indemnified Party (as defined
below) shall be made in accordance with the following procedures. A Person
entitled to indemnification under this _Article 4_ (an "Indemnified Party")
shall give prompt written notification to the Person from whom indemnification
is sought (the "Indemnifying Party") of the commencement of any action, suit,
or proceeding relating to a third-party claim for which indemnification may
be sought or, if earlier, upon the potential assertion of any such claim by a
third party (collectively, an "Action"). Within thirty (30) days after
delivery of such notification, the Indemnifying Party may, upon written
notice thereof to the Indemnified Party, assume control of the defense of the
Action with counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying
Party does not assume control of such defense, the Indemnified Party shall
control such defense. The Party not controlling such defense of an Action may
participate in such Action at its own expense. The Party

 



     |  | 
---|---|--- 
  MEMBERSHIP INTEREST PURCHASE AGREEMENT |  |

19  controlling such defense shall keep the other Party advised of the status of
such Action, and the defense thereof and shall consider recommendations made
by the other Party with respect thereto. Neither the Indemnifying Party nor
the Indemnified Party, as the case may be, shall agree to any settlement of
such Action without the prior written consent of the other Party, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

 

(b) An Indemnified Party wishing to assert a claim for indemnification
under this _Article 4_ that is not subject to _Section 4.3(a)_ shall deliver
to the Indemnifying Party a prompt written notice (a "Claim Notice") which
contains (i) a description and the amount (the "Claimed Amount") of any
Damages incurred by the Indemnified Party, (ii) a statement that the
Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification under this _Article 4_ and a
reasonable explanation of the basis therefor, and (iii) a demand for payment
in the amount of such Damages. Within sixty (60) days after delivery of a
Claim Notice, the Indemnifying Party shall deliver to the Indemnified Party a
written response in which the Indemnifying Party shall either: (i) agree that
the Indemnified Party is entitled to receive all of the Claimed Amount (in
which case such response shall be accompanied by a payment by the Indemnifying
Party to the Indemnified Party of the Claimed Amount, by check or by wire
transfer), or (ii) contest that the Indemnified Party is entitled to receive
the Claimed Amount in whole or in part. If the Indemnifying Party in such
response contests the payment of all or part of the Claimed Amount, the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall use good faith efforts to
resolve such dispute. If such dispute is not resolved within sixty (60) days
following the delivery by the Indemnifying Party of such response, then either
Party may file a claim to enforce its rights under this Agreement.

(c) As a condition to any payment by the Indemnifying Party, the
Indemnified Party shall assign to the Indemnifying Party all of its rights
with respect to the subject matter of the claim or otherwise make arrangements
reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnifying Party to provide that the
Indemnifying Party is subrogated to such rights

 

(d) The Buyer and the Seller shall cooperate with each other with
respect to resolving any claim or liability with respect to which one Party is
obligated to indemnify the other Party hereunder, including by making

liability;  _provided_ , _however_ , that such Party shall not be required to
make such efforts if they would be detrimental in any Material respect to such
Party.

20 Section 4.4 Survival. Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, the
representations and warranties of the Seller and the Buyer set forth in this
Agreement, and the right to make a claim hereunder with respect to a Breach
thereof, shall survive the Closing and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and shall remain in full force and effect
for a period of twenty four (24) months following the Closing Date, at which
time they shall expire; provided, however, that the representations and
warranties set forth in  _Sections 2.1_ , _2.2_ , _2.3_ and _2.4_ shall
survive forever, and the representations and warranties set forth in _Sections
2.11_ and _2.17_ shall survive for the applicable statutes of limitations
periods. Any valid claim for a Breach of a representation or warranty
pursuant to _Section 4.1(a)(i)_ or _Section 4.2(a)(i)_ that is properly
asserted in writing pursuant to _Section 4.3_ prior to the expiration as
provided in this  _Section 4.4_ of the representation or warranty that is
the basis for such claim shall survive until such claim is finally resolved
and satisfied.

 

Section 4.5 Limitations.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, each of the following limitations shall apply to any claim
for indemnification under this Section 4:

 

(i) the Seller shall have no liability to the Buyer
Indemnified Persons pursuant to this _Article 4_ (other than in respect of
any Breaches of representations contained in _Sections 2.1_ , _2.2_ , _2.3_ ,
and _2.4_ of this Agreement) until the aggregate amount of all alleged
Damages resulting therefrom exceed an amount equal to one-half of one percent
(0.5%) of the Purchase Price and then indemnity shall attach to the first
dollar of the indemnified claim(s); and

 

(ii) the overall aggregate liability of the Seller to the
Buyer Indemnified Persons pursuant to this _Article 4_ (other than in respect
of Breaches of representations contained in _Sections 2.1_ , _2.2_ , _2.3_ ,
and _2.4_ of this Agreement) shall not exceed an amount equal to ten
percent (10%) of the Purchase Price and the overall aggregate liability of
the Seller to the Buyer for Breaches of representations contained in _Sections
2.1_ , _2.2_ , _2.3_ , and _2.4_ of this Agreement shall not exceed an
amount equal to the Purchase Price.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
Buyer shall not be entitled to make any claim for indemnification with respect
to any matter to the extent the Closing Purchase Price has been adjusted to
reflect such matter pursuant to  _Section 1.4_, and the amount of any
Damages for which indemnification is provided under this _Article 4_ shall be
calculated net of any accruals, reserves, or provisions reflected in the Final
Net Assets that is applicable to the matter for which the accrual, reserve,
or provision was created.

Section 4.6 Manner of Payment. Any indemnification payments pursuant to this
_Article 4_ shall be effected by wire transfer of immediately available funds
to an account designated in writing by the applicable Indemnified Person
within ten (10) Business Days after the final determination thereof. All
amounts to be paid by the Seller under this _Article 4_ shall first be paid
from the Escrow until the Escrow is fully exhausted.

 

Section 4.7 Remedies. The Parties acknowledge and agree that their respective
sole and exclusive remedy with respect to any and all claims relating to this
Agreement and any document

 



     |  | 
---|---|--- 
  MEMBERSHIP INTEREST PURCHASE AGREEMENT |  |

21  or certificate delivered in connection with this Agreement, or any Legal
Requirement or otherwise (other than claims of fraud) shall be pursuant to the
indemnification provisions set forth in  _Article 4_. In furtherance of the
foregoing, each Party hereby waives, to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Legal Requirements, any and all rights, claims and causes of action
it or any of its Affiliates may have against the other Party arising under or
based upon this Agreement and any document or certificate delivered in
connection with this Agreement, any Legal Requirement or otherwise (except
pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in _Article 4_ ).

 

Section 4.8 Determination of Damages; Adjustment of Purchase Price. The
Parties will make adjustments for insurance coverage in determining Damages
for purposes of this _Article 4_ by reducing the amount of such Damages for
any amounts that the Buyer or the Company actually receive in cash insurance
proceeds (after giving effect to any applicable deductible or retention, net
of any premium increase as a result of any such claims and net of any costs to
collect such amounts). Any indemnity payment under this Agreement shall be
treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes, unless a
final determination (which shall include the execution of a Form 870-AD or
successor form) with respect to the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates
causes any such payment not to be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase
Price for United States federal income Tax purposes.

Article 5. TAX MATTERS

 

The following provisions shall govern the allocation of responsibility as
between the Buyer and the Seller for certain Tax matters following the
Closing Date.

Section 5.1 Tax Indemnification. The Seller shall indemnify the Company and
the Buyer indefinitely and hold them harmless from and against (a) all Taxes
(or the non-payment thereof) of the Company for all taxable periods ending
before the Closing Date and the portion thereof through the end of the Closing
Date for any taxable period that includes (but does not end on) the Closing
Date ("Pre-Closing Tax Period"), except to the extent that such Taxes were
taken into account in the calculation of the Final Net Assets or arise from a
transaction occurring after the Closing, (b) any and all Taxes for the Pre-
Closing Tax Period of any member of an affiliated, consolidated, combined, or
unitary group of which the Company (or any predecessor of any of the
foregoing) is or was a member prior to the Closing, including pursuant to
Treasury Regulation § 1.1502-6 or any analogous or similar state, local, or
foreign law or regulation, and (c) any and all Taxes of any Person
(other than the Company) imposed on the Company as a transferee or successor,
by contract, or pursuant to any Legal Requirement if such Taxes relate to an
event or transaction occurring before the Closing and such relationship
existed prior to the Closing. The indemnity provided in this _Section 5.1
_is not subject to the limitations contained in _Article 4_ hereof; provided,
however, that the Sellers obligations under this _Section 5.1_ shall not, in
any event, exceed the Purchase Price.

Section 5.2 Straddle Period. In the case of any taxable period that includes
(but does not end on) the Closing Date (a "Straddle Period"), the amount of
any Taxes for the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be determined based on an
interim closing of the books as of the close of business on the Closing Date.

22 Section 5.3 Responsibility for Filing Tax Returns.

 

(a) The Seller shall prepare or cause to be prepared and cause to be
timely filed all Tax Returns for the Company that are filed after the Closing
Date that pertain to periods prior to the Closing Date. Upon completion of
such Tax Returns for the Company that pertain to periods prior to the Closing
Date, the Seller shall pay to the Buyer (through the use of the Escrow, if
available), any Tax payments due on such returns except to the extent that
such Taxes were taken into account in the calculation of the Final Net Assets.
Buyer shall then remit or cause to be remitted all Taxes in respect of such
Tax Returns payable after the Closing Date. The Seller shall permit the Buyer
to review and comment on each Tax Return described in the preceding sentence
for a period of up to ten (10) days prior to filing and shall make such
revisions of such Tax Returns as are reasonably requested by the Buyers
Representative.

 

(b) The Buyer shall prepare or cause to be prepared and cause to be
timely filed all Tax Returns for the Company for each Straddle Period. The
Buyer shall permit the Seller to review and comment on each Tax Return
described in the preceding sentence for a period of up to ten (10) days prior
to filing and shall make such revisions to such Tax Returns as are reasonably
requested by the Seller. In the event of a dispute between the Parties with
respect to any item on any such Tax Return, the Parties shall act in good
faith to resolve any such dispute prior to the date on which such Tax Return
is required to be filed. The Buyer agrees to file all permitted extensions of
time to file such Tax Return as shall be reasonably required to allow any such
dispute to be resolved. If the Parties hereto cannot resolve any disputed
item, the item or items in question shall be resolved in a manner similar to
that set forth in _Section 1.4(c)_ and _Section 1.4(d)_ hereof. Upon
completion of such Tax Returns, Seller shall pay to Buyer (through the use of
Escrow funds established hereunder, if available), the portion of the Tax
payments due on such returns that relate to the Pre-Closing Tax Period, except
to the extent such Taxes were taken into account in the calculation of the
Final Net Assets. Buyer shall then pay all Taxes due in respect of such Tax
Returns.

 

(c) The parties acknowledge that the Company shall be disregarded as a
separate entity for federal and applicable state income Tax purposes (before
and during the Closing) and will not be filing income Tax Returns with respect
to such income Taxes (so that, for the avoidance of doubt, the
foregoing provisions of this _Section 5.3_ shall not apply to Tax Returns
for Taxes that are income or franchise Taxes).

 

Section 5.4 Refunds and Tax Benefits. Any Tax refunds that are received by the
Buyer or the Company, and any amounts credited against Tax to which the Buyer
or the Company become entitled, that relate to Tax periods or portions thereof
ending before the Closing Date shall be for the account of the Seller. The
Buyer shall promptly notify the Seller in writing of any Tax refund(s)
received by or payable to the Company after the Closing that relate to Tax
periods or portions thereof ending before the Closing Date. The Buyer shall
pay over to the Seller any such refund or the amount of any such credit
within fifteen (15) days after receipt or entitlement thereto. The Buyer shall
cooperate, and cause the Company to cooperate, in obtaining any refund that
the Seller reasonably believes should be available, including without
limitation, through filing appropriate forms with the applicable Taxing
Authorities. Any costs incurred in the pursuit of such returns for the benefit
of the Seller shall be the responsibility of the Seller.

23 Section 5.5 Cooperation on Tax Matters; Tax Audits.

 

(a) The Buyer and the Seller shall cooperate fully, as and to the
extent reasonably requested by the other Party, in connection with the filing
of Tax Returns pursuant to this _Article 5_ and any Tax Audit or other
Proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation shall include the retention
and (upon the other Partys request) the provision of records and information
that are reasonably relevant to any such audit or other Proceeding and making
employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional
information and explanation of any material provided hereunder. The Parties
agree (i) to retain all books and records with respect to Tax matters
pertinent to the Company relating to any taxable period beginning before the
Closing Date until the expiration of the statute of limitations (and, to the
extent notified by the Buyer or the Seller, any extensions thereof) of the
respective taxable periods, and to abide by all record retention agreements
entered into with any Taxing Authority (any such agreements are listed in
_Schedule 5.5(a)_ hereof), and (ii) to give the other Party reasonable written
notice prior to transferring, destroying, or discarding any such books and
records and, if the other Party so requests, the Buyer or the Seller, as the
case may be, shall allow the other Party to take possession of such books and
records.

 

(b) The Seller shall have the sole right to represent the Companys
interests in any audit or examination ("Tax Audit") or Proceeding by any
Taxing Authority with respect to Tax periods or portions thereof ending before
the Closing Date and to employ counsel of its choice at its expense. In the
case of a Straddle Period, the Seller shall be entitled to participate at its
expense in any Tax Audit or Proceeding relating in any part to Taxes
attributable to the portion of such Straddle Period deemed to end before the
Closing Date and, with the written consent of the Buyer (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld), at the Sellers sole expense, may assume the control
of such entire Tax Audit or Proceeding. Neither the Buyer (or its Affiliates)
nor the Seller (or its Affiliates) may settle or otherwise dispose of any Tax
Audit or Proceeding for which the other party may have a liability under this
Agreement or retroactive or prospective tax consequence, or which may result
in an increase in eithers liability under this Agreement, without the prior
written consent of the affected party or affiliate, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld but which may be conditioned on indemnifying the
affected party or affiliate with respect to such liability.

(c) The Buyer and the Seller further agree, upon request, to use their
best efforts to obtain any certificate or other document from any Governmental
Authority or any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce, or
eliminate any Tax that could be imposed (including, but not limited to, with
respect to the transactions contemplated hereby).

 

(d) The Buyer and the Seller further agree, upon request, to provide
the other Party with all information that either Party may be required to
report pursuant to Code § 6043, or Code § 6043A, or Treasury Regulations
promulgated thereunder.

 

(e) Neither the Buyer (or its Affiliates) nor the Seller (or
its Affiliates) shall (or shall cause or permit the Company to) amend, re-
file, or otherwise modify any Tax Return relating in whole or in part to the
Company with respect to Tax periods or portions thereof ending before the
Closing Date (or with respect to any Straddle Period)

 



     |  | 
---|---|--- 
  MEMBERSHIP INTEREST PURCHASE AGREEMENT |  |

24  without the prior written consent of the other partys representative, which
consent may be withheld in the sole discretion of the representative, unless
such modification does not result in any adverse Tax consequences to such
other Party.

Section 5.6 Certain Taxes and Fees. All excise, sales, use, transfer, stamp,
documentary, filing, recordation, and other similar taxes, together with any
interest, additions, or penalties with respect thereto and any interest in
respect of such additions or penalties (the "Transfer Taxes"), resulting from
the transfer of the Company Interests pursuant to this Agreement shall be
shared equally by the Buyer and the Seller. Notwithstanding anything contained
in this _Article 5_ to the contrary, any Tax Returns that must be filed
in connection with Transfer Taxes shall be prepared and timely filed by the
Seller and the Seller shall provide the Buyer with a reasonable opportunity to
review, and provide comments to, any such Tax Returns prior to filing any such
Tax Returns.

 

Article 6. FURTHER AGREEMENTS

 

Section 6.1 Access to Information; Record Retention; Cooperation.

 

(a) Following the Closing, each Party shall afford to the other Party
and to the other Partys Affiliates, authorized accountants, counsel, and
other designated representatives reasonable access (including using reasonable
efforts to give access to third parties possessing information and
providing reasonable access to its own employees who are in possession of
relevant information) and duplicating rights during normal business hours to
all non-privileged records, books, contracts, instruments, documents,
correspondence, computer data, and other data and information (collectively,
"Information") within the possession or control of such Party or its
Affiliates, relating to the Company or its business or operations prior to the
Closing, insofar as such access is reasonably required by the other Party.
Information may be requested under this _Section 6.1(a)_ for, without
limitation, any financial reporting and accounting matters, preparing or
verifying financial statements, preparing and filing of any Tax Returns,
prosecuting any claims for refund, defending any Tax claims or assessment,
preparing securities law or exchange filings, prosecuting, defending, or
settling any litigation, Environmental Matter, or insurance claim, performing
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, and all other proper
business purposes.

 

(b) Following the Closing, each Party shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to make available to the other Party, upon
written request, such Partys and its Affiliates officers, directors,
employees, and agents to the extent that such persons may reasonably be
required in connection with any legal, administrative, or other proceedings
in which the requesting Party may from time to time be involved relating to
the Company or its businesses or operations prior to the Closing or for any
other matter referred to in  _Section 6.1(a)_.

(c) A Party providing Information or personnel to the other Party
under _Section 6.1(a)_ or _Section 6.1(b)_ shall be entitled to receive from
the recipient, upon the presentation of invoices therefor, payments for such
amounts, relating to supplies, disbursements, and other out-of-pocket
expenses, as may be reasonably incurred in providing such Information;
_provided_ , _however_ , that no such reimbursements shall be

25  required for the salary or cost of fringe benefits or similar expenses
pertaining to employees or directors of the providing Party or its Affiliates.

 

(d) Each of the Buyer and the Seller shall hold, and shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to cause their respective Affiliates,
consultants, and advisors to hold, in strict confidence all Information
concerning the other furnished to it by the other Party or the other Partys
representatives at any time prior to Closing or pursuant to this _Section
6.1_ (except to the extent that such Information (i) is or becomes generally
available to the public other than as a result of a disclosure by the
receiving Party in violation of the terms of this _Section 6.1_, (ii) was
within the possession of the receiving Party prior to it being furnished to
the receiving Party by or on behalf of the other Party pursuant hereto,
provided that the source of such information was not known by the receiving
Party at the time of receipt to be bound by a confidentiality agreement with
or other contractual, legal, or fiduciary obligation of confidentiality to the
other Party or any other party with respect to such information, or (iii) is
or becomes available to the receiving Party from a source other than the other
Party, provided that such source is not, to the Knowledge of the receiving
Party at the time of receipt, bound by a confidentiality agreement with
or other contractual, legal, or fiduciary obligation of confidentiality to
the other Party or any other party with respect to such information), and each
Party shall not release or disclose such Information to any other person,
except its auditors, attorneys, financial advisors, bankers, and other
consultants and advisors, unless compelled to disclose such Information by
judicial or administrative process or, as advised by its counsel, by other
requirements of law; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that in the case of disclosure
by a receiving Party compelled by judicial or administrative process, the
receiving Party shall, to the extent legally permissible, notify the
disclosing Party promptly of the request or requirement so that the
disclosing Party may seek, at the disclosing Partys sole cost and expense an
appropriate protective order or waive compliance with the provisions of this
_Section 6.1(d)_. If, in the absence of a protective order or the receipt of
a waiver hereunder, a Party is, on the written advice of counsel, compelled to
disclose any Information by judicial or administrative process, such Party may
so disclose the Information; _provided_ , _however_ , that, at the written
request of the disclosing Party, the receiving Party shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain, at the expense of the disclosing Party an order
or other assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded to such
portion of the Information required to be disclosed.

Section 6.2 Further Assurances. At any time and from time to time after the
Closing, as and when requested by any Party hereto and at such Partys
expense, the other Party shall promptly execute and deliver, or cause to be
executed and delivered, all such documents and instruments and shall take, or
cause to be taken, all such further or other actions as such other Party may
reasonably deem necessary or desirable to evidence and effectuate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(a) Each individual who is employed by the Company immediately prior
to the Closing Date shall remain an employee of the Company following the
Closing Date (each such employee, an "Affected Employee").

 



     |  | 
---|---|--- 
  MEMBERSHIP INTEREST PURCHASE AGREEMENT |  |

26 (b) As of the Closing, each Affected Employee shall remain eligible to
participate, without any waiting time, in welfare benefit plans currently
available to employees of the Company.

 

(c) Effective as of the Closing, the Buyer shall cause the Company to
continue to recognize all accrued and unused vacation days, holidays,
personal, sickness, and other paid time off days (including banked days) that
have accrued to Affected Employees through the Closing and which have been
reserved for in the Closing Net Asset Schedule.

(d) The Buyer acknowledges that no Affected Employee shall be
terminated solely due to the transaction contemplated by this Agreement, and,
therefore, no obligations under the Consolidated Omnibus Reconciliation Act of
1985, as amended, and the regulations and rules issued pursuant thereto
("COBRA") will arise in connection with such transaction. The Buyer shall or
shall cause the Company to meet any obligation under COBRA with respect to
qualifying events occurring after the Closing.

 

(e) The Buyer acknowledges that the Company intends to pay transaction
bonuses to certain of the Affected Employees in connection with the Closing
(the "Employee Bonuses"). The recipients and the amounts of the Employee
Bonuses are set forth on _Section 6.3(e)_ of the Disclosure Schedule. The
Buyer acknowledges that the Estimated Net Assets has been (and that the
Closing Net Assets will be) reduced by the amount of the Employee Bonuses
(including all applicable withholding and other related Taxes) regardless of
when such Employee Bonuses are paid and understands that the Company shall
pay such Employee Bonuses as directed by the Seller (even if such payment is
after the Closing Date). The Buyer agrees that the Seller shall be entitled to
all Tax benefits (including the benefit of any compensation deductions)
associated with or otherwise related to the payment of the Employee Bonuses.

 

Section 6.4 Director and Officer Insurance.

 

(a) For a period of six (6) years from and after the Closing Date, the
Company shall, and the Buyer shall cause the Company to, maintain all rights
to indemnification (including the advancement of expenses) existing in favor
of each present and former Manager and officer of the Company
(collectively, the " _Officer and Director Indemnified Parties_ "), under
their respective certificates of formation, limited liability company
agreements, or other governing documents, as applicable, as in effect as of
the Effective Time, and shall not amend, repeal or modify any provision
thereof relating to the exculpation or indemnification of any officers and/or
Managers, it being the intent of the parties that the officers and/or Managers
of the Companies shall continue to be entitled to such exculpation and
indemnification to the full extent of the Law.

 

(b) At or prior to the Closing, the Seller shall, or shall cause the
Company to purchase (at the Sellers expense) a so-called "tail" policy for
such directors and officers liability insurance covering those persons who
are currently covered by the Companys directors and officers liability
insurance policies with coverage in amount and scope at least as favorable as
the Companys existing coverage for a period of at least six (6) years after
the Closing. Any amount that remains payable by the Seller or the Company at
or after the Closing to purchase such tail policy pursuant to this _Section
6.4(b)_ will be treated as a liability for purposes of the calculation of
Closing Net Assets.

27 (c) The provisions of this _Section 6.4_ are (i) intended to be for
the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Officer and Director
Indemnified Party, and each such Persons heirs, representatives, successors
or assigns, it being expressly agreed that such Persons shall be third party
beneficiaries of this _Section 6.4_, and (ii) in addition to, and not in
substitution for, any other right to indemnification or contribution that any
such Person may have by contract or otherwise. Following the Closing, the
Buyer shall not enter into, or permit any of its Affiliates to enter into, any
merger, consolidation or similar transaction unless the Buyer and the Company
shall have ensured that the surviving or resulting entity is creditworthy and
will assume the obligations imposed by this _Section 6.4_ and the Buyer and
the Company remain liable hereunder.

agree that any dispute arising from this Agreement or the transaction
contemplated by this Agreement shall be submitted to binding arbitration,
using the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American
Arbitration Association. The parties agree that they shall attempt in good
faith to agree upon a single arbitrator to decide the matter. In the event
that after a period of fifteen (15) days after receipt of the demand for
arbitration the parties have failed to agree upon a single arbitrator, each
party shall name a single arbitrator. The two named arbitrators shall then be
responsible for identifying a third, neutral arbitrator who shall arbitrate
such dispute. Any such arbitrator shall have significant experience in
arbitrating disputes regarding mergers and acquisition transactions of a size
and nature similar to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Unless
otherwise agreed, in writing, by both parties, the arbitration shall take
place in Elkhart Country, Indiana. Each Party shall be responsible for its own
costs and fees in connection with such arbitration; provided, however, that
the arbitrator may award the prevailing party in such arbitration reasonable
legal and other professional fees incurred in connection with such
arbitration. The arbitrator shall deliver a reasoned award with respect to his
or her findings and such award, absent fraud, manifest error or bad faith,
shall be deemed a final arbitration award that is binding on each of the
Buyer and the Seller. Judgment may be entered to enforce such award in any
court of competent jurisdiction.
