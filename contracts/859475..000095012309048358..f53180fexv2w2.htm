Property or Trademarks; and (iii) the representations and warranties made by
NXP in _Section 4.21_ constitute the only representations and warranties
made by NXP with respect to Intellectual Property or Trademark matters in
connection with the Transaction. 

   

 (b) In the event (i) NXP is unable to obtain, prior to Closing, a legally binding ruling from the competent Netherlands Tax Authority (in Dutch: _Vaststellingsovereenkomst_ ) (the "Netherlands Tax Ruling") entered into by NXP for and on behalf of the Dutch Newco and the competent Netherlands Tax Authority, which provides that a disposition of any assets held by Dutch Newco at Closing which are subsequently transferred to Trident Cayman or any Affiliate of Trident Cayman within thirty (30) days after the Closing will not result in any income tax under the laws of the Netherlands _or_ (ii) the critical assumptions (in Dutch: _kritische veronderstellingen_ ) and respective terms and conditions of the Netherlands Tax Ruling are not acceptable to Trident, or that NXP can not demonstrate to the reasonable satisfaction of Trident that all critical assumptions and terms and conditions contained in the Netherlands Tax Ruling are or can be satisfied on or after Closing, then, in either such event and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the first sentence of _Section 1.10(a)_, NXP will form USIP LLC and (A) the IP Transfer and License Agreement shall be entered into between NXP and USIP LLC (and _not_ Dutch Newco), and will provide for the assignment and license of certain Intellectual Property and Trademarks to USIP LLC (and _not_ Dutch Newco); and (B) the certain Acquired Assets that would have otherwise have been transferred to Dutch Newco pursuant to _Section 1.10(a)_ shall instead be transferred to USIP LLC pursuant to one or more Pre-Closing Carve-Out Agreements, including, but not limited to, customer contracts, purchase orders related to sale of inventory and those Acquired Assets set forth in _Sections 1.4(p)_.

The Parties are aware that Continuing Employees could refuse to be transferred to the Companies or any of their Subsidiaries; _provided, however_ , that NXP shall use its reasonable best efforts to ensure that all Continuing Employees do not object to the transfer of employment to the Companies or any of their Subsidiaries. NXP shall ensure that the collective bargaining agreements applicable to the Continuing Employees listed on _Schedule 1.11(a)-2_ are acknowledged by the applicable Company or Companys Subsidiary. 

   

 (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, should any employee of NXP or its Affiliates, other than a Continuing Employee, pass to Trident, any Subsidiary of Trident, any of the Transferred Newcos, the Companies or any of their Subsidiaries, as the case may be, or should any other individual assert claims against Trident, any Subsidiary of Trident, any of the Transferred Newcos, the Companies or any of their Subsidiaries based upon the allegation that his or her employment relationship passed to the Trident, any Subsidiary of Trident, any of the Transferred Newcos, the Companies or any of their Subsidiaries, as the case may be ("TUPE Related Labor Claims"), such TUPE Related Labor Claims shall be the responsibility of NXP and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, NXP shall indemnify and hold harmless Indemnified Trident Persons, for all Damages arising out of or related to such TUPE Related Labor Claims. 

   

 1.12 _Further Assurances_. In case at any time after the Closing Date, any further action by a Party is reasonably necessary to carry out the purposes of this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements, such Party shall execute and deliver such documents and other papers and take such further actions as may be reasonably required to carry into effect the intents and purposes of this Agreement. From and after the Closing Date, NXP shall, and shall cause its Affiliates (other than the Companies or any of their Subsidiaries) to convey, transfer, and assign to the applicable Company or Subsidiary thereof, free and clear of all Encumbrances, other than Permitted Encumbrances, all rights, title and interest in any tangible or intangible rights, properties or assets then held by NXP or any such Affiliates, the conveyance, transfer or assignment of which was or is required by the covenants of NXP contained in this Agreement. 

   

 (b) If after the Agreement Date, Trident identifies any Contract not transferred pursuant to _Section 1.4(b)_ that is Related to the Business and that Trident reasonably believes is of material benefit to the operation of the Business, NXP shall, after written request by Trident, use commercially reasonable efforts (subject to _Section 1.13_) to extend the benefit of such Contract to the Transferred Newcos or Trident, including by potentially partitioning such Contract, acting as an agent for the Transferred Newcos or Trident under such Contract or assisting the Transferred Newcos or Trident in negotiating and entering into a replacement for such Contract on commercial terms. Each Party shall bear its own costs and expenses in pursuing any arrangement contemplated by this _Section 1.12(b)_. 

   ##### 

  

   

 (c) Any such action required to be taken under this _Section 1.12_ following the date that is twelve (12) months after the Closing shall be required to be taken by a Party only at the written request of the other party which other party shall be responsible for all costs and expenses associated therewith. No such action shall be required to be taken by a Party more than 36 months following the Closing. 

  

 1.13 _Nonassignability of Assets_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement or in any of the Pre-Closing Carve-Out Agreements, to the extent that the sale, assignment, sublease, transfer, conveyance or delivery or attempted sale, sublease, assignment, transfer, conveyance or delivery to a Company or to Trident of any asset that would be an Acquired Asset or Transferred IP, or any claim or right or any benefit arising thereunder or resulting therefrom, is prohibited by any Applicable Law or would require any Governmental Authorizations or third party authorizations, approvals, consents or waivers, and such authorizations, approvals, consents or waivers shall not have been obtained prior to the Closing, the Closing shall proceed without the sale, assignment, sublease, transfer, conveyance or delivery of such asset unless such failure causes a failure of any of the conditions to Closing set forth in _Article 9_, in which event the Closing shall proceed only if the failed condition is waived by the Party or Parties entitled to the benefit thereof. In the event that the Closing proceeds without the transfer, sublease or assignment of any such asset, then during the period not to exceed twelve (12) months following the Closing, NXP shall use commercially reasonable efforts, with the cooperation of Trident, to promptly obtain such authorizations, approvals, consents or waivers;  _provided, however_ , that none of NXP or Trident or any of their respective Affiliates shall be required to pay any consideration to obtain any contractual consent or waiver, other than (a) any  _de minimis_ fees, expenses or other consideration or (b) any such fees, expenses or other consideration required to be paid pursuant to the express provisions of the Contract requiring such consent, which consideration, fees or expenses shall be paid by NXP, nor shall any such Party be required to pay any amounts in respect of any Governmental Authorization other than filing, recordation or similar fees which shall be shared equally by NXP and Trident. Pending such authorization, approval, consent or waiver, the Parties shall cooperate with each other in any mutually agreeable, reasonable and lawful arrangements designed to provide to the relevant Company or Trident the benefits of use of such asset. Once authorization, approval, consent or waiver for the sale, assignment, sublease, transfer, conveyance or delivery of any such asset not sold, assigned, subleased, transferred, conveyed or delivered at the Closing is obtained, NXP shall or shall cause the relevant Affiliates to, assign, transfer, convey and deliver such asset to the relevant Company or Trident at no additional cost. To the extent that any such asset cannot be transferred or the full benefits of use of any such asset cannot be provided to one of the Companies (or a Subsidiary thereof) or Trident or one of its subsidiaries following the Closing, then Trident (or a Subsidiary thereof) and NXP (or any Affiliate thereof holding such asset) shall enter into such lawful arrangements (including subleasing, sublicensing or subcontracting) as will provide to the Parties hereto the economic and operational equivalent, to the extent permitted and reasonably practicable, of obtaining such authorization, approval, consent or waiver and the performance by one of the Companies (or a Subsidiary thereof) of the obligations thereunder. NXP and its Affiliates shall hold in trust for and pay to Trident promptly upon receipt thereof, all income, proceeds and other monies received by NXP or any of its Affiliates (net of any Taxes and any other costs imposed upon NXP or any of its Affiliates) that would have been received by Trident in the absence of the arrangements under this _Section 1.13_. 

    ##### 

 

   

 1.14 _Adjustments, Prorations_. In the event that the Closing Date does not occur on the last Business Day of a month, adjustments will be made to reflect certain rents, prepaid expenses, accrued but unpaid expenses and similar items which will be prorated as of the Closing Date after the portion of the month on and prior to the Closing Date (which will be for the account of NXP) and the portion of the month after the Closing Date (which will be for the account of Trident). The relevant adjustment shall be effected by deducting from (in the case of an adjustment to the credit of NXP) or adding to (in the case of an adjustment to the credit of Trident) the Post-Closing Statement.

Each of the Transferred Newcos, the Companies and each of their respective Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed to do business, and is in good standing, in jurisdictions that recognize the concept, as a foreign Entity in each jurisdiction where the character of the properties 

   ##### 

  

    

owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of its activities makes
such qualification or licensing necessary, except where the failure to be so
qualified and in good standing, individually or in the aggregate with any
such other failures, would not reasonably be expected to have more than an
immaterial adverse effect on the Business taken as a whole. None of the
Transferred Newcos, the Companies or any of their respective Subsidiaries is
in violation of any of its Charter Documents. 

   

 (b) _Power and Authority_. Each of the Transferred Newcos, the Companies and each of their respective Subsidiaries has all requisite corporate power and authority to enter into, execute, deliver and perform its obligations under each of the Ancillary Agreements to which it is or will be a party and to consummate the Transaction. The Transaction and the execution, delivery and performance by the Transferred Newcos, the Companies and each of their respective Subsidiaries of the Ancillary Agreements to which they are or will be party and all other agreements, transactions and actions contemplated thereby, have been duly and validly approved and authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Transferred Newcos, any Company and any applicable Subsidiary, and no other corporate action on the part of NXP, the Transferred Newcos, the Companies or any Subsidiary is required in connection therewith. 

   

 (c) _Enforceability_. Each of the Ancillary Agreements to which any of the Transferred Newcos, the Companies or any of their Subsidiaries is a party are, or when executed by the parties thereto, will be, valid and binding obligations of the Transferred Newcos, such Company or Subsidiary, as applicable, enforceable against it in accordance with their respective terms, subject to the effect of (i) applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws now or hereafter in effect relating to rights of creditors generally and (ii) rules of law and equity governing specific performance, injunctive relief and other equitable remedies. 

   

 (d) _No Consents; Conflicts_. No consent, approval, order, authorization, release or waiver of, or registration, declaration or filing with, any Governmental Authority, is necessary or required to be made or obtained by the Transferred Newcos, the Companies or any of their Subsidiaries to enable them to lawfully execute and deliver, enter into, and perform under each of the Ancillary Agreements to which any of them are party or to consummate the Transaction, (assuming, for the purpose of this _Section 4.1_, that following the Closing the Transferred Newcos, the Companies and their respective Subsidiaries will not be Subsidiaries of NXP), except (i) such filings and notifications as may be required to be made in connection with the Transaction under the HSR Act and other applicable Antitrust Laws set forth on _Schedule 4.1(d)(i)_ of the NXP Disclosure Schedule ( _provided, however_ , that _Schedule 4.1(d)(i)_ may be updated by NXP, with the consent of Trident (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) at any time prior to October 31, 2009 to reflect further analysis of applicable Antitrust Laws and any required filings and notifications) and the expiration or early termination of applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act and such Antitrust Laws (the "Antitrust Approvals"), (ii) as otherwise set forth on _Schedule 4.1(d)(i)_ of the NXP Disclosure Schedule or (iii) those consents, approvals, orders, authorizations, releases, waivers, registrations, declarations or filings the failure of which to obtain or make would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to be material to any Transferred Newcos, the Companies and their Subsidiaries ability to 

   ##### 

  

    

consummate the Transaction or to perform their obligations under the Ancillary
Agreements to which they are or will be a party or to have an adverse effect
on the Business that is not immaterial. Neither the execution and delivery by
the Transferred Newcos, the Companies or any of their Subsidiaries of any of
the Ancillary Agreements, nor the consummation of the Transaction or any
other transaction contemplated thereby (assuming, for the purpose of this 
_Section 4.1_, that following the Closing the Transferred Newcos, the
Companies and their respective Subsidiaries will not be Subsidiaries of NXP),
conflicts with or violates or results in any violation of or default under
(with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) or gives rise to a right
of termination, cancellation, modification or acceleration of any obligation
or loss of any benefit under: (a) any provision of the Charter Documents of
any Transferred Newco, any of the Companies or their Subsidiaries, each as
currently in effect; (b) assuming the receipt of all consents, approvals,
orders, authorizations, releases and waivers and the making of all
registrations, declarations and filings set forth on _Schedule 4.1(d)(i) _of

NXP Disclosure Schedule and in the case of clause (b) or (c), other than such
conflicts, violations, defaults, terminations, cancellations, modifications,
accelerations or losses that, individually or in the aggregate, would not
reasonably be expected to be material to, or to delay, any Transferred
Newcos, the Companies and their Subsidiaries ability to consummate the
Transaction or to perform their obligations under the Ancillary Agreements to
which they are or will be a party or to have an adverse effect on the
Business that is not immaterial.

 7.12 _Stockholders  Meeting_. 

   

 (a) Trident shall take all action necessary under all Applicable Laws to call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of Tridents Stockholders to vote on the issuance of the Trident Common Stock to NXP as contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as practicable following SEC clearance of the Proxy Statement (the "Stockholders Meeting"). Trident shall use all reasonable efforts to solicit from its stockholders proxies in favor of the approval of the Charter Amendment and the issuance of the Trident Common Stock to NXP as contemplated by this Agreement (subject to Tridents right to effect a change in Board Recommendation in accordance with the terms of this Agreement). Trident shall ensure that all proxies solicited by or on behalf of Trident in connection with the Stockholders Meeting are solicited in compliance with all Applicable Laws. NXP may 

   ##### 

  

   

require Trident to adjourn or postpone the Stockholders Meeting one (1) time
for a period not exceeding thirty (30) days. 

   

 (b) Subject to _Section 7.12(c)_: (i) the Proxy Statement shall include a statement to the effect that Tridents Board of Directors recommends that Tridents Stockholders vote to approve the Charter Amendment and the issuance of Trident Common Stock to NXP as contemplated by this Agreement at the Stockholders Meeting (such recommendation being referred to as the "Board Recommendation"); and (ii) the Board Recommendation shall not be withdrawn or modified in a manner adverse to NXP and Tridents Board of Directors shall not publicly propose to withdraw or to qualify or modify in a manner adverse to NXP, the Board Recommendation. Nothing in this Agreement shall preclude (A) Trident from making any public disclosure of any material facts, including but not limited to the fact that an Acquisition Proposal has been submitted to Trident, if Tridents Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with Tridents outside legal counsel, that such disclosure would be reasonably expected to constitute a breach of its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law, or (B) Tridents Board of Directors from taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act with regard to an Acquisition Proposal; _provided, however_ , that if such disclosure has the effect of withdrawing or adversely qualifying or modifying the Board Recommendation, NXP shall have the right (to the extent provided in _Section 10.1(e)_) to terminate this Agreement under _Section 10.1(e)_ and receive the termination fee contemplated under _Section 10.4_ from Trident. 

   

 (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, at any time before the issuance of Trident Common Stock to NXP as contemplated by this Agreement is approved by the applicable Required Stockholder Approvals, the Board Recommendation may be withdrawn or qualified or modified in a manner adverse to NXP, if Tridents Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consulting with outside legal counsel that such withdrawal, qualification or modification would be required by its fiduciary obligations to Tridents Stockholders under Applicable Laws. Trident shall provide NXP with at least seventy-two (72) hours notice (the "Notice Period", which may run concurrently with any notice required under _Section 10.1(h)_ ) to the effect that absent any revision to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Tridents Board of Directors has resolved to effect a withdrawal or modification of the Board Recommendation and/or to terminate this Agreement, which notice shall specify in reasonable detail the basis for such withdrawal, qualification or modification of the Board Recommendation or termination, including the identity of any party making a Superior Offer and the material terms thereof. During the Notice Period, Trident shall, and shall cause its financial and legal advisors to, (1) negotiate with NXP and any representative or agent of NXP (including any director or officer of NXP) (collectively, "NXP Representatives") in good faith (to the extent NXP desires to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement such that Tridents Board of Directors would not effect a withdrawal, qualification or modification of the Board Recommendation and/or terminate this Agreement, and (2) permit NXP and the NXP Representatives to make a presentation to Tridents Board of Directors regarding this Agreement and any adjustments with respect thereto (to the extent NXP desires to make such presentation); _provided, that,_ in the event of any material or substantive revisions to any Acquisition Proposal that Tridents Board of Directors has determined to be 

   ##### 

  

   

a Superior Offer, Trident shall be required to deliver a new written notice
to NXP. In determining whether to withdraw or to qualify or modify the Board
Recommendation and/or terminate this Agreement, Tridents Board of Directors
shall take into account any changes to the terms of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement proposed by NXP in response to such notice. 

   

 (d) Prior to a termination of this Agreement, Tridents obligation to call, give notice of, convene and hold the Stockholders Meeting in accordance with _Section 7.12(a)_ shall not be limited or otherwise affected by the commencement, disclosure, making, announcement or submission of any Superior Offer or other Acquisition Proposal, or by any withdrawal, qualification or modification of the Board Recommendation. 

  

 7.13 _Employee Equity_. 

   

 (a) Trident agrees that, at the Stockholders Meeting, it will submit for approval to Tridents Stockholders, a new omnibus employee equity incentive plan in the form attached as  _Exhibit N_ with the number of shares of Trident Common Stock available for issuance thereunder to be mutually agreed upon by Trident and NXP within thirty (30) days after the Agreement Date, under which Continuing Employees, as well as employees of Trident and its Subsidiaries (other than the Companies and their Subsidiaries), will be eligible to receive awards (the "New Trident Equity Plan"), and, in connection with the initial awards under the New Trident Equity Plan, that it will consult in good faith with NXP regarding award levels and terms so as to appropriately incentivize employees. Awards under the New Trident Equity Plan shall be made following the completion of the Option Exchange contemplated in  _Section 7.13(b)_ by the Compensation Committee of the Tridents Board of Directors (as reconstituted in connection with the Transaction). 

   

 (b) As promptly as practicable following the Closing, subject to receipt of any required stockholder approval, Trident will launch an offer to employee holders of stock options, offering to exchange certain options to purchase shares of Trident Common Stock for a lesser number of replacement options to purchase shares of Trident Common Stock to be granted under the New Trident Equity Plan (the "Option Exchange"). Trident agrees that it shall consult in good faith with NXP in determining which options will be eligible to participate in and the terms of the Option Exchange. 

   

 (c) To the extent that any unvested options to purchase shares of Trident Common Stock under any Trident Stock Plan remain outstanding immediately following the completion of the Option Exchange, Trident will take into account such unvested equity grants in determining the number of equity awards to be granted to employees of Trident and its Subsidiaries (other than the Continuing Employees) as contemplated in clause (a) above. 

  

 7.14 _No Shop_.

_bona fide_ written Acquisition Proposal, not solicited in violation of this
_Section 7.14_, that Tridents Board of Directors determines in good faith
after consultation with Union Square Advisors or another financial advisor of

obligations to Tridents stockholders under Applicable Laws; (B)
Trident receives from such Person an executed confidentiality agreement not

Person, Trident furnishes or makes available such non-public information to

inquiry; and (ii) the status and material terms and conditions of

Each Claim Notice shall describe the claim in reasonable detail, including the amount of the Damages relating thereto (if quantifiable), the event or occurrence giving rise thereto and the basis for such claim for indemnification. 

   

 (b) If any claim or demand by an Indemnified Person under this _Article 11_ relates to a Third-Party Claim filed or made against an Indemnified Person, the Indemnifying Party may elect at any time to negotiate a settlement or a compromise of such action or claim or to defend such action or claim, in each case at its sole cost and expense (subject to _Section 11.4(c)_ ) and with its own counsel. If (i) within thirty (30) days of receipt from an Indemnified Person of any Claim Notice with respect to a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party advises such Indemnified Person in writing that the Indemnifying Party will not elect to defend, settle or compromise such action or claim or (B) fails to make such an election in writing; or (ii) after assuming the defense of a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party fails to take reasonable steps necessary to defend diligently such Third-Party Claim within ten (10) Business Days after receiving written notice from the Indemnified Person to the effect that the Indemnifying Party has so failed, such Indemnified Person may (subject to the Indemnifying Partys continuing right of election in the preceding sentence), at its option, defend, settle or otherwise compromise or pay such action or claim; _provided_ that any such settlement or compromise shall be permitted hereunder only with the written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned; and _provided further_  that any such settlement or compromise shall not be determinative of the existence of or amount of Damages relating to such matter, except with the consent of the Indemnifying Party. Unless and until the Indemnifying Party makes an election in accordance with this _Section 11.4(b)_ to defend, settle or compromise such action, all of the Indemnified Persons reasonable costs and expenses arising out of the defense, settlement or compromise of any such action or claim shall be Damages subject to

indemnification hereunder to the extent provided herein. Each Indemnified
Person shall make available to the Indemnifying Party all information
available to such Indemnified Person relating to such Third-Party Claim. In
addition, the parties shall render to each other such assistance as may
reasonably be requested in order to ensure the proper and adequate defense
of any such Third-Party Claim. The party in charge of the defense shall keep
the other parties fully apprised at all times as to the status of the defense
or any settlement negotiations with respect thereto. If the Indemnifying
Party elects to defend any such Third-Party Claim, then the Indemnified
Person shall be entitled to participate in such defense with counsel, at
such Indemnified Persons sole cost and expense (unless (i) both the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Person are named parties to the
proceeding, and under applicable standards of professional conduct, an actual
or potential conflict between the positions of the Indemnifying Party and the
Indemnified Person that would preclude or render inadvisable joint
representation of such parties, in which case the Indemnifying Party shall be
liable for the fees and expenses hereunder with respect to one law firm, in

 (a) Each Indemnified Person shall be obligated in connection with any claim for indemnification under this _Article 11_ to use all commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any insurance proceeds available to such Indemnified Person with regard to the applicable claims. The amount which the Indemnifying Party is or may be required to pay to any Indemnified Person pursuant to this _Article 11_ shall be reduced (retroactively, if necessary) by any indemnification or insurance proceeds actually recovered by such Indemnified Person related to such Damages (net of any out-of-pocket costs reasonably incurred in connection therewith). If an Indemnified Person shall have received the payment required by this Agreement from the Indemnifying Party in respect of Damages and shall subsequently receive insurance proceeds in respect of such Damages, then such Indemnified Person shall promptly repay to the Indemnifying Party a sum equal to the amount of such insurance proceeds actually received. 

   

 (b) Indemnification payments under this Agreement shall be paid by the Indemnifying Party without reduction for any Tax Benefits available to the Indemnified Person. To the extent, however, that the Indemnified Person recognizes Tax Benefits as a result of any Damages, the Indemnified Person shall pay the amount of such Tax Benefits (but not in excess of the indemnification payment or payments actually received from the Indemnifying Party with respect to such Damages) to the Indemnifying Party as such Tax Benefits are actually recognized by the Indemnified Person. For this purpose, the Indemnified Person shall be deemed to recognize a tax benefit ("Tax Benefit") with respect to a taxable year if, and to the extent that, the Indemnified Persons cumulative liability for Taxes through the end of such taxable year, calculated by excluding any Tax items attributable to the Damages from all taxable years, exceeds the Indemnified Persons actual cumulative liability for Taxes through the end of such taxable year, calculated by taking into account any Tax items attributable to the Damages for all taxable years (to the extent permitted by relevant Tax law and treating such Tax items as the last items claimed for any taxable year). 

   

 (c) In addition to the requirements of _Section 11.5(a)_, each Indemnified Entity shall be obligated in connection with any claim for indemnification under this _Article 11_ to use all commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate Damages upon and after becoming aware of any event which could reasonably be expected to give rise to such Damages; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the Indemnified Person shall not be required to incur any non- _de minimis_ costs or expenses that are not reimbursed by the Indemnifying Party. 

   

 (d) The Indemnifying Party shall be subrogated to any right of action which the Indemnified Person may have against any third party with respect to any matter giving rise to a claim for indemnification hereunder. 

   

 (e) The indemnification provided in this _Article 11_ shall be the exclusive post-Closing remedy available to any party hereto with respect to any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement in this Agreement, the IP Transfer and License Agreement and the Pre-Closing Carve-out Agreements, except as otherwise expressly provided herein or therein; _provided, however_ , that this _Section 11.5(e)_ shall not 

   ##### 

  

    

apply or limit (i) the remedy available to either party hereto with respect to
any fraudulent act or willful breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement in this Agreement, by the other party hereto or (ii)
the rights of the parties to any adjustment contemplated by _Section 2.2_ of
this Agreement. 

   

 (f) The parties agree that any indemnification payment made pursuant to this Agreement shall be treated as an adjustment to the Exchange Consideration, unless otherwise required by Applicable Law. If an Indemnified Person incurs a Tax liability under Applicable Law due to receipt or accrual of the right to receive all or any portion of an indemnification payment pursuant to this Agreement, such indemnification payment shall be made on a Grossed-Up Basis. 

   

 (g) All indemnity payments under this Agreement shall be payable in United States dollars in immediately available funds. If any indemnification claims are incurred in a currency other than United States dollars, then such amount denominated in such foreign currency shall be converted into an amount denominated in United States dollars using the noon buying rate for such foreign currency as certified by the New York Federal Reserve Bank on the Business Day immediately preceding the date on which such payment is paid.
