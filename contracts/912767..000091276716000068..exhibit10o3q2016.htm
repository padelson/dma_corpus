rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises and be subject to all
the obligations, restrictions, disabilities, liabilities, debts and duties of
the Company and Merger Sub. From and after the Effective Time, the Company
shall continue as the surviving corporation in the Merger (the Company, as the

shall cease.

case, that the name of the corporation set forth therein shall be changed to
the name of the Company.

1.4 Directors and Officers. The directors and officers of Merger Sub, in each

Each of the Closing Payments shall be made in the amounts and as set forth in
the Pre-Closing Statement delivered pursuant to Section 2.5(a).

2.3 Effect on Company Securities.

(a)As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of any Equity Holder, and subject to the other provisions of this
Section 2.3:

(i)Each issued and outstanding share of Preferred Stock shall be (x) converted
into (1) the right to receive an amount equal to the Per Share Preferred
Consideration set forth on the Pre-Closing Statement, (2) the right to receive
an amount equal to the Per Share Common Consideration as set forth on the Pre-
Closing Statement, (3) the contingent right to receive its pro rata portion of
an upward adjustment of the Purchase Price calculated (and distributed) as set
forth in Section 2.5 (and the contingent liability for its pro rata portion of
any downward adjustment of the Purchase Price calculated (and payable) as set
forth in Section 2.5) and (y) immediately canceled.

(ii)Each issued and outstanding share of Common Stock shall be (x) converted
into (1) the right to receive an amount equal to the Per Share Common
Consideration set forth on the Pre-Closing Statement, and (2) the contingent
right to receive its pro rata portion of an upward adjustment of the Purchase
Price calculated (and distributed) as set forth in Section 2.5 (and the
contingent liability for its pro rata portion of any downward adjustment of
the Purchase Price calculated (and payable) as set forth in Section 2.5), and
(y) immediately canceled.

(iii)Each share of Common Stock or Preferred Stock that is owned by Purchaser,
Merger Sub or the Company (as treasury stock or otherwise) or any of their
respective direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiaries shall be cancelled and
retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in
exchange therefor.





\- 4 - 

(iv)Each outstanding option or warrant relating to the Company Stock shall be
cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be
delivered in exchange therefor.

(b)As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of any Equity Holder, each share of common stock of Merger Sub issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted
into one newly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock of
the Surviving Corporation, and such common stock of the Surviving Corporation
issued on that conversion will constitute all of the issued and outstanding
shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation immediately following the
Effective Time.

2.4 Exchange of Certificates.

(a)Prior to the Closing, Purchaser, the Representative, the Company and the
Escrow Agent (in such capacity, the "Exchange Agent") will deliver an Exchange
Agent Agreement in a form reasonably acceptable to the Parties (the "Exchange
Agreement"). Pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, the Exchange Agent will act
as exchange agent in connection with the Merger to receive the Letters of
Transmittal and Certificates and, for the benefit of the Equity Holders, the
Merger Consideration.

(b)Prior to receiving any Closing Payment, each holder of record of a
certificate or certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented issued and outstanding shares of Company Stock (the
"Certificates") shall have delivered to the Exchange Agent (i) a properly
completed and duly executed letter of transmittal and release substantially in
the form set forth in Exhibit A (a "Letter of Transmittal") and (ii) the
Certificates, if any, held of record by such holder. Such Letter of
Transmittal shall have been previously delivered by Representative or its
designee to such holder along with instructions thereto and a notice to the
effect that delivery of the Certificates shall be effected, and risk of loss
and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates to the Exchange Agent. Upon surrender of a Certificate to the
Exchange Agent, together with such Letter of Transmittal, duly executed, the
holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor
the Merger Consideration at such times and in such amounts as determined
herein, and the Certificate so surrendered shall be canceled. If any portion
of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other than the Person in
whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered (other than as
contemplated by Section 2.6 with respect to Schultz), it shall be a condition
of exchange that such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise in
proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such exchange shall
pay any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the exchange to a Person
other than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the
reasonable satisfaction of the Company and Purchaser that such Tax has been
paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section
2.4, each Certificate shall be deemed as of the Effective Time of the Merger
to represent only the right to receive, upon surrender of such Certificate in
accordance with this Section 2.4(b), the Merger Consideration. If any
certificate evidencing any share of Company Stock shall have been lost, stolen
or destroyed, the Company or Purchaser may, in its discretion and as a
condition precedent to the issuance of any consideration pursuant to this
Section 2.4, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed





\- 5 - 

certificate to provide an appropriate affidavit (providing indemnification
and/or insurance) with respect to such certificate (a "Lost Stock Affidavit").

(c)All Closing Payments paid (together with the contingent right to receive
(if, when and to the extent payable) the remaining Merger Consideration) upon
the surrender of Certificates or delivery of a Lost Stock Affidavit in
accordance with the terms of this Article II shall be deemed to have been
exchanged and paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares
represented by such Certificates, and at the Effective Time, the stock
transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no
further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation of the shares of Company Stock that were issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they
shall be canceled and exchanged for a portion of the Merger Consideration as
provided in this Article II.

(d)At any time following the six (6) month anniversary of the Closing Date,
the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the Exchange Agent to
deliver to it any funds (including any interest received with respect thereto)
on deposit with the Exchange Agent and which have not been disbursed to the
Equity Holders, and thereafter, such Equity Holders shall be entitled to look
only to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or
other similar laws) as general creditors thereof with respect to the payment
of any Merger Consideration that would otherwise be payable upon surrender of
any Certificates held by such Stockholders, as determined pursuant to this
Agreement, without any interest thereon. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by
such Stockholders at such time at which such amounts would otherwise escheat
to or become property of any Governmental Authority shall become, to the
extent permitted by applicable Laws, the property of Purchaser, free and clear
of all claims or interests of any Person previously entitled thereto.

2.5 Final Adjustment of the Purchase Price.

(a)Pre-Closing Statement. Not later than three (3) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to Purchaser (i) a statement (the
"Pre-Closing Statement"), substantially similar in form to the illustrative
example set forth on Exhibit B, setting forth (A) the Company's good faith
estimate of Working Capital as of the close of business on the Closing Date
(the "Estimated Closing Date Working Capital"), (B) the Company's calculation
of the Company Transaction Expenses, (C) the Company's calculation of Closing
Date Indebtedness, (D) the Company's good faith estimate of the Closing Cash
as of the close of business on the Closing Date (the "Estimated Closing
Cash"), (E) the Per Share Preferred Consideration (calculated with respect to
the shares of Preferred Stock based on the dates of issuance of such shares of
Preferred Stock), (F) the Per Share Common Consideration, (G) the number of
Fully Diluted Shares, (H) the number of Fully Diluted Preferred Shares, (I)
the amount, and the calculation of, the Company's good faith estimate of the
Purchase Price derived from the items described in this Section
2.5(a)(i)(B)-(D) and determined without reference to Working Capital (such
resulting calculation, the "Estimated Purchase Price") (provided that, if the
Working Capital Target exceeds such calculation of the Estimated Closing Date
Working Capital, then (x) the Estimated Purchase Price shall be reduced by the
amount of such excess plus One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) and (y) the amount
resulting





\- 6 - 

therefrom shall be the Estimated Purchase Price for purposes of this
Agreement), and (J) the amount, and the calculation of, the Closing Payments
derived from the Estimated Purchase Price, (ii) a certificate signed by an
authorized executive officer of the Company that the Pre-Closing Statement and
the determinations and calculations contained therein were prepared in a
manner consistent with the relevant definitions set forth in this Agreement
and in accordance with the Accounting Rules, and (iii) the Pay-Off Letters.
The Company shall provide Purchaser with reasonable access during normal
business hours to the books and records of the Company, and other Company
documents, to review the information set forth in the Pre-Closing Statement
prior to the Closing Date; provided, however, that (x) such access shall not
be a condition to Closing under this Agreement and (y) Purchaser and Merger
Sub shall be entitled to rely on the Pre-Closing Statement in making payments
under Section 2.2 and Purchaser and Merger Sub shall not be responsible for
the calculations or the determinations regarding such calculations in such
Pre-Closing Statement.

(b)Final Purchase Price Adjustment. The Purchase Price shall be adjusted
following the Closing based on the difference between the Final Closing Date
Purchase Price (as determined in accordance with this Section 2.5) and the
Estimated Purchase Price, and payment shall be made in respect of any such
post-Closing adjustment as set forth in Section 2.5(e).

(c)Closing Statement. No later than sixty (60) days after the Closing Date,
Purchaser shall cause to be prepared in good faith and delivered to the
Representative a statement (the "Closing Statement"), substantially similar in
form to the Pre-Closing Statement, setting forth Purchaser's calculation of
(i) Working Capital as of the close of business on the Closing Date, (ii) the
amount, if any, by which such calculation of Working Capital exceeds the
Working Capital Target or the amount, if any, by which the Working Capital
Target exceeds such calculation of Working Capital, (iii) each of the items
described in Section 2.5(a)(i)(B)-(H) above, as of the close of business on
the Closing Date and (iv) the amount, and calculation of, the Purchase Price
derived solely from the foregoing items (collectively, the "Closing Date
Purchase Price"), together with a certificate signed by an authorized
executive officer of Purchaser that the Closing Statement and the
determinations and calculations contained therein were prepared in a manner
consistent with the relevant definitions set forth in this Agreement and in
accordance with the Accounting Rules. If Purchaser fails to deliver the
Closing Statement within such sixty (60) day period, then in addition to any
other rights the Representative may have under this Agreement, the
Representative shall have the right to elect that the Estimated Purchase Price
(as adjusted to incorporate the amount, if any, by which the Estimated Closing
Date Working Capital exceeds the Working Capital Target or the amount, if any,
by which the Working Capital Target exceeds the Estimated Closing Date Working
Capital) be deemed to be the amount of the Final Closing Date Purchase Price
and be final and binding and used for purposes of calculating the adjustment
pursuant to Section 2.5(b) above. The Parties acknowledge that no adjustments
may be made to the Working Capital Target.

(d)Disputes.

(i)The Representative shall have sixty (60) days to review the Closing
Statement. If Representative disagrees in good faith with Purchaser's
calculation of the Closing Date Purchase Price as set forth in the Closing
Statement, the Representative may, within such sixty (60) day period, deliver
a written notice to Purchaser (a "Dispute Notice")





\- 7 - 

disagreeing with such calculation and, to the extent the Representative is
reasonably able to so specify, setting forth the Representative's good faith
basis for such disagreement, and the Representative shall be deemed to have
agreed with all other items contained in the Closing Statement and the
calculations of the Closing Date Purchase Price set forth therein (except to
the extent specified in such Dispute Notice or related to the items or amount
subject to such disagreement). If the Representative fails to deliver such a
Dispute Notice during such sixty (60) day period, the Representative shall
have waived its rights to contest the Closing Statement and the calculations
of the Closing Date Purchase Price set forth therein shall be deemed to be
final and binding upon the Parties and such amount shall be used for purposes
of calculating the adjustment pursuant to Section 2.5(b) above.

(ii)If a Dispute Notice is duly delivered pursuant to Section 2.5(d)(i), the
Representative and Purchaser shall, during the thirty (30) days following such
delivery, attempt to reach agreement on the disputed items or amounts to
determine, as may be required, the amount of the Closing Date Purchase Price.
Any such agreement shall be in writing and shall be final and binding upon the
Parties. If during such thirty (30) day period, the Representative and
Purchaser are unable to reach such agreement, then all amounts and items
remaining in dispute shall be submitted by the Representative and Purchaser to
KPMG LLP (US) (the "Accounting Referee") for a determination resolving such
disputed items or amounts for the purpose of calculating the Closing Date
Purchase Price (it being agreed and understood that the Accounting Referee
shall act as an arbitrator to determine such disputed items or amounts (and,
as a result thereof, the Closing Date Purchase Price) and shall do so based
solely on presentations and information provided by Purchaser and the
Representative and not by independent review). Purchaser and the
Representative shall agree, promptly after the appointment of the Accounting
Referee, on the process and procedures governing the resolution of any
disputed items by the Accounting Referee; provided, that if such Parties fail
to agree on such process and procedures within ten (10) days following the
appointment of the Accounting Referee, then such process and procedures shall
be determined by the Accounting Referee (it being agreed and understood that
such process shall include, at a minimum, appropriate measures to ensure
compliance by the applicable parties with Section 2.5(f) and the process and
procedures for the submission of any written presentations by the
Representative and Purchaser and the time periods thereof). In conducting its
review, the Accounting Referee shall consider only those items or amounts in
the Closing Statement and Purchaser's calculations of the Closing Date
Purchase Price as to which the Representative has disagreed pursuant to the
Dispute Notice. The scope of the disputes to be resolved by the Accounting
Referee shall be limited to fixing mathematical errors and determining whether
the items in dispute were determined in accordance with this Agreement
(including the definition of the terms Working Capital, Closing Cash, Closing
Date Indebtedness, Closing Date Indebtedness to be Repaid, Company Transaction
Expenses and the Accounting Rules) and the Accounting Referee is not to make
any other determination. The Accounting Referee shall deliver to the
Representative and Purchaser, as promptly as practicable (but in any case no
later than thirty (30) days after the date of engagement of the Accounting
Referee), a report setting forth its calculations of the Closing Date Purchase
Price, which amount shall not be less than the applicable amount thereof shown
in Purchaser's calculation delivered pursuant to Section 2.5(c) nor more than
the amount





\- 8 - 

thereof shown in the Representative's calculation delivered pursuant to
Section 2.5(d)(i). Such report shall be final and binding upon the Parties and
shall be used for purposes of calculating the adjustment pursuant to Section
2.5(b) above. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the dispute
resolution mechanism contained in this Section 2.5(d) shall be the exclusive
mechanism for resolving disputes regarding the Purchase Price adjustment, if
any, and neither the Equity Holders nor any Purchaser Indemnified Party shall
be entitled to indemnification for Losses pursuant to Article IX, Section 10.2
or any other provision of this Agreement to the extent such Losses are taken
into account in the determination of the Closing Date Purchase Price or for
matters expressly raised by the Parties and adjudicated on by the Accounting
Referee in connection with the determination of the Closing Date Purchase
Price. Judgment may be entered upon the determination of the Accounting
Referee in any court having jurisdiction over the party against which such
determination is to be enforced. The fees, costs and expenses of the
Accounting Referee shall be borne by the Parties in proportion to the relative
amount each Party's determination has been modified, with any amount to be
borne by the Equity Holders to be paid first out of the Representative Expense
Fund and, if the Representative Expense Fund is exhausted, by the Equity
Holders on a several (and not joint and several) basis based on their
allocable share of the Merger Consideration paid as of such date (and in all
cases subject to the limitations set forth in Section 9.5(b)). For example, if
the Representative challenges the calculation of the Closing Date Purchase
Price by an amount of One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000), but the
Accounting Referee determines that the Equity Holders have a valid claim for
only Sixty Thousand Dollars ($60,000), the Equity Holders shall bear forty
percent (40%) of the fees and expenses of the Accounting Referee and Purchaser
shall bear the other sixty percent (60%) of such fees and expenses.

(e)Final Closing Date Purchase Price Adjustment. Following the time that the
Closing Date Purchase Price is finally determined pursuant to this Section 2.5
(such finally determined amount, the "Final Closing Date Purchase Price"),
payment shall be made as follows:

(i)If the Final Closing Date Purchase Price is greater than the Estimated
Purchase Price, Purchaser shall, within five (5) Business Days after the Final
Closing Date Purchase Price is determined pursuant to this Section 2.5, pay at
the direction of the Representative, for further payment by the Exchange Agent
to the Equity Holders, without interest and rounded to the nearest cent, by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to the Exchange Agent pursuant to
wire instructions provided in writing by the Representative, an amount equal
to such excess. In the event that the aggregate Final Closing Date Purchase
Price is not adequate to pay the aggregate Preferred Redemption Amount, then
any payments made pursuant to this Section 2.5(e)(i) shall be made to the
Preferred Stockholders pro rata in proportion to the full amounts to which
they would otherwise be respectively entitled if the Final Closing Date
Purchase Price was equal to the Preferred Redemption Amount, until such time
as the entire Preferred Redemption Amount has been paid. After the payment of
the entire Preferred Redemption Amount, any payments made pursuant to this
Section 2.5(e)(i) shall be paid to the Equity Holders pro rata based on the
number of Fully Diluted Shares.





\- 9 - 

(ii)If the Final Closing Date Purchase Price is less than the Estimated
Purchase Price, each Equity Holder shall (on a several, and not joint and
several, basis based on their allocable share of the Merger Consideration paid
as of such date (and in all cases subject to the limitations set forth in
Section 9.5(b))), within five (5) Business Days after the Final Closing Date
Purchase Price is determined pursuant to this Section 2.5, pay to Purchaser,
by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated in
writing by Purchaser, an amount equal to (x) such deficit multiplied by (y)
such Equity Holder's allocable share of the Merger Consideration paid as of
such date (subject in all cases to the limitations set forth in Section
9.5(b)). At Purchaser's election and sole discretion, Purchaser may also
recover all or any portion of such deficit from the Indemnity Escrow Fund, in
which case each Equity Holder shall be obligated to promptly replenish the
Indemnity Escrow Fund for an amount equal to any such portion multiplied by
such Equity Holder's allocable share of the Merger Consideration paid as of
such date (subject in all cases to the limitations set forth in Section
9.5(b)).

Upon payment of the amounts provided in this Section 2.5(e) in accordance
herewith, none of the Parties may make or assert any claim under this Section
2.5.

(f)Cooperation. During the period of time from and after the Closing Date
through the final determination and payment of the Final Closing Date Purchase
Price in accordance with this Section 2.5, (i) the Representative and
Purchaser shall, and Purchaser shall cause the Company and each of its and the
Company's representatives to, reasonably cooperate and assist in any review by
the Accounting Referee of the Closing Statement and the calculations of the
Closing Date Purchase Price and in the conduct of the review referred to in
this Section 2.5 and (ii) Purchaser and the Representative shall afford, and
Purchaser shall cause the Company to afford, to one another and any
accountants, counsel or financial advisers retained by one another in
connection with the review of the Closing Date Purchase Price, and afford to
the Accounting Referee in connection with any review by it in accordance with
this Section 2.5, and subject to signing a customary confidentiality agreement
and any other customary document required by any accountants providing work
papers, adequate access during normal business hours upon reasonable advance
notice to the applicable books, records and personnel (including the Company's
accountants) of the Company and such representatives (including the work
papers of the Company's accountants) relevant to the review or preparation of
the Closing Statement and to the determination of the Closing Date Purchase
Price and, if requested by the Representative and readily available to
Purchaser, shall provide any such books and records electronically and in such
formats as are reasonably requested.

(g)Any amount paid pursuant to this Section 2.5 shall be treated by the
Parties as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for federal, state, local and
foreign income Tax purposes, unless applicable Tax Law causes such payment not
to be so treated.

(h)The Pre-Closing Statement, Estimated Purchase Price, Closing Statement,
Closing Date Purchase Price and Final Closing Date Purchase Price and the
determinations and calculations contained therein shall be prepared in a
manner consistent with the relevant definitions set forth in this Agreement
and in accordance with the Accounting Rules except that such statements,





\- 10 - 

calculations and determinations shall not include any purchase accounting or
other adjustment arising out of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

2.1 Escrow Amount.

(a)Generally. At the Closing, a portion of the Closing Payment otherwise
payable to Schultz pursuant to Sections 2.2(a) and 2.2(b) in an aggregate
amount equal to the Indemnity Escrow Amount shall be deposited with the Escrow
Agent in accordance with the Escrow Agreement and shall be treated as an
installment payment if and when received by Schultz for Tax reporting. The
Indemnity Escrow Amount, as adjusted from time to time, together with sixty
percent (60%) of any interest or other income earned thereon, shall be
referred to as the "Indemnity Escrow Fund"). The terms of, and timing and
payment under, the Indemnity Escrow Fund shall be in accordance with the
applicable provisions of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement.

(b)[Reserved].

(c)Indemnity Escrow Fund. The Indemnity Escrow Fund shall be distributed by
the Escrow Agent in accordance with this Section 2.6, Section 10.2, Article IX
and the Escrow Agreement. Within ten (10) days following the Expiration Date,
the amount of the Indemnity Escrow Fund then remaining (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, sixty percent (60%) of all interest and other income
earned thereon), minus an amount sufficient to cover any outstanding and
unpaid Indemnification Claims made in good faith on or prior to the Expiration
Date, shall be released to the Exchange Agent for distribution to Schultz.
After the applicable date on which the Indemnity Escrow Fund is released
pursuant to the foregoing sentence, upon the settlement or final determination
of any prior or pending Indemnification Claim, any amount remaining in the
Indemnity Escrow Fund relating to such prior or ending Indemnification Claim
shall be immediately released to the Exchange Agent for distribution to
Schultz.

2.2 Withholding. Representative, the Exchange Agent, Purchaser, Merger Sub,
the Company or the Surviving Corporation (as appropriate) shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any Person such amounts as are required by applicable Tax Law to
be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the
Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to such Person in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made.

be sufficient in form and substance to start the twenty (20) day period during
which a Stockholder must demand appraisal of such Stockholder's Company Stock
as contemplated by Section 262(d)(2) of the DGCL.

(c)The board of directors of the Company shall not withdraw, alter, modify,
change or revoke (i) its recommendation to the Stockholders to vote in favor
of adoption of this Agreement (the "Board Recommendation") or (ii) its
approval of the Merger; provided, however, that the board of directors of the
Company may, at any time prior to receiving the Stockholder Approval, change
its Board Recommendation if the board of directors of the Company reasonably
concludes in good faith, after receipt of advice from outside legal counsel,
that the failure of the board of directors of the Company to change such Board
Recommendation would result in a breach of its fiduciary obligations to the
Stockholders under applicable Laws.

(d)Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary but subject to
Section 8.2(e), any shares of Company Stock held by a holder who has not voted
in favor of adoption of this Agreement or consented thereto in writing and who
has properly demanded and not effectively withdrawn or lost such holder's
appraisal rights in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL, if applicable
(such shares being referred to collectively as the "Dissenting Shares" until
such time as such holder fails to perfect or otherwise loses such holder's
appraisal rights under the DGCL with respect to such shares), shall not be
converted into or represent a right to receive the applicable consideration
for Company Stock set forth in Section 2.2, but the holder thereof shall only
be entitled to such rights as are provided by Section 262 of the DGCL, if
applicable. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 6.2(d), if any
holder of Dissenting Shares shall effectively withdraw or lose (through
failure to perfect or otherwise) such holder's appraisal rights with respect
to such shares under Section 262 of the DGCL or if a court of competent
jurisdiction shall determine that





\- 38 - 

such holder is not entitled to the relief provided by Section 262 of the DGCL,
then such holder's shares shall be treated as if they had been converted into
and shall represent only the right to receive, as of the Effective Time, the
Merger Consideration, as set forth in and subject to the provisions of this
Agreement, upon surrender of the Certificate (as defined below) formerly
representing such shares, without interest thereon. The Company shall provide
Purchaser prompt written notice of any demands received by the Company for
appraisal of any shares of Company Stock, any withdrawal of any such demand
and any other demand, notice or instrument delivered to the Company prior to
the Effective Time pursuant to the DGCL that relates to such demand, and
Purchaser shall have the opportunity and right to direct all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to such demands. Except with the prior written
consent of Purchaser, the Company shall not make any payment with respect to,
or settle or offer to settle, any such demands.

6.3 Notice; Effect of Notice. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall notify
Purchaser, and Purchaser shall notify the Representative, promptly in writing
if to the Knowledge of the Company or to the knowledge of Purchaser there
occurs any event, transaction or circumstance that causes any material
covenant or agreement of the Company (in the case of the Company) or Purchaser
or Merger Sub (in the case of the Purchaser) to be breached or that renders
untrue any representation or warranty of the Company (in the case of the
Company) Purchaser or Merger Sub (in the case of the Purchaser) contained in
this Agreement, in each case in any material respect; provided, however, that
no such notice shall have any effect on the Representative's or Purchaser's,
as the case may be, ability to assert the failure of any conditions to its
obligation to close set forth in Article VIII or make a claim for
indemnification under Article IX or Article X. Without limiting the foregoing,
Purchaser's receipt of information pursuant to this Section 6.3 shall not
operate as a waiver or otherwise affect any representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement given or made by the Company or Equity Sponsor in this Agreement
(including Sections 9.2(a), 10.2 and 11.1(d)) and shall not be deemed to amend
or supplement the Company Disclosure Schedule.

6.4 Control of Business. Purchaser acknowledges and agrees on behalf of itself
and its Affiliates that: (a) nothing contained in this Agreement shall give
Purchaser or its Affiliates, directly or indirectly, the right to control or
direct the Company's or its Subsidiaries' operations prior to the Closing; and
(b) prior to the Closing, the Company's management and board of directors and
equity holders shall exercise, consistent with and subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement and applicable Law, complete control and
supervision over the Company's and its Subsidiaries' operations.

6.5 Obligations with Respect to Consents of Governmental Authority. Purchaser
shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, acquire or agree to acquire,
by merging with or into or consolidating with, or by purchasing a substantial
portion of the assets of or equity in, or by any other manner, any business or
any corporation, partnership, association or other business organization or
division thereof, or otherwise acquire or agree to acquire any assets, if the
entering into of a definitive agreement relating to, or the consummation of
such acquisition, merger or consolidation would reasonably be expected to
materially delay or prevent the consummation of the Transaction by the Outside
Date.

6.6 No Solicitation of Other Bids.

(a)Neither the Company nor Equity Sponsor shall, and shall not authorize or
permit any of their respective Affiliates or any of their respective
representatives to, directly or indirectly, (i) encourage, solicit, initiate,
facilitate or continue inquiries regarding an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) enter
into discussions or negotiations with, or provide any information to, any
Person concerning a possible Acquisition Proposal, or (iii) enter into any
agreements or other instruments (whether or not binding) regarding an
Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall immediately cease and cause to be
terminated, and shall cause its Affiliates and all of their respective
representatives to immediately cease and cause to be terminated, all existing
discussions or negotiations, if any, with any Persons conducted heretofore
with respect to, or that could reasonably be expected to lead to, an
Acquisition Proposal. For purposes hereof, "Acquisition Proposal" shall mean
any inquiry, proposal or offer from any Person (other than Purchaser or any of
its Affiliates) concerning (1) a merger, consolidation, liquidation,
recapitalization, share exchange or other business combination transaction
involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (2) the issuance or
acquisition of shares of capital stock or other equity securities of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to a Person other than an existing
Stockholder or any of its Affiliates, or (3) the sale, exchange or other
disposition of any significant portion of the properties or assets of the
Company and its Subsidiaries.

(b)In addition to the other obligations under this Section 6.6, the Company
and each Equity Sponsor shall promptly (and in any event within two (2)
Business Days after receipt thereof by the Company, any Subsidiary thereof,
Equity Sponsor or their respective representatives) advise Purchaser orally
and in writing of any Acquisition Proposal, any request for information with
respect to any Acquisition Proposal, or any inquiry with respect to or which
could reasonably be expected to result in an Acquisition Proposal, and the
material terms and conditions of such request, Acquisition Proposal or
inquiry.

(c)The Company and Equity Sponsor agree that the rights and remedies for
noncompliance with this Section 6.6 shall include the right to seek to have
this Section 6.6 specifically enforced by any court having equity
jurisdiction, it being acknowledged and agreed that any such breach or
threatened breach shall cause irreparable injury to Purchaser and that money
damages would not provide an adequate remedy to Purchaser.

occurring on or prior to the Closing in such Person's capacity as a director
or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (a "DandO Indemnifiable
Claim") and (ii) reimburse such DandO Indemnified Persons all DandO Expenses
incurred in connection with any DandO Indemnifiable Claim promptly after receipt

Indemnified Person is not entitled to be indemnified under applicable Law. Any
DandO Indemnifiable Claim shall continue until such DandO Indemnifiable Claim is
disposed of or all judgments, orders, decrees or other rulings in connection
with such DandO Indemnifiable Claim are fully and finally satisfied. For the
purposes of this Agreement, "DandO Expenses" shall mean reasonable attorneys'
fees and all other out-of-pocket costs, charges and expenses paid or incurred

(b)Purchaser agrees that (i) the Organizational Documents of the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries after the Closing shall contain provisions

Subsidiaries, respectively, on the Execution Date, which provisions shall not
be amended, repealed or otherwise modified following the Closing in any manner
that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of such beneficiaries,
unless such modification is required by applicable Law and (ii) all rights to
indemnification as provided in any indemnification agreements with any current
or former directors, officers and employees of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries as in effect as of the Execution Date and set forth on Section

with a claims period of at least six (6) years from the Closing Date from an
insurance carrier with the same or better financial-strength rating as the
Company's current insurance carrier with respect to directors' liability
insurance in an amount and scope at least as favorable to the Company's
directors and officers as the Company's existing policies with respect to
matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Closing Date. Purchaser shall
not, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to not, cancel or change such
insurance policies in any respect so long as such policies are fully paid for
by the Company prior to the Closing or included in the calculation of "Company

participation of, members of senior management of the Company and its
Subsidiaries approved by Representative) pursuant to the questions and topics

of any inaccuracy or failure of any representation or warranty made by the
Company in this Agreement to be true and correct as of the Closing Date (or as
to the date made, where such representation or warranty relates to an earlier
specified date), subject in all events to exclusions which are customary in
nature, including without limitation, exclusions for the matters set forth on
Schedule D hereto. The premium due under the RandW Insurance Policy and other

prior written consent of the Representative, which consent shall not be

this Agreement shall be true and correct (disregarding all qualifications or
limitations as to "materiality", "Purchaser Material Adverse Effect" and words
of similar import set forth therein) as of the Closing Date with the same
force and effect as though made on and as of such date (other than those
representations and warranties that address matters only as of a specified
date, which shall have been true and correct only as of such specified date),
except in each case where the failure of such representations and warranties
to be so true and correct would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Purchaser Material Adverse Effect, and Representative shall have received a
certificate signed by an authorized executive officer of Purchaser, dated as
of the Closing Date, to the foregoing effect;

(b)each of Purchaser and Merger Sub shall have performed and complied in all
material respects with all covenants and agreements required by this Agreement
to be performed or complied with by Purchaser or Merger Sub, as applicable, on
or prior to the Closing Date, and the Representative shall have received a
certificate signed by an authorized executive officer of Purchaser, dated as
of the Closing Date, to the foregoing effect; and

(c)Purchaser shall have paid the Closing Payments due in accordance with
Section 3.3.

ARTICLE IX 

INDEMNIFICATION

9.1 Survival. Subject to the limitations and other provisions of this
Agreement, the representations and warranties of the Parties contained in this
Agreement shall survive the Closing and shall remain in full force and effect
until the earlier of (x) thirty (30) days after delivery to the Surviving
Corporation of the Surviving Corporation's audit for the fiscal year ending
December 31, 2017 and (y) June 30, 2018 (the "Expiration Date"); provided,
however, that the representations and warranties in (1) Sections 4.1, 4.2,
4.4(a), 4.4(b) and 4.20 (the "Fundamental Representations") and (2) Section
5.1 and Section 5.6 shall survive the Closing for a period of six (6) years.
The covenants and agreements in this Agreement that by their nature are
required to be performed by or prior to the Closing shall survive the Closing,
and thus claims may be brought in respect of a breach thereof, until the
twelve (12) month anniversary of the Closing Date. The covenants and
agreements in this Agreement that by their nature are required to be performed
following the Closing Date shall survive the Closing, and thus a claim may be
brought in respect of a breach thereof, until six (6) months following the
last date on which each such post-Closing covenant was required to be
performed (or, if no such date is provided, then the Expiration Date).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a written claim or written notice is given
in good faith under this Article IX with respect to any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement prior to the expiration of the applicable
survival period, the claim with respect to such representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement shall continue indefinitely until such claim is finally
resolved pursuant to this Article IX. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, in the event of any breach of a representation or
warranty by a Party that constitutes fraud, such representation or warranty
shall survive the Closing indefinitely and continue in full force and effect.

9.2 Indemnification.

(a)From and after the Closing Date, and subject to the provisions of this
Article IX, each Equity Holder hereby, on a several, and not joint and
several, basis based on its allocable share of the Merger Consideration paid
as of such date and solely in accordance with Section 9.5 (and the limitations
set forth therein), agrees to indemnify and defend each of Purchaser and its
Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries) and
their respective directors, officers, employees, Affiliates, agents,
attorneys, representatives, successors and assigns (collectively, the
"Purchaser Indemnified Parties") against, and shall hold each of them harmless
from and against, and shall pay and reimburse each of them for, any and all
Losses incurred or sustained by, or imposed upon, the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties based upon, arising out of, with respect to or by reason of:

(i)any inaccuracy in or breach of any of the representations or warranties of
the Company contained in this Agreement (other than the representations and
warranties set forth in Section 4.10 (Taxes));

(ii)(A) any breach or non-fulfillment on or prior to the Closing of any
covenant or agreement to be performed by the Company pursuant to this
Agreement on or





\- 49 - 

prior to the Closing or (B) any breach or non-fulfillment of any covenant or
agreement to be performed by the Representative or the Equity Holders pursuant
to this Agreement; or

(iii)any claim made by any Equity Holder, other than the Equity Sponsors,
Schultz or Representative to enforce their rights under this Agreement,
relating to the calculation of the Merger Consideration, including with
respect to the Per Share Preferred Consideration, the Per Share Common
Consideration and the calculations and determinations pursuant to Section 2.5.

(b)From and after the Closing Date, and subject to the provisions of this
Article IX, Purchaser shall indemnify and defend the Equity Holders and each
of their respective directors, officers, employees, Affiliates, agents,
attorneys, representatives, successors and assigns, as applicable
(collectively, the "Equity Holders Indemnified Parties" and together with the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties, the "Indemnified Parties") against, and shall
hold each of them harmless from and against, and shall pay and reimburse each
of them for, any and all Losses incurred or sustained by, or imposed upon, the
Equity Holders Indemnified Parties based upon, arising out of, with respect to
or by reason of:

(i)any inaccuracy in or breach of any of the representations or warranties of
Purchaser or Merger Sub contained in this Agreement; or

(ii)any breach or non-fulfillment of any covenant or agreement to be performed
by Purchaser or Merger Sub pursuant to this Agreement.

(c)Certain Limitations.

(i)Notwithstanding the provisions of this Article IX (but subject to Section
9.2(c)(iii)), after the Closing, the Purchaser Indemnified Parties (A) shall
not be entitled to recover pursuant to Section 9.2(a) until the Losses
incurred relating thereto exceed, in the aggregate, Eight Hundred Twelve
Thousand Five Hundred Dollars ($812,500) (the "Basket") (provided that the
Basket shall not apply to Losses based upon, arising out of, with respect to
or by reason of any inaccuracy in or breach of Sections 4.3(a) or 4.11(a)),
and then the Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall only be entitled to recover
thereunder to the extent that aggregate indemnified Losses exceed the amount
of the Basket, and (B) shall not be entitled to recover pursuant to Section
9.2(a) from the Equity Holders any amounts in excess of the amount then
remaining in the Indemnity Escrow Fund.

(ii)Notwithstanding the provisions of this Article IX (but subject to Section
9.2(c)(iii)), after the Closing, the Equity Holders Indemnified Parties (A)
shall not be entitled to recover pursuant to Section 9.2(b) until the Losses
incurred relating thereto exceed, in the aggregate, the Basket, and then the
Equity Holders Indemnified Parties shall only be entitled to recover
thereunder to the extent that aggregate indemnified Losses exceed such amount,
and (B) shall not be entitled to recover pursuant to Section 9.2(b) any
amounts in excess of Sixteen Million Dollars ($16,000,000).





\- 50 - 

(iii)Notwithstanding the foregoing, the limitations set forth in Sections
9.2(c)(i) and (ii) shall not apply to Losses based upon, arising out of, with
respect to or by reason of (A) any inaccuracy in or breach of any Fundamental
Representation, (B) any intentional breach or intentional non-fulfillment of
any covenant or agreement to be performed by the Company, the Representative,
the Equity Holders, Merger Sub or Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement that
gives rise to liability under Section 9.2(a)(ii) or Section 9.2(b)(ii), as
applicable, (C) Section 9.2(a)(iii) or (D) any claim based on fraud, provided
that (1) the maximum aggregate indemnification obligations of the Equity
Holders in respect of Losses based upon, arising out of, with respect to or by
reason of the matters set forth in the foregoing clauses (A) through (D) shall
not exceed the Merger Consideration (and in all cases subject to the
limitations set forth in Section 9.5(b)) and (2) the maximum aggregate
indemnification obligation of Purchaser pursuant to Section 9.2(b) shall not
exceed the Purchase Price.

(d)No Indemnification. Notwithstanding Section 9.2(a) or anything to the
contrary contained herein, no Purchaser Indemnified Party shall be entitled to
indemnification for any Losses incurred or sustained by, or imposed upon, the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties to the extent such Losses are based upon,
arising out of, with respect to, or by reason of any of the matters set forth
on Schedule D hereto.

9.3 Indemnification Procedures.

(a)In the event that (i) an Indemnified Party becomes aware of the existence
of any Indemnification Claim or (ii) any Legal Proceedings shall be
instituted, or any claim shall be asserted, by any Person not party to this
Agreement in respect of an Indemnification Claim (a "Third-Party Claim"), the
Indemnified Party shall promptly cause written notice thereof (a "Claim
Notice") to be delivered to the party from whom indemnification is sought (the
"Indemnifying Party") which, in a claim against the Indemnity Escrow Fund,
shall be delivered to the Representative and Schultz; provided, however, that
so long as such notice is given within the applicable time period described in
Section 9.1, no delay on the part of the Indemnified Party in giving any such
notice shall relieve the Indemnifying Party of any indemnification obligation
hereunder unless (and then solely to the extent that) the Indemnifying Party
forfeits rights or defenses by reason of such delay. Each Claim Notice shall
be in writing and (A) shall specify the basis for indemnification claimed by
the Indemnified Party, (B) if such Claim Notice is being given with respect to
a Third-Party Claim, shall describe in reasonable detail such Third-Party
Claim and shall be accompanied by copies of all relevant pleadings, demands
and other papers served on the Indemnified Party and (C) shall specify the
amount of (or if not finally determined, a good faith estimate of, if
reasonably practicable) the Losses being incurred by, or imposed upon, the
Indemnified Party on account of the basis for the claim for indemnification.

(b)With respect to any Third-Party Claim where indemnification is sought
against the Equity Holders and recovery for which is limited solely against
the Indemnity Escrow Fund pursuant to this terms of this Article IX, then
Schultz shall be considered the Indemnifying Party for purposes of such Third-
Party Claim; provided, however, that if Losses in relation to such Third-Party
Claim could reasonably be expected to exceed the Indemnity Escrow Fund or if
recovery





\- 51 - 

in respect thereof is not limited to the Indemnity Escrow Fund, then the
Representative shall be the Indemnifying Party for purposes of such Third-
Party Claim. The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to participate in, or
by giving written notice to the Indemnified Party within thirty (30) days (the
"Dispute Period"), to assume the defense of any Third-Party Claim at the
Indemnifying Party's expense and by the Indemnifying Party's own counsel, and
the Indemnified Party shall cooperate in good faith in such defense; provided,
however, that the Indemnifying Party shall not have the right to defend or
direct the defense of any such Third Party Claim (i) that is asserted directly
by or on behalf of a Person that is a Material Customer or Material Supplier,
(ii) that seeks an injunction or other non-monetary relief against the
Indemnified Parties, (iii) unless the Indemnifying Party shall have confirmed
to the Indemnified Party, in writing and within the Dispute Period, such
Indemnifying Party's obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party against any
Losses that may result from the Third Party Claim (subject to the limitations
on indemnification contained in this Article IX), or (iv) if the insurer under
the RandW Insurance Policy shall have assumed the defense of such Third Party
Claim in accordance with the terms of the RandW Insurance Policy. In the event
that the Indemnifying Party properly assumes the defense of any Third Party
Claim, subject to Section 9.3(c), it shall have the right to take such action
as it deems necessary to avoid, dispute, defend, appeal or make counterclaims
pertaining to any such Third Party Claim in the name and on behalf of the
Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Party shall have the right to participate
in the defense of any Third Party Claim with counsel selected by it subject to
the Indemnifying Party's right to control the defense thereof. The fees,
expenses and other disbursements of such counsel shall be at the expense of
the Indemnified Party, provided, that if in the reasonable opinion of counsel
to the Indemnified Party, (A) there are legal defenses available to an
Indemnified Party that are different from or additional to those available to
the Indemnifying Party or (B) there exists a conflict of interest between the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party that cannot be waived, the
Indemnifying Party shall be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of
counsel to the Indemnified Party (provided the Indemnifying Party shall not be
required to pay for more than one such counsel for all Indemnified Parties in
connection with any Indemnification Claim). If the Indemnifying Party does not
elect within the Dispute Period to assume control of the defense of any Third
Party Claim, the Indemnified Party may defend against, negotiate, settle or
otherwise handle such Third Party Claim and seek indemnification for any and
all Losses based upon, arising from or relating to such Third Party Claim,
subject to Section 9.3(c) and the other limitations set forth herein. The
Representative, Schultz and Purchaser shall cooperate with each other in all
reasonable respects in connection with the defense of any Third Party Claim,
including making available records relating to such Third Party Claim and
furnishing, without expense (other than reimbursement of actual out-of-pocket
expenses) to the defending party, management employees of the non-defending
party as may be reasonably necessary for the preparation of the defense of
such Third Party Claim.

(c)Notwithstanding anything in this Section 9.3 to the contrary, in the event
that the Indemnifying Party has elected to assume control of the defense of
any Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall not, without the written
consent of the Indemnified Party (and Schultz in the event that Schultz is not
the Indemnifying Party), which consent may not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed by the Indemnified Party (or Schultz, as applicable),
settle and/or compromise any Third Party Claim (each a "Settlement");
provided, however, that the Indemnifying Party may effect a Settlement without
such consent if, with respect to such Settlement (1) the claimant and such
Indemnifying Party provide to such Indemnified Party and its Affiliates





\- 52 - 

and representatives an unqualified release from all liability in respect of
the Third Party Claim, (2) such Settlement is limited to monetary damages to
be paid by the Indemnifying Party or, with the written consent of the
Indemnified Party and Schultz (either of which consent may not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), from the Indemnity Escrow Fund, and (3)
such Settlement does not contain any admission of guilt or liability. If the
Indemnified Party has properly assumed the defense pursuant to Section 9.3(b),
it shall not agree to any settlement without the written consent of the
Indemnifying Party and Schultz (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed).

(d)In the event that an Indemnified Party has delivered a Claim Notice in
respect of an Indemnification Claim that does not involve a Third-Party Claim,
the Indemnifying Party, Schultz and the Indemnified Party shall attempt in
good faith to resolve any disputes with respect to such Claim Notice within
thirty (30) days of the delivery by the Indemnified Party thereof, and if not
resolved in such thirty (30) day period, such Indemnification Claim may,
subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, be resolved through
judicial actions, suits or proceedings brought any such party or by such other
means as such parties mutually agree.

9.4 Limitations on Indemnification.

(a)Any Indemnification Claim or claim under Section 9.2 or Section 10.2
required to be made on or prior to the expiration of the applicable survival
period set forth in Section 9.1 or Section 10.8, as applicable, and not made,
shall be irrevocably and unconditionally released and waived by the Party
seeking indemnification with respect thereto. It is the express intent of the
Parties that, if the applicable period for an item as contemplated by this
Section 9.4 is shorter than the statute of limitations that would otherwise
have been applicable to such item, then, by contract, the applicable statute
of limitations with respect to such item shall be reduced to the shortened
survival period contemplated hereby. The Parties further acknowledge that the
time periods set forth in Section 9.1 or Section 10.8, as applicable, for the
assertion of claims under this Agreement are the result of arms' length
negotiation among the Parties and that they intend for the time periods to be
enforced as agreed by the Parties.

(b)The amount of any Losses or Taxes for which indemnification is provided
under this Article IX or Section 10.2 shall be net of any amounts actually
recovered by the Indemnified Party under insurance policies or any indemnity,
contribution or other similar Contract with respect to such Losses or Taxes,
as applicable, and in all cases net of any actual, out-of-pocket collection
costs and expenses and any related increases in insurance premiums or other
retrospectively rated premiums. The Indemnified Party shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain recovery of any Losses or Taxes, as applicable,
under all insurance policies or indemnity, contribution or other similar
Contracts if the Indemnified Party reasonably believes that it can collect
against such policy or obligation for such Losses or Taxes; provided that in
no event shall an Indemnified Party be required to initiate any Legal
Proceeding against any insurance carrier; provided, further, that promptly
after the realization of any insurance proceeds, indemnity, contribution or
other similar payment, the Indemnified Party shall reimburse the Indemnifying
Party for such reduction in Losses for which the Indemnified Party was
indemnified prior to the realization or reduction of such Losses.





\- 53 - 

(c)If the same claim for indemnification may be brought as a result of a
breach of more than one representation or warranty contained in this
Agreement, the Indemnified Party may choose the representation or warranty
under which to pursue the indemnification claim, and the fact that such
indemnification claim may be limited or barred if brought pursuant to a breach
of one particular representation or warranty contained in this Agreement shall
not impact or limit an Indemnified Party's ability to bring the same claim for
breach of another representation or warranty to which such limitation does not
apply. In addition, the limitations set forth in this Section 9.4 do not limit
the obligation of any Party to indemnify any other Party from and against any
claim arising from any breach of a covenant, even if such breach also
constitutes a breach of a representation or warranty. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, no Indemnified Party shall be entitled to recover any Losses
related to any matter arising under one provision of this Agreement to the
extent that such Indemnified Party has already recovered such Losses with
respect to such matter pursuant to other provisions of this Agreement.

(d)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no party shall,
in any event, be liable pursuant to this Article IX or Section 10.2 to any
other Person for any punitive damages except to the extent actually paid with
respect to a Third Party Claim. In the event of any breach giving rise to an
indemnification obligation under this Article IX or Section 10.2, the
Indemnified Party shall take and cause its Affiliates to take, all
commercially reasonable measures to mitigate the consequences of the related
breach or Tax to the extent required by applicable Law.

(e)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any amounts
payable pursuant to the indemnification obligations under this Article IX or
Section 10.2 shall be paid without duplication and in no event shall any Party
hereto be indemnified under different provisions of this Agreement for Losses
that have already been paid. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
Purchaser shall not be entitled to indemnification for Losses pursuant to this
Article IX or Section 10.2 to the extent such Losses are taken into account in
the determination of the Closing Date Purchase Price or for matters expressly
raised by the Parties and adjudicated on by the Accounting Referee in
connection with the determination of the Closing Date Purchase Price.

(f)The Parties agree to treat any indemnity payment made pursuant to this
Article IX or Section 10.2 as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for federal,
state, local and foreign income Tax purposes, unless applicable Tax Law causes
such payment not to be so treated.

(g)With respect to Taxes, in the event of a conflict between the provisions of
Article IX, on the one hand, and the provisions of Article X, on the other
hand, the provisions of Article X shall control.

(h)For purposes of determining the amount of any Losses that are the subject
matter of a claim for indemnification, each representation and warranty in
this Agreement shall be read without regard and without giving effect to the
term "material", "Company Material Adverse Effect", "Purchaser Material
Adverse Effect" or any similar phrase which has the effect of making such
representation and warranty less restrictive (as if any such word or phrase
were deleted from such representation and warranty), other than (i) the use of
the word "Material" in the terms Material Contract, Material Customers and
Material Suppliers, (ii) the failure to list items on the Schedules





\- 54 - 

because of materiality qualifications to the disclosure or (iii) the
representation set forth in Section 4.7(b), which shall retain the Material
Adverse Effect qualification therein.

9.5 Source of Recovery.

(a)If there is determined to be any amount owing to a Purchaser Indemnified
Party as a result of indemnification under this Article IX or Section 10.2,
the amount then remaining in the Indemnity Escrow Fund shall be used by a
Purchaser Indemnified Party as the first recourse with respect to any and all
amounts owed to a Purchaser Indemnified Party pursuant to this Article IX or
Section 10.2. However, if the amount then remaining in the Indemnity Escrow
Fund is insufficient to satisfy in full any amount owing to a Purchaser
Indemnified Party as a result of indemnification under this Article IX or
Section 10.2, then the Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall seek recourse
against the RandW Insurance Policy (unless coverage is expressly not available
for such claim). If the amount then remaining in the Indemnity Escrow Fund is
insufficient to satisfy in full any Indemnification Claim asserted in good
faith under this Article IX solely in respect of the matters set forth in
clauses (A) through (D) of Section 9.2(c)(iii), and, in any case, the amount
of any such Indemnification Claim asserted in good faith would reasonably be
expected to exceed the then remaining RandW Insurance Policy Coverage Amount,
then the Purchaser Indemnified Party shall be entitled to recourse directly
against the Equity Holders (in accordance with each Equity Holder's allocable
share of the Merger Consideration paid as of such date and after giving credit
to Schultz for the amount paid or to be paid from the Indemnity Escrow Fund)
on a several (and not joint and several) basis based on their allocable share
of the Merger Consideration paid as of such date (and in all cases subject to
the limitations set forth in this Section 9.5), for the amount in excess of
the then-remaining Indemnity Escrow Fund and the then remaining RandW Insurance
Policy Coverage Amount (except for claims that are expressly not covered by
the RandW Insurance Policy in the first instance), subject to the other
limitations and qualifications of this Article IX and provided that to the
extent any such Indemnification Claim is asserted pursuant to Section
9.2(c)(iii)(B) in respect of any intentional breach or intentional non-
fulfillment of any covenant or agreement made by any one or more Equity
Holders, then such Equity Holders whose intentional breach or intentional non-
fulfillment gave rise to such Indemnification Claim shall be exclusively
liable for any such amounts.

(b)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, no
Equity Holder will have liability under this Agreement in excess of the amount
of Merger Consideration received by such Equity Holder.

9.6 Payments; Indemnity Escrow Fund. Once a Loss is agreed to by the
Indemnifying Party or finally adjudicated to be payable pursuant to this
Article IX, the Indemnifying Party shall satisfy its obligations within ten
(10) Business Days of such agreement or final, non-appealable adjudication, as
applicable, by wire transfer of immediately available funds. In addition, as
promptly as practicable but in any event within three (3) Business Days of
such agreement or final, non-appealable adjudication, Purchaser and the
Representative shall, to the extent any such obligation is to be paid out of
the Indemnity Escrow Fund and moneys remain therein, jointly instruct the
Escrow Agent to pay to the applicable Purchaser Indemnified Party from the
Indemnity Escrow Fund the full amount of such Losses by wire transfer of
immediately available funds pursuant to wire instructions provided in writing
by Purchaser.





\- 55 - 

9.7 Effect of Investigation. The representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements of the Indemnifying Party, and the Indemnified Party's right to
indemnification with respect thereto, shall not be affected or deemed waived
by reason of any investigation made by or on behalf of the Indemnified Party
(including by any of its representatives) or by reason of the fact that the
Indemnified Party or any of its representatives knew or should have known that
any such representation, warranty, covenant or agreement is, was or might be
inaccurate or by reason of the Indemnified Party's waiver of any condition set
forth in Section 8.2 or Section 8.3, as the case may be; provided, however,
that to the extent that the Representative can demonstrate that, as of the
Execution Date, Purchaser had actual knowledge (as determined consistent with
the terms and conditions of the RandW Insurance Policy) of a breach by the
Company of any representation or warranty of the Company contained in this
Agreement, then such breach cannot serve as the basis for, or give rise to,
any Indemnification Claim under Section 9.2(a) or Section 10.2.

9.8 Exclusive Remedy; Nature of Representations and Warranties. Following the
Closing Date, the sole and exclusive remedy (other than claims arising from
fraud) (a) for any inaccuracy or breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement, or (b) otherwise relating
to the subject matter of this Agreement shall be subject to indemnification in
accordance with this Article IX and Section 10.2, and no Person will have any
other entitlement, remedy or recourse, whether in contract, tort or otherwise.
In furtherance of the foregoing, each Party hereby waives, to the fullest
extent permitted by Law, any and all rights, claims and causes of action for
any breach of any such representation, warranty, covenant or agreement or
otherwise relating to the subject matter of this Agreement it may have against
the other Party hereto and its Affiliates arising under or based upon any Law,
except pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in this Article IX
and Section 10.2 (and, for the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing waiver shall
not limit any Purchaser Indemnified Party's rights under the RandW Insurance
Policy or any other insurance). Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section
9.8 shall not interfere with or impede the operation of the provisions of
Section 2.5(d)(ii) providing for the resolution of certain disputes relating
to the Purchase Price between the parties and/or by an Accounting Referee.
Nothing in this Section 9.8 shall limit any Party's rights under Section 12.9.

9.9 Waiver of Subrogation, Contribution, Reimbursement and Other Rights. Each
Equity Holder, including each Equity Sponsor, agrees that if, following the
Closing, any payment is or is required to be made by it pursuant to the terms
of this Agreement in respect of any claim for indemnification, it shall have
no rights against the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries,
whether by reason of subrogation, contribution, reimbursement or otherwise, in
respect of any such payments or liabilities, and shall not take any action
against the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries with respect
thereto. Any such rights which any Equity Holder, including any Equity
Sponsor, may, by operation of Law or otherwise, have against the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries shall, effective at the time of Closing, be deemed to
be hereby expressly and knowingly waived.





\- 56 - 

ARTICLE X 

TAX MATTERS

10.1 Tax Returns.

(a)The Company shall, at its expense, prepare and timely file, or cause to be
prepared and timely filed, all Tax Returns required to be filed by the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries that are due on or before the Closing Date (taking
into account any extensions), and shall timely pay all Taxes that are due and
payable on or before the Closing Date (taking into account any extensions).
Any such Tax Return shall be prepared in a manner consistent with past
practice (unless otherwise required by Law).

(b)Purchaser shall, at its expense, prepare and timely file, or cause to be
prepared and timely filed, all Tax Returns due and required to be filed by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries after the Closing Date with respect to a
Pre-Closing Period and for any Straddle Period. Any such Tax Return shall be
prepared in a manner consistent with past practice (unless otherwise required
by Law) and such Tax Returns shall be submitted by Purchaser to the
Representative (together with schedules, statements and, to the extent
requested by the Representative, supporting documentation) at least thirty
(30) days prior to the due date (including extensions) of such Tax Returns for
the Representative's review and approval. Notwithstanding the immediately
preceding sentence, (i) the Company Transaction Expenses shall, to the
greatest extent permitted by applicable Tax Law, and regardless of whether
such items remain unpaid as of Closing, be allocated to, and deducted, or
deemed deducted, for Tax purposes in the Pre-Closing Period, and (ii) any net
operating loss or other loss for Tax purposes incurred or arising in a Pre-
Closing Period shall be applied in all cases against any Pre-Closing Period
income Taxes or Tax liability. If the Representative objects to any item on
any such Tax Return, it shall, within ten (10) days after delivery of such Tax
Return, notify Purchaser in writing that it so objects, specifying with
particularity any such item and stating the specific factual or legal basis
for any such objection. If a notice of objection is delivered, Purchaser and
the Representative shall negotiate in good faith and use their commercially
reasonable efforts to resolve such items. If Purchaser and the Representative
are unable to reach such agreement within ten (10) days after receipt by
Purchaser of such notice, the disputed item(s) shall be resolved by the
Accounting Referee and any determination by the Accounting Referee shall be
final and binding on the Parties for all Tax and Tax reporting purposes. The
Accounting Referee shall resolve any disputed items within twenty (20) days of
having the item referred to it pursuant to such procedures as it may require.
If the Accounting Referee is unable to resolve any disputed items before the
due date for such Tax Return, the Tax Return shall be filed as prepared by
Purchaser and then amended to reflect the Accounting Referee's resolution. The
fees, costs and expenses of the Accounting Referee shall be borne equally by
Purchaser and the Representative. The preparation and filing of any Tax Return
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that does not relate to a Pre-
Closing Period or Straddle Period shall be exclusively within the control of
Purchaser. Purchaser shall be entitled to deduct from the Indemnity Escrow
Fund (i) Taxes due with respect to any such Tax Return that relate to Pre-
Closing Periods, and (ii) Taxes due with respect to any such Tax Return that
relate to Straddle Periods that are allocable in accordance with Section
10.1(c) to the portion of such Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date, but
only to the extent such Taxes due were not





\- 57 - 

paid, including in Working Capital, Indebtedness or any other component of the
Purchase Price, or otherwise satisfied by the Company at or prior to the
Closing.

(c)In the case of Taxes that are payable with respect to a taxable period that
begins before and ends after the Closing Date (each such period, a "Straddle
Period"), the amount of Taxes allocable to the portion of the Straddle Period
ending on the Closing Date shall be deemed to be (i) in the case of Taxes
imposed on a periodic basis, the amount of such Taxes for the entire period
multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of calendar
days in the Straddle Period ending on and including the Closing Date and the
denominator of which is the number of calendar days in the entire relevant
Straddle Period and (ii) in the case of Taxes not described in clause (i),
including for the avoidance of doubt, income Taxes, the amount of any such
Taxes shall be determined as if such taxable period ended as of the close of
business on the Closing Date.

(d)Purchaser agrees to give written notice to the Representative of the
receipt of any written notice by the Company, Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates which involves the assertion of any claim, or the commencement of
any Legal Proceeding, in respect of which an indemnity may be sought by
Purchaser pursuant to this Article X (a "Tax Claim"); provided, however, that
failure to comply with the foregoing shall not affect Purchaser's right to
indemnification hereunder except to the extent the Equity Holders are
materially prejudiced as a result of such failure. Purchaser shall control the
contest or resolution of any Tax Claim; provided, however, Purchaser shall
keep the Representative reasonably informed in all material respects and on a
reasonably current basis with respect to such Tax Claim, shall permit the
Representative to participate in any such Tax Claim, including, for the
avoidance of doubt, attending any meetings or conferences with Taxing
Authorities, and Purchaser shall not settle or compromise any such Tax Claim
without the prior written consent of the Representative, which consent shall
not by unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

10.2 Indemnification.

(a)Except to the extent of (i) Taxes paid or satisfied at or prior to the
Closing, (ii) Taxes reflected as a current liability in the Working Capital of
the Company as of Closing, and (iii) Taxes attributable to any transactions
not contemplated by this Agreement occurring outside the Ordinary Couse of
Business on the Closing Date but after the Closing, the Equity Holders hereby
agree to indemnify the Company, Purchaser, and each Purchaser Indemnified
Party and hold them harmless from and against (A) any Loss attributable to any
breach of or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty made in Section
4.10, (B) any Loss attributable to any breach or violation of, or failure to
fully perform, any covenant, agreement, undertaking or obligation in Article
X, (C) all Taxes of the Company and its Subsidiaries or relating to the
business of the Company and its Subsidiaries for all Pre-Closing Periods, (D)
all Taxes of any member of an affiliated, consolidated, combined or unitary
group of which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (or any predecessor
thereof) is or was a member on or prior to the Closing Date by reason of a
liability under Section 1.1502-6 of the Treasury Regulations or any comparable
provisions of foreign, state or local Law, and (E) any and all Taxes of any
Person imposed on the Company or any of its Subsidiaries arising under the
principles of transferee or successor liability or by contract, relating to an
event or transaction occurring before the Closing Date. Any such indemnity
payment required to be made





\- 58 - 

pursuant to this Section 10.2 shall be satisfied solely in accordance with,
and from the sources (and in the order) identified in, Section 9.5. Purchaser
shall not have any right to indemnification under this Agreement (including
Article IX and Article X) from and against any Losses or Taxes of any Person
that are due to the unavailability in any Post-Closing Period of any net
operating losses, credits or other Tax attributes from a Pre-Closing Period.

(b)Purchaser shall be responsible, and indemnify the Equity Holders, for any
and all Taxes of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries arising out of
or attributable to any Post-Closing Period and Taxes described in clauses (i),
(ii) and (iii) of Section 10.2(a).

10.3 Amended Returns. Unless otherwise required by Law or based upon the
opinion of Purchaser's independent registered public accounting firm (a copy
of which Purchaser shall give to the Representative), Purchaser shall not, and
shall cause its Affiliates, including the Company and its Subsidiaries, not to
amend, refile or otherwise modify any Tax Return relating in whole or in part
to any Pre-Closing Period, including the pre-Closing portion of a Straddle
Period, without the prior written consent of the Representative, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed; provided that to
the extent that any such amended or otherwise modified Tax Return is filed
without the prior written consent of Representative based upon the opinion of
Purchaser's independent registered public accounting firm and such amended or
otherwise modified Tax Return results in an increase in Taxes attributable to
a Pre-Closing Period, then Purchaser shall not be entitled to seek
indemnification for such increased Tax amounts pursuant to Article IX, Section
10.2 or otherwise.

10.4 Cooperation. For a period of five (5) years commencing on the Closing
Date, Purchaser and the Representative shall (and shall cause their respective
Affiliates to) (a) assist the other Party in preparing any Tax Returns which
such other Party is responsible for preparing and filing in accordance with
Section 10.1, (b) cooperate fully in preparing for and conducting any audits
of, or disputes with Taxing Authorities regarding, any Tax Returns of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and (c) make available to the other Party
and to any Taxing Authority as reasonably requested all information, records,
and documents relating to Taxes of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. In
furtherance of the foregoing, Purchaser and the Representative shall retain
(and shall cause their Affiliates to retain) copies of all Tax Returns and
related work papers for all taxable periods that include the Closing Date and
all prior taxable periods until expiration of the statute of limitations to
which such Tax Returns relate.

10.5 No Code Section 338 Election. Purchaser shall not make, or permit to be
made, any election under Section 338 of the Code or any similar provision of
state, local, or non-U.S. Tax Law with respect to the Company or its
Subsidiaries.

10.6 No Duplication. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, any amounts payable pursuant to the obligations under this Article
X shall be paid without duplication and in no event shall any Party be paid
under different provisions of this Agreement for the same Losses that have
already been paid or otherwise taken into account under this Agreement.





\- 59 - 

10.7 Tax Treatment of Payments. The Parties shall treat any indemnity payments
made pursuant to this Article X as adjustments to the Purchase Price for Tax
purposes unless applicable Tax Law causes such payment not to be so treated.

10.8 Survival. The indemnity and payment obligations set forth in this Article
X shall survive the Closing until the Expiration Date. The right to
indemnification with respect to claims of which notice was given prior to the
expiration of the applicable survival period shall survive such expiration
until such claim is finally resolved and any obligations with respect thereto
are fully satisfied.

ARTICLE XI 

TERMINATION

11.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated prior to the Closing as
follows:

(a)by mutual written consent of the Representative and Purchaser;

(b)at the election of the Representative or Purchaser on or after September
30, 2016 (the "Outside Date"), if the Closing shall not have occurred by the
close of business on such date, provided that the right to terminate this
Agreement under this Section 11.1(b) shall not be available to a Party if such
Party is in material breach of any of its covenants or agreements under this
Agreement or to any Party whose breach of this Agreement has been the primary
cause of the failure of the Closing to have occurred by the Outside Date;

(c)by the Representative or Purchaser if there shall be any Law that makes
consummation of the Transaction illegal or otherwise prohibited or there shall
be in effect a final, nonappealable Order of a Governmental Authority of
competent jurisdiction restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the
consummation of the Transaction; provided, however, that the right to
terminate this Agreement under this Section 11.1(c) shall not be available to
a Party if such Order was primarily due to the failure of such Party to
perform any of its covenants or agreements under this Agreement;

(d)by Purchaser if the Company shall have breached any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement that would give
rise to the failure of any of the conditions set forth in Article VIII, which
breach either (i) is not cured within twenty (20) days following the
Representative's receipt of written notice of such breach, (ii) by its nature,
cannot be cured prior to the Outside Date or (iii) by its nature, is incapable
of being cured; provided, however, that the right to terminate this Agreement
under this Section 11.1(d) shall not be available to Purchaser if Purchaser is
in material breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements under this Agreement;

(e)by the Representative, if Purchaser or Merger Sub shall have breached any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement
that would give rise to the failure of any of the conditions set forth in
Article VIII, which breach either (i) is not cured within twenty (20) days
following Purchaser's receipt of written notice of such breach, (ii) by its





\- 60 - 

nature, cannot be cured prior to the Outside Date or (iii) by its nature, is
incapable of being cured; provided, however, that the right to terminate this
Agreement under this Section 11.1(e) shall not be available to the
Representative if the Company is in material breach of any of their respective
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements under this Agreement;

(f)by the Representative, if Purchaser or Merger Sub fails to consummate the
Closing within three (3) Business Days of the date on which the Closing is
otherwise required to be consummated pursuant to Section 3.1; or

(g)by the Purchaser if the Written Consent, duly executed by the Equity
Sponsors, has not been delivered by the Company to Purchaser within one (1)
hour following the execution of this Agreement by the parties hereto.

11.2 Termination Procedure. In the event of the termination and abandonment of
this Agreement by the Representative and/or Purchaser pursuant to Section
11.1, written notice thereof shall forthwith be given to the other Parties,
and this Agreement shall terminate, and the consummation of the Transaction
shall be abandoned, without further action by any Party hereto.

11.3 Effect of Termination. If this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant
to Section 11.1, all further obligations of the Parties under this Agreement
shall terminate and such termination shall be without liability to the
Parties, except that (a) the obligations of the Parties under the
Confidentiality Agreement, Section 7.3, this Section 11.3 and Article XII
shall survive such termination and not be affected thereby and (b) no such
termination shall relieve any Party hereto from liability for any breach of
this Agreement.

ARTICLE XII 

MISCELLANEOUS

12.1 Expenses.

(a)Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or the other Transaction
Agreements, each Party shall bear its own costs and expenses incurred in
connection with the negotiation and execution of this Agreement and the other
Transaction Agreements and each other agreement, document and instrument
contemplated hereby or thereby and the consummation of the Transaction.

(b)Any sales, use, gross receipts, stamp, documentary, registration, value
added, gains, recording, real estate transfer, stock transfer or similar Tax
payable in connection with the Transaction (collectively, "Transfer Taxes")
shall be borne equally by Purchaser and the Company (and the Company's portion
shall be attributed to the Pre-Closing Period for purposes of indemnification
under Article X). Except as otherwise required by Law, Purchaser shall duly
and timely prepare and file any Tax Return relating to such Taxes. Purchaser
shall give the Representative a copy of each such Tax Return for its review
and comments at least fifteen (15) days prior to filing and shall give the
Representative a copy of such Tax Return as filed, together with proof of
payment of the Taxes shown thereon to be payable.





\- 61 - 

12.2 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware applicable to contracts made
and performed in such state without giving effect to the choice of law
principles of such state that would require or permit the application of the
laws of another jurisdiction.

12.3 Submission to Jurisdiction; Waivers. The Parties agree that any dispute,
controversy or claim arising out of or relating to the Transaction or to this
Agreement, or the validity, interpretation, breach or termination thereof,
including claims seeking redress or asserting rights under any Law, shall be
resolved exclusively in the courts of the State of Delaware or any court of
the United States located in the State of Delaware (the "Delaware Courts") and
appellate courts having jurisdiction of appeals from such Delaware Courts. In
that context, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Party
irrevocably and unconditionally:

(a)submits for itself and its property in any action relating to the
Transaction or to this Agreement, or for recognition and enforcement of any
judgment in respect thereof, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Delaware
Courts, and appellate courts having jurisdiction of appeals from any of the
foregoing courts, and agrees that all claims in respect of any such action
shall be heard and determined in such Delaware Courts or, to the extent
permitted by law, in such appellate courts;

(b)consents that any such action may and shall be brought exclusively in such
courts and waives any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the venue
or jurisdiction of any such action in any such court or that such action was
brought in an inconvenient forum, and agrees not to plead or claim the same;

(c)waives all right to trial by jury in any action (whether based on contract,
tort or otherwise) arising out of or relating to the Transaction or to this
Agreement, or its performance under or the enforcement of this Agreement;

(d)agrees that service of process in any such action may be effected by
mailing a copy of such process by registered or certified mail (or any
substantially similar form of mail), postage prepaid, to such Party at its
address as provided in Section 12.7; and

(e)agrees that nothing in this Agreement shall affect the right to effect
service of process in any other manner permitted by the laws of the State of
Delaware.

12.4 Further Assurances. After the Closing, each Party shall from time to
time, at the request of and without further cost or expense to the other,
execute and deliver such other instruments of conveyance and assumption and
take such other actions as may reasonably be requested in order to more
effectively consummate the Transaction.

12.5 Entire Agreement. This Agreement (including the Schedules and Exhibits
hereto) and the other Transaction Agreements represent the entire
understanding and agreement between the Parties with respect to the
Transaction and supersedes all prior agreements among the Parties respecting
the Transaction. The Parties have voluntarily agreed to define their rights,
liabilities and obligations respecting the Transaction exclusively in contract
pursuant to the express terms and





\- 62 - 

provisions of this Agreement; and the Parties expressly disclaim that they are
owed any duties or are entitled to any remedies not expressly set forth in
this Agreement.

12.6 Amendments and Waivers. This Agreement can be amended, supplemented or
changed, and any provision hereof can be waived, only by written instrument
making specific reference to this Agreement signed by Purchaser, the
Representative and each Equity Sponsor. The waiver by any Party of a breach of
any provision of this Agreement shall not operate or be construed as a further
or continuing waiver of such breach or as a waiver of any other or subsequent
breach. No failure on the part of any Party to exercise, and no delay in
exercising, any right, power or remedy hereunder shall operate as a waiver
thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of such right, power or
remedy by such Party preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, power or remedy. In the event any provision of
any other Transaction Agreement shall in any way conflict with the provisions
of this Agreement (except where a provision therein expressly provides that it
is intended to take precedence over this Agreement) this Agreement shall
control.

12.7 Notices. All notices and other communications under this Agreement shall
be in writing and shall be deemed given (a) when delivered personally by hand
(with written confirmation of receipt), (b) when sent by facsimile or e-mail
of a PDF document (with written confirmation of transmission), or (c) one (1)
Business Day following the day sent by overnight courier (with written
confirmation of receipt), in each case at the following addresses and
facsimile numbers (or to such other address or facsimile number as a Party may
have specified by notice given to the other Party pursuant to this provision).

12.8 Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced by any Law or public policy,
all other terms or provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in
full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the
Transaction is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any Party.
Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal,
or incapable of being enforced, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as
closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the Transaction is
consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible.

12.9 Specific Performance. Each Party acknowledges and hereby agrees that any
breach of this Agreement would give rise to irreparable harm for which
monetary damages would not be an adequate remedy. Accordingly, the Parties
acknowledge and hereby agree that in the event of any breach or threatened
breach by the Company, the Representative or the Equity Sponsors, on the one
hand, or Purchaser or Merger Sub, on the other hand, of any of their
respective covenants or obligations set forth in this Agreement, the Company,
the Representative or the Equity Sponsors,





\- 65 - 

on the one hand, and Purchaser or Merger Sub, on the other hand, shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent or restrain breaches or
threatened breaches of this Agreement, and to specifically enforce the terms
and provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches
of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and obligations of the other
under this Agreement. The Company, the Representative or the Equity Sponsors,
on the one hand, and Purchaser or Merger Sub, on the other hand, hereby agree
not to raise any objections to the availability of the equitable remedy of
specific performance to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of
this Agreement, by the Company, the Representative or the Equity Sponsors, on
the one hand, or Purchaser or Merger Sub, on the other hand, and to
specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent
breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the
covenants and obligations of the Parties under this Agreement.

12.10 No Third-Party Beneficiaries. Nothing in this Agreement, express or
implied, is intended or shall be construed to give any legal or equitable
right, remedy or claim to any Person other than (a) the Parties and their
respective successors and permitted assigns, (b) the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties and the Equity Holders Indemnified Parties and (c) each DandO
Indemnified Person, who shall have the right to enforce the obligations of
Purchaser and the Surviving Corporation solely with respect to Section 7.7. No
Related Party of the Company or any Equity Holder (and no Related Party of any
Related Party), other than the Company, the Equity Holders and the
Representative, shall have any liability (whether in Law or in equity or in
contract or in tort) for any obligations or liabilities of the Company or the
Equity Holders arising under, in connection with or related to this Agreement
or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, the Transaction,
including any alleged nondisclosure or misrepresentations made by any such
Persons.

12.11 Assignment. No Party may assign or transfer this Agreement or any right,
interest or obligation hereunder, directly or indirectly (by operation of Law
or otherwise), without the prior written approval of the other Parties;
provided, however, that Purchaser may (a) assign (in whole or in part) any or
all of its rights and obligations hereunder to (i) any Affiliate or (ii) the
insurer under the RandW Insurance Policy (provided that no such assignment shall
abrogate the subrogation waiver in the RandW Insurance Policy described in the
penultimate sentence of Section 7.9) and/or (b) collaterally assign (in whole
or in part) any or all of its rights hereunder as security to one or more of
Purchaser's or its Affiliates' existing or future lenders, in either case
without obtaining the prior written approval of the other Parties, and any
such assignment shall be valid and effective; provided, however, that no such
assignment shall relieve Purchaser of its obligations hereunder. Any
assignment in violation of this Section 12.11 shall be void. Subject to the
foregoing, this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of
the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

12.12 Cooperation with Legal Proceedings. From and after the Closing, if
requested by the Representative, Purchaser shall cooperate with the
Representative in the investigation, defense or prosecution of any Legal
Proceedings pending or threatened against the Representative, any Equity
Holder or any of their Affiliates with respect to the business of the Company
and its Subsidiaries, whether or not either Party has notified the other of an
indemnification claim with respect to such matter. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, but provided that such





\- 66 - 

requests shall not unreasonably interfere with the business or operations of
Purchaser, Purchaser shall make available its employees to give depositions or
testimony and shall furnish all documentary or other evidence that the
Representative may reasonably request. The Representative shall reimburse
Purchaser for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection
with the performance of its obligations under this Section 12.12.

12.13 Authorization of Representative.

(a)By virtue of the Merger and the adoption of this Agreement, each of the
Equity Holders irrevocably nominates, constitutes and appoints ABP II SR,
L.L.C. as its agent and true and lawful attorney-in-fact with full power of
substitution, to act in the name, place and stead of the Equity Holders for
purposes of executing any documents and taking any actions that the
Representative may, in its sole discretion, determine to be necessary,
desirable or appropriate in connection with any claim for indemnification,
compensation or reimbursement under Article IX, Section 10.2 or under the
Escrow Agreement. ABP II SR, L.L.C. hereby accepts its appointment as the
Representative.

(b)The Representative is authorized and empowered to act as a representative,
for the benefit of the Equity Holders, as the exclusive agent and attorney-in-
fact to act on behalf of the Equity Holders, in connection with and to
facilitate the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, including
pursuant to the Escrow Agreement, which shall include the power and authority:
(i) to execute and deliver the Escrow Agreement (with such modifications or
changes therein as to which the Representative, in its sole discretion, shall
have consented) and to agree to such amendments or modifications thereto as
the Representative, in its sole discretion, determines to be desirable; (ii)
to execute and deliver such waivers and consents in connection with this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby as the Representative, in its sole discretion,
may deem necessary or desirable; (iii) to collect and receive all moneys and
other proceeds and property payable to the Representative from the Indemnity
Escrow Fund as described herein, and, subject to any applicable withholding
laws, and net of any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Representative,
the Representative shall disburse and pay (or cause to be disbursed and paid)
the same to Schultz; (iv) as the Representative, to enforce and protect the
rights and interests of the Equity Holders and to enforce and protect the
rights and interests of the Representative arising out of or under or in any
manner relating to this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or any of the
Transaction Agreements (including in connection with any and all claims for
indemnification brought under Article IX or Article X, claims related to
Taxes, or claims related to the Closing Date Purchase Price), and to take any
and all actions which the Representative believes are necessary or appropriate
under the Escrow Agreement and/or this Agreement for and on behalf of the
Equity Holders, including asserting or pursuing any claim, action, proceeding
or investigation (a "Claim") against Purchaser and/or the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries (after the Closing), defending any Third-Party Claims or
Claims by the Purchaser Indemnified Parties, consenting to, compromising or
settling any such Claims, conducting negotiations with Purchaser, the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries (after the Closing) and their respective
representatives regarding such Claims, and, in connection therewith, to (A)
assert or institute any Claim; (B) investigate, defend, contest or litigate
any Claim initiated by Purchaser, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
(after the Closing) or any other Person, or by any





\- 67 - 

federal, state or local Governmental Authority against the Representative
and/or any of the Equity Holders and/or the Indemnity Escrow Fund, and receive
process on behalf of any or all Equity Holders in any such Claim and
compromise or settle on such terms as the Representative shall determine to be
appropriate, and give receipts, releases and discharges with respect to, any
such Claim; (C) file any proofs of debt, claims and petitions as the
Representative may deem advisable or necessary; (D) settle or compromise any
claims asserted under the Escrow Agreement; and (E) file and prosecute appeals
from any decision, judgment or award rendered in any such action, proceeding
or investigation, it being understood that the Representative shall not have
any obligation to take any such actions, and shall not have any liability for
any failure to take any such actions; (v) to refrain from enforcing any right
of the Equity Holders or any of them and/or the Representative arising out of
or under or in any manner relating to this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or
any other agreement, instrument or document in connection with the foregoing;
provided, however, that no such failure to act on the part of the
Representative, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or in the
Escrow Agreement, shall be deemed a waiver of any such right or interest by
the Representative or by the Equity Holders unless such waiver is in writing
signed by the waiving party or by the Representative; and (vi) to make,
execute, acknowledge and deliver all such other agreements, guarantees,
orders, receipts, endorsements, notices, requests, instructions, certificates,
letters and other writings, and, in general, to do any and all things and to
take any and all action that the Representative, in its sole and absolute
discretion, may consider necessary or proper or convenient in connection with
or to carry out the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Escrow
Agreement, and all other agreements, documents or instruments referred to
herein or therein or executed in connection herewith and therewith.

(c)The Representative shall not be entitled to any fee, commission or other
compensation for the performance of its services hereunder, but shall be
entitled to the payment of all its out-of-pocket expenses incurred as the
Representative. In connection with the foregoing, at the Closing, an aggregate
amount of Seven Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($750,000) (the "Representative
Expense Fund") shall be transferred by or on behalf of the Company to the
Representative, to be used by the Representative to pay expenses incurred by
the Representative in its capacity as the Representative; provided, however,
that if the Transaction is not consummated, the Company shall reimburse the
Representative for all costs and expenses reasonably incurred by the
Representative in connection with the Transaction. Once the Representative
determines, in its sole discretion, that the Representative will not incur any
additional expenses in its capacity as the Representative, then the
Representative will distribute (or cause to be distributed) the remaining
unused Representative Expense Fund, if any, to the Equity Holders. In the
event that the aggregate Purchase Price is not adequate to pay the aggregate
Preferred Redemption Amount, then any payments out of the unused
Representative Expense Fund shall be made to the Preferred Stockholders pro
rata in proportion to the full amounts to which they would otherwise be
respectively entitled if the aggregate Purchase Price was equal to the
Preferred Redemption Amount, until such time as the entire Preferred
Redemption Amount has been paid. After the payment of the entire Preferred
Redemption Amount, any payments out of the unused Representative Expense Fund
shall be paid to the Equity Holders pro rata based on the number of Fully
Diluted Shares. If, however, the Representative incurs expenses, in its
capacity as the Representative, in an amount exceeding the Representative
Expense Fund, then any funds released to the Representative, in its capacity
as the Representative, from the Indemnity Escrow Fund pursuant to Section 2.6,
shall be used to





\- 68 - 

reimburse the Representative for the difference between the total expenses
incurred by the Representative and the Representative Expense Fund. In
connection with this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and any instrument,
agreement or document relating hereto or thereto, and in exercising or failing
to exercise all or any of the powers conferred upon the Representative
hereunder (i) the Representative shall incur no responsibility whatsoever to
any of the Equity Holders by reason of any error in judgment or other act or
omission performed or omitted hereunder or in connection with the Escrow
Agreement or any such other agreement, instrument or document, excepting only
responsibility for any act or failure to act which represents willful
misconduct, (ii) the Representative shall not be liable to Equity Holders for
any apportionment or distribution of payments made by the Representative in
good faith, and if any such apportionment or distribution is subsequently
determined to have been made in error, the sole recourse of any Equity Holder
to whom payment was due, but not made or not made in full, shall be to recover
from the other Equity Holders any payment in excess of the amount to which
such Equity Holder is determined to have been entitled, and (iii) the
Representative shall be entitled to rely on the advice of counsel, public
accountants or other independent experts experienced in the matter at issue,
and any error in judgment or other act or omission of the Representative
pursuant to such advice shall in no event subject the Representative to
liability to any of the Equity Holders. Each Equity Holder shall indemnify the
Representative against all Losses (including any and all expenses reasonably
incurred in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation,
commenced or threatened or any claims whatsoever), arising out of or in
connection with any claim, investigation, challenge, action or proceeding or
in connection with any appeal thereof, relating to the acts or omissions of
the Representative hereunder, or under the Escrow Agreement or otherwise. In
the event that the aggregate Purchase Price is not adequate to pay the
aggregate Preferred Redemption Amount, then any payments of indemnification
obligations under this Section 12.13(c) shall be made by the Preferred
Stockholders pro rata based on their allocable share of the Merger
Consideration paid as of such date. After the payment of the entire Preferred
Redemption Amount, any payments of indemnification obligations under this
Section 12.13(c) shall be made by the Equity Holders pro rata based on the
number of Fully Diluted Shares; provided, however, that in no event shall an
Equity Holder be required to make a payment under this Section 12.13(c) in an
amount greater than the amount of consideration received by such Equity Holder
under Section 2.2. The foregoing indemnification shall not apply in the event
of any action or proceeding which finally adjudicates the liability of the
Representative hereunder for its willful misconduct. In the event of any
indemnification hereunder, upon written notice from the Representative to the
Equity Holders as to the existence of a deficiency toward the payment of any
such indemnification amount, each Equity Holder shall promptly deliver to the
Representative full payment of his, her or its ratable share of the amount of
such deficiency calculated as set forth in this Section 12.13(c).

(d)All of the indemnities, immunities and powers granted to the Representative
under this Section 12.13 shall survive the Closing Date and/or any termination
of this Agreement and/or the Escrow Agreement. Purchaser and the Company shall
have the right to rely upon all actions taken or omitted to be taken by the
Representative pursuant to this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, all of
which actions or omissions shall be legally binding upon the Equity Holders.
The grant of authority provided for herein (i) is coupled with an interest and
shall be irrevocable and survives the death, incompetency, bankruptcy or
liquidation of any of the Equity Holders and (ii) shall survive the Closing.
Any amounts received by the Representative on account of any one





\- 69 - 

or more Equity Holders, whether pursuant to Section 2.4, Section 2.5, the
Escrow Agreement or otherwise, shall be distributed to such Equity Holders,
net of any reserve the Representative may deem necessary in its reasonable
discretion. In the event that the aggregate Purchase Price is not adequate to
pay the aggregate Preferred Redemption Amount, then any payments of any
amounts received by the Representative on account of all Equity Holders shall
be made to the Preferred Stockholders pro rata in proportion to the full
amounts to which they would otherwise be respectively entitled if the
aggregate Purchase Price was equal to the Preferred Redemption Amount, until
such time as the entire Preferred Redemption Amount has been paid. After the
payment of the entire Preferred Redemption Amount, any payments of any amounts
received by the Representative on account of all Equity Holders shall be paid
to the Equity Holders pro rata based on the number of Fully Diluted Shares.

(e)The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the Representative in its
capacity as such shall have no liability to, and shall not be liable for any
Losses of, any Party hereto or to any Purchaser Indemnified Party in
connection with any obligations of the Representative under this Agreement or
the Escrow Agreement or otherwise in respect of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby.

(f)The Representative shall have the right to resign, and the Equity Holders
shall choose the successor representative by affirmative vote of the Equity
Holders that hold as of the Closing Date a majority of the voting power of the
Company based on their Pro Rata Percentage. Following such resignation, any
reference to the Representative herein shall be deemed to include such
successor representative. Similarly, the Representative shall have the right
to assign all or part of its rights and obligations hereunder to any one or
more Persons, subject to the affirmative vote of the Equity Holders that hold
as of the Closing Date a majority of the voting power of the Company based on
their Pro Rata Percentage.
