**ARTICLE  2**

 

 

**The  Merger**

 

 

**_Section  2.01_ _The  Merger_**

 

 

(a) At  the Effective  Time, Merger Subsidiary shall be merged (the **"
Merger"**) with and  into the Company in accordance with Delaware Law,
whereupon the separate  existence of Merger Subsidiary shall cease, and the
Company shall be the  surviving corporation (the **" Surviving 
Corporation"**).

 

 

(b) Subject  to the  provisions of Article 9, the closing of the Merger
(the  **" Closing"**) shall take place in St. Louis, Missouri at the 
offices of Bryan Cave LLP, 211 North Broadway, Suite 3600, St. Louis,
Missouri  63102 as soon as possible, but in any event no later than two
Business Days  after the date the conditions set forth in Article 9 (other
than conditions  that  by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing,
but subject to the  satisfaction or, to the extent permissible, waiver of
those conditions at  the  Closing) have been satisfied or, to the extent
permissible, waived by the  party  or parties entitled to the benefit of
such conditions, or at such other place,  at such other time or on such other
date as Parent and the Company may mutually  agree (the **" Closing Date"**).

 

 

(c) Upon  the Closing,  the Company and Merger Subsidiary shall file a
certificate of merger with  the  Delaware Secretary of State and make all
other filings or recordings required  by  Delaware Law in connection with
the Merger. The Merger shall become  effective at such time (the **"
Effective Time"**) as the  certificate of merger is duly filed with the
Delaware Secretary of State  (or at  such later time as permitted by
Delaware Law as Parent and the Company shall  agree and shall be specified in
the certificate of merger).

 

 

(d) From  and after the  Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
possess all the properties,  rights, powers, privileges and franchises and be
subject to all of the  obligations, liabilities, restrictions and
disabilities of the Company and  Merger Subsidiary, all as provided under
Delaware Law.

 

 

**_Section  2.02_ _Conversion  of  Shares_**

 

 

At  the Effective Time:

 

 

(a) except  as otherwise  provided in Section 2.02(b) or Section 2.04, each
share of Company Common  Stock  (including each Company Restricted Share)
outstanding immediately prior to  the  Effective Time shall be converted
into the right to receive $18.30 in cash,  without interest (such per share
amount, the **" Merger  Consideration"**). As of the Effective Time, all such
shares  of Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically  be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and (i) each
certificate  which  immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any
such shares of Company  Common Stock (each, a **" Certificate"**) and (ii)
each  uncertificated share of Company Common Stock (an **" Uncertificated 
Share"**) which immediately prior to the Effective Time was registered to  a
holder on the stock transfer books of the Company, shall thereafter
represent  only the right to receive the Merger Consideration.

 

 

(b) each  share of  Company Common Stock held by the Company or owned by
Parent or any of its  Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be canceled, and  no  payment shall be made with respect thereto; and

 

 

(c) each  share of  common stock of Merger Subsidiary outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective  Time shall be converted into and become
one share of common stock of the  Surviving Corporation with the same rights,
powers and privileges as the  shares  so converted and shall constitute the
only outstanding shares of capital  stock  of the Surviving Corporation.

 

 

**_Section  2.03_ _Surrender  and  Payment_**

 

 

 

(a) Prior  to the  Effective Time, Parent shall appoint a commercial bank or
trust company  reasonably acceptable to the Company (the **" Exchange
Agent"**) for  the purpose of exchanging Certificates or Uncertificated
Shares for the Merger  Consideration. As of the Effective Time, Parent shall
deposit with  the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the holders of shares of
Company Common  Stock, for exchange in accordance with this Section through
the Exchange  Agent,  cash sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger
Consideration pursuant to Section  2.02(a). Promptly after the Effective
Time, Parent shall send, or  shall cause the Exchange Agent to send, to each
holder of shares of Company  Common Stock at the Effective Time a letter of
transmittal and instructions  as  Parent may reasonably specify and which
shall be reasonably acceptable to  the  Company (which shall specify that
the delivery shall be effected, and risk  of  loss and title shall pass,
only upon proper delivery of the Certificates  or  transfer of the
Uncertificated Shares to the Exchange Agent) for use in such  exchange.

 

 

(b) Each  holder of  shares of Company Common Stock that have been converted
into the right to  receive the Merger Consideration shall be entitled to
receive, upon (i)  surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together
with a properly  completed letter of transmittal, or (ii) receipt of an
"agent's message" by the  Exchange Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of
transfer as the Exchange  Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a
book-entry transfer of  Uncertificated Shares, the Merger Consideration in
respect of the Company  Common  Stock represented by a Certificate or
Uncertificated Share. Until so  surrendered or transferred, as the case may
be, each such Certificate or  Uncertificated Share shall represent after the
Effective Time for all purposes  only the right to receive such Merger
Consideration.

 

 

(c) If  any portion of  the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person
other than the Person  in  whose name the surrendered Certificate or the
transferred Uncertificated  Share  is registered, it shall be a condition to
such payment that (i) either such  Certificate shall be properly endorsed or
shall otherwise be in proper form  for  transfer or such Uncertificated
Share shall be properly transferred and (ii)  the  Person requesting such
payment shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer  or  other taxes
required as a result of such payment to a Person other than the  registered
holder of such Certificate or Uncertificated Share or establish  to  the
satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or is  not 
payable.

 

 

(d) The  stock transfer  books of the Company shall be closed immediately
upon the Effective Time  and  there shall be no further registration of
transfers of shares of Company  Common  Stock thereafter on the records of
the Company. If, after the  Effective Time, Certificates or Uncertificated
Shares are presented to Parent,  the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange
Agent for any reason, they shall  be  canceled and exchanged for the Merger
Consideration to the extent provided  for,  and in accordance with the
procedures set forth, in this Article 2.

 

 

(e) Any  portion of the  Merger Consideration made available to the Exchange
Agent pursuant to Section  2.03(a) that remains unclaimed by the holders of
shares of Company Common  Stock  six months after the Effective Time shall
be delivered to Parent or otherwise  on  the instruction of Parent, and any
such holder who has not exchanged shares  of  Company Common Stock for the
Merger Consideration in accordance with this  Section 2.03 prior to that time
shall thereafter look only to Parent for  payment  of the Merger
Consideration, and any dividends and distributions with respect  thereto, in
respect of such shares without any interest  thereon. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Parent shall not be liable to  any holder of shares of Company
Common Stock for any amounts paid to a public  official pursuant to
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar  laws.

 

 

**_Section  2.04_ _Dissenting  Shares_**

 

 

Notwithstanding  anything in this Agreement to the contrary, shares (the **"
Dissenting  Shares"**) of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately  prior to the Effective Time that are held by any holder who is
entitled to  demand and properly demands appraisal of such shares pursuant
to, and who  complies in all respects with, the provisions of Section 262 of
Delaware  Law  ( **" Section 262"**) shall not be converted into the right
to  receive the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.02(a), but
instead  such holder shall be entitled to payment of the fair value of such
shares  in  accordance with the provisions of Section 262. At the Effective
Time,  the Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically  be  canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a
certificate that  immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
Dissenting Shares shall  cease to have any rights with respect thereto,
except the right to receive  the  fair value of such shares in accordance
with the provisions of Section  262. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any
such holder shall fail to  perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose
the right to appraisal  under  Section 262 or a court of competent
jurisdiction shall determine that such  holder is not entitled to the relief
provided by Section 262, then the right  of  such holder to be paid the fair
value of such holder's Dissenting Shares under  Section 262 shall cease and
such Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to have  been  converted at the
Effective Time into, and shall have become, the right to  receive the Merger
Consideration as provided in Section 2.02(a). The  Company shall serve prompt
notice to Parent of any demands for appraisal  of any  shares of Company
Common Stock, withdrawals of any such demands and any other  instruments
served pursuant to Delaware Law received by the Company, and  Parent  shall
have the right to participate in and direct all negotiations and  proceedings
with respect to such demands. The Company shall not,  without the prior
written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect  to,  or settle or
offer to settle, any such demands, or agree to do or commit  to do  any of
the foregoing.

 

 

**_Section  2.05_ _Stock  Options  and Other Equity Awards_**

 

 

(a) At  or immediately  prior to the Effective Time, each outstanding option
to purchase shares of  Company Common Stock under any employee stock option
or compensation plan  or  arrangement of the Company (each, a **" Company
Stock Option"**),  whether or not exercisable or vested, shall be canceled,
and the Company  shall  pay each holder of any such option at or promptly
after, but in no event  later  than sixty (60) days after, the Effective
Time for each such Company Stock  Option surrendered an amount in cash
determined by multiplying (i) the excess,  if any, of the Merger
Consideration over the applicable exercise price of  such  option by (ii)
the number of shares of Company Common Stock such holder could  have
purchased (assuming full vesting of all Company Stock Options) had such 
holder exercised such Company Stock Option in full immediately prior to the 
Effective Time.

 

 

(b) At  or immediately  prior to the Effective Time, each outstanding
Company Restricted Share shall  vest and become free of such other lapsing
restrictions as of the Effective  Time  and shall, as of the Effective Time,
be canceled and converted into the right  to  receive the Merger
Consideration in accordance with Section  2.02(a).

 

 

(c) At  or immediately  prior to the Effective Time, each outstanding
restricted stock unit award  representing the right to receive shares of
Company Common Stock granted  pursuant to any equity or compensation plan or
arrangement of the Company  (each,  a **" Company Restricted Stock Unit"**)
shall vest and become free  of such other lapsing restrictions as of the
Effective Time and shall, as  of the  Effective Time, be canceled, and the
Company shall pay each holder of any  such  Company Restricted Stock Unit at
or promptly after, but in no event later  than  sixty (60) days after, the
Effective Time for each such Company Restricted  Stock  Unit surrendered an
amount in cash determined by multiplying (i) the Merger  Consideration by
(ii) the number of units covered by such Company Restricted  Stock Unit that
have not been settled or paid immediately prior to the Effective  Time.

 

 

(d) As  of the Effective  Time, each outstanding share of Company "phantom"
stock shall become free of any  restrictions, and shall, as of the Effective
Time, be canceled and converted  into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration in accordance with Section  2.02(a).

 

 

(e) Prior  to the  Effective Time, the Company shall obtain any consents
from holders of Company  Stock Options and Company Restricted Stock Units and
make any amendments  to the  terms of such equity or compensation plans or
arrangements that are necessary  to  give effect to the transactions
contemplated by this Section 2.05 and to  ensure  compliance with Section
409A of the Code. Notwithstanding any other  provision of this Agreement,
payment may be withheld in respect of any Company  Stock Option or Company
Restricted Stock Unit until such necessary consents  are  obtained.

 

 

**_Section  2.06_ _Adjustments_**

 

 

If,  during the  period between the date of this Agreement and the Effective
Time, any change  in  the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company
shall occur, as a  result  of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock
split (including reverse  stock  split), merger, combination, exchange or
readjustment of shares, subdivision  or  other similar transaction, or any
stock dividend thereon with a record date  during such period, the Merger
Consideration and any other amounts payable  pursuant to this Agreement shall
be appropriately adjusted to eliminate the  effect of such event on the
Merger Consideration or any such other amounts  payable pursuant to this
Agreement.

 

 

**_Section  2.07_ _Withholding  Rights_**

 

 

Each  of the  Exchange Agent, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be
entitled to  deduct  and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable
to any Person pursuant  to  this Article 2 such amounts as it is required to
deduct and withhold with  respect to the making of such payment under any
provision of federal, state,  local or foreign Tax law. If the Exchange
Agent, Parent or the  Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, so withholds
amounts and duly  pays  over such amounts to the appropriate Taxing
Authority, such amounts shall  be  treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder  of  the shares of Company
Common Stock, Company Stock Option, Company Restricted  Share or Company
Restricted Stock Unit in respect of which the Exchange Agent,  Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, made such deduction  and 
withholding.

 

 

**_Section  2.08_ _Lost  Certificates_**

 

 

If  any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making  of an  affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such
Certificate to be lost,  stolen or destroyed and, if required by the
Surviving Corporation, the posting  by such Person of a bond, in such
reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation  may direct, as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it with  respect to such
Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue, in exchange for  such  lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration to be paid  in 
respect of the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such
Certificate,  as contemplated by this Article 2.

 

 

**ARTICLE  3**

 

 

**The  Surviving Corporation**

 

 

**_Section  3.01_ _Articles  of  Incorporation_**

 

 

The  articles of  incorporation of the Merger Subsidiary in effect at the
Effective Time shall  be  the articles of incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation until amended  in  accordance with Applicable Law.

 

 

**_Section  3.02_ _Bylaws_**

 

 

The  bylaws of  Merger Subsidiary in effect at the Effective Time shall be
the bylaws of  the  Surviving Corporation until amended in accordance with
Applicable  Law.

 

 

**_Section  3.03_ _Directors  and  Officers_**

 

 

From  and after the  Effective Time, until successors are duly elected or
appointed and qualified  in  accordance with Applicable Law, (i) the
directors of Merger Subsidiary at  the  Effective Time shall be the
directors of the Surviving Corporation and (ii)  the  officers of the
Company at the Effective Time shall be the officers of the  Surviving
Corporation.

 

 

**ARTICLE  4**

 

 

**Representations  and Warranties of the Company**

 

 

The  Company  represents and warrants to Parent that:

 

 

**_Section  4.01_ _Corporate  Existence and Power_**

 

 

The  Company is a  corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in
good standing under  the  laws of the State of Delaware and has all
corporate powers required to carry  on  its business as now conducted. The
Company is duly qualified to do  business as a foreign corporation and is in
good standing in each jurisdiction  where such qualification is necessary,
except for those jurisdictions where  failure to be so qualified would not
reasonably be expected to have,  individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on the  Company. Prior to the date of this Agreement, the
Company has  delivered to Parent true and complete copies of the certificate
of incorporation  and bylaws of the Company as in effect on the date of
this  Agreement.

 

 

**_Section  4.02_ _Corporate  Authorization_**

 

 

The  execution,  delivery and performance by the Company of this Agreement
and the consummation  by the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby
are within the Company's  corporate powers and, except for the Company
Stockholder Approval in connection  with the consummation of the Merger, have
been duly authorized by all necessary  corporate action on the part of the
Company. The affirmative vote of  the holders of a majority of the
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock  for  the adoption of this
Agreement and approval of the Merger is the only vote  of  the holders of
any of the Company's capital stock necessary in connection with  the
consummation of the Merger (the **" Company Stockholder  Approval"**). This
Agreement constitutes a valid and binding  agreement of the Company
enforceable against the Company in accordance with  its  terms (subject to
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer,  reorganization,
moratorium and other laws affecting creditors' rights generally  and general
principles of equity).

 

 

(b) At  a meeting duly called and held, the Company's Board of Directors has
(i)  unanimously declared this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby  advisable, fair to and in the best interests of the Company and its 
stockholders, (ii) unanimously approved, adopted and declared advisable this 
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, (iii) unanimously
resolved  to recommend adoption of this Agreement and approval of the Merger
by the  Company's stockholders (such recommendation, the **" Company Board

including,  if  applicable, Schedule B thereto) prepared in connection with
any such plan  or  trust. Such plans are referred to collectively herein as
the  **" Employee Plans."**

 

 

(b) With  respect to  each Employee Plan which is subject to the provisions
of Title IV of ERISA  in  which the Company participates or has
participated, (i) no accumulated funding  deficiency, if applicable, within
the meaning of ERISA Section 302 or Code  Section 412 has been incurred,

Employee Plan as determined pursuant to Code Section  412. For purposes of
determining the present value of benefit  liabilities under any such Employee
Plan, the actuarial assumptions and methods  used under such Employee Plan
for the most recent Employee Plan actuarial  valuation shall be used.

 

 

(c) Within  the last six  (6) years, the Company has not made any
contributions to any multiemployer  plan  (as defined in ERISA Section 3(37)
or 4001(a)(3)), the Company has not been  a  member of a controlled group
which contributed to any such plan, and the  Company  has not been under

so qualified, or has  pending or has time remaining in which to file, an
application for such  determination from the Internal Revenue Service, and
the Company is not aware  of  any reason why any such determination letter
should be revoked or not be  reissued. The Company has made available to
Parent prior to date of  this Agreement copies of the most recent Internal
Revenue Service determination  letters with respect to each such Employee
Plan. To the knowledge of  the Company, each Employee Plan has been
maintained in substantial compliance  with its terms and with the
requirements prescribed by any and all statutes,  orders, rules and
regulations, including ERISA and the Code, which are  applicable to such
Employee Plan, except for failures to comply or violations  that have not had
and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually  or  in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. To the  knowledge of the
Company, no events have occurred with respect to any Employee  Plan that

excise taxes under Sections 4972, 4975, 4976, 4977, 4979, 4980B, 4980D,
4980E  or  5000 of the Code, except for failures to comply or violations
that have not  had  and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate,  a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

All contributions to the  Employee Plans have been made on a timely basis in

violations that have not had and would  not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material  Adverse Effect on the Company.

 

 

(e) Except  with respect  to agreements, arrangements or other instruments
listed on Section 4.16(e)  of  the Company Disclosure Schedule, the

either alone or together with any  other  event: (i) entitle any such person
to severance pay, bonus amounts, retirement  benefits, job security benefits
or similar benefits, (ii) trigger or accelerate  the time of payment or
funding (through a grantor trust or otherwise) of  any  compensation or
benefits payable to any such person, (iii) accelerate the  vesting of any
compensation or benefits of any such person (including any  stock  options
or other equity-based awards, any incentive compensation or any deferred

any  such person. Except with respect to agreements, arrangements or other 
instruments listed on Section 4.16(e) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, 
there  is no Contract or plan (written or otherwise) covering any employee or
former  employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that, individually

not  be  deductible pursuant to the terms of Section 280G or 162(m) of the 
Code. Section 4.16(e) of the Company Disclosure Schedule lists all 
agreements, arrangements and other instruments which give rise to an

(g) There  has been no  amendment to, written interpretation or announcement
(whether or not written)  by  the Company or any of its Affiliates relating
to, or change in employee  participation or coverage under, an Employee Plan
which would increase  materially the expense of maintaining such Employee
Plan above the level  of the  expense incurred in respect thereof for the
fiscal year ended December 30,  2006. Except with respect to agreements,
arrangements or other  instruments listed on Section 4.16(g) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule,  no  condition exists that would prevent the Company
from amending or terminating  any  Employee Plan without liability, other
than the obligation for ordinary benefits  accrued prior to the termination
of such plan.

 

 

(h) There  is no action,  suit, investigation, audit or proceeding pending
against or involving or,  to the  knowledge of the Company, threatened

stockholders (the  **" Company Stockholder Meeting"**) to be duly called and
held as  soon as reasonably practicable for the purpose of voting on the
adoption  of this  Agreement and the approval of the Merger. Subject to
Section 6.03(b),  the Board of Directors of the Company shall recommend
adoption of this Agreement  and approval of the Merger by the Company's
stockholders. In  connection with such meeting, subject to Section 6.03(b),
the Company shall  (i)  promptly prepare and file with the SEC, use its
commercially reasonable efforts  to have cleared by the SEC and thereafter
mail to its stockholders as promptly  as practicable the Company Proxy
Statement and all other proxy materials  for  such meeting, (ii) use its
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the  Company  Stockholder Approval
and (iii) otherwise comply with all legal requirements  applicable to such

Stockholder Meeting as soon as reasonably practicable whether  or  not (i)
an Adverse Recommendation Change shall have occurred or (ii) an  Acquisition
Proposal shall have been publicly proposed or announced or otherwise 
submitted to the Company or any of its Representatives.

 

 

**_Section  6.03_ _No  Solicitation; Other Offers_**

 

 

(a) Subject  to Section 6.03(b),  the Company shall not, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries not to, and shall  direct  and use its commercially reasonable
efforts to cause its and their officers,  directors, employees, investment
bankers, attorneys, accountants, consultants  and other agents, advisors or
representatives (collectively,  **" Representatives"**) not to, directly or
indirectly, (i) solicit,  initiate or take any action to facilitate or
encourage the submission of  any  Acquisition Proposal, (ii) enter into or
participate in any discussions or  negotiations with, furnish any information
relating to the Company or any  of its  Subsidiaries or afford access to the
business, properties, assets, books  or  records of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries to, otherwise cooperate  in any  way with, or knowingly
assist, participate in, facilitate or encourage any  effort by any Third
Party that is seeking to make, or has made, an Acquisition  Proposal, (iii)
fail to make, withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Parent  or publicly
propose to withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Parent the  Company
Board Recommendation, or recommend, adopt or approve or publicly  propose 
to recommend, adopt or approve an Acquisition Proposal, (any of the
foregoing  in  this clause (iii), an **" Adverse Recommendation Change"**),
(iv)  grant any waiver or release under any standstill or similar agreement
with  respect to any class of equity securities of the Company or any of
its  Subsidiaries or (v) enter into any agreement in principle, letter of
intent,  term sheet, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option
agreement, joint  venture agreement, partnership agreement or other similar
instrument  constituting or relating to an Acquisition Proposal. Without
limiting  the foregoing, it is agreed that any violation of the restrictions
on the  Company set forth in the preceding sentence by any Representative of
the  Company  or any of its Subsidiaries shall be a breach of this Section
by the  Company. The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and 
their respective Representatives to, cease immediately and cause to be 
terminated any and all existing activities, discussions or negotiations,  if
any,  with any Third Party conducted prior to the date of this Agreement with
respect  to any Acquisition Proposal and shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts  to  cause any such Party (or its agents or advisors) in
possession of confidential  information about the Company that was furnished
by or on behalf of the Company  to return or destroy all such information.
During the term of this  Agreement, the Company shall not take any actions to
make any state takeover  statute (including any Delaware state takeover
statute) or similar statute  inapplicable to any Acquisition Proposal.

 

 

(b) Notwithstanding  the  foregoing, at any time prior to the adoption of
this Agreement by the Company's  stockholders (and in no event after the
adoption of this Agreement by the  Company's stockholders), the Board of
Directors of the Company, directly or  indirectly through advisors, agents or
other intermediaries, may, or may  cause  the Company to, subject to
compliance with Section 6.03(a), (i) engage in  negotiations or discussions
with any Third Party that, subject to the Company's  compliance with Section
6.03(a), has made after the date of this Agreement  a  Superior Proposal or
an unsolicited bona fide Acquisition Proposal that the  Board of Directors of
the Company reasonably believes (after consultation  with a  financial
advisor of nationally recognized reputation and outside legal counsel)  is,
or will lead to, a Superior Proposal, (ii) thereafter furnish to such 
Third  Party nonpublic information relating to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries  pursuant to a confidentiality agreement with terms no less
favorable to the  Company than those contained in the Confidentiality
Agreement; provided that  all  such information (to the extent that such
information has not been previously  provided or made available to Parent) is
provided or made available to Parent,  as the case may be, prior to or
substantially concurrently with the time  it is  provided or made available
to such Third Party), (iii) following receipt  of a  Superior Proposal after
the date of this Agreement, make an Adverse  Recommendation Change, and (iv)
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section  10.01(d), but in each case
referred to in the foregoing clauses (i) through  (iv)  only if the Board of
Directors of the Company determines in good faith by  a  majority vote,
after consultation with outside legal counsel to the Company,  that the
failure to take such action is inconsistent with its fiduciary duties  under
Applicable Law. Nothing contained herein shall prevent the  Board of
Directors of the Company from complying with requirements of Rule  14e-2(a)
and Rule 14d-9 under the 1934 Act, with regard to an Acquisition  Proposal,
so long as any action taken or statement made to so comply is  consistent
with this Section 6.03; provided, that such requirement will in  no  way
eliminate or modify the effect that any action pursuant to such requirement 
would otherwise have under this Agreement.

 

 

(c) The  Board of  Directors of the Company shall not take any of the
actions referred to in  clauses (i) through (iv) of Section 6.03(b) unless
the Company shall have  delivered to Parent a prior written notice advising
Parent that it intends  to  take such action. In addition, the Company shall
notify Parent  promptly (but in no event later than 24 hours) after receipt
by the Company  (or  any of its Representatives) of any Acquisition
Proposal, any indication that  a  Third Party is reasonably likely to make
an Acquisition Proposal or of any  request for information relating to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries  or  for access to the business,
properties, assets, books or records of the Company  or any of its
Subsidiaries by any Third Party that is reasonably likely to  make  or has
made an Acquisition Proposal, which notice shall be provided orally  and  in
writing and shall identify the Third Party making, and the terms and 
conditions of, any such Acquisition Proposal, indication or  request. The
Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed, on a  current basis, of the
status and material terms of any such Acquisition  Proposal, indication or
request.

 

 

**" Superior  Proposal"** means any bona fide, unsolicited written
Acquisition Proposal  that, if consummated, would result in the person making
such Acquisition  Proposal (or in the case of a direct merger between such
person and the Company,  the stockholders of such person) acquiring, directly
or indirectly, more  than  50% of the voting power of the Company Common
Stock or all or substantially  all  of the assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and  which  offer, in the good faith
judgment of the Board of Directors of the Company  (after consultation with a
financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation  and outside legal
counsel), (i) is more favorable from a financial point  of view  to the
Company's stockholders than the Merger (taking into account all of the  terms
and conditions of such proposal and this Agreement (including the ability  of
the parties thereto to consummate the transactions contemplated thereby 
and  any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent in
response  to  such Superior Proposal or otherwise)); (ii) is reasonably
capable of being  completed, taking into account all financial, legal,
regulatory and other  aspects of such proposal; and (iii) for which
financing, if a cash transaction  (whether in whole or in part), is then
fully committed or reasonably determined  to be available by the Board of
Directors of the Company.

 

 

**_Section  6.04_ _Access  to  Information; Confidentiality_**

 

 

From  the date of  this Agreement until the Effective Time and subject to
Applicable Law, the  Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, (i)
give to Parent, its  counsel, financial advisors, auditors and other
authorized representatives  reasonable access to its offices, properties,
books and records, (ii) furnish  to  Parent, its counsel, financial
advisors, auditors and other authorized  representatives such financial and
operating data and other information as  such  Persons may reasonably
request and (iii) instruct its employees, counsel,  financial advisors,
auditors and other authorized representatives to cooperate  with Parent in
its investigation. Any investigation pursuant to this  Section shall be
conducted in such manner as not to interfere unreasonably  with  the conduct
of the business of the Company. All information furnished  pursuant to this
Section shall be subject to the confidentiality agreement,  dated as of May
9, 2007, between Parent and the Company (the  **" Confidentiality
Agreement"**). No information or  knowledge obtained by Parent in any
investigation pursuant to this Section  6.04  shall affect or be deemed to
modify any representation or warranty made by  the  Company hereunder.
Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries  shall be obligated to
provide access to, or to disclose, any information  to  Parent if the
Company reasonably determines that such access or disclosure  would 
jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of the Company or any of its 
Subsidiaries or violate any Applicable Law. All requests for information 
made  pursuant to this Section 6.04 shall be directed to an executive officer
of  the  Company or such Person as may be designated by the Company's
executive  officers.

 

 

**_Section  6.05_ _Tax  Matters_**

 

 

(a) Except  as set forth  on Section 6.01 of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, neither the Company nor  any  of its Subsidiaries shall make or
change any _material_ Tax election,  change any annual tax accounting period,
adopt or change any method of tax  accounting, file any amended Tax Returns
or claims for Tax refunds, enter  into  any closing agreement, surrender any
Tax claim, audit or assessment, surrender  any right to claim a Tax refund,
offset or other reduction in Tax liability  surrendered, consent to any
extension or waiver of the limitations period  applicable to any Tax claim or
assessment or take or omit to take any other  action, if any such action or
omission would have the effect of _materially _ increasing the Tax liability
or _materially_ reducing any Tax asset of  the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries.

 

 

(b) On  or prior to the  Effective Time, the Company and each of its
Subsidiaries will terminate or  cause  to be terminated any power of
attorney currently in place relating to  Taxes.

 

 

(c) The  Company and  each of its Subsidiaries shall establish or cause to
be established in  accordance with GAAP on or before the Effective Time an
adequate accrual  for all  Taxes due with respect to any period or portion
thereof ending prior to or  as of  the Effective Time.

 

 

**_Section  6.06_ _Stockholder  Litigation_**

 

 

The  Company shall  give Parent the opportunity to participate, subject to a
customary joint  defense  agreement, in, but not control, the defense or
settlement of any stockholder  litigation against the Company or its
directors or officers relating to the  Merger or any other transactions
contemplated hereby; provided, however,  that no  such settlement shall be
agreed to without Parent's consent (not to be  unreasonably withheld, delayed
or conditioned).

 

 

**_Section  6.07_ _Refinancing  of  Company Notes_**

 

 

 

(a) As  soon as  reasonably practicable after the receipt of any written
request by Parent  to do  so, the Company shall take such actions as shall
be reasonably requested  by  Parent to commence offers to purchase (the **"
Offers"**) any and  all of the Company's outstanding 8% Notes due 2011 (the
**" 8%  Notes"**) and 9 3/8% Noted due 2011 (the **" 9 3/8% Notes"**,  and
together with the 8% Notes, the **" Notes"**) on price terms and  on other
customary terms and conditions as shall be specified by Parent,  and  shall
retain a dealer manager and other advisors in connection with the Offers  as
shall be requested by the Parent, all subject to the approval of the Company 
(which approval will not unreasonably be withheld). The closing of  the
Offers shall be conditioned upon the satisfaction of specified conditions 
to  the Closing and such other conditions agreed upon by Parent and the
Company,  and  the parties shall cause the purchases of the Notes pursuant
to the Offers  to  occur on the Closing Date. The purchases of the Notes
pursuant to the  Offers shall be consummated using funds provided by or at
the direction of  Parent. Subject to the preceding sentence, the Company
shall provide,  and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and shall use its
reasonable best efforts  to cause their respective Representatives to,
provide all cooperation reasonably  requested by Parent in connection with
and to effect the purchase of the  Notes  pursuant to the Offers; _provided_
, that Parent acknowledges that any  determination whether to tender the
Notes in the Offers will be made by the  holders of the Notes, and the level
of acceptance of the Offers shall not  affect  the obligations of the
parties to proceed with the Closing  hereunder. Parent shall provide (or
cause to be provided) immediately  available funds to the Company for the
full payment of all the Notes properly  tendered and not withdrawn to the
extent required pursuant to the terms of  the  Offers.

 

 

(b) If  requested by  Parent in writing on a timely basis, in addition to
commencing Offers for  the  Notes, the Company shall, to the extent
permitted by the Notes and the  indentures governing each series of Notes
(the **" Indentures"**),  (i) instruct the trustees under the respective
Indentures (the  **" Trustees"**) concurrently with the Closing to issue
notices of  redemption providing for the redemption on the then earliest
permitted  redemption date of all of the outstanding Notes pursuant to the
applicable  provisions of the Indentures or (ii) take any actions reasonably
requested  by Parent to facilitate the defeasance and/or satisfaction and
discharge  of the  Indentures and/or the Notes pursuant to the applicable
sections of the  Indentures at the Effective Time; _provided_ that prior to
the Company  being required to make any irrevocable commitment with respect
to the actions  described in clause (i) or (ii) above, Parent shall have, or
shall have caused  to be, deposited with the Trustees sufficient funds to
effect such redemption,  defeasance and/or satisfaction and discharge. The
redemption,  defeasance and satisfaction and discharge of the Notes pursuant
to the preceding  sentence are referred to collectively as the "Discharge" of
the  Notes. The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and 
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause their respective 
Representatives to, provide all cooperation reasonably requested by Parent 
in  connection with the Discharge of the Notes.

 

 

(c) If  this Agreement  is terminated other than pursuant to Section
10.01(c)(i), Section 10.01(c)(ii)  (but only to the extent resulting from a
willful breach or a willful failure  by  the Company), Section 10.01(c)(iii)
or Section 10.01(d)(i), then Parent shall,  upon request by the Company,
reimburse the Company within two (2) Business  Days  for all reasonable and
documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses incurred  by or  on behalf of the
Company to the extent resulting from its compliance with  this  Section
6.07; provided, that, to the extent Parent has reimbursed the Company  for
such fees and expenses, if a Payment Event relating to a termination  of
this  Agreement pursuant to Section 10.01(b)(i) or Section 10.01(b)(iii)
occurs,  in  addition to the Termination Fee then due, the Company shall,
within two (2)  Business Days of such Payment Event, repay Parent an amount
equal to such  reimbursement.

 

 

(d) It  is the intent of  the parties that to the extent Parent requests the
Company to make the Offers  and effect a Discharge of the Notes, the closing
of the Offers and the Discharge  of the Notes, if any, would occur on the
Closing Date immediately prior to  the  Effective Time, and that no Notes
will be accepted pursuant to the Offers  and no  Discharge of the Notes
shall occur unless the conditions to the Closing have  been satisfied and the
parties are prepared to proceed with the  Closing. In connection with any
funding by Parent of the closing of  the Offers or of the Discharge of the
Notes as contemplated above, the Company  shall issue a promissory note to
Parent or its designee relating to the  repayment of such funds, in form
reasonably satisfactory to Parent, which  shall  include the following
terms:

 

 

(i) Such  note shall  bear interest, payable monthly in arrears, at
applicable 30-day Libor, plus  the  Interest Rate Spread. "Libor" shall mean
the rate for deposits of  U.S. dollars for 30 days which appears on the
Bloomberg Screen BTTM Page  under  the heading "LIBOR FIX BBAM " as of 11
am, London time, on the second business  day preceding the start of each such
30-day period (or successor index if  such  rate is not published). The

**ARTICLE  7**

 

 

**Covenants  of Parent**

 

 

Parent  agrees  that:

 

 

**_Section  7.01_ _Conduct  of  Parent_**

 

 

From  the date of  this Agreement until the Effective Time, except with the
Company's prior written  consent, Parent shall not take any action that would
make any representation  or  warranty of the Parent hereunder inaccurate in
any material respect at, or  as of  any time before, the Effective Time or
would materially delay the  Closing.

 

 

**_Section  7.02_ _Obligations  of  Merger Subsidiary_**

 

 

Parent  shall take  all action necessary to cause Merger Subsidiary to
perform its obligations  under  this Agreement and to consummate the Merger
on the terms and conditions set  forth in this Agreement.

 

 

**_Section  7.03_ _Voting  of  Shares_**

 

 

Parent  shall vote  all shares of Company Common Stock beneficially owned by
it or any of its  Subsidiaries in favor of adoption of this Agreement at the
Company Stockholder  Meeting.

 

 

**_Section  7.04_ _Director  and  Officer Liability_**

 

 

Parent  shall cause  the Surviving Corporation, and the Surviving
Corporation hereby agrees, to  do  the following:

 

 

(a) For  six years after  the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall indemnify and hold harmless  the present and former officers and
directors of the Company (each an  **" Indemnified Person"**) in respect of
acts or omissions occurring  at or prior to the Effective Time to the fullest
extent permitted by Delaware  Law or any other Applicable Law or provided
under the Company's certificate of  incorporation and bylaws in effect on the
date of this Agreement; provided  that  such indemnification shall be
subject to any limitation imposed from time  to  time under Applicable Law.

 

 

(b) For  six years after  the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall provide officers' and  directors' liability insurance in respect of
acts or omissions occurring prior  to the Effective Time covering each such
Indemnified Person covered as of  the  date of this Agreement by the
Company's officers' and directors' liability  insurance policy on terms with
respect to coverage and amount no less favorable  than those of such policy
in effect on the date of this Agreement; provided  that, in satisfying its
obligation to provide such insurance coverage, the  Surviving Corporation
shall not be obligated to pay an aggregate premium  in  excess of 300% of
the amount per annum the Company paid in its last full  fiscal  year, which
amount the Company has disclosed to Parent prior to the date  of this 
Agreement; provided further, that if the annual premiums of such insurance 
coverage exceed such amount, Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall be 
obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost 
not  exceeding such amount. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at Parent's 
election, in lieu of providing the officers' and directors' liability
insurance  coverage contemplated above, Parent or the Surviving Corporation
may purchase  a  non-cancelable "tail" coverage insurance policy under the
Company's current  officers' and directors' liability insurance policies
(providing coverage not  less favorable than provided by such insurance in
effect on the date hereof),  which tail policy shall be effective for a
period from the Effective Time  through and including the date six years from
the Closing Date, covering  each  Indemnified Person covered as of the date
of this Agreement by the Company's  officers' and directors' liability
insurance policies in respect of acts or  omissions occurring prior to the
Effective Time.

 

 

(c) If  Parent, the  Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or
assigns (i) consolidates  with  or merges into any other Person and shall
not be the continuing or the surviving  corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers  or  conveys all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any Person,  then, and in each such case,
to the extent necessary, proper provision shall  be  made so that the
successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation,  as the case
may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section  7.04.

 

 

(d) The  rights of each  Indemnified Person under this Section 7.04 shall be
in addition to any rights  such Person may have under the certificate of
incorporation or bylaws of  the  Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or
under Delaware Law or any other  Applicable Law or under any agreement of any
Indemnified Person with the  Company  or any of its Subsidiaries. The
Indemnified Persons to whom this  Section 7.04 applies shall be third party
beneficiaries of this Section 7.04.  The provisions of this Section 7.04 are
intended to survive consummation  of the  Merger and are intended to be for
the benefit of, and shall be enforceable  by,  each Indemnified Person, his
or her successors, heirs or  representatives.

 

 

**_Section  7.05_ _Employee  Matters_**

 

 

(a) For  the period  commencing with the Effective Time and ending December
31, 2007, Parent shall  cause to be provided, to each individual who is
employed by the Company and  its  Subsidiaries immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than those  individuals covered by collective
bargaining agreements) and who remain employed  with the Surviving
Corporation or any of Parent's Subsidiaries (each an  **" Affected
Employee"**), base salary and bonus opportunity no less  than that provided
to such Affected Employee immediately prior to the Effective  Time, and until
September 30, 2008, with respect to such Affected Employee,  Parent shall use
reasonable efforts to maintain such Affected Employee's  aggregate
compensation. For the period ending not earlier than twelve  (12) months
after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be provided,  to  Affected
Employees, in the aggregate, employee benefits substantially comparable  in
the aggregate (except as noted below) to the benefits, including without 
limitation severance benefits, provided to the Affected Employees under the 
Employee Plans immediately prior to the Effective Time, and after such
period,  the benefits provided by Parent under the plans and programs
generally made  available to similarly situated employees of Parent and its 
Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for the calendar year in  which
the Effective Time occurs, Parent shall (x) cause to be paid to each 
Affected Employee his or her target bonus for such year, and (y) cause to 
be  made to the Company's tax-qualified profit sharing plan (or credited to
a  non-qualified plan to the extent not permitted by the terms of such  tax-
qualified profit sharing plan or applicable law), on behalf of each Affected 
Employee who (i) completes a "Year of Service" (as defined in such tax-
qualified  profit sharing plan) during such calendar year and (ii) is
employed on December  15 of such calendar year (or who died, became totally
and permanently disabled,  or retired after age 65 or is involuntarily
terminated without cause during  such  calendar year) a profit sharing
contribution equal to 10% of base salary  plus  target bonus which is paid
during a period in such calendar year when the  Affected Employee is an
"Active Participant" under such tax-qualified profit  sharing plan.
Immediately before the Effective Time, the Company  shall cause the tax-
qualified profit sharing plan to be amended (in a manner  acceptable to
Parent) to reflect the obligation described herein. No  provision herein is
intended to confer upon any employee rights as a third-party  beneficiary
hereunder or to act as an amendment to any Employee  Plan.

 

 

(b) With  respect to any  employee benefit plan in which any Affected
Employee first becomes eligible  to  participate, on or after the Effective
Time (the **" New Company  Plans"**), Parent shall: (i) waive all pre-
existing conditions,  exclusions and waiting periods with respect to
participation and coverage  requirements applicable to such Affected Employee
under any health and welfare  New Company Plans in which such Affected
Employee may be eligible to participate  after the Effective Time; (ii)
provide credit towards any deductible or out  of  pocket expense maximum
under any health and welfare New Company Plans for  out of  pocket amounts
expended by the Affected Employee under the Employee Plans  during  the
current calendar year; and (iii) recognize service of Affected Employees 
(or  otherwise credited by the Company or its Subsidiaries) accrued prior to
the  Effective Time for purposes of eligibility to participate and vesting
(but  not  for the purposes of benefit accrual) under any New Company Plan
in which  such  Affected Employees may be eligible to participate after the
Effective Time;  provided, however, that in no event shall any credit be
given to the extent  it  would result in the duplication of benefits for the
same period of  service.

Proposal that it do so;

 

 

(ii) a  breach of any  representation or warranty or failure to perform any

Parent does not make, within five Business Days of receipt of such written

condition is incapable of being satisfied  by the End Date.

result from the (i) willful failure of either  party to fulfill or willful
breach that results in the failure to satisfy  a  condition to the
performance of the obligations of the other party, or (ii)  willful failure
of either party to perform a covenant hereof, such party  shall  be fully

(b) If  a Payment Event  (as hereinafter defined) occurs, the Company shall
pay Parent (by wire transfer  of immediately available funds), if, pursuant

prior to the Company Stockholder  Meeting, or the End Date, as the case may
be, an Acquisition Proposal shall  have  been made and not publicly
withdrawn, and (B) within 12 months following  the  date of such
termination, the Company shall have either entered into a  definitive
agreement to effect, or consummated, an Acquisition Proposal (whether  or not
such transaction was the one as to which a proposal, offer, or indication  of
interest has been made or announced prior to such  termination). For purposes
of this Section 11.04(b), each reference  to 20% in the definition of
"Acquisition Proposal" shall be deemed to be  50%.

 

 

(c) The  Company  acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section
11.04 are an integral  part of the transactions contemplated by this

would not enter into this  Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company fails
promptly to pay any  amount due to Parent or Merger Subsidiary pursuant to
this Section 11.04,  it  shall also pay any costs and expenses (including
attorneys' fees) incurred by  Parent or Merger Subsidiary in connection with
a legal action to enforce  this  Agreement that results in a judgment
against the Company for such amount,  together with interest on any amount of
the Termination Fee at a rate per  annum  equal to 3% over the prime rate
(as published in _The Wall Street  Journal_ ) in effect on the date such
payment should have been  made.

 

 

**_Section  11.05_ _Disclosure  Schedule References_**

 

 

The  parties hereto  agree that disclosure of any item, matter or event in a
particular Section  of  the Company Disclosure Schedule shall only be deemed
to be an exception to  (or,  as applicable, a disclosure for purposes of)
(i) the representations and  warranties (or covenants, as applicable) of the
relevant party that are  contained in the corresponding Section or
subsection, as applicable, of this  Agreement and (ii) any other
representation and warranty of such party that  is  contained in another
Section or subsection of this Agreement, but only so  long  as the
application to any such other Section or subsection is readily apparent  from
such disclosure. By listing matters on the Company Disclosure Schedule, 
the  Company shall not be deemed to have established any materiality
standard,  admitted any liability, or concluded that any one or more of such
matters  are  material, or expanded in any way the scope or effect of the
representations  and  warranties of the Company contained in this Agreement.

 

 

**_Section  11.06_ _Binding  Effect;  Benefit; Assignment_**

 

 

 (a) The  provisions of this  Agreement shall be binding upon and, except
as provided in Section 7.04,  shall  inure to the benefit of the parties
hereto and their respective successors  and  assigns. Except as provided in
Section 7.04, no provision of this  Agreement is intended to confer any
rights, benefits, remedies, obligations  or  liabilities hereunder upon any
Person other than the parties hereto and their  respective successors and
assigns.

 

 

(b) No  party may  assign, delegate or otherwise transfer any of its rights
or obligations under  this Agreement without the consent of each other party
hereto, except that  Parent or Merger Subsidiary may transfer or assign its
rights and obligations  under this Agreement, in whole or from time to time
in part, to (i) one or  more  of their Affiliates at any time and (ii) after
the Effective Time, to any  Person; provided that such transfer or assignment
shall not relieve Parent  or  Merger Subsidiary of its obligations hereunder
or enlarge, alter or change  any  obligation of any other party hereto or
due to Parent or Merger  Subsidiary.

 

 

**_Section  11.07_ _Governing  Law_**

 

 

This  Agreement  shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
laws of the State  of  New York, without regard to the conflicts of law
rules of such state, except  to  the extent that Delaware Law is mandatorily
applicable to the  Merger.

 

 

**_Section  11.08_ _Jurisdiction_**

 

 

The  parties hereto  agree that any suit, action or proceeding seeking to
enforce any provision  of,  or based on any matter arising out of or in
connection with, this Agreement  or  the transactions contemplated hereby
shall be brought in the United States  District Court for the Southern
District of New York or any New York State  court  sitting in New York City,
so long as one of such courts shall have subject  matter jurisdiction over
such suit, action or proceeding, and that any cause  of  action arising out
of this Agreement shall be deemed to have arisen from  a  transaction of
business in the State of New York, and each of the parties  hereby 
irrevocably consents to the jurisdiction of such courts (and of the
appropriate  appellate courts therefrom) in any such suit, action or
proceeding and  irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law,
any objection  that  it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue
of any such suit,  action  or proceeding in any such court or that any such
suit, action or proceeding  brought in any such court has been brought in an
inconvenient forum. Process  in  any such suit, action or proceeding may be
served on any party anywhere in  the  world, whether within or without the
jurisdiction of any such court. Without  limiting the foregoing, each party
agrees that service of process on such  party  as provided in Section 11.01
shall be deemed effective service of process  on  such party.

 

 

**_Section  11.09_ _WAIVER  OF JURY  TRIAL_**

 

 

EACH  OF THE PARTIES  HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO
TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY  LEGAL  PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS  CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

 

 

**_Section  11.10_ _Counterparts;  Effectiveness_**

 

 

This  Agreement may  be signed in any number of counterparts, each of which
shall be an original,  with the same effect as if the signatures thereto and
hereto were upon the  same  instrument. This Agreement shall become
effective when each party hereto  shall  have received a counterpart hereof
signed by all of the other parties  hereto. Until and unless each party has
received a counterpart hereof  signed by the other party hereto, this
Agreement shall have no effect and  no  party shall have any right or
obligation hereunder (whether by virtue of  any  other oral or written
agreement or other communication).

 

 

**_Section  11.11_ _Entire  Agreement_**

 

 

This  Agreement and  the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire
agreement between the  parties with respect to the subject matter thereof and
supersede all prior  agreements and understandings, both oral and written,
between the parties  with  respect to the subject matter thereof.

 

 

**_Section  11.12_ _Severability_**

 

 

If  any term, provision, covenant or restriction of this Agreement is held
by  a  court of competent jurisdiction or other Governmental Authority to be
invalid,  void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms, provisions,
covenants  and  restrictions of this Agreement shall remain in full force
and effect and  shall  in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated so
long as the economic or  legal  substance of the transactions contemplated
hereby is not affected in any  manner  materially adverse to any party. Upon
such a determination, the  parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify
this Agreement so as to effect  the original intent of the parties as closely
as possible in an acceptable  manner in order that the transactions
contemplated hereby be consummated  as  originally contemplated to the
fullest extent possible.

 

 

**_Section  11.13_ _Specific  Performance_**

 

 

The  parties hereto  agree that irreparable damage would occur if any
provision of this Agreement  were not performed in accordance with the terms
hereof and that the parties  shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of  this  Agreement or to enforce
specifically the performance of the terms and provisions  hereof in any court
specified in Section 11.08, in addition to any other  remedy  to which they
are entitled at law or in equity.
