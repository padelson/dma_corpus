obligations and liabilities  of KNBT  shall be taken and deemed to be
transferred to and vested in NPB, as the  surviving corporation in the

excluding any  KNBT/NPB Directors, such approval not to be unreasonably
withheld) to ensure  that the KNBT/NPB Directors shall continue to hold 5
places on the NPB board  of  directors, in which event such replacement
shall be deemed a KNBT/NPB  Director. On and after the Effective Date Mr.
Jeffrey P. Feather  shall become the Vice Chairman of NPB's board of

Effective  Date,  continue to be issued and outstanding as an identical
share of NPB Common  Stock.

the  treasury of NPB immediately prior to the Effective Date, if any, shall,
on  and  after the Effective Date, continue to be issued and held in the
treasury  of  NPB.

 



 

2.02 _Conversion  of KNBT  Common Stock_. Subject to Sections 2.03 and 2.04
below with respect to  treasury stock and fractional shares, each share of
KNBT Common Stock issued  and  outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Date, shall, on the Effective  Date, automatically by reason of the
Merger and without any action on the  part  of the holder thereof, cease to
be outstanding and be converted into the  right  to receive 1.00 share of

Stock on the effective date of the NPB Stock Dividend  (as  so adjusted and
as may be further adjusted pursuant to Section 2.07, the  "Exchange Ratio").
The consideration provided for in this Section 2.02 and in  Section 2.04 is
referred to herein as the "Merger Consideration."

 



 

2.03 _Treasury  Stock and  Stock Owned by KNBT_. Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement  to the contrary, each share of KNBT Common Stock which is
either issued and  held  in the treasury of KNBT or issued and held by KNBT
or its Subsidiaries (other  than shares held in an agency or fiduciary
capacity or as a result of debts  previously contracted) as of the Effective
Date, if any, shall be cancelled,  and  no cash, stock or other property
shall be delivered in exchange  therefor.

 



 

2.04 _No  Fractional  Shares_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement to  the contrary, neither certificates nor scrip for fractional
shares of NPB  Common  Stock shall be issued in the Merger. Each holder of
KNBT Common Stock who  otherwise would have been entitled to a fraction of a
share of NPB Common  Stock  shall receive in lieu thereof cash (without
interest) in an amount determined  by  multiplying the fractional share
interest to which such holder would otherwise  be entitled (after taking into

Stock on Nasdaq for the 10 full trading days prior to the Effective  Date. No
such

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

holder  shall be entitled to dividends, voting rights or any other rights in

(a)  At  the Effective Time, each KNBT Stock Option which is outstanding and
unexercised  immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not then
vested and  exercisable, shall cease to represent a right to acquire shares
of KNBT Common  Stock and shall be converted automatically into an option to
purchase shares  of  NPB Common Stock, and NPB shall assume each KNBT Stock
Option, in accordance  with the terms of the applicable KNBT Stock Plan and
stock option or other  agreement by which it is evidenced, except that from
and after the Effective  Time, (i) NPB and the Human Resources Committee of
the NPB Board shall be  substituted for KNBT and the committee of the KNBT
Board (including, if  applicable, the entire KNBT Board) administering such
KNBT Stock Option Plan,  (ii) each KNBT Stock Option assumed by NPB may be
exercised solely for shares  of  NPB Common Stock, (iii) the number of
shares of NPB Common Stock subject  to such  KNBT Stock Option shall be
equal to the number of shares of KNBT Common Stock  subject to such KNBT
Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time  multiplied by the
Exchange Ratio, provided that any fractional shares of  NPB  Common Stock
resulting from such multiplication shall be rounded down to  the  nearest
share, (iv) the per share exercise price under each such KNBT Stock  Option
shall be adjusted by dividing the per share exercise price under each  such
KNBT Stock Option by the Exchange Ratio, provided that such exercise  price 
shall be rounded up to the nearest cent, and (v) all outstanding KNBT
Options  shall become fully vested and exercisable at the Effective Time
notwithstanding  anything to the contrary in the applicable KNBT Stock Plan
or stock option  or  other agreement by which a KNBT Stock Option is 
evidenced. Notwithstanding clauses (iii) and (iv) of the preceding  sentence,
each KNBT Stock Option which is an "incentive stock option" shall be 
adjusted as required by Sections 409A and 424 of the Code, and the
regulations  promulgated thereunder, so as not to constitute a modification,
extension  or  renewal of the option within the meaning of Sections 409A and
424(h) of the  Code. NPB and KNBT agree to take all necessary steps to effect
the  foregoing provisions of this Section 2.05 (a), including in the case of
NPB  taking all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance a
sufficient  number of shares of NPB Common Stock for delivery upon exercise
of the options  to issue shares of NPB Common Stock issued in accordance
herewith.

 



 

(b)  As  soon as practicable after the Effective Date, but in no event later
than  ten  (10) Business Days after the Effective Date, NPB shall file a
registration  statement on Form S-3 or Form S-8, as the case may be (or any
successor or  other  appropriate forms), with respect to the shares of NPB
Common Stock subject  to  the options referred to in paragraph (a) of this
Section 2.05 and shall use  its  reasonable efforts to maintain the current
status of the prospectus or  prospectuses contained therein for so long as
such options remain outstanding  in  the case of a Form S-8 or, in the case
of a Form S-3, until the shares subject  to such options may be sold without
a further holding period under Rule 144  under the Securities Act.

 



 

(c) As  soon as practicable  after the Effective Date, but in no event later
than twenty (20) Business  Days  after the Effective Date, NPB shall deliver

Stock which comprise the Merger Consideration pursuant  to  Section 2.02 in
the form of book-entry shares to holders of shares of KNBT  Common Stock and
(ii) deliver to the Exchange Agent an estimated amount of  cash  sufficient
to make all payments pursuant to Section 2.04, in exchange for  KNBT 
Certificates in accordance with this Section 2.06. The Exchange Agent shall 
not  be entitled to vote or exercise any rights of ownership with respect to
the  shares of NPB Common Stock held by it from time to time hereunder,
except  that  it shall receive and hold all dividends or other distributions
paid or  distributed with respect to such shares for the account of the
person entitled  thereto.

 



 

(b) As  soon as reasonably  practicable after the Effective Date, but in any
event not later than ten  (10)  Business Days after KNBT delivers or causes
to be delivered a final stock  register of the KNBT shareholders, NPB shall
cause the Exchange Agent to  mail to  each holder of one or more KNBT
Certificates:

 



 

(i) a  letter of transmittal  which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and  title  to the KNBT Certificates shall pass,
only upon delivery of the KNBT Certificates  to the Exchange Agent, and which
letter shall be in customary form and have  such  other provisions as NPB
reasonably may specify; and

 



 

(ii) instructions  for  effecting the surrender of such KNBT Certificates in
exchange for the Merger  Consideration payable for the shares represented
thereby.

 



 

Upon  surrender of a KNBT Certificate to the Exchange Agent together with
such  letter  of transmittal, duly executed and completed in accordance with
the instructions  thereto, and such other documents as reasonably may be
required by the Exchange  Agent, the holder of such KNBT Certificate shall be
entitled to receive in  exchange therefor (i) a statement evidencing book-
entry shares representing,  in  the aggregate the number of whole shares of
NPB Common Stock that such holder  has the right to receive pursuant to
Section 2.02 (after taking into account  all  shares of KNBT Common Stock
held by such at the Effective Time), and (ii)  a  check representing the
amount of cash, if any, payable in lieu of a fractional  share of KNBT Common
Stock under Section 2.04, and the KNBT Certificate so  surrendered shall
forthwith be cancelled. Following the issuance of shares  of  NPB Common
Stock in book-entry form pursuant to this

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Agreement,  each recipient of such shares will receive a Direct Registration
System Stock  Distribution Statement from NPB's transfer agent evidencing the
credit of shares  of NPB Common Stock to an account for such shareholder and
containing  instructions on how a shareholder may, if desired, request a
physical  certificate for shares of NPB Common Stock.

 



 

(c) Any  statement evidencing  book-entry shares issued in exchange for KNBT
Certificates pursuant to Section  2.06(a) above shall be dated the Effective
Date and any holder shall be entitled  to dividends and all other rights and
privileges pertaining to such shares  of  stock from the Effective Date.
Until surrendered, each KNBT  Certificate shall, from and after the Effective
Time, evidence solely the  right  to receive the Merger Consideration.

 



 

(d) If  a KNBT Certificate is  exchanged on a date following one or more
record dates after the Effective  Date  for the payment of dividends or any
other distribution on shares of NPB Common  Stock, NPB shall pay to such
shareholder cash in an amount equal to dividends  payable on such shares of
NPB Common Stock received in exchange for KNBT  Certificates and pay or
deliver any other distribution to which such shareholder  is entitled. No
interest shall accrue or be payable in respect of  dividends or any other
distribution otherwise payable under this Section  2.06(d)  upon surrender
of KNBT Certificates. Notwithstanding the foregoing,  no party hereto shall
be liable to any holder of KNBT Common Stock for any  amount paid in good
faith to a public official or agency pursuant to any  applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar law. Until such  time as KNBT Certificates are
surrendered to NPB for exchange, NPB shall  have  the right to withhold
dividends or any other distributions on the shares  of NPB  Common Stock
issuable to such shareholder.

 



 

(e) Upon  the Effective Date,  the stock transfer books for KNBT Common
Stock will be closed and no further  transfers of KNBT Common Stock will
thereafter be made or  recognized. All KNBT Certificates surrendered pursuant
to this  Section 2.06 will be cancelled and exchanged for the Merger
Consideration  as  provided herein.

 



 

(f) If  there is a transfer  of ownership of KNBT Common Stock which is not
registered in the transfer  records of KNBT, a statement of book-entry shares
evidencing, in the aggregate,  the proper number of shares of NPB Common
Stock and any cash in lieu of a  fractional share payment to Section 2.04 and
dividends or other distributions  to  which such holder is entitled pursuant
to Section 2.06(c), as applicable,  may be  issued with respect to such KNBT
Common Stock to such a transferee if the  KNBT  Certificate representing
such shares of KNBT Common Stock is presented to  the  Exchange Agent,
accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect  such transfer
and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have  been  paid or
are not payable.

 



 

(g) If  any KNBT Certificate  shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the
Exchange Agent shall deliver  in  exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed KNBT Certificate, upon the making  of  a sworn affidavit of that
fact by the holder thereof in form satisfactory  to the  Exchange Agent, the
Merger Consideration required pursuant to this Agreement;  provided, however,
that the Exchange Agent may, in its sole discretion and  as a  condition
precedent to the delivery of the Merger Consideration to which  the  holder
of such KNBT Certificate is entitled as a result of the Merger, require  the
owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed KNBT Certificate to

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

deliver  a  bond in such amount as it may direct as indemnity against any
claim that  may be  made against KNBT, NPB or the Exchange Agent or any
other party with respect  to  the KNBT Certificate alleged to have been
lost, stolen or  destroyed.

 



 

2.07 _Anti-Dilution  Provisions_. If, in addition to the NPB Stock Dividend,
NPB shall,  at any time before the Effective Date:

 



 

(a) declare  a dividend in  shares of NPB Common Stock with a record date
prior to the Effective  Date;

 



 

(b) resolve  to combine the  outstanding shares of NPB Common Stock into a
smaller number of shares prior  to  the Effective Date;

 



 

(c) resolve  to effect a  split or subdivide the outstanding shares of NPB
Common Stock with a record  date  prior to the Effective Date; or

 



 

(d) reclassify  the shares of  NPB Common Stock prior to the Effective Date;

 



 

then,  in  any such event, the number of shares of NPB Common Stock to be
delivered  to KNBT  shareholders in exchange for shares of KNBT Common Stock
shall be adjusted  so  that each KNBT shareholder shall be entitled to
receive such number of shares  of  NPB Common Stock as such shareholder
would have been entitled to receive  if the  Effective Date had occurred
prior to the happening of such event. (By  way of illustration, if NPB shall
declare a stock dividend of 3% payable  with  respect to a record date on or
prior to the Effective Date, the Exchange  Ratio  shall be adjusted upward
by 3%.). In addition, in the event that,  prior to the Effective Date, NPB
enters into an agreement pursuant to which  shares of NPB Common Stock would
be converted into shares or other securities  or  obligations of another
corporation, proper provision shall be made in such  agreement so that each
KNBT shareholder who becomes a shareholder of NPB  shall  be entitled to
receive such number of shares or other securities or amount  or  obligations
of such other corporation as such shareholder would be entitled  to  receive
if the Effective Date had occurred immediately prior to the happening  of 
such event. Furthermore, the number of shares of NPB Common Stock  subject to
each KNBT Option referenced in Section 2.05(a) and the applicable  exercise
price shall be appropriately adjusted.

to have  been  withheld and paid in connection with any amounts paid or
owing to any employee,  except where failure to withhold or to pay such
withholding would not have  a  Material Adverse Effect on NPB.

(i) such  insurance will be  cancelled or that coverage thereunder will be
reduced or eliminated;  or

 



 

(ii) premium  costs with  respect to such insurance will be substantially

all material respects,  NPB  agrees to file, or cause to be filed, the
Registration Statement and the  Prospectus/Proxy Statement with the SEC as

respective  affiliates, officers or directors, should be discovered by KNBT
or NPB which  should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to either the
Registration  Statement or the Prospectus/Proxy Statement so that such
documents would  not  include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to
state any material  fact  required to be stated therein or necessary to make
the statements therein,  in  light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading, the  party  which discovers such information
shall promptly notify the other party and,  to  the extent required by law,
rules or regulations, an appropriate amendment  or  supplement describing
such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC  and  disseminated to
the shareholders of KNBT and NPB.

and to obtain as promptly as  practicable all permits, consents, approvals
and authorizations of all  Regulatory Authorities and other third parties
which are necessary or advisable  to consummate the Contemplated Transactions
and to comply with the terms  and  conditions of all such permits, consents,
approvals and authorizations of  all  such Regulatory Authorities and third
parties. Notwithstanding the  foregoing, nothing contained herein shall be
deemed to require NPB or KNBT  to  take any action, or commit to take any
action, or agree to any conditions  or  restrictions, in connection with
obtaining the foregoing permits, consents,  approvals and authorizations of
Regulatory Authorities or other third parties  that would reasonably be
expected to result in the imposition of a condition  or  restriction of the
type referred to in Sections 6.01(d) and  6.02(d).

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 



 

(c) NPB  and KNBT shall  promptly inform each other of any material
communication from, and shall  give  the other a reasonable opportunity to

transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and each  shall  consult the
other with respect to the substance and status of such  filings. KNBT and NPB
shall each promptly furnish the other with  copies of written communications
to, or received by them from, any Regulatory  Authority in respect of the
Contemplated Transactions.

 



 

(d) KNBT  and NPB shall  cooperate with each other in the foregoing matters
and shall furnish the  other  with all information concerning itself as may
be necessary or advisable in  connection with any Application or filing,
including any report filed with  the  SEC, made by or on behalf of such
party to or with any Regulatory Authority  in  connection with the
Contemplated Transactions, and in each such case, such  information shall be
accurate and complete in all material  respects. In connection therewith,

this Agreement; but in respect  of  the foregoing clauses (i) through (iv)
only if the KNBT Board of Directors  shall  conclude in good faith after
consultation with its legal and financial advisors,  that failure to do so
would result in a breach by such directors of their  fiduciary duties.

 



 

KNBT  shall (unless it believes, after  consultation with its counsel, that
such notification would violate the KNBT  Board of Directors' fiduciary
duties) notify NPB as promptly as practicable, in  reasonable detail, as to
any inquiries and proposals relating to an Acquisition  Proposal which it or
any of its representatives or agents may  receive.

 



 

5.07  _Advice of Changes_ _._ Each of NPB and KNBT shall promptly  advise
the other of any change or event which, individually or in the aggregate 
with other such changes or events, has or would reasonably be expected to 
have a  Material Adverse Effect on it or which it believes would or would be
reasonably  likely to cause or constitute a material breach of any of its
representations,  warranties or covenants contained herein, provided,
however, that any  noncompliance with the foregoing shall not constitute the
failure to be  satisfied of a condition set forth in Article VI or give rise
to any right  of  termination under Article VII unless the underlying breach
shall independently  constitute such a failure or give rise to such a right.

 



 

5.08 _Other  Undertakings  by NPB and KNBT_.

 



 

(a) _Undertakings  of  KNBT_.

 



 

(i) _Shareholder  Approval_. KNBT shall call a special KNBT Shareholders

cause its respective  Subsidiaries to, execute and deliver to each law firm
referred to in Sections  6.01(g) and 6.02(g) certificates containing

substance of any press release related to this Agreement and the

requirements of any stock  exchange.

 



 

(iii) _Maintenance  of  Insurance_. NPB and each NPB Subsidiary, and KNBT
and each KNBT  Subsidiary, shall maintain insurance in such amounts as NPB

limitations  imposed by law, GAAP and the fiduciary duties of the Board of
Directors of  KNBT,  KNBT shall establish such additional accruals and
reserves as may be reasonably  necessary to conform KNBT's accounting and
credit loss reserve practices and  methods to those of NPB; provided,
however, that KNBT shall not be required  to  take such action prior to the

in Sections 6.01 and 6.02, as certified in  writing to KBNT by NPB; provided

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

further,  however, that no such additional accruals and reserves will be
required to  be  made more than five (5) business days prior to the Closing
Date. No  such additional accruals or reserves made by KNBT pursuant to this
subsection  shall constitute or be deemed to be a breach, violation of or
failure to  satisfy  any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement,
condition or other provision  of this Agreement or otherwise be considered in
determining whether any such  breach, violation or failure to satisfy shall
have occurred. The  recording of any such adjustments shall not be deemed to

management with any such  adjustments.

to the  other, as soon as practicable after the end of each month and after

KNBT Benefit Plans that are  a  defined benefit pension plans (as described
under ERISA) at such time and  in  such manner as shall be mutually agreed
by KNBT and NPB to be in their best  interests and not inconsistent with the
requirements of ERISA. Except  as otherwise agreed to by NPB and KNBT, any
such withdrawal shall be effected  by  transferring the assets and
liabilities attributable to KNBT from such plans  into one or more single
employer defined benefit pension plan that is sponsored  by KNBT, or, after
the Effective Time, NPB. No  action  to be taken by KNBT or NPB pursuant to
the terms of this Section 5.08(b)(xi)  shall constitute or be deemed to be a
breach, violation of or failure to  satisfy  any representation, warranty,
covenant, agreement, condition or other provision  of this Agreement or
otherwise be considered in determining whether any such  breach, violation or

(c) _Undertakings  of  NPB_.

 



 

(i) _Shareholder  Approval_. NPB shall call a special NPB Shareholders
Meeting to be  held as soon as practicable after the Registration Statement
is declared  effective by the SEC, for purposes of voting upon the adoption
of this Agreement  and the approval of the transactions contemplated hereby.
NPB shall  use commercially reasonable efforts to solicit and obtain the

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

votes  of  the NPB shareholders in favor of the adoption of this Agreement.
The  Board of Directors of NPB shall recommend adoption of this Agreement by
the  shareholders of NPB.

 



 

(ii)  _Stock  Exchange Listing_. NPB  shall use its reasonable best efforts
to file all notices with Nasdaq and  take  any other action as may be
necessary to ensure that the shares of NPB Common  Stock to be issued in the
Merger or otherwise pursuant to this Agreement  will be  listed on Nasdaq,
subject to official notice of issuance, at the Effective  Time.

 



 

(iii) _Employees;  Severance Policy_.

 



 

(A) NPB  and KNBT will work  cooperatively prior to the Closing through an
integration team to determine  which employees will likely be redundant based
on planned closings of certain  offices and duplicative functions of
employees following the  Merger. Each of NPB and KNBT will inform each of
their employees of  the likelihood of such employee having continued
employment with KNBT Bank,  NPB,  NPBank or any other NPB Subsidiary
following the Closing, and NPB will permit  any KNBT employee to apply for
any employment position posted as available  with  KNBT Bank, NPB, NPBank or
any other NPB Subsidiary. Where there is a coincidence  of responsibilities,
NPB will try to reassign the affected individual to  a  needed position that
utilizes the skills and abilities of the  individual.

 



 

(B) Prior  to the Effective  Time, NPB shall take all reasonable action so
that employees of KNBT and  its  Subsidiaries who become employees of NPB
and its Subsidiaries (the "Continuing  Employees") shall be entitled to
participate, effective as soon as  administratively practicable following the
Effective Time, in each NPB Benefit  Plan of general applicability to the
same extent as similarly-situated employees  of NPB and its Subsidiaries (it
being understood that inclusion of the employees  of KNBT and its
Subsidiaries in the NPB Benefit Plans may occur at different  times with
respect to different plans and that any grants to any former employee  of
KNBT or its Subsidiaries under any equity compensation plan of NPB shall 
be  discretionary with NPB). To the extent that Continuing Employees are 
not entitled to participate in any NPB Benefit Plan effective as of the 
Effective Time, such employees shall continue to participate in the 
corresponding employee benefit plan, program or arrangement of KNBT and its 
Subsidiaries so as to ensure that there is not a lapse in participation or 
coverage (but in no event to provide duplicate participation or coverage), 
as  applicable, prior to participation in such NPB Benefit Plan, provided
that  in no  event shall NPB be required to continue any employee benefit
plan, program  or  arrangement of KNBT for which there is no corresponding
NPB Benefit Plan.  NPB  shall cause each NPB Benefit Plan in which
Continuing Employees are eligible  to  participate to take into account for
purposes of eligibility, vesting and  benefit accruals under the NPB Benefit
Plans (other than for benefit accruals  under NPB's defined benefit pension
plan and supplemental executive retirement  plan) the service of such
employees with KNBT and its Subsidiaries (and any  predecessor entities) to
the same extent as such service was credited generally  for such purpose by
KNBT and its Subsidiaries, provided, however, that such  service shall not be
recognized to the extent that such recognition would  result  in a
duplication of benefits with respect to the same period of  service.

 



 

(C) If  Continuing Employees  become eligible to participate in a medical,
dental, health or disability  plan  of NPB or its Subsidiaries, NPB shall
cause each such plan to (i) waive any  preexisting condition limitations to
the extent such conditions are covered  under the

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applicable  medical, health, dental or disability plans of KNBT and its
Subsidiaries,  (ii)  honor under such plans any deductible, co-payment and
out-of-pocket expenses  incurred by the employees and their beneficiaries
during the portion of the  plan  year prior to such participation and (iii)
waive any waiting period limitation  or evidence of insurability requirement
which would otherwise be applicable  to  such employee on or after the
Effective Time, unless such employee had not  yet  satisfied any similar
limitation or requirement under an analogous KNBT Benefit  Plan prior to the
Effective Time.

 



 

(D) An  employee of NPB or  any of its Subsidiaries who was an employee of
KNBT or any of its Subsidiaries  immediately prior to the Effective Time
(excluding any employee who is party  to  an employment agreement, change-
in-control agreement or any other agreement  which provides for severance
payments) whose employment terminates during  the  one-year period following
the Effective Time under circumstances entitling  him  or her to benefits
under the terms of the KNBT Severance Plan shall be entitled  to receive
severance payments in accordance with, and to the extent provided  in,  the
KNBT Severance Plan.

 



 

(E) As  of the Effective  Time, NPB shall assume and honor and shall cause
the appropriate Subsidiaries  of  NPB to assume and honor in accordance with
their terms all KNBT Benefit Plans  existing immediately prior to the
execution of this Agreement which have  been  disclosed in Section 3.12(a)
of the KNBT Disclosure Schedule. NPB acknowledges  and agrees that the
consummation of the Merger constitutes a "Change in Control" for purposes of
the KNBT Benefit Plans.

 



 

(F) With  respect to each  KNBT Benefit Plan subject to Section 409A of the
Code, KNBT agrees to amend  each  such plan or cause each such plan to be
amended to the extent necessary to  comply with Section 409A of the Code (or
to cause such plan, in whole or  in  part, to avoid the application of
Section 409A of the Code by preserving  the  terms of such plan, and the law
in effect, for benefits vested as of December  31, 2004) prior to the earlier
of the Effective Time or the deadline imposed  by  the IRS. Such amendments
shall be provided to NPB and its counsel at  least ten days prior to their
proposed adoption by KNBT or KNBT Bank and  shall  be subject to the prior
approval of NPB, which shall not be unreasonably  withheld.

 



 

(G) With  respect to  the KNBT Employee Stock Ownership Plan (the "ESOP"),
KNBT prior to the Effective  Time and NPB subsequent to the Effective Time
shall: (i) take any  actions necessary to cause the ESOP to be terminated and
for the balances  in all  participant accounts to become fully vested and
nonforfeitable as of the  Effective Date; (ii) cause the Trustee of the ESOP
to sell a number of shares  of  NPB Common Stock received in the ESOP
suspense account as a result of the  Merger  to the extent necessary to
obtain cash at least equal to the remaining ESOP  indebtedness; (iii) in the
event the cash sales proceeds from the sale of  the  NPB Common Stock in the
ESOP suspense account are less than the then outstanding  ESOP indebtedness,
make an additional cash contribution to the ESOP so that  the  suspense
account has sufficient cash to repay the then outstanding ESOP  indebtedness;
(iv) cause the Trustee to use the cash proceeds from the sale  of  NPB
Common Stock and any cash contribution required by clause (iii) above  to 
repay in full all outstanding ESOP indebtedness; (v) cause any shares of 
NPB  Common Stock and any cash remaining in the suspense account maintained
under  the  ESOP, after giving effect to the repayment of the ESOP
indebtedness referred  to  in clause (iv) above, to be

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

allocated  to the accounts of ESOP participants who have account balances in
the ESOP  in  accordance with the applicable provisions of the ESOP; (vi)
cause the account  balances of all ESOP participants to be 100% vested and
distributed in a  lump  sum (or transferred in accordance with Section
401(a)(31) of the Code) as  soon  as practicable following the later of (A)
the Effective Time or (B) the date  of  receipt of a favorable determination
letter from the IRS regarding the qualified  status of the ESOP upon its
termination; and (vii) adopt amendment(s) to  the  ESOP, in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to NPB, as may be requested  by the IRS in
connection with the request for a determination  letter. As soon as
practicable after the date hereof, KNBT shall file  a request for a
determination letter from the IRS regarding the continued  qualified status
of the ESOP upon its termination. Prior to the  Effective Time, KNBT and,
following the Effective Time, NPB shall use their  respective reasonable best
efforts to obtain such favorable determination  letter  (including, but not
limited to, making such changes to the ESOP and the proposed  allocation
described herein as may be requested by the IRS as a condition  to its 
issuance of a favorable determination letter).

 



 

(H) As  of the date of  this Agreement, NPB, NPBank, KNBT and KNBT Bank, as
applicable, shall enter  into  (i) amendments to the amended and restated
employment agreements between  KNBT,  KNBT Bank and each of Mr. Fainor and
Ms. Bodnyk in the form set forth in  Exhibit  3 hereto, and (ii) a the
Consulting Agreement in the form set forth in Exhibit  4  hereto.

 



 

(I) Subject  to the other  provisions of this Section 5.08(c)(iii) and
Section 2.05, after the Effective  Date, NPB may discontinue, amend, convert
to, or merge with, an NPB or NPB  Subsidiary plan any KNBT Benefit Plan,
subject to such plan\'s provisions  and  applicable law, provided that no
such action shall reduce or eliminate a  vested  benefit.

 



 

(iv) _Election  of NPBank  Directors_.

 



 

(A) Upon  consummation of the Merger and subject to compliance with all
applicable  legal  requirements, NPB shall cause NPBank to elect the
KNBT/NPB Directors (each,  a "KNBT/NPBank Directors") as directors of
NPBank, effective the Effective Date,  each to hold office until his
successor is elected and qualified or otherwise  in  accordance with
applicable law, the articles of association and bylaws of  NPBank; and NPB
and NPBank shall take all steps necessary to ensure that  the  KNBT/NPBank
Nominees are re-elected to NPBank\'s Board of Directors so that  they  may
hold such office for a period of not less than three years following  the 
Closing.

 



 

(B) If  any KNBT/NPBank Director, or any successor, resigns, dies or is
otherwise  removed from NPBank\'s Board of Directors prior to the third
anniversary of  the  Closing, the KNBT/NPB Directors who are then serving on
the NPBank Board,  by a  plurality vote, shall have the right to select the
successor to such KNBT/NPBank  Director, or any successor, subject to (A)
compliance with the NPB/NPBank  Bylaws  Restrictions, (B) such person being
"independent" as defined by the SEC and  Nasdaq, and (C) approval of such
person by NPB (which approval will not be  unreasonably withheld). NPB shall
take all reasonable steps to elect  such successor to the NPBank Board of
Directors.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 



 

(C) The  KNBT/NPB Directors who are elected to serve on the NPBank Board will
be  compensated for such service after the Effective Date in the same
manner  and in  the same amounts as all other directors of NPB who serve on
the NPBank Board  are  compensated.

 



 

(D) The  covenants in this Section 5.08(c)(iv) shall expire if and when NPB
or NPBank  shall be acquired, merged or otherwise sold.

 



 

(v) _KNBT  Division, KNBT  Regional Board_.

 



 

(A) Upon  consummation of  the Merger and until consummation of the Bank
Merger, NPB shall operate KNBT  Bank as a Pennsylvania savings bank. The
Board of Directors of KNBT  Bank (the "KNBT Bank Board") shall, during this
time period, consist of all the  members of KNBT's Board of Directors at the
Effective Date and two NPB or NPBank  representatives selected by NPB; KNBT's
current non-employee directors serving  as directors of KNBT Bank during this
time period who are not KNBT/NPB Directors  or employees of NPB or any of its
Subsidiaries shall receive the same  compensation received by them as
directors of KNBT and KNBT Bank at the date  hereof. The KNBT/NPB Directors
who continue to serve on the KNBT Bank Board  will  be compensated for such
service after the Effective Date in the same manner  and  in the same
amounts as all other directors of NPB who serve on a Subsidiary  bank  board
are compensated.

 



 

(B) Upon  consummation of  the Bank Merger, NPB shall cause NPBank to
establish and operate a separate  banking division called "KNBT, a Division
of National Penn Bank" (the "KNBT Bank  Division"). The KNBT Bank Division
will consist of all KNBT Bank\'s  community offices in the Lehigh,
Northampton, Carbon, Luzerne, Schuylkill  and  Monroe counties of
Pennsylvania and all of NPB's community offices in the Lehigh  and
Northampton, counties of Pennsylvania, subject to an office consolidation 
evaluation process to be undertaken by NPB and KNBT. The directors of NPBank 
at  the time of the merger of NPBank and KNBT Bank will be the directors of 
NPBank.

 



 

(C) For  at least three  years after the Closing Date, all offices and
operations of the KNBT Bank  Division will be branded, subject to NPB's
reasonable discretion, using the name "KNBT, a Division of National Penn
Bank", including without limitation all  branch signage, statements,
communications, business cards, stationary,  brochures, web site, marketing
materials, promotional items, billing and  all  other aspects of the KNBT
Bank Division. Notwithstanding the foregoing, NPB  shall be relieved from the
obligations under this Section 5.08(c)(v)(C) if  (i)  NPB or NPBank shall be
acquired, merged or otherwise sold or (ii) NPB shall  undertake a new
corporate wide branding/renaming charter conversion within  the  NPB primary
market areas.

 



 

(D) Upon  consummation of  the Bank Merger, NPB shall cause NPBank to
establish a regional board (the "KNBT  Regional Board"). The KNBT Regional
Board shall initially consist of  all the directors of KNBT immediately prior
to the Closing Date, including  the  KNBT/NPB Directors. In accordance with
NPB corporate governance  procedures and guidelines, the KNBT Regional Board
will have authority to  recommend additional members from time to time. NPB
anticipates that  the emphasis of the KNBT Regional Board will be on business
development,  marketing and expansion of the KNBT Bank Division. For those
KNBT  Regional

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Board  members who are not KNBT/NPB Directors, they shall receive
compensation for  their service on the KNBT Regional Board at $25,000 per
annum (which can  be a  combination of retainer and meeting fees, similar to
other NPB Subsidiary  Boards) until the third anniversary of the Closing
Date. For KNBT  Regional Board members who are KNBT/NPB Directors, their
compensation shall  be  based on NPB's existing fee schedule for
advisory/regional  boards. NPB anticipates that the emphasis of the KNBT
Regional Board  will be on business development, marketing and expansion of
NPB's and its  Subsidiaries' businesses. Other persons who may be selected
for  service on the KNBT Regional Board shall be compensated in accordance
with  NPB\'s  standard compensation arrangements for divisional board
members, which is  partially fixed and partially incentive-based
compensation.

 



 

(E) NPB  shall operate KNBT  Bank or the KNBT Bank Division, and maintain
the KNBT Regional Board at the  foregoing compensation level, for a period of
at least three years after  the  Effective Date. This covenant shall expire
if (i) NPB shall be  acquired, merged or otherwise sold and the KNBT Bank
Division is not continued  or (ii) if agreed to by a majority vote of the
KNBT Bank Board or the KNBT  Regional Board on the one hand and the NPBank
Board of Directors on the  other.

 



 

(vi) _Indemnification,  Insurance_.

 



 

(A) From  and after the  Effective Time, NPB shall indemnify and hold
harmless each present and former  director, officer, employee and agent of
KNBT or a Subsidiary of KNBT, as  applicable, determined as of the Effective
Time (the "Indemnified Parties")  against any costs or expenses (including
reasonable attorneys' fees), judgments,  fines, losses, claims, damages or
liabilities incurred in connection with  any  claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,  administrative or
investigative, arising out of matters existing or occurring  at  or prior to
the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at  or  after the
Effective Time, arising in whole or in part out of or pertaining  to  the
fact that he or she is or was a director, officer or employee of KNBT  or, 
while a director, officer or employee of KNBT, is or was serving at the
request  of KNBT as a director, officer, employee or agent of another
corporation,  association, partnership, joint venture, trust or other
enterprise, including  without limitation matters related to the negotiation,
execution and performance  of this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby, to the  fullest  extent which such Indemnified Parties
would be entitled under the BCL (which  right to indemnification shall
include the advancement of reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses in advance
of the final disposition of any claim, action,  suit, proceeding or
investigation upon receipt from an Indemnified Party  of any  required
undertaking).

 



 

(B) Without  limitation of  the foregoing, NPB agrees that all rights to
indemnification and all limitations  on liability existing in favor of the
Indemnified Parties in the respective  article of incorporation, bylaws or
similar organizational documents of KNBT  or  any of its Subsidiaries as in
effect as of the date of this Agreement with  respect to matters occurring
prior to the Effective Time shall survive the  Merger and shall continue in
full force and effect from and after the Effective  Time, provided, that
nothing contained in this Section 5.08(c)(vi) shall  be  deemed to preclude
any liquidation, consolidation or merger of NPB or any  of its 
Subsidiaries, in which case all of such rights to indemnification and 
limitations on liability shall be deemed to so survive and continue 
notwithstanding any such liquidation, consolidation or merger. Without 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

limiting  the foregoing, in any case in which approval by NPB, one of its
Subsidiaries  or  the board of directors thereof is required to effect any
indemnification,  at the  election of the Indemnified Party, the
determination of any such approval  shall  be made by a majority of the
independent directors of NPB then in office  or by  independent counsel
mutually agreed upon between NPB and the Indemnified  Party.

 



 

(C) Prior  to the Effective  Date, NPB shall use its reasonable best efforts
(and KNBT shall cooperate  and  assist prior to the Effective Date in these
efforts), at no expense to the  beneficiaries, to:

 



 

(1) maintain  directors\' and  officers\' liability insurance ("DandO
Insurance") for the Indemnified Parties  with respect to matters occurring at
or prior to the Effective Time, issued  by a  carrier assigned a claims-
paying ability rating by A.M. Best and Co. of "A  (Excellent)" or higher; or

 



 

(2) obtain  coverage for  Prior Acts for the Indemnified Parties under the
directors\' and officers\'  liability insurance policies currently maintained
by NPB;

 



 

effective  at the Effective Time, in either case, providing at least the same
coverage  as  the DandO Insurance currently maintained by KNBT and containing
terms and  conditions which are no less favorable to the beneficiaries, for a
six-year  period after the Effective Date; provided, that NPB shall not be
obligated  to  make annual premium payments for such six-year period in
respect of the DandO  Insurance which exceed, for the portion related to
KNBT\'s directors and  officers, 200% of the annual premium payment, as of
June 30, 2007, under  KNBT\'s  current policy in effect on the date of this
Agreement (the "Maximum  Amount"). If the amount of the premiums necessary to
maintain or  procure such insurance coverage exceeds the Maximum Amount, NPB
shall use  its  reasonable best efforts to maintain the most advantageous
policies of directors\'  and officers\' liability insurance obtainable for a
premium equal to the Maximum  Amount.

 



 

(D) If  any claim is made  against present or former directors, officers or
employees of KNBT or any  KNBT  Subsidiary who are covered or potentially
covered by insurance, neither NPBank  nor NPB shall do anything that would
forfeit, jeopardize, restrict or limit  the  insurance coverage available
for that claim until the final disposition  thereof.

 



 

(E) If  NPB or any of its  successors or assigns shall consolidate with or
merge into any other person  and  shall not be the continuing or surviving
person of such consolidation or  merger  or shall transfer all or
substantially all of its assets to any person, then  and  in each case,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns  of NPB
shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section  5.08(c)(vi).

 



 

(F) The  provisions of this  Section 5.08(c)(vi) are intended to be for the
benefit of and shall be  enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, his or her
heirs and  representatives.

 



 

(G) NPB  shall pay all  expenses, including reasonable attorneys\' fees,
that may be incurred by any  Indemnified Party in enforcing the indemnity and
other obligations provided  for  in this Section 5.08(c)(vi).

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 



 

5.09 _Section  16 Matters_. NPB and KNBT agree that, in order to most
effectively  compensate and retain KNBT Insiders (as defined below) in
connection with  the  Merger, both prior to and after the Effective Time, it
is desirable that  KNBT  Insiders not be subject to a risk of liability
under Section 16(b) of the  Exchange Act to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law in connection  with the conversion of shares of KNBT Common
Stock into shares of NPB Common  Stock and KNBT Stock-Based Awards into NPB
Stock-Based Awards in the Merger,  and  for that compensatory and retentive
purpose agree to the provisions of this  Section 5.09. Assuming that KNBT
delivers to NPB the Section 16  Information (as defined below) in a timely
fashion, the Board of Directors  of  NPB, or a committee of non-employee
directors thereof (as such term is defined  for purposes of Rule 16b-3(d)
under the Exchange Act), shall adopt a resolution  providing that the receipt
by KNBT Insiders of NPB Common Stock in exchange  for  shares of KNBT Common
Stock and of NPB Stock-Based Awards in exchange for  KNBT  Stock-Based
Awards, in each case pursuant to the Merger and to the extent  such 
securities are listed in the Section 16 Information, are intended to be
exempt  from liability pursuant to Section 16(b) under the Exchange  Act.
"Section 16 Information" shall mean information accurate in all  material
respects regarding KNBT Insiders, the number of shares of KNBT Common  Stock
beneficially owned by each such KNBT Insider and expected to be exchanged 
for NPB Common Stock in the Merger and the number and description of KNBT 
Stock-Based Awards beneficially owned by each such KNBT Insider and expected 
to  be converted into NPB Stock-Based Awards in connection with the  Merger.
"KNBT Insiders" shall mean those officers and directors of  KNBT who are
subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the  Exchange Act
and who will be subject to such requirements in their capacity  as  officers
and/or directors of NPB following the Merger.

8.07 _Disclosure  Schedules_. Information contained on either the KNBT
Disclosure  Schedule or the NPB Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to cover
the express  disclosure requirement contained in a representation or warranty
of this  Agreement and any other representation or warranty of this Agreement
of such  party where it is readily apparent it applies to such provision.
The  mere inclusion of an item in a Disclosure Schedule as an exception to
a  representation or warranty shall not be deemed an admission by a party
that  such  item represents a material exception or fact, event or
circumstance or that  such  item is or could result in a Material Adverse
Effect.

determined by a court of competent  jurisdiction to be invalid or
unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as  to  that jurisdiction, be
ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or  unenforceability without
rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining  terms  and provisions of
this Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability  of  any of the
terms or provisions of this Agreement in any other jurisdiction,  and  if
any provision of this Agreement is determined to be so broad as to be 
unenforceable, the provision shall be interpreted to be only so broad as 
is  enforceable, in all cases so long as neither the economic nor legal
substance  of  the transactions contemplated hereby is affected in any
manner materially  adverse to any party or its shareholders. Upon any such 
determination, NPB and KNBT shall negotiate in good faith in an effort to 
agree  upon a suitable and equitable substitute provision to effect the
original  intent  of the parties.

accordance with the domestic internal law of the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania,  except to the extent that federal law is applicable by its
terms.

 



 

8.12 _Interpretation_. Each  of NPB and KNBT acknowledges that it has
participated in the drafting of  this  Agreement, and any applicable rule of
construction to the effect that  ambiguities are to be resolved against the
drafting party will not be applied  in  connection with the construction or
interpretation of this  Agreement.
