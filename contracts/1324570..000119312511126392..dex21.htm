This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (hereinafter referred to as this "
_Agreement_ "), dated May 2, 2011, is by and among PPR S.A., a " _soci ete
anonyme a conseil dadministration_" (a corporation with a board of directors)
organized under the laws of France (" _Parent_ "), TRANSFER HOLDING, INC., a
Delaware corporation and a direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of
Parent (" _Purchaser_ "), and Volcom, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "
_Company_ "). All capitalized terms used in this Agreement shall have the
meaning ascribed to such terms in _Section 9.5_ or as otherwise defined
elsewhere in this Agreement unless the context clearly provides otherwise.

RECITALS

WHEREAS, in furtherance thereof and pursuant to this Agreement, Purchaser has
agreed to commence a tender offer (as it may be amended from time to time, the
" _Offer_ ") to purchase all of the outstanding shares of the Companys Common
Stock, par value $0.001 per share (the " _Shares_ "), at a price per Share of
$24.50 (such amount or any different amount per Share that may be paid
pursuant to the Offer being hereinafter referred to as the " _Offer Price_ ");

 

WHEREAS, following the acceptance for payment of the Shares pursuant to the
Offer and upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, Purchaser will be merged with and into the Company with the Company
as the Surviving Corporation (the " _Merger_ ," and together with the Offer
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the "
_Transactions_ "), in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State
of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ "), whereby each issued and outstanding Share not
owned directly or indirectly by Parent, Purchaser or the Company (other than
Dissenting Shares) will be converted into the right to receive the Offer Price
in cash, without interest, upon the terms and conditions set forth in this
Agreement;

 

WHEREAS, immediately following the execution and delivery of this Agreement,
Parent and Purchaser will enter into a Tender and Voting Agreement with
certain directors and executive officers of the Company, pursuant to which,
among other things, such directors and executive officers will agree to tender
shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by each of them in the Offer and
to take certain actions and exercise certain rights, and to refrain from
taking other actions or exercising other rights, in each case, as set forth
therein;

WHEREAS, the board of directors of the Company (the " _Company Board of
Directors_ ") has (i) determined that the Transactions contemplated by this
Agreement are fair to and in the best interests of its stockholders, (ii)
approved and declared advisable this Agreement and the Transactions, including
the Offer and the Merger, and (iii) resolved to recommend that the Companys
stockholders accept the Offer, tender their Shares to Purchaser and, to the
extent applicable, adopt this Agreement;

 



1 WHEREAS, the boards of directors of Parent and Purchaser have, on the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth herein, approved and declared
advisable this Agreement and the Transactions contemplated hereby, including
the Offer and the Merger; and

WHEREAS, Parent, Purchaser and the Company desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the
Offer and the Merger and also prescribe various conditions to the Offer and
the Merger.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and premises
contained in this Agreement and for other good and valuable consideration,
the receipt and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties to this
Agreement agree as follows:

AGREEMENT

ARTICLE I

 

THE OFFER AND MERGER

Section 1.1 _The Offer_.

(a) Provided that this Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance
with _Section 8.1_, as promptly as practicable (and, so long as the Company
is in compliance with its obligations to provide information contained in the
third sentence of _Section 1.1(h)_, within seven (7) business days) after
the date hereof, Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to)
commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder
(the " _Exchange Act_ ")) the Offer to purchase for cash all Shares at the
Offer Price; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the Company is not ready to file
the Schedule 14D-9 on the same date as the commencement of the Offer by such
seven (7) business day deadline, then such deadline shall automatically be
extended until such date at the Company is ready to file the Schedule 14D-9.

(b) The obligation of Purchaser to accept for payment and pay for any Shares
validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer shall be subject to:
(i) there being validly tendered in the Offer and not withdrawn prior to any
then scheduled Expiration Time that number of Shares which, together with the
Shares then beneficially owned by Parent or Purchaser (if any), represents at
least a majority of the Shares then outstanding (determined on a fully
diluted basis) (as such minimum number of Shares may be amended or waived
pursuant to _Section 1.1(c)_, the " _Minimum Condition_ "); and (ii) the
satisfaction, or waiver by Parent or Purchaser, of the other conditions and
requirements set forth in _Annex I_ (together with the Minimum Condition, the
" _Offer Conditions_ "). Subject to the prior satisfaction of the Minimum
Condition and the satisfaction, or waiver by Parent or Purchaser, of the
other Offer Conditions, Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to)
consummate the Offer in accordance with its terms and accept for payment and
pay for all Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer
as promptly as possible after Purchaser is legally

 



2  permitted to do so after the Expiration Time. The Offer Price payable in
respect of each Share validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer
shall be paid net to the seller in cash, without interest, on the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and the Offer. In
circumstances in which the stockholders of the Company do not have the right
to seek remedies at law or equity, the obligations of Parent and Purchaser
under this Agreement are material to the Companys execution of this Agreement
and any failure by Parent or Purchaser to comply with the terms of this
Agreement shall enable the Company to seek all remedies available at law or
equity to it and on behalf of the stockholders.

(c) The Offer shall be made by means of an offer to purchase (the " _Offer
to Purchase_ ") that contains the terms set forth in this Agreement and the
Offer Conditions. Parent and Purchaser expressly reserve the right to increase
the Offer Price or to make any other changes in the terms and conditions of
the Offer, or waive, in whole or in part, any of the Offer Conditions;
_provided, however_ , that unless otherwise provided by this Agreement or as
previously approved in writing by the Company, Purchaser shall not (i)
decrease the Offer Price, (ii) change the form of consideration payable in
the Offer, (iii) reduce the number of Shares to be purchased in the Offer,
(iv) make any changes to or otherwise amend or modify any of the Offer
Conditions, or impose conditions to the Offer, that are different than or in
addition to the Offer Conditions, (v) amend or waive the Minimum Condition,
(vi) make any changes to or otherwise amend or modify any of the terms of the
Offer in a manner that is, or could reasonably be expected to be, adverse in
any respect to the holders of Shares, or (vii) extend or otherwise change the
Expiration Time in a manner other than pursuant to and in accordance with this
Agreement.

 

(d) The Offer shall expire at midnight (New York City time) on the date that
is twenty (20) business days following the commencement (within the meaning
of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) of the Offer (the " _Initial Expiration
Time_ ") or, in the event the expiration of the Offer has been extended
pursuant to and in accordance with this Agreement, the date to which the
Offer has been so extended (the Initial Expiration Time, or such later time to
which the expiration time has been extended pursuant to and in accordance with
this Agreement, is referred to as the " _Expiration Time_ "). 

(e) Unless this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 8.1_, the Offer
shall be extended from time to time as follows:

(i) _Offer Conditions Not Satisfied_. If on or prior to any then scheduled
Expiration Time, the Offer Conditions shall not have been satisfied, or, in
Parents sole discretion, waived by Parent or Purchaser if permitted
hereunder, Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to) extend the
Offer for successive periods of up to ten (10) business days each until the
Offer Conditions are satisfied or waived; _provided, however_ , that Purchaser
shall not be required to extend the Offer beyond the date that is forty (40)
business days after the satisfaction of the Antitrust Condition, provided
that such date shall be no earlier than September 30, 2011 and no later than
December 31, 2011 (the " _Outside Date_ ").

 



3 (ii) _Required by Applicable Law or Nasdaq_. Purchaser shall extend the Offer
for any period or periods required by applicable Law, by interpretation or
position of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or its staff (the " _SEC_
") or by Nasdaq.

 

(f) If necessary or desirable to obtain sufficient Shares (without regard to
the exercise of the Top-Up Option) to reach the Short Form Threshold,
Purchaser shall provide for a "subsequent offering period" (and one or more
extensions thereof) in accordance with Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act of
up to twenty (20) business days, as determined by Purchaser in consultation
with the Company, in accordance with Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act.
Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Offer, Purchaser
shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to) immediately accept for payment,
and pay for, all Shares that are validly tendered pursuant to the Offer
during such "subsequent offering period." The Offer Documents will provide for
the possibility of a "subsequent offering period" in a manner consistent with
the terms of this _Section 1.1(f)_.

(g) Purchaser shall not terminate the Offer prior to any scheduled Expiration
Time without the prior written consent of the Company, except in the event
that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 8.1_. In the event
that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 8.1_ prior to the
scheduled Expiration Time, Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser
to) promptly (and in any event within one (1) business day of such
termination), irrevocably and unconditionally terminate the Offer. If the
Offer is terminated or withdrawn by Purchaser, or this Agreement is
terminated prior to the purchase of Shares in the Offer, Purchaser shall
promptly return, and shall cause any depository acting on behalf of Purchaser
to return, all tendered Shares to the registered holders thereof. 

(h) As soon as practicable on the date of the commencement of the Offer
(within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act), Parent and
Purchaser shall file or cause to be filed with the SEC, pursuant to Regulation
M-A under the Exchange Act (" _Regulation M-A_ "), a Tender Offer Statement on
Schedule TO with respect to the Offer (together with all amendments,
supplements and exhibits thereto, the " _Schedule TO_ "). The Schedule TO
shall include, as exhibits, the Offer to Purchase and a form of letter of
transmittal and summary advertisement (collectively, together with
any amendments and supplements thereto, the " _Offer Documents_ "). The
Company shall promptly furnish to Parent and Purchaser all information
concerning the Company or any of its Representatives reasonably requested by
Parent or Purchaser and required by the Exchange Act to be set forth in the
Offer Documents. Parent and Purchaser agree to take all steps necessary to
cause the Offer Documents to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to holders
of Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by the Exchange Act.
Parent and Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand,
agree to promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the Offer
Documents if and to the extent that it shall have become false or misleading
in any material respect or as otherwise required by applicable Law. Parent and
Purchaser further agree to take all steps necessary to cause the Offer
Documents, as so corrected (if applicable), to be filed with the SEC
and disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case to the extent required by
the Exchange Act. The Company and its counsel shall be given

 



4  a reasonable opportunity to review the Schedule TO and the Offer Documents
before they are filed with the SEC, and Parent and Purchaser shall give due
consideration to all the reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested
thereto by the Company and its counsel. In addition, Parent and Purchaser
shall provide the Company and its counsel with copies of any written comments,
and shall inform them of any oral comments, that Parent, Purchaser or their
counsel may receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff with respect
to the Schedule TO or the Offer Documents promptly after receipt of such
comments, and any written or oral responses thereto. The Company and
its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review any such
written responses and Parent and Purchaser shall give due consideration to all
reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by the Company
and its counsel. 

(i) The Offer Price shall be adjusted appropriately to reflect the effect of
any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend
or distribution of securities convertible into Common Stock), cash dividend,
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of
shares or other like change with respect to Common Stock occurring on or
after the date hereof and prior to Purchasers acceptance for payment of, and
payment for, Common Stock pursuant to the Offer.

Section 1.2 _Company Actions_.

(a) As promptly as practicable after the filing of the Schedule TO, the
Company shall, in a manner that complies with Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange
Act, file with the SEC a Tender Offer Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on
Schedule 14D-9 with respect to the Offer (together with all amendments,
supplements and exhibits thereto, the " _Schedule 14D-9_ ") that shall,
subject to the provisions of _Section 5.2_, contain the Company Board
Recommendation. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to file the
Schedule 14D-9 on the date the Schedule TO is filed. The Company agrees to
take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9 to be filed with the SEC
and disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent
required by the Exchange Act. The Company, on the one hand, and Parent and
Purchaser, on the other hand, agree to promptly correct any information
provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that it
shall have become false or misleading in any material respect or as otherwise
required by applicable Law. The Company further agrees to take all steps
necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9, as so corrected (if applicable), to be
filed with the SEC and disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case as and
to the extent required by the Exchange Act. Unless the Company Board of
Directors has effected a Change of Recommendation, Parent, Purchaser and their
counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review the Schedule
14D-9 before it is filed with the SEC and the Company shall give due
consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested
thereto by Parent, Purchaser and their counsel. In addition, the Company shall
provide Parent, Purchaser and their counsel with copies of any written
comments, and shall inform them of any oral comments, that the Company or its
counsel may receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff with respect
to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after the Companys receipt of such comments,
and any written or oral responses thereto. Purchaser and their counsel shall
be given a reasonable opportunity to review any such written responses and the
Company shall give due consideration to all 

 



5  reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by Parent,
Purchaser and their counsel, _provided_ that if there has been a Change of
Recommendation, then the Company shall not be required to provide Purchaser
and their counsel with an opportunity to review those sections of the response
relating to the Change of Recommendation. The Company consents, subject to the
provisions of _Section 5.2_, to the inclusion of the Company Board
Recommendation in the Offer Documents and to the inclusion of a copy of the
Schedule 14D-9 with the Offer Documents mailed or furnished to the holders of
Shares.

 

(b) In connection with the Offer, the Company shall promptly (and in any event
within five (5) business days following the date of this Agreement) furnish
or cause to be furnished to Purchaser mailing labels, security position
listings and any available listing or computer files containing the names and
addresses of the record holders of the Shares and the beneficial holders
of the Shares known to the Company as of the most recent practicable date,
and shall promptly furnish Purchaser with such information and assistance
(including, but not limited to, lists of the record holders of the Shares and
the beneficial holders of the Shares known to the Company, updated from time
to time upon Purchasers request, and their addresses, mailing labels and
lists of security positions) as Purchaser or its agent may reasonably request
for the purpose of communicating the Offer to the record and beneficial
holders of the Shares. Except for such steps as are necessary to disseminate
the Offer Documents and any other documents necessary to consummate the Offer,
the Merger and the other Transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Parent
and Purchaser shall hold in confidence the information contained in any such
labels, listings and files, shall use such information only in connection with
the Offer and the Merger and, if this Agreement shall be terminated,
shall promptly deliver (and shall use their respective reasonable best
efforts to cause their agents and Representatives to deliver) to the Company
all copies and any extract or summaries of such information. In addition, in
connection with the Offer, the Company shall cooperate with Parent and
Purchaser to disseminate the Offer Documents to holders of Shares held in or
subject to any Company Equity Plan or other Benefit Plans, and to permit such
holders of Shares to tender Shares in the Offer. 

Section 1.3 _Directors_.

(a) Provided that the Minimum Condition is satisfied, promptly after Purchaser
accepts for payment and pays for any Shares tendered and not withdrawn
pursuant to the Offer (the " _Acceptance Time_ "), and at all times
thereafter, Purchaser shall be entitled to elect or designate such number of
directors, rounded up to the next whole number, on the Company Board of
Directors as is equal to the product of the total number of directors on the
Company Board of Directors (giving effect to the directors elected or
designated by Purchaser pursuant to this sentence) multiplied by the
percentage that the aggregate number of Shares beneficially owned by Parent
and Purchaser bears to the total number of Shares then outstanding. Upon
Purchasers request at any time following the Acceptance Time, the Company
shall promptly take such actions, including but not limited to filling
vacancies or newly created directorships on the Company Board of Directors,
increasing the size of the Company Board of Directors (including by amending
the Company Bylaws if necessary so as to increase the size of the Company
Board of Directors) and/or requesting and accepting the resignations of such
number of

 



6  its incumbent directors, as is reasonably necessary to enable Purchasers
designees to be so elected or designated to the Company Board of Directors,
and shall promptly cause Purchasers designees to be so elected or designated
at such time. The Company shall, upon Purchasers request following the
Acceptance Time, also cause Persons elected or designated by Purchaser to
constitute the same percentage (rounded up to the next whole number) as is on
the Company Board of Directors of (i) each committee of the Company Board of
Directors, (ii) each board of directors (or similar body) of each Company
Subsidiary, and (iii) each committee (or similar body) of each such board, in
each case to the extent permitted by applicable Law and the Nasdaq Marketplace
Rules. The Companys obligations under this _Section 1.3(a)_ shall be subject
to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder.
The Company shall promptly upon execution of this Agreement take all actions
required pursuant to Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 in order to fulfill its
obligations under this _Section 1.3(a)_, including mailing to stockholders
(together with the Schedule 14D-9, unless otherwise requested by Parent) the
information required by Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 as is necessary to enable
Purchasers designees to be elected or designated to the Company Board of
Directors. Purchaser shall supply the Company with, and solely be responsible
for, information with respect to Purchasers designees and Parents and
Purchasers respective officers, directors and affiliates to the extent
required by Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1. The provisions of this _Section
1.3(a)_ are in addition to and shall not limit any rights that any of
Purchaser, Parent or any of their respective affiliates may have as a
record holder or beneficial owner of Shares as a matter of applicable Law
with respect to the election of directors or otherwise.

 

(b) In the event that Purchasers designees are elected or designated to the
Company Board of Directors pursuant to  _Section 1.3(a)_, then, until the
Effective Time, the Company shall cause the Company Board of Directors to
maintain three (3) directors who are members of the Company Board of Directors
on the date hereof, each of whom shall be "independent" for purposes of Rule
10A-3 of the Exchange Act and also eligible to serve on the Companys audit
committee under the Exchange Act and Nasdaq rules and at least one of whom
shall be an "audit committee financial expert" as defined in Item
407(d)(5)(ii) of Regulation S-K and the instructions thereto (the "
_Continuing Directors_ "); _provided, however_ , that if any Continuing
Director is unable to serve due to death, disability or resignation, the
Company shall take all necessary action (including creating a committee of the
Company Board of Directors) so that the Continuing Director(s) shall be
entitled to elect or designate another Person (or Persons) to fill such
vacancy, and such Person (or Persons) shall be deemed to be a Continuing
Director for purposes of this Agreement. If no Continuing Director then
remains, the other directors shall designate three (3) Persons who shall each
qualify as "independent" for purposes of Rule 10A-3 of the Exchange Act and
eligible to serve on the Companys audit committee under the Exchange Act and
Nasdaq rules and at least one of whom shall be an "audit committee
financial expert" as defined in Item 407(d)(5)(ii) of Regulation S-K and the
instructions thereto, to fill such vacancies and such Persons shall be deemed
Continuing Directors for all purposes of this Agreement. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if Purchasers designees
constitute a majority of the Company Board of Directors after the Acceptance
Time and prior to the Effective Time, then the affirmative vote of a majority
of the Continuing Directors shall (in addition to the

 



7  approval rights of the Company Board of Directors or the stockholders of the
Company as may be required by the Company Governing Documents or applicable
Law) be required for the Company (i) to amend or terminate this Agreement,
(ii) to extend the time of performance of, or waive, any of the obligations or
other acts of Parent or Purchaser under this Agreement, or to exercise or
waive any of the Companys rights, benefits or remedies hereunder, if such
action would adversely affect the holders of Shares (other than Parent or
Purchaser), (iii) except as provided herein, to amend the Company Governing
Documents in a manner that would reasonably be expected to adversely affect
the holders of Shares (other than Parent or Purchaser), or (iv) to take any
other action or make any other determination of the Company Board of Directors
under or in connection with this Agreement if such action would reasonably be
expected to adversely affect the holders of Shares (other than Parent or
Purchaser). The Continuing Directors shall have, and Parent shall cause the
Continuing Directors to have, the authority to retain such counsel (which
may include current counsel to the Company or the Board of Directors) and
other advisors at the expense of the Company as determined by the Continuing
Directors, and the authority to institute any action on behalf of the Company
to enforce performance of this Agreement.

9 (a) As promptly as practicable following the Acceptance Time, the Company
shall prepare and file with the SEC a proxy for the Special Meeting (together
with any amendments thereof or supplements thereto and any other required
proxy materials, the " _Proxy Statement_ ") relating to the Merger and this
Agreement; _provided, _ that Parent, Purchaser and their counsel shall be
given a reasonable opportunity to review the Proxy Statement before it is
filed with the SEC and the Company shall give due consideration to all
reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by Parent,
Purchaser and their counsel. Subject to _Section 5.2_, the Company shall
include in the Proxy Statement the recommendation of the Company Board of
Directors that the stockholders of the Company vote in favor of the adoption
of this Agreement in accordance with the DGCL. The Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain and furnish the information required to be
included by the SEC in the Proxy Statement and, after consultation with
Purchaser, respond promptly to any comments made by the SEC with respect to
the Proxy Statement. The Company shall provide Parent, Purchaser and their
counsel with copies of any written comments, and shall inform them of any oral
comments, that the Company or its counsel may receive from time to time from
the SEC or its staff with respect to the Proxy Statement promptly after the
Companys receipt of such comments, and any written or oral responses thereto.
Parent, Purchaser and their counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity
to review any such written responses and the Company shall give due
consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested
thereto by Parent, Purchaser and their counsel. The Company, on the one hand,
and Parent and Purchaser, on the other hand, agree to promptly correct any
information provided by it for use in the Proxy Statement if and to the extent
that such information shall have become false or misleading in any material
respect or as otherwise required by applicable Laws, and the Company further
agrees to cause the Proxy Statement, as so corrected (if applicable), to be

of the Proxy Statement as provided in _Section 1.9(b)(ii)_, mailed to
holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by the Exchange

(b) The Company, acting through the Company Board of Directors, shall, in
accordance with and subject to the requirements of applicable Law and this
Agreement (including _Section 5.2_ and  _Section 8.1_):

(i) (A) as promptly as reasonably practicable following the Acceptance Time,
duly set a record date for, and take all action necessary in accordance with
the DGCL and the Company Governing Documents to duly call and give notice of a
special meeting of its stockholders (such meeting or any adjournment or
postponement thereof, the " _Special Meeting_ ") for the purpose of
considering and taking action upon this Agreement and the Merger (with the
record date and meeting date set in consultation with Purchaser), and (B) as
promptly as reasonably practicable following the Acceptance Time, convene and
hold the Special Meeting (and adjourn or postpone the Special Meeting in
consultation with Purchaser);

(ii) as promptly as reasonably practicable following the Acceptance Time, file
the definitive Proxy Statement with the SEC and cause the Proxy Statement to
be mailed to its stockholders; and

 



10 (iii) use its reasonable best efforts to (A) solicit from its stockholders
proxies in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and (B) secure any approval
of stockholders of the Company that is required by the DGCL and any other
applicable Law to effect the Merger.

 

(c) At the Special Meeting or any postponement or adjournment thereof, Parent
shall vote, or cause to be voted, all of the Shares then owned by it,
Purchaser or any of their other Subsidiaries in favor of the adoption of this
Agreement and to deliver or provide, in its capacity as a stockholder of the
Company, any other approvals that are required by the DGCL and any
other applicable Law to effect the Merger.

Section 1.10 _Merger Without Meeting of Stockholders_. Notwithstanding the
terms of  _Section 1.9_, in the event that Parent, Purchaser and their
respective Subsidiaries shall hold, in the aggregate, at least ninety percent
(90%) of the outstanding Shares (the " _Short Form Threshold_ ") following
the Acceptance Time and the expiration of any "subsequent offering period"
provided by Purchaser pursuant to and in accordance with this Agreement, if
applicable, and the exercise of the Top-Up Option, if applicable, the parties
hereto shall cause the Merger to become effective promptly, without a meeting
of stockholders of the Company, in accordance with Section 253 of the DGCL
(such Merger, a " _Short Form Merger_ ").

 

Section 1.11 _Top-Up Option_.

(a) The Company hereby grants to Purchaser an irrevocable option (the " _Top-
Up Option_ "), exercisable only upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth herein and only on or after the Acceptance Time, to purchase, at a
price per share equal to the Offer Price, an aggregate number of shares of
Common Stock (the " _Top-Up Option Shares_ ") that, when added to the number
of shares of Shares owned by Parent and Purchaser immediately following
consummation of the Offer, shall constitute one (1) share more than ninety
percent 90% of the shares of Common Stock then outstanding on a fully diluted
basis, after giving effect to the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares;
_provided, however_ , that the Top-Up Option shall not be exercisable unless,
immediately after such exercise and the issuance of shares of Common Stock
pursuant thereto, the Short Form Threshold would be reached (after
giving effect to the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares); _provided,
further_ , that in no event shall the Top-Up Option be exercisable for a
number of shares of Common Stock in excess of the Companys total authorized
and unissued shares of Common Stock, and excluding any shares that are
reserved or otherwise committed for issuance (treating any Shares held in the
treasury of the Company as unissued). Purchaser may pay the Company the
aggregate price required to be paid for the Top-Up Shares either (i) entirely
in cash or (ii) at Purchasers election, by (x) paying in cash an amount equal
to not less than the aggregate par value of the Top-Up Shares and (y)
executing and delivering to the Company a promissory note having a principal
amount equal to the balance of the aggregate purchase price pursuant to the
Top-Up Option less the amount paid in cash pursuant to the preceding clause
(x) (a " _Promissory Note_ "). Any such Promissory Note shall be full
recourse against Parent and Purchaser and (i) shall bear interest per annum at
the rate equal to the prime lending rate at the time such note is paid as
published by The Wall Street Journal, (ii) be secured by 

 



11  the Top-Up Shares, (iii) shall mature on the first (1st) anniversary of the
date of execution and delivery of such Promissory Note and (iv) may be
prepaid, in whole or in part, without premium, penalty or prior notice.

(b) Provided that no applicable Law, order, injunction or other legal
impediment shall prohibit the exercise of the Top-Up Option or the issuance
of the Top-Up Option Shares pursuant thereto, or otherwise make such exercise
or issuance illegal, Purchaser may exercise (subject to the restrictions
contained in  _Section 1.11(a)_) the Top-Up Option on one or more occasions,
in whole or in part, after the Acceptance Time and prior to the earlier to
occur of (i) the fifth (5th) business day after the later of (A) the
Expiration Time and (B) the expiration of any "subsequent offering period";
and (ii) the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms.

(c) Each time that Purchaser wishes to exercise the Top-Up Option, Purchaser
shall send to the Company a written notice (a " _Top-Up Exercise Notice_ ,"
the date of which notice is referred to herein as the " _Top-Up Notice Date_
") specifying the denominations of the certificate or certificates evidencing
the Top-Up Option Shares which Purchaser wishes to receive, and the place,
time and date for the closing of the purchase and sale pursuant to the Top-Up
Option (the " _Top-Up Closing_ "). The Company shall, promptly after receipt
of the Top-Up Exercise Notice, deliver a written notice to Purchaser
confirming the number of Top-Up Option Shares and the aggregate purchase
price therefor (the " _Top-Up Notice Receipt_ "). At the Top-Up Closing,
Purchaser shall pay the Company the aggregate price required to be paid for
the Top-Up Option Shares, by delivery of cash and a Promissory Note in an
aggregate principal amount equal to that specified in the Top-Up Notice
Receipt, and the Company shall cause to be issued and delivered to Purchaser a
certificate or certificates representing the Top-Up Option Shares or, if the
Company does not then have certificated Shares, the applicable number of
Book-Entry Shares. Such certificates or Book-Entry Shares may include any
legends that are required by federal or state securities Laws.

 

(d) Parent and Purchaser acknowledge that the Top-Up Shares which Purchaser
may acquire upon exercise of the Top-Up Option shall not be registered under
the Securities Act and shall be issued in reliance upon an exemption from
registration under the Securities Act for transactions not involving a public
offering. Parent and Purchaser represent and warrant to the Company
that Purchaser is, or shall be upon any purchase of Top-Up Shares, an
"accredited investor", as defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D under the
Securities Act. Purchaser agrees that the Top-Up Option, and the Top-Up Shares
to be acquired upon exercise of the Top-Up Option, if any, are being and
shall be acquired by Purchaser for the purpose of investment and not with a
view to, or for resale in connection with, any distribution thereof (within
the meaning of the Securities Act). 

(e) Without the prior written consent of the Company, the right to exercise
the Top-Up Option granted pursuant to this Agreement shall not be assigned by
Purchaser, other than to Parent or a direct or indirect wholly owned
Subsidiary of Parent, including by operation of Law or otherwise, and any
attempted assignment in violation of this _Section 1.11(e)_ shall be null
and void.

 



12 ARTICLE II

CONVERSION OF SECURITIES

Section 2.1 _Conversion of Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders of any
securities of the Company or common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of
Purchaser (the " _Purchaser Common Stock_ "):

 

(a) _Purchaser Common Stock_. Each issued and outstanding share of Purchaser
Common Stock shall be converted into and become one fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation and, except
as set forth in _Section 2.1(b)_ below, shall constitute the only outstanding
shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation. From and after the
Effective Time, all certificates representing Purchaser Common Stock shall be
deemed for all purposes to represent the number of shares of common stock of
the Surviving Corporation into which they were converted in accordance with
the immediately preceding sentence.

(b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock_. All Shares owned
by the Company, Parent or Purchaser (but not any Shares owned by any of their
respective Subsidiaries (for the absence of doubt, other than Purchaser itself
or the Company itself), which Shares, if any, shall be converted into such
number of shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation so as to
maintain relative ownership percentages) shall be cancelled and shall cease to
exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

 

(c) _Conversion of Common Stock_. Each Share issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Shares to be cancelled or
converted in accordance with _Section 2.1(b)_ and other than Dissenting
Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive the Offer Price, payable
to the holder thereof in cash, without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_
"). From and after the Effective Time, all such Shares shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and
each holder of a Share shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto,
except the right to receive the Merger Consideration therefor upon the
surrender of such Share in accordance with _Section 2.2_, without interest
thereon.

(d) _Adjustment to Merger Consideration_. The Merger Consideration shall be
adjusted appropriately to reflect the effect of any stock split, reverse stock
split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities
convertible into Common Stock), cash dividend, reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other
like change with respect to Common Stock occurring on or after the date
hereof and prior to the Effective Time.

Section 2.2 _Payment for Securities; Surrender of Certificates_. 

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent or Purchaser shall
designate a reputable bank or trust company, which shall be reasonably
acceptable to the Company, to act as the payment agent in connection with the
Merger (the " _Paying_

 



13   _Agent_ "). Prior to or at the Effective Time, Parent or Purchaser shall
deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent the aggregate Merger
Consideration with respect to Shares converted into Merger Consideration
pursuant to _Section 2.1(c)_ (the " _Exchange Fund_ "). In the event the
Exchange Fund shall be insufficient to make the payments contemplated by
_Section 2.1(c)_, Parent shall, or shall cause Purchaser to, promptly
deposit additional funds with the Paying Agent in an amount which is equal to
the deficiency in the amount required to make such payment. The Exchange Fund
shall not be used for any purpose that is not expressly provided for in this
Agreement. The Exchange Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent as
reasonably directed by Parent; _provided, however,_ that any investment of
such cash shall in all events be limited to direct short-term obligations of,
or short-term obligations fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by,
the U.S. government, in commercial paper rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys
Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively, or in
certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of
commercial banks with capital exceeding $10 billion (based on the most recent
financial statements of such bank that are then publicly available), and that
no such investment or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to holders
of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares pursuant to this _Article II_. Any
interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to
the Surviving Corporation on the earlier of one year after the Effective Time
or full payment of the Exchange Fund.

(b)  _Procedures for Surrender_. Promptly after the Effective Time (but in no
event later than three (3) business days), Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, cause the Paying Agent to mail (and make available
for collection by hand) to each holder of record of a certificate or
certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
outstanding Shares (the " _Certificates_ ") or non-certificated Shares
represented by book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") and whose Shares were
converted pursuant to _Section 2.1_ into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration (i) a letter of transmittal, which shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass,
only upon delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof)
to the Paying Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions
as Parent may reasonably specify and (ii) instructions for effecting the
surrender of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-
Entry Shares in exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration. Upon
surrender of a Certificate (or an affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-
Entry Share for cancellation to the Paying Agent or to such other agent or
agents as may be appointed by Parent or the Surviving Corporation, together
with such letter of transmittal duly completed and validly executed in
accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be
required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such Certificate or
Book-Entry Share shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the
applicable Merger Consideration for each Share formerly represented by such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share, to be mailed (or made available for
collection by hand if so elected by the surrendering holder) within five (5)
business days following the later to occur of (i) the Effective Time or (ii)
the Paying Agents receipt of such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu
thereof) or Book-Entry Share, and the Certificate (or affidavit of loss in
lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Share so surrendered shall be forthwith
cancelled. The Paying Agent shall accept such Certificates (or affidavits of
loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares upon compliance with such

 



14  reasonable terms and conditions as the Paying Agent may impose to effect an
orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices. If
payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the
Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a
condition precedent of payment that (A) the Certificate so surrendered shall
be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer and
(B) the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other
similar Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to
a Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or
shall have established to the satisfaction of Parent that such Tax either has
been paid or is not required to be paid. Payment of the Merger Consideration
with respect to Book-Entry Shares shall only be made to the Person in
whose name such Book-Entry Shares are registered. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this _Section 2.2_, each Certificate and Book-Entry Share
shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the
right to receive the Merger Consideration in cash as contemplated by this
_Section 2.2_, without interest thereon.

(c) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Shares_. At the Effective
Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter
there shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares on the records
of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of
Certificates outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease
to have any rights with respect to such Shares except as otherwise provided
for herein or by applicable Law. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates
or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any
reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Agreement.

 

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund; No Liability_. At any time following twelve
(12) months after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall be
entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any
interest received with respect thereto) remaining in the Exchange Fund that
have not been disbursed, or for which disbursement is pending subject only to
the Paying Agents routine administrative procedures, to holders of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, and thereafter such holders shall be
entitled to look only to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned
property, escheat or other similar Laws) as general creditors thereof with
respect to the Merger Consideration payable upon due surrender of their
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares and compliance with the procedures in
_Section 2.2(b)_, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, none of the Surviving Corporation, Parent, Purchaser, the Paying
Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any holder of a Certificate or
Book-Entry Share for Merger Consideration delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

(e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent shall
issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the Merger
Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to _Section 2.1_ hereof;
_provided, however_ , that Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition
precedent to the payment of such Merger Consideration, require the owners of
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in such sum as
it may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against Parent,

 



15  the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent with respect to the
Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

 

Section 2.3 _Dissenting Shares_.

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, other than as
provided in _Section 2.3(b)_, Shares outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and held by a holder who did not vote in favor of the Merger
(or consent thereto in writing) and is entitled to demand and properly demands
appraisal of such Shares (" _Dissenting Shares_ ") pursuant to, and who
complies in all respects with, Section 262 of the DGCL (the " _Appraisal
Rights_ ") shall be entitled to seek payment of the fair value of such
Dissenting Shares in accordance with the Appraisal Rights (it being understood
that at the Effective Time, such Dissenting Shares shall no longer be
outstanding, shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and
such holder shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto other than the
right to receive the appraised value of such Dissenting Shares to the
extent afforded by the Appraisal Rights); _provided, however_ , that if any
such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw, fail to
protect or otherwise lose the right to payment of the fair value of such
Dissenting Shares under the Appraisal Rights, then the right of such holder
to be paid the fair value of such holders Dissenting Shares shall cease and
such Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to have been converted as of the
Effective Time into, and to have become exchangeable solely for the right to
receive, the Merger Consideration.

(b) The Company shall give prompt notice to Purchaser of any demands received
by the Company for appraisal of any Shares, of any withdrawals of such demands
and of any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the
Company relating to Appraisal Rights, and Purchaser shall have the right to
participate in and control all negotiations and proceedings with respect to
such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the
prior written consent of Purchaser, make any payment with respect to, or
settle or compromise or offer to settle or compromise, any such demand, or
agree to do any of the foregoing.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, each of
Parent, Purchaser and the Company acknowledges and agrees that in any
appraisal proceeding under Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to Dissenting
Shares and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, neither Parent
nor the Surviving Corporation shall assert that the Top-Up Option, the Top-Up
Option Shares or any cash or Promissory Note delivered by Purchaser to the
Company as payment for any Top-Up Option Shares should be considered in
connection with the determination of the fair value of the Dissenting Shares
in accordance with Section 262(h) of the DGCL.

Section 2.4 _Treatment of Company Options and Restricted Shares_.

(a) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, (i) each outstanding, unvested
and unexercised option to purchase Shares (together, the " _Company Options_
") under any stock option plan of the Company, including the Amended and
Restated 2005 Incentive Award Plan, or any other plan, agreement or
arrangement of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, including any foreign
equity plan, agreement or arrangement

 



16  (collectively, the " _Company Equity Plan_ "), shall become immediately
vested and exercisable in full, and (ii) with respect to any Company Options
that remain outstanding and are unexercised as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time, all such Company Options shall be cancelled and, in exchange
therefor, each holder of any such cancelled Company Option shall be entitled
to receive, in consideration of the cancellation of such Company Option and
in settlement therefor, a payment in cash of an amount equal to the product of
(A) the total number of Shares previously subject to such Company Option and
(B) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price
per Share previously subject to such Company Option (such amount being
hereinafter referred to as the " _Option Consideration_ "). The Option
Consideration shall be paid by the Surviving Corporation as soon
as practicable (but in no event later than five (5) business days) following
the Effective Time. From and after the Effective Time, any such cancelled
Company Option shall no longer be exercisable by the former holder thereof,
but shall only entitle such holder to the payment of the Option
Consideration.

(b) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, (i) each outstanding share of
restricted stock (together, the " _Restricted Shares_ ") under the Company
Equity Plan shall become immediately vested and all restrictions thereupon
shall lapse, and (ii) each vested Restricted Share shall be cancelled and the
holder thereof shall be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration in
respect of each Share underlying the cancelled vested Restricted Share in
accordance with _Section 2.1(c)_ hereof.

 

(c) The Company shall take all corporate actions necessary to effectuate the
treatment of the Company Options and Restricted Shares (collectively, the "
_Company Equity Awards_ ") as contemplated by this _Section 2.4_ and to
ensure that (i) all awards issued under the Company Equity Plan shall be
cancelled as of the Effective Time, and (ii) neither any holder of Company
Equity Awards, nor any other participant in any Company Equity Plan shall have
any right thereunder to acquire any securities of the Company, the Surviving
Corporation, or Parent, or to receive any payment or benefit with respect to
any award previously granted under the Company Equity Plan, except as provided
in this _Section 2.4_.

(d) After the Effective Time, the Company Equity Plan shall be terminated and
no further Company Equity Awards or other rights with respect to Shares shall
be granted thereunder.

 

Section 2.5 _Additional Benefits Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall take all actions that are necessary to effect the transactions
described in _Section 2.4_ above pursuant to the terms of the Company Equity
Plan and agreements evidencing the Company Options and Restricted Shares. All
amounts payable pursuant to _Section 2.4_ shall be paid without interest.
Any payments made pursuant to this Agreement shall be net of all applicable
withholding taxes that Parent, Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation and the
Paying Agent, as the case may be, shall be required to deduct and withhold
from such payments under the Code, the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder or any provision of applicable Law. To the extent that amounts are
so deducted and withheld by Parent, Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or
the Paying Agent, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having

 



17  been paid in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by
Parent, Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent.

jurisdictions which recognize such concept) in each jurisdiction in which the
nature of its business or the ownership, leasing or operation of its
properties makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except for those
jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or licensed or to be in
good standing would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company has delivered to
or made available to Parent and Purchaser, prior to the execution of this
Agreement, true and complete copies of the Company Governing Documents not

its business or the ownership, leasing or operation of its properties make

determined that this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger and the other
Transactions are fair to, and in the best interests of, the stockholders of
the Company, (b) approved and declared advisable this Agreement and the

of the terms, conditions or provisions of any Company Material Contract, or
(d) violate any order, writ, injunction, decree or Law applicable to the

and accurately reflect the books and records of the Company and the
Significant Subsidiaries in all material respects, (ii) have been or will be,
as the case may be, prepared in accordance with United States generally

Section 3.7  _Internal Controls; Sarbanes-Oxley Act_.

(a) The Company has designed and maintains a system of internal controls
over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the
Exchange Act) sufficient to provide reasonable assurances regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with GAAP, including to provide

managements general or specific authorizations, (ii) transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in

assets that could have a material effect on the Companys financial statements
is permitted only in accordance with managements general or specific
authorization, and (iv) the recorded accountability for assets is compared

taken with respect to any differences, and the Company is in compliance
in all material respects with such system. As of the date hereof, the Company
has not identified any existing material weaknesses not otherwise remedied in
the design or operation of the internal control over financial reporting. The
Company and the Company Subsidiaries maintain and keep in all material
respects books, records and accounts, which, in reasonable detail, accurately
and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries. The Company

 



22  (i) has designed and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as
defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to ensure that
all material information required to be disclosed by the Company in the

management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure and (ii) to the Companys knowledge, has disclosed to the Companys
auditors and the audit committee of the Company Board of Directors (and made
summaries of such disclosures available to Parent) (A) any significant

affect in any material respect the Companys ability to record, process,
summarize and report financial information and (B) any fraud, whether or not
material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant
role in the Companys internal controls over financial reporting.

(b) To the knowledge of the Company, since January 1, 2010, no employee
of the Company or the Significant Subsidiaries has provided or is providing
information to any law enforcement agency regarding the violation of any
applicable Law of the type described in Section 806 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.
Neither the Company nor the Significant Subsidiaries nor, to the knowledge of
the Company, any director, officer, employee or agent of the Company or the
Significant Subsidiaries, has discharged, demoted or suspended an employee of
the Company or the Significant Subsidiaries in the terms and conditions of
employment because of any lawful act of such employee described in Section 806
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

Section 3.8 _Absence of Certain Changes_.

(a) Except as expressly contemplated by this Agreement, since January 1,
2011, (i) the Company has conducted, in all material respects, its business in
the ordinary course consistent with past practice and (ii) through the date
hereof, there has not been any action taken by the Company or any Company
Subsidiary that, if taken during the period from the date of this Agreement
through the Effective Time without Parents consent, would constitute a breach
of _Sections 5.1(a)_ , _5.1(b)_ ,  _5.1(f)_ , _5.1(l)_ , _5.1(n)_ or
_5.1(p)_.

(b) From January 1, 2011 through the date of this Agreement, no fact(s),
change(s), event(s), development(s) or circumstances exist or have occurred,
which have had or would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 

(c) From April 22, 2011 through the date of this Agreement, the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries have not terminated any Company Agreement that is a
"standstill" agreement or waived any "standstill" provision or provision of
similar effect to which it or a Company Subsidiary is a party or of which it
is a beneficiary.

 

Section 3.9 _No Undisclosed Liabilities_. Except (a) as reflected or otherwise
reserved against in the Companys consolidated balance sheet included in its

liabilities and obligations incurred since January 1, 2011 in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practice, (c) for liabilities and
obligations incurred in accordance with this Agreement or in connection with
the Transactions, and (d) for liabilities and obligations incurred in
accordance with the terms of any Company Material Contract other than
liabilities or obligations due to breaches thereunder, neither the Company nor
any Company Subsidiary has incurred any liabilities or obligations of any
nature, whether or not accrued or contingent or otherwise, other than as have
not had and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

Section 3.10 _Absence of Litigation_. There is no claim, action, suit,
arbitration, investigation of a Governmental Entity, alternative dispute
resolution action or any other judicial or administrative proceeding, in Law
or equity (collectively, a " _Legal Proceeding_ "), pending against (or to
Companys knowledge, threatened against or naming as a party thereto), the
Company, a Company Subsidiary or any executive officer or director of the
Company or of any Company Subsidiary (in their capacity as such) other than as
have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Company nor any
Company Subsidiary is subject to any outstanding order, writ, injunction,
decree or arbitration ruling or judgment of a Governmental Entity which has
had or would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate,
a Company Material Adverse Effect or which would reasonably be expected to
prevent or materially delay the consummation of the Offer, the Merger or any
of the other Transactions. Since January 1, 2010, neither the Company nor any

be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material
Adverse Effect.

 

Section 3.11 _Employee Benefit Plans; ERISA_.

programs, agreements or arrangements, including pension, retirement, profit
sharing, deferred compensation, stock option, change in control, retention,
equity or equity-based compensation, stock purchase, employee stock ownership,
severance pay, vacation, bonus or other incentive plans, all medical, vision,
dental or other health plans, all life insurance plans, and all other material
employee benefit plans or fringe benefit plans, including "employee benefit
plans" as that term is defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, in each case,
whether oral or written, funded or unfunded, or insured or self-insured,
maintained by the Company or a Company Subsidiary, or to which the Company or
a Company Subsidiary contributes or is obligated to contribute thereunder, or
with respect to which the Company or a Company Subsidiary has or may have any
material liability (contingent or otherwise).

(b) Each Benefit Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a)
of the Code, and each trust that is related to a Benefit Plan and intended to
be tax

 



24  exempt under Section 501(a) of the Code, has been determined by the Internal
Revenue Service to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code or exempt
from taxation under Section 501(a) of the Code, as applicable, and, to the
knowledge of the Company, nothing has occurred that would adversely affect the
qualification or tax exemption of any such Benefit Plan or related trust.
Except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect,
to the knowledge of the Company, each Benefit Plan and any related trust
complies in all material respects, and has been administered in compliance in
all material respects, with ERISA, the Code, and other applicable Laws and
with its terms.

(c) No Benefit Plan (i) is a "multiemployer plan" (as defined in Section
3(37) or 4001(a)(3) of ERISA) or a plan that has two or more contributing
sponsors at least two of whom are not under common control, within the meaning
of Section 4063 of ERISA (a " _Multiple Employer Plan_ "), (ii) is subject to
Part 3 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA or Title IV of ERISA or Section 412
of the Code or (iii) provides for post-retirement or other post-employment
welfare benefits (other than health care continuation coverage as required by
applicable Law).

(d) Neither the Company, nor any Company Subsidiary, nor any of their
respective ERISA Affiliates (i) has, at any time during the last six years,
contributed to or been obligated to contribute to any Multiemployer Plan or
Multiple Employer Plan; or (ii) has incurred any Withdrawal Liability that has
not been satisfied in full. There does not now exist, nor do any
circumstances exist that could result in, any Controlled Group Liability that
would be a material liability of the Company or any Company Subsidiary
following the Closing.

 

(e) Except as may be required by applicable Law, or as contemplated under this
Agreement, the Company does not have any announced plan or legally binding
commitment to amend or modify any existing Benefit Plan.

(f) With respect to the Benefit Plans, each to the extent applicable, correct
and complete copies of the following have been delivered or made available to
Parent by the Company: (i) all Benefit Plans (including all amendments and
attachments thereto); (ii) written summaries of any Benefit Plan not in
writing; (iii) all related trust documents; (iv) all insurance contracts or
other funding arrangements; (v) the most recent annual report (Form 5500)
filed with the Internal Revenue Service; (vi) the most recent determination
letter from the Internal Revenue Service; (vii) the most recent annual
financial report; (viii) the most recent actuarial report; and (ix) the most
recent summary plan description and any summary or material
modification thereto. Except as specifically provided in the foregoing
documents delivered or made available to Parent, there are no amendments to
any Benefit Plan that have been adopted or approved nor has the Company or any
Company Subsidiary undertaken to make any such amendments or to adopt or
approve any new Benefit Plan.

(g) To the knowledge of the Company, no compensation paid pursuant to any
Benefit Plan by the Company to any "service provider" (as such term is defined
in Section 409A of the Code and the United States Treasury Regulations and
Internal Revenue Service guidance thereunder (together, the " _409A
Authorities_ ")) violates the

 



25  requirements of the 409A Authorities. Each Benefit Plan which is a
"nonqualified deferred compensation plan" (as such term is defined in Section
409A(d)(1) of the Code) has, at all times, been (i) administered in material
compliance with the 409A Authorities, and (ii) in documentary compliance with
the 409A Authorities.

(h) To the knowledge of the Company, all material contributions required to be
made to any Benefit Plan by applicable Law or regulation or by any plan
document or other contractual undertaking, and all material premiums due or
payable with respect to insurance policies funding any Benefit Plan, for any
period through the date hereof have been timely made or paid in full or, to
the extent not required to be made or paid on or before the date hereof, have
been fully reflected on the financial statements.

(i) Except as contemplated by this Agreement, neither the execution and
delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby (either alone or in conjunction with any other event) will
(i) result in any payment (including, without limitation, severance,
unemployment compensation, "excess parachute payment" (within the meaning of
Section 280G of the Code), forgiveness of indebtedness or otherwise) becoming
due to any director or any officer or any employee of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary under any Benefit Plan or otherwise; (ii) materially
increase any benefits otherwise payable under any Benefit Plan; (iii) result
in any acceleration of the time of payment or vesting of any such benefits;
(iv) require the funding of any trust or other funding vehicle; or (v) limit
or prohibit the ability to amend, merge, terminate or receive a reversion of
assets from any Benefit Plan or related trust. No Benefit Plan provides for a
gross-up of Taxes.

 

(j) There are no pending, or, to the Companys knowledge, threatened claims
(other than claims for benefits in the ordinary course), lawsuits or
arbitrations which have been asserted or instituted, or to Companys
knowledge, no set of circumstances exists which may reasonably give rise to a
claim or lawsuit, against the Benefit Plans, any fiduciaries thereof with
respect to their duties to the Benefit Plans or the assets of any of the
trusts under any of the Benefit Plans (other than for claims in the ordinary
course).

(k) All Company Options have (or with respect to such options which have been
exercised as of the date of this Agreement, had) a per share exercise price
that is (or with respect to such options which have been exercised as of the
date of this Agreement, was) at least equal to the fair market value of a

such third party or as promptly as practicable thereafter. Without limiting
the foregoing, it is understood that any breach of the restrictions set forth
in this _Section 5.2_ by any Company Subsidiary or any Representative of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary shall be deemed to be a breach of this
_Section 5.2_ by the Company.

(d) The Company shall notify Parent and Purchaser promptly (and in no event
later than forty-eight (48) hours) after receipt of any Competing Proposal or

in Recommendation in response to an unforeseen Effect (other than an Effect
relating to or arising out of a Competing Proposal) that has occurred or
arisen after the date of this Agreement that was not known to the Company as
of the date of this Agreement if and only if the Company Board of Directors
has determined in good faith after consultation with the Companys outside
legal advisors that failure to take make such a Change in Recommendation would
be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Company Board of Directors
under applicable Law, and (ii) in response to a Competing Proposal that did
not result from a breach of this _Section 5.2_ and that the Company Board
of Directors determines, in good faith after consultation with the Companys
outside legal and

 



42  financial advisors, constitutes a Superior Proposal (x) make a Change in
Recommendation in order to propose publicly to recommend the approval or
adoption of such Superior Proposal, or (y) terminate this Agreement in

shall have given Parent and Purchaser four (4) business days after delivery
of such notice to propose revisions to the terms of this Agreement and/or the
Transactions (and/or make any other proposals) and during such time shall have
negotiated and caused its Representatives to negotiate (if Parent and the
Purchaser have notified the Company that they desire to negotiate),
confidentially and in good faith with Parent and Purchaser so as to have such
Competing Proposal cease to qualify as a Superior Proposal and (y) the
Company Board of Directors shall have determined in good faith, after
consultation with its outside financial and legal advisors and considering the
results of such negotiations and giving effect to any proposals, amendments
or modifications offered by Parent and Purchaser, that such Competing
Proposal nevertheless remains a Superior Proposal. The Company acknowledges
and agrees that each successive material amendment or material revision to any
Superior Proposal or any material term thereof shall constitute a new
Superior Proposal, as applicable, for all purposes of this Agreement,
including without limitation with respect to necessitating the delivery of a
new Notice of Superior Proposal, new two (2) business day period and new
determinations by the Company Board of Directors as set forth herein.

Company Board of Directors from (i) disclosing to the Companys stockholders a
position contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the
Exchange Act or (ii) making any disclosure to its stockholders if the Company
Board of Directors has reasonably determined in good faith, after consultation
with outside legal counsel, that the failure to do so would be inconsistent
with any applicable Law;  _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall
this _Section 5.2(f)_ (A) affect the obligations of the Company specified in

terms.

 

(d) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause
to be maintained in effect the current policies of directors and officers
liability insurance maintained by the Company (provided that Parent may
substitute therefor policies with reputable and financially sound carriers of
at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions which
are no less advantageous) with respect to claims arising from or related to
facts or events which occurred at or before the Effective Time; _provided,
however_ , that Parent shall not be obligated to make annual premium
payments for such insurance to the extent such premiums exceed 300% of the
annual premiums paid as of the date hereof by the Company for such insurance
(such 300% amount, the " _Base Premium_ "); _provided, further_ , if such
insurance coverage cannot be obtained at all, or can only be obtained at an
annual premium in excess of the Base

 



47  Premium, Parent shall maintain the most advantageous policies of directors
and officers insurance obtainable for an annual premium not to exceed the
Base Premium; _provided_ ,  _further_ , if the Company or Parent elects, by
giving written notice to the other at least five (5) business days prior to
the Effective Time, then, in lieu of the foregoing insurance, effective as of
the Effective Time, the Company or Parent shall purchase a directors and
officers liability insurance "tail" or "runoff" insurance program for a
period of six (6) years after the Effective Time with respect to wrongful acts
and/or omissions committed or allegedly committed at or prior to the
Effective Time (such coverage shall have an aggregate coverage limit over the
term of such policy in an amount not to exceed the annual aggregate coverage
limit under the Companys existing directors and officers liability policy,
and in all other respects shall be comparable to such existing coverage).

 

(e) In the event the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns
(i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
Person, then and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that
such continuing or surviving corporation or entity or transferee of such
assets, as the case may be, shall assume all of the applicable obligations set
forth in this _Section 6.5_.

 

(f) The Covered Persons (and their successors and heirs) are intended third
party beneficiaries of this _Section 6.5_, and this  _Section 6.5_ shall
not be amended in a manner that is adverse to the Covered Persons (including
their successors and heirs) or terminated without the consent of the Covered
Persons (including their successors and heirs) affected thereby. 

Section 6.6 _State Takeover Laws_. If any "control share acquisition," "fair
price" or other anti-takeover laws or regulations enacted under state or
federal Laws becomes or is deemed to become applicable to the Company, the
Offer, the acquisition of Shares pursuant to the Offer, the Merger or any
other Transaction, then the Company and the Company Board of Directors shall
use its reasonable best efforts to, including taking all necessary actions and
granting such necessary approvals so as to, render such statute (or the
relevant provisions thereof) inapplicable to the foregoing so that the Offer,
the Merger and the other Transactions may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated herein or to otherwise minimize the
effect of such Law on this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger and the other
Transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 6.7 _Obligations of Purchaser_. Parent shall take all action
reasonably necessary to cause Purchaser and the Surviving Corporation to
perform their respective obligations under this Agreement and to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Offer and the
Merger, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement.

Section 6.8 _Employee Benefits Matters_.

 

(a) Effective as of the Effective Time and for a period of one (1) year
thereafter, Parent shall provide, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
provide, to

 



48  each employee of the Company who continues to be employed by the Company or
the Surviving Corporation (the " _Affected Employees_ "), (i) a base salary or
regular hourly wage, whichever is applicable, that is not less than the base
salary or regular hourly wage provided to such Affected Employee by the
Company immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) cash bonus opportunity,
and cash sales and service incentive award compensation opportunity that is
not less than the cash bonus opportunity, and sales and service incentive
award compensation opportunity provided to such Affected Employee by the
Company immediately prior to the Effective Time, (iii) employee benefits
(excluding equity awards) that are, in the aggregate, substantially comparable
to those provided to such Affected Employee (including all dependents) by the
Company immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (iv) a severance
opportunity in accordance with _Section 6.8(a)(iv)_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter. Effective as of the Effective Time and thereafter, Parent shall
provide, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide, that periods of
employment with the Company (including, without limitation, any predecessor of
the Company) shall be taken into account for purposes of determining, as
applicable, the eligibility for participation and vesting of any Affected
Employee under all employee benefit plans maintained by Parent or an
affiliate of Parent for the benefit of the Affected Employees, including,
without limitation, vacation plans or arrangements, 401(k), and any severance
or welfare plans); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that such service need not be
recognized for purposes of benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension
plan or to the extent that such recognition would result in any duplication of
benefits. Effective as of the Effective Time and thereafter, Parent shall,
and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, (x) reduce any period of
limitation on health benefits coverage of Affected Employees due to pre-
existing conditions (or actively at work or similar) under the applicable
health benefits plan of Parent or an affiliate of Parent by the number of days
of an individuals "creditable coverage," to the extent required by Section
701 of ERISA, (y) waive any and all eligibility waiting periods and evidence
of insurability requirements with respect to such Affected Employees to the
extent such eligibility waiting periods or evidence of insurability
requirements were waived with respect to the Affected Employees under the
Benefits Plans and (z) credit each Affected Employee with all deductible
payments, out-of-pocket or other co-payments paid by such employee under the
health benefit plans of the Company or its affiliates prior to the Closing
Date during the year in which the Closing occurs for the purpose of
determining the extent to which any such employee has satisfied his or her
deductible and whether he or she has reached the out-of-pocket maximum under
any health benefit plan of Parent or an affiliate of Parent for such year.
The Offer shall not affect any Affected Employees accrual of, or right to
take, any accrued but unused personal, sick or vacation policies applicable to
such Affected Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time. 

(b) Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any Affected Employee any
right to continue in the employ or service of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any affiliate of Parent, or shall interfere with or restrict in
any way the rights of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any affiliate of
Parent, which rights are hereby expressly reserved, to discharge or terminate
the services of any Affected Employee at any time for any reason whatsoever,
with or without cause. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the
contrary, nothing in this _Section 6.8_ shall (x) be deemed or construed to
be an amendment or other modification of any Benefit Plan or

 



49  Purchaser employee benefit plan, or (y) create any third party rights in any
current or former employee, director or other service provider of Parent, the
Surviving Company, the Company or any of their respective affiliates (or any
beneficiaries or dependents thereof).

Section 6.9 _Rule 16b-3_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall be
permitted to take such steps as may be reasonably necessary or advisable
hereto to cause dispositions of Company equity securities (including
derivative securities) pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement by each individual who is a director or officer of the Company to be
exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

Section 6.10 _Alternative Structure_. The Company shall cooperate with Parent
with respect to, and use commercially reasonable best efforts to facilitate,
possible alternative or supplemental structures (including internal
restructurings by the Company or the Company Subsidiaries concurrently with
the Closing) for the acquisition of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries,
_provided_ that such structures do not impede or delay the Closing of the
transaction or change the Merger Consideration or adversely affect the Company
should the Merger not occur.

 

Section 6.11 _Control of Operations_. Without in any way limiting any partys
rights or obligations under this Agreement, the parties understand and agree
that (i) nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Parent, directly or
indirectly, the right to control or direct the Companys operations prior to
the Effective Time, and (ii) prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete
control and supervision over its operations.

Section 6.12 _Rule 14d 10(d) Matters_. Prior to the Acceptance Time, the
Company (acting through the compensation committee of the Board of Directors)
will take all such steps as may be required to cause each agreement,
arrangement or understanding entered into by the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries prior to, on or after the date hereof with any of its current or
former officers, directors or employees to be approved as an "employment
compensation, severance or other employee benefit arrangement" within the
meaning of Rule 14d10(d)(1) under the Exchange Act and to satisfy the
requirements of the non-exclusive safe harbor set forth in Rule 14d10(d)
under the Exchange Act.

TERMINATION

 

Section 8.1 _Termination_.

(a) This Agreement may be terminated and the Offer, the Merger and the other
Transactions may be abandoned (except as otherwise provided below, whether
before or after receipt of the Requisite Stockholder Approval, if applicable)
as follows:

(i) by mutual consent of Parent and the Company at any time prior to
the Acceptance Time;

(ii) by either Parent or the Company, prior to the purchase of any Shares
pursuant to the Offer, if there has been a breach by the other party of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement set forth in this Agreement,
which breach (A) in the case of a breach by the Company would result in any
condition in _Annex I_ not being satisfied at the time of such breach and (B)
in the case of a breach by Parent or Purchaser, would reasonably be expected
to prevent, or materially impair, the ability of either Parent or Purchaser to
consummate the Offer, the Merger and the other Transactions (and in each case
such breach is not curable, or if curable, has not been cured within twenty
(20) business days after the receipt of notice thereof by the defaulting party
from the non-defaulting party); _provided, however_ , this Agreement may not
be terminated pursuant to this _Section 8.1(a)(ii)_ by any party if such
party is then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement set forth in this Agreement; or 

(iii) by either Parent or the Company, if the Acceptance Time shall not have
occurred by midnight, New York City time on the Outside Date; _provided,
however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
_Section 8.1(a)(iii)_ shall not be available to any party whose breach of
any 

 



51  representation, warranty, covenant or agreement set forth in this Agreement
has been the primary cause of Purchasers failure to accept for payment all
such Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer prior to the Outside Date;

(iv) by Parent, prior to the Acceptance Time, if a Change of
Recommendation has occurred;

(v) by the Company if (A) prior to the Acceptance Time in order to enter into
an acquisition agreement providing for a Superior Proposal; _provided_ that
the Company shall have complied in all material respects with _Section
5.2(e)_ and (B) the Company pays the Termination Fee in accordance with 
_Section 8.2(b)_;

(vi) by the Company if Parent or Purchaser fails to commence (within the
meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) the Offer as provided in
_Section 1.1_ hereof within ten (10) business days of the date hereof;
_provided, however_ , that any such termination must occur within ten (10)
business days of such date and that the Company may not terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(vi)_ (A) after Parent or Purchaser
commences the Offer, (B) if the failure to commence the Offer is primarily
caused by the Companys breach of this Agreement or (C) if a Change of
Recommendation has occurred;

(vii) by either the Company or Parent if a Governmental Entity of competent
jurisdiction, that is within a jurisdiction that is material to the business
and operations of the Company, shall have issued a final, non-appealable
order, decree or ruling in each case permanently restraining, enjoining or
otherwise prohibiting the acceptance of and the payment for, the Shares
pursuant to the Offer, or consummation of the Merger or other Transactions;
_provided, however_ , that the party seeking to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this _Section 8.1(a)(vii)_ shall have complied with all of its
obligations under _Section 6.3_, including its obligation to use reasonable
best efforts to prevent the entry of, and to remove, such order, decree or
ruling; or

(viii) by Parent, prior to the Acceptance Time, if a Company Material
Adverse Effect shall have occurred or shall exist, which has not been cured
or ceased to exist within thirty (30) business days after the receipt of
notice thereof by the Company from Parent.

 

Section 8.2 _Effect of Termination_.

(a) In the event of the termination of this Agreement as provided in _Section
8.1_, written notice thereof shall forthwith be given to the other party or
parties specifying the provision hereof pursuant to which such termination is
made, and this Agreement shall forthwith become null and void and there shall
be no liability on the part of Parent, Purchaser or the Company, except that
the Confidentiality Agreement, this  _Section 8.2_ and _Section 9.3_
through _Section 9.14_ shall survive such termination; _provided_ , _however_
, that subject to _Section 8.2(d)_, nothing herein shall relieve any party
hereto from liability for a material breach of its covenants or agreements
set forth in this Agreement

 



52  prior to such termination (which the parties acknowledge and agree shall not
be limited to reimbursement of expenses or out-of-pocket costs, and may
include the benefit of the bargain lost by the Companys stockholders (taking
into consideration relevant matters, including the total amount payable to
such stockholders under this Agreement and the time value of money), which
shall be deemed in such event to be damages of the Company). 

(b) _Termination Fee_.

(i) If Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(a)(iv)_ and
Parent and Purchaser are not in material breach of this Agreement at the time
of such termination, within three (3) business days of such termination pay
Parent a fee of $20,000,000 in cash (the " _Termination Fee_ ") and, upon the
payment of the Termination Fee, the Company shall have no further liability
with respect to this Agreement or the Transactions contemplated hereby to
Parent (or its designee).

(ii) If the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section
8.1(a)(v)_, prior to or concurrent with, and as a condition to, the
effectiveness of such termination, the Company shall pay to Parent (or its
designee) the Termination Fee and upon payment of the Termination Fee, the
Company shall have no further liability with respect to this Agreement or the
Transactions contemplated hereby to Parent or Purchaser.

(iii) If Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(a)(ii)_,
or if the Company or Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section
8.1(a)(iii)_, and in either case, prior to such termination a Competing
Proposal had been disclosed and not withdrawn and within six (6) months of
either such termination the Company consummates a transaction with respect to
a Competing Proposal or enters into an agreement providing for a Competing
Proposal that is subsequently consummated, the Company shall, prior to the
effectiveness of such consummation, pay to Parent the Termination Fee.

 

(iv) For purposes of this _Section 8.2(b)_, the term "Competing Proposal"
shall have the meaning assigned to such term in _Section 9.5_, except that
the reference to "at least 20%" in the definition of "Competing Proposal"
shall be deemed to be a reference to "at least 50%."

 

(c) The Termination Fee shall be paid by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account designated in writing by Parent. For the
avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the Company be obligated to pay any
termination fee on more than one occasion.

(d) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that the agreements contained in
this _Section 8.2_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and that the Termination Fee is not a penalty, but rather is
liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent and
Purchaser, as the case may be, in the circumstances in which such Termination
Fee is payable for the efforts and resources

 



53  expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in
reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, which amount would otherwise be impossible
to calculate with precision. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, Parents right to receive payment of the Termination Fee from the
Company shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent and Purchaser
against the Company and its Subsidiaries and any of their respective former,
current or future officers, directors, partners, stockholders, managers,
members, affiliates or agents for the loss suffered as a result of the
failure of the Merger to be consummated, and upon payment of such amount,
none of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
former, current or future officers, directors, partners, stockholders,
managers, members, affiliates or agents shall have any further liability or
obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby. Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, nothing
herein shall relieve any party from liability for fraud or any willful breach
of this Agreement.

Section 9.7  _Interpretation_. When a reference is made in this Agreement to

otherwise indicated. Whenever the words "include", "includes" or
"including" are used in this Agreement they shall be deemed to be followed by
the words "without limitation." As used in this Agreement, the term
"affiliates" shall have the meaning set forth in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange

Section 9.10 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by rule of Law or public
policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the Offer or the Merger is not affected in any manner adverse to
any party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the
end that the Offer and the Merger are fulfilled to the extent possible.

 

Section 9.11 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction_.

Court of Chancery, or, if (and only if) such court lacks subject matter
jurisdiction, the Federal court of the United States of America sitting in
Delaware, and any appellate court from any thereof, (iii) waives, to the
fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so,

 



64  any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of
any such action or proceeding in the Delaware Court of Chancery, or, if (and
only if) such court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, the Federal court of
the United States of America sitting in Delaware, and any appellate court from
any thereof and (iv) waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, the
defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or
proceeding in the Delaware Court of Chancery, or, if (and only if) such court
lacks subject matter jurisdiction, the Federal court of the United States of
America sitting in Delaware, and any appellate court from any thereof. Each
of the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such action or
proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by
suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law. Each party to
this Agreement irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner
provided for notices in _Section 9.4_. Nothing in this Agreement will affect
the right of any party to this Agreement to serve process in any other manner

Section 9.12 _Waiver of Jury Tria_ l. EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF
ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE
OFFER AND MERGER CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES
AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER
PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD
NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE EITHER OF SUCH WAIVERS, (B)
IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVERS, (C) IT
MAKES SUCH WAIVERS VOLUNTARILY, AND (D) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS
AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN
THIS  _SECTION 9.12_.

parties hereto (whether by operation of Law or otherwise) without the prior
written consent of the other parties, except that Purchaser may assign, in its
sole discretion and without the consent of any other party, any or all of its
rights, interests and obligations hereunder to (a) Parent, (b) Parent and one
or more direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiaries of Parent, or (c) one or
more direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiaries of Parent. Subject to the

hereunder, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be
enforceable by the parties and their respective successors and assigns.

 

Section 9.14 _Enforcement; Remedies_. The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of
this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms. It
is accordingly agreed that the parties hereto (on behalf of themselves and any
third-party beneficiaries of this Agreement, including the stockholders of
the Company) shall be entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to seek to specifically

 



65  enforce the terms hereof, this being in addition to any other remedy to
which they are entitled at Law or in equity. Except as otherwise provided
herein, including, for the avoidance of doubt,  _Section 8.2(d)_, any and
all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative
with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by Law or
equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy will
not preclude the exercise of any other remedy.
