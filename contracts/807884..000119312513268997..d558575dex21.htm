7\. Closing Process.

7.1 _Inspections and Phased Closings_. Within five (5) days after
satisfaction of Purchasers Conditions to Close as set forth in Section 6(c),
6(f) and 6(i), Purchaser will begin the Inspection (as described on Exhibit
"B"). Purchaser and Seller will coordinate with respect to the sequence and
timing of the Inspection. Within five (5) days after the Inspection of the
initial sixteen (16) Shops (the "First Closing Shops"), Seller shall convey
all Assets pertaining to the First Closing Shops to Purchaser and Seller
shall assign to Purchaser and Purchaser shall assume from Seller all Assumed
Liabilities pertaining to the First Closing Shops (the date of such assignment
and assumption is referred to herein as the "First Closing Date"). Within
five (5) days after the Inspection of an additional sixteen (16) Shops (the
"Second Closing Shops"), Seller shall convey all Assets pertaining to the
Second Closing Shops to Purchaser and Seller 

 



6  shall assign to Purchaser and Purchaser shall assume from Seller all Assumed
Liabilities pertaining to the Second Closing Shops (the date of such
assignment and assumption is referred to herein as the "Second Closing
Date"). Within five (5) days after Inspection of all remaining Shops (the
"Third Closing Shops"), Seller shall convey all Assets pertaining to the Third
Closing Shops to Purchaser and Seller shall assign to Purchaser and Purchaser
shall assume from Seller all Assumed Liabilities pertaining to the Third
Closing Shops (the date of such assignment and assumption is referred to
herein as the "Third Closing Date"). Each of the First Closing Date, the
Second Closing Date and the Third Closing Date are referred to herein as a
"Closing Date". On each Closing Date the parties will execute such closing
documents as are reasonably necessary in order to effectuate such transfer of
the applicable Assets and Assumed Liabilities.

7.2 _Transfer Date_. The parties agree that it will take more than one day
for Purchaser to complete the Inspection of all Shops. The date Purchaser
commences the Inspection contemplated above shall be deemed the "Transfer
Date" for the Shop(s) that are the subject of the Inspection activities.
If the Closing occurs and the Transfer Date for a Shop is earlier than the
actual day of the Closing for such Shop, then upon the consummation of the
Closing, the subject Transfer Date shall be deemed to be the Closing Date for
the applicable Shop for all purposes under this Agreement. In this regard and
in recognition that Seller has been operating the Business and that Seller
and/or Purchaser, as the case may be, intends to continue operating it without
interruption, both parties agree to cooperate with each other to ensure that
the Business is operated in the ordinary course of business during the period
from the Transfer Date to the Closing, and each party agrees to afford the
other an adequate opportunity to oversee the operation of the Business during
such period in order to protect its interests.

7.3 _Prepaid Amounts; Income and Expense Prorations_. At the Closing,
Purchaser and Seller shall equitably prorate all prepaid expenses that are
considered Excluded Assets ("Prepaid Expenses") and all accrued liabilities to
the extent the same have been paid or are payable and to the extent the same
are assumed by Purchaser as part of the Assumed Liabilities, all so that
Purchaser pays for all amounts attributable to the period of time on and after
the Transfer Date and Seller pays for all amounts attributable to the period
of time prior to the Transfer Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prepaid
amounts relating to items not to be assumed by Purchaser at the Closing will
not be Prepaid Expenses and will not be prorated between the parties; examples
of such non-prorated expenses include, without limitation, amounts for
prepaid permits and licenses and amounts for prepaid premiums for Sellers
insurance policies. Also, Prepaid Expenses shall not include amounts expended
for advertising. All security and other deposits made by Seller in connection
with any of the Assumed Liabilities shall be deemed Assets. The parties also
agree that all income earned or accrued before the Transfer Date shall be
credited or received by Seller, and all income earned or accrued on or after
the Transfer Date shall be credited and received by Purchaser; and all
expenses and liabilities accrued or becoming due before the Transfer Date
shall be paid by Seller, and all expenses and liabilities accrued and
becoming due on or after the Transfer Date shall be paid by Purchaser. Without
limiting the foregoing, all ongoing expenses of the Business [for example,
real property rentals, real estate taxes and common area maintenance charges
payable under real estate leases, utility and security charges, wages,
compensation and benefits of Sellers employees and payments to or from
landlords, licensors, licensees, vendors, suppliers, service providers and
other contractors of Seller] expressly assumed by Purchaser at the Closing,
if any,

 



7  will be equitably prorated between Seller and Purchaser as of the Transfer
Date. To the extent any adjustment under this Section cannot be reasonably and
finally determined at Closing, the parties hereto agree to reconcile all such
income and expenses and make all adjustments and settlements between them as
may be appropriate or required under this Section as soon as reasonably
practicable after the Closing Date (with each party hereto acting diligently
and in good faith in connection with such post-Closing reconciliation,
adjustment and settlement process). Prior to the Closing Date, Purchaser and
Seller shall diligently cooperate in good faith with each other in an attempt
to identify with particularity as many of the Prepaid Expenses and Accrued
Liabilities as is reasonably possible (this process may, in Purchasers
discretion, include, without limitation, a complete inspection at Sellers
home office by Purchasers accounting representatives of Sellers books and
records).

8\. Sellers Closing Deliveries. Seller shall deliver, or cause to be
delivered to Purchaser at each Closing (unless otherwise set forth below) all

11\. Purchase Price Adjustment. On the Third Closing Date, the Purchase Price

any remaining payments made directly by Seller.

 



10 12\. Escrow Agreement. A portion of the Purchase Price in the amount of Eight
Million and No/100 U.S. Dollars ($8,000,000.00) will be delivered by

no tax due from the Comptroller of the State of Texas ("Comptroller") in
accordance with Section 111.020, (ii) satisfactory evidence that Seller has
filed its final sales tax report with, and delivered a notice of Purchasers
name and address to, the Comptroller pursuant to 34 TAC Section 3.7 of the
Texas Regulations, (iii) a letter or any other reasonable documentation from
the Comptroller specifically indicating that Seller has paid all taxes which
are contemplated under Section 111.020 which accrued in connection with the

for such taxes, all as the same is contemplated in Section 111.020, (iv) a
receipt for each Shop issued by the tax collector in accordance with Sections
31.08 and 31.081 showing that the personal property taxes due the applicable

each Shop, and (v) a tax certificate for each Shop issued under Section 31.08
stating that no personal property taxes, penalties or interest is due for each
Shop by the applicable taxing unit, Purchaser shall immediately pay the
withheld amount to Seller. If, however, the Comptroller or any tax collector
pursues a claim against Purchaser for unpaid taxes of Seller, the parties
agree that Purchaser may pay directly to the Comptroller or any such tax
collector such portion of the withheld amount as may be necessary to satisfy
such claim, and Sellers sole recourse for the amount so paid by Purchaser
shall be against the State of Texas and/or the Comptroller or the applicable
tax collector and not against Purchaser.

12  accordance with their respective terms, and Seller has in all material
respects performed all obligations required to be performed by it to date

should be known to Seller that would give rise to any such action, suit,
claim, proceeding, investigation or litigation.

(h) _Ownership of Properties and Absence of Liens_. Seller is the lawful owner
of the Business and the Assets and Seller has good, valid and marketable
title to the Assets and a valid and transferable leasehold interest in all
lease properties. The Business and the Assets will be free and clear of any
liens, claims, equities, charges, options, security interests or encumbrances
of any nature whatsoever with no defects of title as of the Transfer Date,
except (a) liens for current taxes not yet due, and (b) minor imperfections of
title and encumbrances, if any, that do not materially detract from the value
of the property subject thereto or materially impair the operations of the
Business, and have arisen only in the ordinary course of the Business,
consistent with past practice. The Assets and properties described in Section
1 include all assets and inventory used in or necessary to Sellers Business
as presently conducted in the ordinary course.

(i) _Financial Statements_. All information contained in the statements of the

Report to Purchaser.

transaction upon which Seller has maintained an accurate record of the amount

statement made by Seller in this Agreement, including without limitation the
Exhibits attached hereto, omits to state a material fact required to be
stated or necessary to make the statements contained herein or therein not

statements are made. There are no facts known to Seller, which are not also
known to Purchaser or in the pawn shop industry, which materially and
adversely affects or in the future may (so far as Seller can now reasonably
foresee) materially and adversely affect the Business or the
condition, properties, assets, operations or prospects of the Business,
except as set forth herein or in the Exhibits hereto.

(m)  _Payment of Taxes_. There are no taxes or present disputes as to taxes
of any nature payable by Seller which will impair the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, result in any lien upon the
Assets, or impose on Purchaser any burden or obligation to assume or pay any
taxes of any nature (except for any taxes due as a result of the sale of the
Assets, if any). Except for employee withholding taxes which will be deposited
and/or paid according to the payment schedules required by law, to the best
of Sellers knowledge, all tax returns of Seller (federal, state, city or
otherwise) required by law to be filed on or before the Closing and Transfer

corresponding taxes have been paid.

Seller. Notwithstanding, Seller and Principal shall not be liable for a
breach of the representations and/or warranties contained in this Agreement
until such time as the claim exceeds $100,000.00, and further Sellers total

other party for the purpose of this section), then and in such event the
prevailing party shall be entitled to recover from the other party, in
addition to the relief awarded the prevailing party in or by judgment, all
court costs, reasonable investigation expenses, and reasonable attorneys
fees, including appellate proceedings and proceedings in bankruptcy, incurred

any such liability and enforcing its indemnification) for payment of any

whether so expressed or not, shall be binding upon the respective successors
and assigns of the parties hereto, and shall inure to the benefit of, and
shall be enforceable by the parties hereto and their respective heirs,

declared or adjudged invalid were not originally a part hereof unless the
section or exhibit so declared and adjudged invalid materially affects the
consideration or obligation either party is entitled to receive or assume

of acceptance. No breach or violation of any provision hereof may be waived
