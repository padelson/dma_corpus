WHEREAS, as of the date hereof, each Unitholder holds and is entitled to vote
(or direct the voting of) the Member Units set forth opposite such
Unitholders name on _Exhibit_ __ _ A_ hereto (together with such additional
Member Units that become beneficially owned (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act) by such Unitholder, whether upon the

WHEREAS, as a condition to the Parents, Holdcos and Merger Subs willingness
to enter into and perform their respective obligations under the Master
Transaction Agreement, the Parent, Holdco and Merger Sub have required that
the Unitholders agree, and the Unitholders are willing to agree, to enter into
this Agreement.

(a) in favor of (1) the approval of Members entry into the Master

of, or enter into any Contract, option or other arrangement or understanding
with respect to the sale, transfer, pledge, encumbrance, assignment or other

terminate without any further action required by any party hereto upon the
earliest to occur of: (a) the termination of the Master Transaction Agreement
in accordance 

 



4

    

 with its terms; (b) the Effective Time; (c) the time that the Members entry
into the Master Transaction Agreement and the transactions contemplated

this Agreement pursuant to Section 5.1, this Agreement shall become void and
of no effect with no liability on the part of any party hereto; _provided_ ,
_however_ , notwithstanding the forgoing, no such termination shall relieve

in the case of an amendment, by each of the parties hereto, or in the case of
a waiver, by the party against whom the waiver is to be effective. No failure
or delay by any party in exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a
waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any
other or further exercise of any other right hereunder.

permitted under, or otherwise given in connection with, this Agreement shall
be in writing and will be deemed to have been duly given (i) when delivered or

(a) All issues and questions concerning the construction, validity,
interpretation and enforceability of this Agreement will be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of Delaware, without
giving effect to any choice of Law or conflict of Law rules or provisions
(whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would
cause the application of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of
Delaware.

(b) Any Legal Proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on
any matter arising out of or in connection with, this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby will be brought and determined exclusively in
the Delaware Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware; ___provided_ that if
the Delaware Court of Chancery does not have subject matter jurisdiction, any
such Legal Proceeding will be brought exclusively in the United States
District Court for the District of Delaware or any other court of the State
of Delaware, and each of the parties hereby consents to the exclusive
jurisdiction of such courts (and of the appropriate appellate courts
therefrom) in any such Legal Proceeding and irrevocably waives, to the fullest
extent permitted by Law, any objection that such party may now or hereafter
have to the laying of the venue of any such Legal Proceeding in any such court
or that any such Legal Proceeding that is brought in any such court has been
brought in an inconvenient forum. Process in any such Legal Proceeding may be
served on any party anywhere in the world, whether within or without the
jurisdiction of any such court. Without limiting the foregoing, each party
agrees that service of process on such party as provided in Section 5.5 will
be deemed effective service of process on such party.

EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OF ANY CLAIM, DEMAND,
ACTION OR CAUSE OF ACTION (1) ARISING UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR (2) IN ANY WAY

AGREES AND CONSENTS THAT ANY SUCH CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION OR CAUSE OF ACTION
WILL BE DECIDED BY COURT TRIAL WITHOUT A JURY, AND THAT THE PARTIES TO THIS
AGREEMENT MAY FILE A COPY OF THIS AGREEMENT WITH ANY COURT AS
WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE CONSENT OF THE PARTIES HERETO TO THE WAIVER OF THEIR
RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY.

 

Section 5.7. _Specific Performance_.

 

(a) The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that
any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached. Each party agrees that in the
event of any breach or threatened breach by any other party of any covenant or
obligation contained in this Agreement, the non-breaching party shall be
entitled (in addition to any other remedy that may be available to such non-
breaching party, whether in law or equity, including 

 



6

    

 monetary damages) to (i) a decree or order of specific performance to
enforce the observance and performance of such covenant or obligation, and
(ii) an injunction restraining such breach or threatened breach.

(b) Each party further agrees that (x) it will not oppose the granting of
an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief as provided
herein on the basis that any other party has an adequate remedy at law or an
award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at
law or equity and (y) no other party or any other Person shall be required to
obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar instrument in connection with or
as a condition to obtaining any remedy referred to in this Section 5.7, and
each party irrevocably waives any right it may have to require the obtaining,
furnishing or posting of any such bond or similar instrument.

 

Section 5.8. _Counterparts; Effectiveness_. This Agreement may be executed
in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the
same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same
instrument. This Agreement may be executed by facsimile signature or by
emailed portable document format (.pdf) file signature and a facsimile or
.pdf signature shall constitute an original for all purposes.

Section 5.9. _Headings_. Headings of the Articles and Sections of this
Agreement are for convenience of the parties only and shall be given no
substantive or interpretive effect whatsoever.

 

Section 5.10. _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement
which is invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that
jurisdiction, be ineffective to the sole extent of such invalidity or
unenforceability without rendering invalid or unenforceable the remainder of
such term or provision or the remaining terms and provisions of this
Agreement in any jurisdiction. If any provision of this Agreement is so broad
as to be unenforceable, such provision shall be interpreted to be only so
broad as is enforceable.

 

Section 5.11. _Remedies Cumulative_. Except as otherwise provided herein,
any and all remedies expressly conferred upon a party hereto shall be deemed
cumulative with and not exclusive to any other remedy conferred by this
Agreement, or by applicable Law on such party, and the exercise by a party of
any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy.

Section 5.12. _Interpretation_.

 

(a) When a reference is made in this Agreement to an Article or Section,
such reference shall be to an Article or Section of this Agreement unless
otherwise indicated. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including"
are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words
"without limitation." The words "hereof," "herein" and "hereunder" and words
of similar import when used in this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as
a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement. The word "or"
when used in this Agreement is not exclusive. The definitions contained in
this Agreement are applicable to the singular as well as the plural forms of
such terms and to the masculine as well as to the feminine and neuter
genders of such terms.

(b) Any agreement, instrument or statute defined or referred to herein or
in any agreement or instrument that is referred to herein means such
agreement, instrument or statute as from time to time amended, modified or
supplemented, including (in the case of agreements or instruments) by waiver
or consent and (in the case of statutes) by succession of comparable
successor statutes and references to all attachments thereto and instruments
incorporated therein. Each of the parties has participated in the drafting and
negotiation of this Agreement. If an ambiguity or question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement must be construed as if it is drafted by
all the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or
disfavoring any party by virtue of authorship of any of the provisions of
this Agreement.

 



7

    

Section 5.13. _Publication_. Each Unitholder hereby permits Parent,
Holdco, Merger Sub and the Member to publish and disclose in any documents or
schedules required to be filed with the SEC and any other disclosures or
filings required by applicable Law such Unitholders identity and ownership of
such Unitholders Covered Units and the nature of such Unitholders
commitments pursuant to this Agreement.

 

Section 5.14. _No Ownership Interest_. Nothing contained in this Agreement
shall be deemed to vest in Parent or Holdco any direct or indirect ownership
or incidence of ownership of or with respect to any Covered Units. All
ownership and economic benefits of and relating to the Covered Units shall
remain vested in and belong to the applicable Unitholder, and, except as
otherwise provided herein, neither Parent nor Holdco shall have any authority
to direct any Unitholder in the voting or disposition of any Covered Units.
For the avoidance of doubt, each Unitholder shall be entitled to any
dividends or other distributions declared by the Member with respect to such
Unitholders Covered Units.
