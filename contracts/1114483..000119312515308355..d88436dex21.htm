to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent, in trust for the benefit of the
holders of shares of Company Common Stock (other than any Cancelled Shares or
shares remaining outstanding pursuant to Section 4.1(d)), for exchange in
accordance with this ARTICLE IV, evidence of book-entry shares or certificates
(which shares of Parent Common Stock shall contain a customary restricted
stock legend for unregistered shares until the six-month anniversary of
the Effective Time at which time Parent shall cause such legend to be removed
provided the holder thereof is not then an Affiliate of Parent and provided
further, that the holder thereof is not then a party to or bound by the
Stockholders Agreement) representing the number of shares of Parent Common
Stock and an amount of cash, in each case, sufficient to pay to the holders of
shares of Company Common Stock the Per Share Common Stock Merger Consideration
and the Per Share Common Stock Merger Consideration Cash Value (such
certificates or book-entry shares for shares of Parent Common Stock and cash
in Dollars, together with cash in lieu of fractional shares in accordance with
Section 4.3 and any dividends or distributions with respect to the shares of
Parent Common Stock in accordance with Section 4.2(h), being hereinafter
referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ ") payable pursuant to Section 4.1 in
exchange for outstanding shares of Company Common Stock. The Exchange Agent
shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions, deliver the Per Share Common
Stock Merger Consideration and the Per Share Common Stock Merger Consideration
Cash Value contemplated to be paid pursuant to Section 4.1 out of the
Exchange Fund. Parent agrees to make available to the Exchange Agent from time
to time as needed, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock to be issued and paid in consideration therefor pursuant to Section 4.3
and any dividends or distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant
to Section 4.2(h) of this Agreement. Except as specified in this Section 4.2,
the Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose.

 

(c) The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund as
directed by Parent on a daily basis in (i) short-term direct obligations of
the United States of

 



18  America with maturities of no more than 30 days or (ii) short-term
obligations for which the full faith and credit of the United States of
America is pledged to provide for payment of all principal and interest;
_provided_ , that no gain or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to
the holders of Company Common Stock pursuant to this ARTICLE IV. If for any
reason (including losses) the cash in the Exchange Fund shall be insufficient
to fully satisfy all of the payment obligations to be made in cash by the
Exchange Agent hereunder, Parent shall promptly deposit cash into the Exchange
Fund in an amount which is equal to the deficiency in the amount of cash
required to fully satisfy such cash payment obligations.

(d) Upon the surrender of each such Certificate, if applicable, and a properly
completed and duly executed Letter of Transmittal at least two (2) Business
Days prior to the Closing Date, the Exchange Agent shall, at the Effective
Time, pay the holder of such shares of Company Common Stock the Per Share
Common Stock Merger Consideration or the Per Share Common Stock Merger
Consideration Cash Value, as applicable, in consideration therefor, and such
shares of Company Common Stock and any related Certificate shall forthwith be
canceled. Upon the surrender of each such Certificate, if applicable, and a
properly completed and duly executed Letter of Transmittal any time after the
date that is two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Exchange
Agent shall, no earlier than at the Closing and as soon as reasonably
practicable, pay the holder of such shares of Company Common Stock the Per
Share Common Stock Merger Consideration or the Per Share Common Stock Merger
Consideration Cash Value, as applicable, in consideration therefor, and such
shares of Company Common Stock and any related Certificate shall forthwith be
canceled. No interest shall be paid or accrued on any Per Share Common Stock
Merger Consideration, the Per Share Common Stock Merger Consideration Cash
Value, cash payable in lieu of fractional shares in accordance with Section
4.3 or dividends and other distributions in accordance with Section 4.2(h).
Until so surrendered, each such Certificate (other than Certificates
representing Cancelled Shares or shares that remain outstanding pursuant to
Section 4.1(d)) shall, after the Effective Time, represent for all purposes
only the right to receive the Per Share Common Stock Merger Consideration or
the Per Share Common Stock Merger Consideration Cash Value, as applicable,
cash payable in lieu of fractional shares in accordance with Section 4.3 and
dividends and other distributions in accordance with Section 4.2(h).

 

(e) If payment of the Per Share Common Stock Merger Consideration or the Per
Share Common Stock Merger Consideration Cash Value, as applicable, is to be
made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the applicable
surrendered Certificate or uncertificated share is registered, it shall be a
condition of such payment that the Person requesting such payment shall pay,
or cause to be paid, any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the
making of such cash payment to a Person other than the registered holder of
the surrendered Certificate or uncertificated share, or required for any other
reason relating to such holder or requesting Person, or shall establish to
the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not
payable.

(f) At the Effective Time, the share transfer books of the Company shall be
closed and thereafter, there shall be no further registration of Transfers of
shares of Company Common Stock. From and after the Effective Time, the holders
of Certificates (or uncertificated shares) representing shares of Company
Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease
to have any rights with respect to such shares of Company Common

 



19  Stock except the right to receive the consideration provided for, and in
accordance with the procedures set forth, in this ARTICLE IV or as otherwise
provided herein or by Applicable Law. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates are presented to the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Corporation or
Parent, such Certificates shall be canceled and exchanged for the
consideration provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set
forth, in this ARTICLE IV.

(g) Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including the proceeds of any
investments thereof) that remains undistributed to the holders of shares of
Company Common Stock one year after the Effective Time shall be returned to
Parent, upon demand, and any such holder who has not exchanged his, her or its
shares of Company Common Stock for the Per Share Common Stock
Merger Consideration or Per Share Common Stock Merger Consideration Cash
Value, as applicable, in accordance with this Section 4.2 prior to that time
shall thereafter look only to Parent for delivery of the Per Share Common
Stock Merger Consideration or Per Share Common Stock Merger Consideration
Cash Value, as applicable, in respect of such holders shares. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, none of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the Surviving
Corporation shall be liable to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock
for any Per Share Common Stock Merger Consideration or Per Share Common Stock
Merger Consideration Cash Value, as applicable, or other amounts delivered to
a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar laws. Any portion of the Exchange Fund remaining unclaimed by holders
of shares of Company Common Stock three years after the Effective Time (or
such earlier date prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat
to or become property of any Governmental Authority) shall, to the extent
permitted by Applicable Law, become the property of Parent free and clear of
any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 

(h) No dividends or other distributions with respect to shares of Parent
Common Stock issued in the Merger shall be paid to the holder of
any unsurrendered Certificates until such Certificates (or uncertificated
shares of Company Common Stock) are surrendered as provided in this Section
4.2. Following such surrender, subject to the effect of escheat, Tax or other
Applicable Law, there shall be paid, without interest, to the record holder
of the shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange therefor (i) at the
time of such surrender, all dividends and other distributions payable in
respect of such shares of Parent Common Stock with a record date after the
Effective Time and a payment date on or prior to the date of such surrender
and not previously paid and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the
dividends or other distributions payable with respect to such shares of
Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time but with a
payment date subsequent to such surrender. For purposes of dividends or other
distributions in respect of shares of Parent Common Stock, all shares of
Parent Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the Merger shall be entitled to
dividends pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence as if issued and
outstanding as of the Effective Time.

 

(i) Any portion of the consideration payable to holders of Company Common
Stock deposited with the Exchange Agent pursuant to this Section 4.2 to pay
for Dissenting Shares for which appraisal rights shall have been perfected
shall be returned to Parent upon the settlement or final and non-appealable
adjudication of any claim for appraisal rights asserted with respect to such
Dissenting Shares.

 



20 (j) The Per Share Common Stock Merger Consideration or the Per Share Common
Stock Merger Consideration Cash Value, as applicable, issued and paid to a
holder of Company Common Stock upon conversion of the Company Common Stock in
accordance with the terms hereof (including any cash paid pursuant to Section
4.2(h) or Section 4.3) shall be deemed to have been issued and paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Company Common Stock.

 

Section 4.3 _Fractional Shares_.

 

(a) No fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued in the Merger,
but in lieu thereof each holder of shares of Company Common Stock otherwise
entitled to a fractional share of Parent Common Stock will be entitled to
receive, from the Exchange Agent in accordance with the provisions of this
Section 4.3, a cash payment equal to the number of such fractional shares
of Parent Common Stock multiplied by the Closing Parent Common Stock Price.
Fractional share interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to
any other rights (including the right to receive dividends or other
distributions of Parent) of a stockholder of Parent.

(b) As soon as practicable after the determination of the amount of cash, if
any, to be paid to holders of shares of Company Common Stock in lieu of any
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock, the Exchange Agent shall make
available such amounts to such holders of shares of Company Common Stock
without interest, subject to and in accordance with Section 4.2.

Section 4.4 _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange
Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate
the Per Share Common Stock Merger Consideration or Per Share Common Stock
Merger Consideration Cash Value, as applicable, to be paid in respect of the
shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificate as contemplated
by this ARTICLE IV (including any cash payable in respect of such shares in
lieu of fractional shares in accordance with Section 4.3 and any dividends or
distributions payable in accordance with Section 4.2(h)); _provided_ , that
the Person to whom such payments are made shall, as a condition precedent to
the payment thereof, indemnify Parent and the Surviving Company against any
claim that may be made against Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving Company
with respect to the Certificate claimed to have been lost, stolen or
destroyed.

 

Section 4.5 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, with respect to each share of Company Common Stock as to which
the holder thereof shall have properly complied with the provisions of Section
262 of the DGCL as to appraisal rights (each, a " _Dissenting Share_ "), if
any, such holder shall be entitled to payment, solely from the Surviving
Corporation, of the appraisal value of the Dissenting Shares to the extent
permitted by and in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL;
_provided_ , _however_ , that if any holder of Dissenting Shares (a) under
the circumstances permitted by and in accordance with the DGCL, affirmatively
withdraws his, her or its demand for appraisal of such Dissenting Shares, (b)
fails to establish his, her or its entitlement to appraisal rights as
provided in the DGCL or (c) takes or fails to take any action the consequence
of which is that such holder is not

 



21  entitled to payment of the appraisal value for his, her or its shares under
the DGCL, such holder or holders (as the case may be) shall forfeit the right
to appraisal of such shares of Company Common Stock and such shares of
Company Common Stock shall thereupon cease to constitute Dissenting Shares and
such shares of Company Common Stock shall be deemed converted as of the
Effective Time into the right to receive the Per Share Common Stock Merger
Consideration or the Per Share Common Stock Merger Consideration Cash Value,
as applicable, as provided in this ARTICLE IV. The Company shall give Parent
prompt notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of shares
of Company Common Stock, and Parent shall have the right to participate in
all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. The Company
shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, (i) voluntarily
make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal for Dissenting
Shares, (ii) offer to settle any such demands, (iii) waive any failure to
timely deliver a written demand for appraisal in accordance with the DGCL or
(iv) agree to do any of the foregoing.

Section 4.6 _Treatment of Stock Options, Restricted Stock Units and Directors
 Deferred Compensation Plan Shares_.

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, the board of directors of the Company (or, if
appropriate, any committee thereof) shall take all actions necessary and
appropriate to provide that, each option to purchase shares of Company Common
Stock (a " _Company Option_ ") shall become exercisable for a reasonable
period of time prior to the Effective Time, provide written notice to the
holders of the Company Options at least 10 days prior to the Effective Time of
the period to exercise the Company Option and that the Company Option will
terminate and be of no further force and effect as of the Effective
Time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an outstanding performance based Company
Option not previously exercisable will be exercisable only as to the
percentage of shares underlying such Company Option in accordance with the
achievement by the "Investor" of the Investors "Internal Rate of Return"
targets set forth in the underlying award agreement evidencing such Company
Option (as defined therein) taking into account the transactions contemplated
under this Agreement.

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the board of directors of the Company (or, if
appropriate, any committee thereof) shall take all actions necessary and
appropriate to provide that, immediately prior to the Effective Time, each
Company Option, other than a Rollover Option or a Forfeited Option, granted
under the equity incentive plans of the Company or under any and
all individual consultant, employee, director, independent contractor,
independent sales personnel or distributor agreements (collectively, the "
_Company Stock Plans_ "), whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, as of the Effective Time, be
cancelled and, in exchange therefor, each former holder of any such cancelled
Company Option shall be entitled to receive, within five (5) Business Days
following the Effective Date, in consideration of the cancellation of such
Company Option and in settlement therefor, a cash payment equal to the product
of (i) the excess of (A) the Per Share Common Stock Merger Consideration Cash
Value _minus_ (B) the applicable exercise price per share of Company Common
Stock subject to such Company Option, _multiplied by_ (ii) the number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option, and no
consideration shall be payable with respect to any Company Option that is
out-of-the money. Such payment shall be subject to any withholding or other
taxes required by Applicable Law to be withheld.

 



22 (c) Prior to the Closing, the board of directors of the Company (or, if
appropriate, any committee thereof) shall take all actions reasonably
necessary and appropriate to provide that, immediately prior to the Effective
Time, each outstanding performance-based Company Option set forth on Section
4.6(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter and each Company Option which has an
applicable exercise price per share of Company Common Stock greater than or
equal to the Per Share Common Stock Merger Consideration Cash Value (each, a "
_Forfeited Option_ ") that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall, as of the Effective Time, be cancelled without the payment of any
consideration therefor upon the Effective Time.

 

(d) Prior to the Closing, the board of directors of the Company (or, if
appropriate, any committee thereof) shall take all actions necessary and
appropriate to provide that, immediately prior to the Closing, each Restricted
Stock Unit that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be cancelled and, in exchange therefor, each former holder of any such
Restricted Stock Unit shall be entitled to receive, within five (5) Business
Days following the Effective Date, in consideration of the cancellation of
such Restricted Stock Unit and in settlement therefor, a cash payment equal to
the Per Share Common Stock Merger Consideration Cash Value. Such payment
shall be subject to any withholding or other taxes required by Applicable Law
to be withheld.

 

(e) Prior to the Closing, the board of directors of the Company (or, if
appropriate, any committee thereof) shall take all actions necessary and
appropriate to provide that any shares of Company Common Stock to be issued to
a participant in the Directors Deferred Compensation Plan entitled to
distributions of amounts thereunder in connection with the consummation of the
Merger who has elected, in accordance with the terms thereof, to receive such
amount in the form of shares of Company Common Stock shall have been issued
prior to the Effective Time (and will be included in Outstanding Stock and
subject to Section 4.1). Prior to the Closing, the Company shall obtain a
release (in form reasonably acceptable to Parent and Merger Sub) from each
such participant acknowledging the cancellation of such participants rights
under the Directors Deferred Compensation Plan and releasing the Company and
its Subsidiaries from any claims such participant may have to any equity
ownership in the Company or its Subsidiaries, or payment of any amounts
arising in connection therewith, other than the issuance of Company Common
Stock in accordance with this Section 4.6(e).

(f) As of the date hereof, the Company has entered into Rollover Option
Agreements to be effective as of the Closing with each holder of Rollover
Options providing that the Rollover Options held by each such holder will be

aggregate spread value as the Rollover Options they were exchanged for, but
shall have a per share exercise price equal to approximately 25% of the
Closing Parent Common Stock Price with the aggregate number of such Parent
Replacement Options correspondingly reduced from the number of Rollover
Options, and such Parent Replacement Options shall otherwise have the same
terms and conditions as applied to the Rollover Option immediately prior to
the Closing (as such Rollover Options were amended to provide that the post-
termination exercise period for such Rollover Options on any termination other
than a termination for "Cause" (as defined in the applicable award agreement)
shall be the balance of the term of such Rollover Options). Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the terms of each Rollover Option shall comply with the
requirements of Code Section 409(A) and Treasury Regulation
1.409(A)- 1(b)(5)(v)(D).

to Parent the total amount of Company Transaction Expenses as of the Closing.
The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to have all Company
Transaction Expenses contained in the Company Transaction Expense Notice and
shall update such notice, as necessary, one Business Day prior to Closing. The
expenses set forth in the Company Transaction Expense Notice shall be subject
to the Parents reasonable review and the Company shall consult in good faith
with Parent to resolve any disagreement relating to any such expense;
_provided_ , that in no event shall the parties obligations under Section 2.2
be affected by any such disagreement. The Company Transaction Expenses Notice
shall include payment instructions for each Company Transaction Expense due
and payable to a third party listed therein and Parent shall pay all such
Company Transaction Expenses on the Closing Date; and

(b) the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to deliver to Parent

administrative agent for such Funded Debt of the amount of such Funded
Debt and that upon such receipt, (i) Parent or its legal counsel are
authorized to file a termination of any financing statements filed by the
lender relating to such Funded Debt and (ii) each lender or administrative
agent, as applicable, shall promptly execute such additional documents as are
necessary to evidence the discharge of such Encumbrances. On behalf of the
Surviving Corporation, at or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall pay by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account or accounts
designated in the relevant payoff letters the amounts set forth therein
(including the Debt Payoff Amount and all Breakage Costs related thereto).

 

Section 4.8 _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Surviving
Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, from any of the
consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Agreement such
amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to all of the
consideration payable to such Person under any provision of federal,
state, local or foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted
or withheld by Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation, as the case
may be, and paid over to the applicable Governmental Authority, such deducted
or withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the holder of shares of Company Common Stock, Company
Options or Restricted Stock Units, as applicable, in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made by Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving
Corporation, as the case may be.

 



24 ARTICLE V

 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

 

Except as disclosed in the Company Disclosure Letter (each section or
subsection of the Company Disclosure Letter qualifies the Section
or subsection of this Agreement to which it corresponds in number and each
other Section or subsection of this Agreement or the Company Disclosure Letter
where its applicability to, relevance as an exception to, or disclosure for
purposes of, such other Section or subsection is reasonably apparent on its
face), the Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as
follows:

 

Section 5.1 _Corporate Existence_. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is
an entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing (with respect
to jurisdictions that recognize such concept) under the laws of its
jurisdiction of organization with all requisite corporate power and authority
to own, lease and operate its properties and assets as they are now
being owned, leased or operated and to carry on its business as presently
conducted. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is duly qualified to do
business as a foreign corporation or other legal entity and is in good
standing (with respect to jurisdictions that recognize such concept) in each
jurisdiction where the character of the properties owned, leased or operated
by it or the nature of the business transacted by it requires it to be so
qualified or in good standing, except where the failure to be so qualified
and in good standing would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The
Company has made available to Parent complete copies of the Organizational
Documents of the Company and each Significant Subsidiary (within the meaning
of Rule 1-02 of Regulation S-X promulgated under the Securities Act) of the
Company as of the date hereof and as currently in effect, and the Company and

majority of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock entitled to vote
thereon (the " _Company Stockholder Approval_ "), the delivery of the notice
required to be delivered by the Company pursuant to Section 228(e) of the DGCL
(the " _Section 228 Notice_ ") following receipt of the Company Stockholder
Approval and the filing of the Certificate of Merger pursuant to the DGCL, to
consummate the transactions contemplated to be consummated by the Company
hereby. Except for the approvals described in the following sentence, the
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Company and the
consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated to be consummated
by the Company hereby have been duly and validly authorized by all necessary

hereby, including the Merger, other than the Company Stockholder Approval,
the filing of the Certificate of Merger pursuant to the DGCL and the delivery
of the Section 228 Notice following receipt of the Company Stockholder
Approval. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by
the Company and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by
each other party hereto, constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of
the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms,
except as may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent transfer and similar laws of general
applicability relating to or affecting creditors rights or by general equity
principles.

or other legal entity and is in good standing (with respect to jurisdictions
that recognize such concept) in each jurisdiction where the character of the
properties owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of the business
transacted by it requires it to be so qualified or in good standing, except

Ltd., collectively, the " _Debt Providers_ "), including all exhibits,
schedules and annexes thereto, and the Fee Letter referred to (and as defined)
therein (which Fee Letter shall be redacted with respect to fees, pricing
caps, "market flex" provisions and other terms (other than any terms
affecting conditionality) in a manner reasonably acceptable to the Debt
Providers) regarding the terms of the debt financing to be provided thereby
(collectively, the " _Commitment Letter_ "), pursuant to which certain of the
Debt Providers have committed to provide, subject to the terms and conditions
set forth therein, debt financing in the amounts set forth therein (the "Debt
Financing"). The Commitment Letter is (A) in full force and effect and
represents a legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent and, to the
Knowledge of Parent, each of the other parties thereto and (B) enforceable in
accordance with its terms against Parent and, to the Knowledge of Parent,
each of the other parties thereto, in each case except as such enforcement may
be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or
other Applicable Laws of general application affecting enforcement of
creditors rights or by principles of equity (regardless of whether
enforcement is sought in a proceeding at law or in equity). None of the
respective obligations and commitments contained in the Commitment Letter have
been withdrawn, terminated or rescinded in any respect, and no such
amendment, modification, withdrawal, termination or rescission is contemplated
by Parent or, to the Knowledge of Parent, by any other party thereto. Assuming
the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company set forth
herein, no event has occurred which (with or without notice or lapse of time,
or both) would or would reasonably be expected to constitute a default or
breach or a failure to satisfy a condition precedent on the part of Parent
or, to the Knowledge of Parent, any other parties thereto under the Commitment
Letter. There are not, and there are not contemplated to be, any side letters
or other contracts or arrangements related to the Debt Financing other than
as expressly contemplated by the Commitment Letter delivered to the Company at
or prior to the execution and delivery of this Agreement and other than any
related engagement letters. There are no conditions precedent related to the
funding of the full amount of the Debt Financing other than those expressly
set forth in the Commitment Letter as in effect on the date hereof. Parent has
no reason to believe that, (i) it or any other party thereto will be unable
to satisfy on a timely basis any term of the Commitment Letter, (ii) any of
the conditions precedent to the Debt Financing will not be satisfied or (iii)
the Debt Financing will not be made available to Parent on the Closing
Date. Parent has fully paid any and all commitment fees or other fees in
connection with the Commitment Letter that are payable on or prior to the date
hereof, and will pay in full any such amounts due on or before the Closing
Date. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Commitment Letter, subject
to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and assuming that the Debt
Financing is funded in accordance with the Commitment Letter, Parent has, or
will have at Closing, sufficient funds for Parent and Merger Sub to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, including to (1) pay the
Aggregate Cash

 



47  Consideration, (2) pay the Debt Payoff Amount, (3) pay the Company
Transaction Expenses, and (4) satisfy all of the other payment obligations of
Parent and Merger Sub contemplated by this Agreement (such amounts referred
to in clauses (1), (2), (3) and (4), in the aggregate, the " _Required Amount_
").

Regulatory Laws, including those relating to investigational use, premarket

Parent Material Adverse Effect. As of the date of this Agreement, none of
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries has received any written notice from the FDA
or any other Governmental Authority that remains uncured and unresolved (i)

failures to be in compliance that would not have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect.

 

(d) None of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, nor, to the Knowledge of
Parent, any officer, employee or agent of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries,
has made an untrue statement of a material fact or fraudulent statement to the
FDA, failed to disclose a material fact required to be disclosed to the FDA,
or committed an act, made a material statement, or failed to make a
material statement that, at the time such disclosure was made, would
reasonably be expected to provide a basis for the FDA or any other
Governmental Authority to invoke its policy respecting "Fraud, Untrue
Statements of Material Facts, Bribery, and Illegal Gratuities", set forth in
the FDAs Compliance Policy Guide, Section 120.100 (CPG 7150.09). None of
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, nor, to the Knowledge of Parent, any
officer, employee or agent of Parent or any of 

 



48  its Subsidiaries, has been convicted of any crime or engaged in any conduct
for which debarment is mandated by Sec. 306 of the FDCA (21 U.S.C. § 335a(a))
or authorized by Sec. 306 of the FDCA (21 U.S.C. § 335a(b)). None of Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries nor, to the Knowledge of Parent, any officer,
employee or agent of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, has been convicted of
any crime or engaged in any conduct for which such Person or entity could be
excluded from participating in the federal health care programs under Section
1128 of the Social Security Act.

 

(e) Since January 1, 2013 through the date of this Agreement, none of Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries has received any written notice that the FDA or
any other Governmental Authority has commenced, or threatened to initiate, any
action to (i) withdraw its approval of any Medical Device, (ii) enjoin
production of any Medical Device or (iii) enjoin the production of any
Medical Device produced at any facility where any Medical Device is
manufactured, tested or packaged.

Section 6.15 _No Brokers_. Except for Piper Jaffray and Co., Inc., whose fees
and expenses are the sole responsibility of Parent, no broker, investment
banker or finder is entitled to any brokerage or finders fee or other
commission in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
based on any Contract made by or on behalf of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries.

 

Section 6.16 _No Additional Representations_. Except as otherwise expressly
set forth in this ARTICLE VI, neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor
any other Person acting on their behalf, makes any representations or
warranties of any kind or nature, express or implied, in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any representations
or warranties with respect to any projections, forecasts, estimates or
budgets of future revenues, future results of operations or future financial

antitrust, competition, fair trade or similar Applicable Laws in order to
avoid entry of, or to have vacated or terminated, any decree, order or
judgment (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) or other Applicable Law
that could prevent or materially delay the Closing from occurring as promptly
as reasonably practicable; _provided_ , _however_ , that for the avoidance of
doubt, such litigation shall in no way limit the obligations of the parties to
comply with their obligations under the terms of this Section 7.3.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Parent shall not
commence any litigation with respect to the matters that are the subject of
this Section 7.3 without the prior written consent of the Company (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned). Parent and
the Company shall jointly direct and control any litigation described in
either of the immediately preceding sentences, with counsel of their own
choosing; _provided_ , _however_ , that without limiting the generality of
Section 7.3(b), in the event the parties disagree in good faith with respect
to the defense or prosecution of such litigation (or the strategy
with respect thereto) despite the good faith cooperation, assistance and
consultation of the parties as required herein and compliance with their other
obligations under this Section 7.3, Parent shall, subject to and without
limiting Parents obligations under the other provisions of this Section 7.3,
be permitted to implement its strategy and otherwise pursue its position in
good faith with respect to such litigation as to which it has (x) consulted in
advance with the Company, (y) in good faith taken the Companys views into
account, including with respect to the overall strategic direction of the
defense or prosecution of any such litigation and (z) consulted with the
Company prior to taking any material substantive positions, making
dispositive motions or other material substantive filings or entering into any
negotiations concerning such litigation; _provided_ , that such strategy is
designed to obtain approval of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement by any antitrust or competition Governmental
Authority as promptly as reasonably practicable, and in any event prior to the
Outside Date; _provided_ , further, that in such instances where Parent is
permitted to implement its strategy and otherwise pursue its position, the
Company shall not take a position that is contrary to or inconsistent with
Parents strategy and position in any filing, meeting or communication with
any Governmental Authority.

Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 7.3 or any other
provision of this Agreement, (i) none of Parent, the Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries shall be required to agree to any sale, transfer,
license, separate holding, divestiture or other disposition of, or to any
prohibition of or any limitation on the acquisition, ownership, operation,
effective control or exercise of full rights of ownership, or other
modification of rights in respect of, any assets or businesses of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries or of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, or other
remedy (each, a " _Divestiture_ ") (x) that is not conditioned upon the
consummation of the Merger or (y) if such Divestiture would reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect
on Parent and its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation), taken as
a whole and (ii) the Company shall agree to and effect any Divestiture with
respect to its assets or businesses or the assets or businesses of any of
its Subsidiaries that may be requested by Parent or that Parent may consent
to so long as such Divestiture is conditioned on the consummation of the
Merger. In the event of any conflict

 



57  between subsections (a), (b) or (c) of this Section 7.3, the provisions of
this subsection (c) of this Section 7.3 shall, which respect to the matters
addressed in this subsection (c) of this Section 7.3, supersede the
provisions of subsection (a) and (b) of this Section 7.3.

(d) Each party shall and shall cause his, her or its respective Subsidiaries
to respond as promptly as reasonably practicable to any inquiries or requests
for information and documentary material received from any Governmental
Authority in connection with any antitrust or competition matters related to
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. The Company and its
Subsidiaries shall not, but Parent may, if in its good faith judgment it
determines (after consulting in advance with the Company and in good faith
taking the Companys views into account) that the taking of such action would
enhance the likelihood of obtaining any necessary antitrust, competition, fair
trade or similar clearance as promptly as reasonably practicable and in any
event by the Outside Date, extend any waiting period or agree to refile under
the HSR Act and any other applicable Competition Laws.

 

Section 7.4 _Information Pending Closing; Access_. From the date hereof
through the earlier to occur of the Closing and the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to ARTICLE IX, upon the reasonable advance written request
of Parent, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and
their respective Representatives to, at Parents sole cost and expense, (a)
afford to Parent and its Representatives reasonable access, during normal
business hours and in such manner as not to unreasonably interfere with the
normal operation of the businesses of the Company and its Subsidiaries, to the
properties, books, Contracts, data, files, information and records of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, (b) provide such information regarding the
Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective operations to Parent and its
Representatives as Parent may reasonably request and (c) use commercially
reasonable efforts to make available the appropriate Representatives of the
Company and its Subsidiaries and instruct such Representatives to reasonably
cooperate with Parent and its Representatives;  _provided_ , that the
foregoing shall not require the Company or its Affiliates or any of its or
their respective Representatives to (i) violate any confidentiality
obligations of the Company or any of its Affiliates or any of
their respective Representatives to any third party ( _provided_ , that the
Company and its Affiliates shall use reasonable best efforts to, at the sole
cost and expense of Parent, obtain, or cause to be obtained, waivers or enter
into other arrangements to avoid such violations so that this clause (i) does
not apply), (ii) violate any privacy or other Applicable Laws, (iii) make any
disclosure of information that would reasonably be expected, as a result of
such disclosure, and upon the advice of counsel, to have the effect of
causing the waiver of any privilege (including the attorney-client and work
product privileges) ( _provided_ , that if a joint defense agreement or other
commercially reasonable action would maintain such privilege, then the
Company and its Affiliates shall use commercially reasonable efforts to enter
into, at the sole cost and expense of Parent, or cause to be entered into, a
joint defense agreement on customary terms with Parent or take such other
commercially reasonable action if so reasonably requested by Parent, at the
sole cost and expense of Parent, so that this clause (iii) does not apply), or
(iv) furnish any information that could be harmful to the Companys
competitive position or otherwise detrimental to the Company if the Closing
does not occur ( _provided_ , that the Company shall attempt, in good faith,
to make reasonable alternative arrangements as may be reasonably necessary
to produce the relevant information in a way that would not be so harmful or
detrimental). Subject to Section 7.5(a), Parent shall hold, and shall cause
its Affiliates and Representatives to hold, in confidence all such information
on the terms and subject to the

 



58  conditions contained in the Mutual Non-Disclosure Agreement, dated as of
March 12, 2015, by and between Parent and the Operating Company (the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ "). All access and investigation pursuant to this
Section 7.4 shall be coordinated through the General Counsel or Chief
Financial Officer of the Company or their designees. No access or information
provided pursuant to this Section 7.4 or information provided or received by
any Person pursuant to this Agreement will affect any of the representations
or warranties of the Company contained in this Agreement or the conditions
hereunder to the obligations of Parent. The Company shall be entitled to have
its Representatives present at all times during any access pursuant to this
Section 7.4. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 7.4 or any other
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, no party nor any of
its Representatives (A) shall contact or have any discussions with any of the
customers, distributors, sales representatives, vendors, suppliers, licensees,
sub-licensees, landlords or sub-landlords or tenants or sub-tenants of any
other party or its Subsidiaries regarding such party or its Subsidiaries or
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, without prior written consent
of the other party or (B) except for Phase I environmental reviews conducted
at Parents sole expense, perform any onsite procedure or investigation
(including any onsite environmental investigation or study) that involves
physical disturbance or damage to any asset or property or any portions
thereof.

 

Section 7.5 _Confidentiality and Announcements_.

 

(a) Each of Parent and the Company acknowledges that the information being
provided in connection with this Agreement is subject to the terms and
conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement. The terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with its
terms; _provided_ , that from and after the Closing Date, any Confidential
Information (as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement) to the extent
relating exclusively to the businesses of the Company and its Subsidiaries
(other than any Confidential Information of the holders of shares of Company
Common Stock) shall be deemed to be Confidential Information of Parent for
all purposes under the Confidentiality Agreement. If this Agreement is, for
any reason, terminated prior to the Closing Date, the Confidentiality
Agreement shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with its
terms.

(b) None of the parties shall issue or make, or permit to be issued or made,
any press release or other public announcement, statement or disclosure
relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, other than (i)
with the prior written consent of Parent and the Company (such consent not to
be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) or (ii) as required by any
Applicable Law, any Governmental Authority or the rules and regulations of any
applicable securities exchange upon prior notice to the other parties hereto
(or requested by any Governmental Authority or applicable securities
exchange); _provided_ , that the disclosing party required to issue or make,
or permitted to be issued or made, any such press release or other public
announcement, statement or disclosure shall promptly notify the other party
and allow such other party a reasonable opportunity to comment on such press
release or other public announcement, statement or disclosure. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, Parent and the Company hereby acknowledge and agree that the
final form and content of any such required press release or other public
announcement, statement or disclosure shall be at the reasonable discretion of
the disclosing party.

 



59 Section 7.6 _Exclusivity_. The terms of Section 14 of that certain
letter agreement, dated as of July 12, 2015, between Parent and Company, are
hereby incorporated by reference and the terms of such Section shall continue
in force and effect until the earlier of Closing and the date that this
Agreement is terminated pursuant to its terms.

Section 7.7 _Indemnification of Directors and Officers_.

 

(a) For six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to indemnify and hold harmless all past and present
employees, agents, officers and directors of the Company and of its
Subsidiaries to the same extent such Persons are currently indemnified by the
Company and its Subsidiaries pursuant to the Companys and its
Subsidiaries Organizational Documents as in effect on the date hereof for
acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, and for such
period of time Parent shall not, and shall not permit the Company or its
Subsidiaries to, amend, repeal or modify any provision in the Companys or
any of its Subsidiaries Organizational Documents relating to exculpation or
indemnification of present and former officers and directors as in effect in
the Companys or any of its Subsidiaries Organizational Documents
immediately prior to the Closing, except as required by Applicable Law. Parent
shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to,
honor the indemnification agreements of the Company and its Subsidiaries set
forth in Section 7.7(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter with the employees,
officers and directors covered by such agreements. If the Company or any of
its successors or assigns: (i) consolidate with or merge into any other
corporation or entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation
or entity of such consolidation or merger; or (ii) transfer all or
substantially all of its properties and assets, then and in each such case, to
the extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so that the successors
and assigns of the Company shall assume all of the obligations set forth in
this Section 7.7.

 

(b) Parent shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to maintain in effect
for six (6) years from the Closing Date directors and officers liability
insurance covering those Persons who are currently covered by the Companys
and its Subsidiaries directors and officers liability insurance for events
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (" _D andO Insurance_") on terms
not less favorable than such existing insurance coverage; _provided_ , that
the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall not be required, and
Parent shall not be required to cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries, to pay for the DandO Insurance in an annual amount in excess of
two hundred fifty percent (250%) of the annual premium currently paid as of
the date hereof by the Company and its Subsidiaries for such insurance;
_provided_ , _further_ , that if the annual premiums of such insurance
coverage exceed such amount, Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall be
obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost
not exceeding such maximum amount. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement, the Company and its Subsidiaries will, prior to the Closing
at Parents sole cost and expense, purchase six (6) years run-off directors
and officers liability insurance that is dedicated to the Company and its
Subsidiaries and not shared with any other entity that is unrelated to the
Company and its Subsidiaries (" _Runoff D andO Insurance_"); _provided_
that payment for such insurance coverage provided by such Runoff DandO
Insurance shall not exceed two hundred fifty percent (250%) of the annual
premium currently paid as of the date hereof by the Company and its
Subsidiaries for such insurance without Parents prior written consent. If
the cost of the Runoff DandO Insurance would require an expenditure that exceeds

 



60  such amount and Parent does not so consent, the Company shall, and Parent
shall cause the Company to, obtain policies with the greatest coverage
available for a cost not exceeding such maximum amount. Any such Runoff DandO
Insurance policies will satisfy Parents obligation under this Section 7.7(b)
to provide DandO Insurance. In the event that any claim is brought under such
DandO Insurance, the policy shall be maintained until final disposition
thereof.

(c) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall
release, waive or impair any rights to directors and officers insurance
claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any of their respective directors,
officers or other employees, it being understood and agreed that the
indemnification provided for in this Section 7.7 is not prior to or in
substitution for any such claims under such policies; _provided_ , that
subject to the foregoing, the Surviving Corporation shall be a full
indemnitor of first resort without regard to any rights any past and present
officer or director of the Company and of its Subsidiaries and their
respective heirs and legal representatives may have against any other Person,
including any of its Affiliates.

(d) This covenant is intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, each of the past and present officers and directors of the
Company and of its Subsidiaries and their respective heirs and legal
representatives. The rights to indemnification and advancement and the other
rights provided for herein shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights
to which such a Person is entitled, whether pursuant to applicable Law,
contract or otherwise.

Section 7.8 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) As of the Closing Date, and for a one (1) year period following the
Closing Date, Parent will provide to those employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries who remain employed by them (the " _Continuing Employees_ ") (A)
salary and base wages that are at least equal to the salary and base wages
provided to the Continuing Employees immediately prior to the Closing Date
and (B) bonus opportunity and benefits (other than equity compensation
benefits) that, taken as a whole, are comparable in the aggregate to those
provided to similarly situated employees of Parent. For one (1) year
following the Closing Date, Parent shall, or shall cause the Company or its
Subsidiaries, as applicable, to, provide Continuing Employees with severance
benefits provided to similarly situated employees in accordance with Parents
standard practices in effect from time to time; _provided_ , that Parent
shall, and shall cause the Company or its Subsidiaries, as applicable, to,
honor any severance benefits with respect to which any such Continuing
Employee is entitled pursuant to any employment, severance or other similar
agreement with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as in effect at the
Effective Time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein is intended to
limit the right of Parent or the Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries to terminate the employment of any employee at any
time.

(b) For purposes of determining eligibility and vesting (but not for accrual
of benefits, other than with respect to severance, vacation or paid time-off
entitlement) under all employee benefit plans, programs, policies, contracts,
fringe benefits or arrangements of Parent or its Affiliates providing benefits
after the Closing Date to any Continuing Employee (all such plans, " _Parent
Benefit Plans_ "), Parent shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, give each
Continuing Employee full credit for such Continuing Employees service with
the Company and

 



61  its Affiliates (as well as service with any predecessor employer, to the
extent service with the predecessor employer is recognized by the Benefit
Plans immediately prior to the Closing Date) to the same extent recognized by
the Company or its Affiliates immediately prior to the Closing Date, except to
the extent such recognition would result in duplication of benefits. Parent
shall use reasonable efforts to waive, or cause to be waived, any pre-
existing condition limitations, exclusions, actively at work requirements and
waiting periods under any Parent Benefit Plan that is a welfare benefit plan
in which Continuing Employees (and their dependents) will be eligible to
participate from and after the Closing Date, except with respect to evidence
of insurability requirements under any life insurance and disability plans.
Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to recognize, or cause to be
recognized, the dollar amount of all co-payments, deductibles and similar
expenses incurred by each Continuing Employee (and his or her eligible
dependents) under the Benefit Plans during the year in which the Closing Date
occurs for purposes of satisfying such years deductible and co-payment
limitations under the relevant welfare benefit plans in which they will be
eligible to participate from and after the Closing Date.

 

(c) Immediately following the Closing, Parent shall pay Continuing Employees a
pro-rata bonus under the annual incentive plans listed in Section 7.8(c) of
the Company Disclosure Letter for the fiscal year in which the Closing occurs
based on achievement of pro-rata performance targets for the number of days
that have elapsed in such fiscal year as of the Closing Date and with the
bonus amounts to be the pro-rata portion of a full annual bonus based on the
number of days that have elapsed in such fiscal year as of the Closing Date.

 

(d) Nothing expressed or implied herein shall (i) confer upon any past or
present employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries, or his or her
representatives, beneficiaries, successors and assigns, any rights or remedies
of any nature, including, any rights to employment or continued employment
with Parent, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries or any of
their respective successors or Affiliates, (ii) be construed to prohibit
Parent from amending or terminating any employee benefit program or Parent
Benefit Plan or (iii) constitute or be construed as an amendment of any
employee benefit program or any Parent Benefit Plan.

(e) This Section 7.8 shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of
each of the parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this Section 7.8,
express or implied, is intended to confer upon any other Person any rights or
remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Section 7.8.

 

Section 7.9 _Affiliate Agreements_. All Affiliate Agreements set forth on
Section 7.9 of the Company Disclosure Letter shall be terminated at and as of
the Effective Time to the extent provided on Section 7.9 of the Company
Disclosure Letter, and all obligations and liabilities thereunder shall have
been satisfied or waived to the extent provided on Section 7.9 of the Company
Disclosure Letter, and evidence thereof with respect to any such Affiliate
Agreements that do not terminate in accordance with their terms, in form
reasonably acceptable to Parent, shall have been delivered to Parent.

Parent) including by: (i) maintaining in effect and enforcing the Commitment
Letter and complying with its obligations thereunder; (ii)
negotiating, entering into and delivering the definitive agreements with
respect to the Debt Financing (the " _Definitive Financing Agreements_ ") on
the terms and conditions contained in the Commitment Letter and, to the extent
such definitive agreements are executed and delivered prior to the Effective
Time, maintaining in effect and enforcing such definitive agreements; (iii)
satisfying (or, if deemed advisable by Parent, seeking the waiver of) on a
timely basis all terms, covenants and conditions set forth in the Commitment
Letter and the Definitive Financing Agreements applicable to Parent that are
within its control; (iv) participating in and assisting with the preparation
of rating agency presentations and meetings with rating agencies; and (v)
upon satisfaction of all of the conditions precedent under Section 8.1 and
Section 8.2(other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those
conditions), consummating or causing the consummation of the Financing
including by enforcing its rights under the Commitment Letter and the
Definitive Financing Agreements to the extent necessary at such time to fund
the Required Amount.

(b) Parent shall apprise the Company of material developments relating to the
Financing and shall give the Company prompt notice of any material adverse
change with respect to such Financing. Without limiting the foregoing, Parent
agrees to notify the Company promptly, and in any event within three Business
Days the same comes to the Knowledge of Parent, if at any time prior to the
Effective Time (i) the Commitment Letter or any of the commitments with
respect to the Debt Financing thereunder or any Definitive Financing
Agreement, as applicable, shall expire or be terminated for any reason, (ii)
for any reason, all or a portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable or
(iii) any Financing Source or any other Person that is a party to any
Commitment Letter breaches, defaults, terminates or repudiates any provisions
thereunder or threatens in writing to do any of the foregoing. Parent shall
not amend, alter or replace, or agree to amend, alter or replace, the
Commitment Letter in any manner that would (A) impose new or additional
conditions or otherwise expand, amend or modify any of the conditions to the
receipt of the Financing, (B) reduce the amount of cash proceeds from the
Financing available to fund the Required Amount, in each case, in a manner
that would materially adversely affect the ability of Parent or
its Affiliates to enforce their respective rights against the other parties
to the Commitment Letter or the Definitive Financing Agreements or reasonably
be expected to prevent or materially impair or delay the ability of Parent to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, in each case with
respect to the foregoing sub-clauses (A) and (B) without the prior written
consent of the Company (it being understood and agreed that the Commitment
Letter may be amended solely to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners,
syndication agents or similar entities who had not executed the Commitment
Letter as of the date of this Agreement and to reflect assignments and
replacements of lenders in accordance with the terms of the syndication
provisions of the Commitment Letter with respect to the Debt Financing,
_provided_ , that no such addition, assignment or replacement would reasonably
be expected to prevent or materially impair or delay the ability of Parent to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as determined by
the Company in its reasonable discretion).

 



63 (c) If any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and
conditions contemplated in the Commitment Letter for any reason, Parent and
Merger Sub shall use their reasonable best efforts as promptly as practicable
following the occurrence of such event but no later than the final day of the
Marketing Period, to arrange to obtain alternative financing from alternative
sources in an amount sufficient, when taken together with the available cash
of Parent, to fund the Required Amount and pay any related fees and expenses
earned, due and payable as of the Closing Date (the " _Alternate Financing_
") and to obtain, and, if obtained, will provide the Company with true,
correct and complete copies of, any new financing commitment that provides for
at least the same amount of financing as such Commitment Letter as originally
issued, to the extent needed to fund the Required Amount (the " _Alternate
Commitment Letter_ "). In the event any Alternate Financing is obtained and an
Alternate Commitment Letter is entered into in accordance with this Section
7.10(c), (i) any reference in this Agreement to " _Debt Financing_ " shall
mean the debt financing contemplated by the Commitment Letter as modified
pursuant to clause (ii) below, and (ii) any reference in this Agreement to
the " _Commitment Letter_ " (or defined terms that use such phrase) shall be
deemed to include the Commitment Letter to the extent not superseded by an
Alternate Commitment Letter, at the time in question and any Alternate
Commitment Letter to the extent then in effect.

(d) From and after the date of this Agreement, and through the earlier of the
Closing and the date on which this Agreement is terminated in accordance with
ARTICLE IX, the Company shall, and the Company shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries and each of its and their respective management, advisors and
other Representatives to, use its respective reasonable best efforts to
provide all cooperation reasonably requested by Parent to assist Parent in the
arrangement of any Debt Financing or any debt capital markets financing
undertaken in lieu of or in replacement of all or a portion of such Debt
Financing (the "Bond Financing" and, together with the Debt Financing, the "
_Financing_ ") for the purposes of financing the Required Amount and all
related fees and expenses of Parent (it being acknowledged and agreed by
Parent and Merger Sub that, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, the receipt of such Financing is not a condition to the consummation
of the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement), including (A) participating in a reasonable number of meetings,
presentations, road shows, sessions with rating agencies, Financing Arrangers
and prospective Financing Arrangers and drafting sessions, and participating
in reasonable and customary due diligence, (B) furnishing Parent and the

structure, arrange, syndicate and consummate the Debt Financing and the Bond
Financing, including financial statements of the Operating Company,
information necessary to create pro forma financial statements, financial data
of the Operating Company, audit reports and other information of the type
required by Regulation S-X and Regulation S-K under the Securities Act for a
registered public offering of debt securities by Parent on Form S-1 (subject
to exceptions customary for private placements pursuant to Rule 144A under
the Securities Act for debt capital markets transactions similar to the Bond
Financing), other information of the type customarily included in a bank
information memorandum (including information necessary to create pro forma
financial statements) and including, in any event, all information and data
necessary to satisfy the conditions set forth in Clauses (i)(B) and (ii)(B) of

include financial statements of the Company, collectively, the " _Required
Information_ "), (C) assisting Parent and the Financing Arrangers in the

Information or the other information provided pursuant to this 7.10 that it

require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to agree to pay any fees,
reimburse any expenses or otherwise incur any liability or give any
indemnities prior to the Closing Date, (C) require the Company or any of its

any Contract, (D) require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to execute

directors, officers or stockholders of the Company to act to adopt any
resolutions or consents or execute any Definitive Financing Agreements unless
such individuals will remain in such capacities after the Closing. Parent
shall promptly, upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company for all
reasonable and documented costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys
fees) incurred by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective
Representatives in connection with the Financing (collectively, the "Financing

provided by the Company or its Affiliates or its or their respective
Representatives).

Section 7.12 _FIRPTA Certificate_. At or prior to Closing, the Company shall

five (5) years of the date of the certification, a "United States real
property holding corporation" as defined in Section 897 of the Code, and shall

payments" under Section 280G of the Code. Prior to seeking such stockholder
approval, the Company will request waivers (the " _280G Waivers_ ") from the
intended recipients of such payments or benefits which waivers shall provide
that unless such payments or benefits are approved by the stockholders of the
Company to the extent and manner prescribed under Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the
Code, such payments or benefits shall not be made; _provided_ , that in no
event will this Section 7.13 be construed to require the Company to compel any
Person to waive any existing rights under any contract or agreement that such
Person has with the Company or any Subsidiary thereof and in no event will
the Company be deemed in breach of this Section 7.13 if any such Person
refuses to waive any such rights. The parties acknowledge that this Section
7.13 shall not apply to any arrangements entered into at the

Affiliates, on the one hand, and a disqualified individual on the other hand
unless such arrangements have been entered into in advance of the vote and
provided to the Company prior to its seeking stockholder approval (the "
_Parent Arrangements_ ") so that, for the avoidance of doubt, unless such
arrangements have been entered into in advance of the vote and provided to
the Company, compliance with this Section 7.13 shall be determined as if such
Parent Arrangements had not been entered into. At least five (5) Business Days
prior to the date the Company submits all relevant arrangements for
such stockholder approval, the Company shall provide Parent, for its review
and reasonable comment, a copy of the documentation proposed to be submitted
(including any 280G Waivers) and the calculations prepared under Section 280G
of the Code, upon which the stockholder vote is being sought.

Section 7.14 _Notice of Events_. The Company shall give prompt notice to
Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company, of any notice or

transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

following sentence or (ii) as otherwise expressly provided herein, all
expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions

filing fees and expenses.

such documents and other papers and perform such further acts as may be

event later than one (1) Business Day after, the execution this Agreement, the
Company shall deliver to Parent a true and complete copy of a written consent

Disclosure Schedule evidencing the Company Stockholder Approval (the "
_Requisite Approval_ ") and in connection therewith take such other actions
set forth on Section 7.17 of the Company Disclosure Letter.

Section 7.18 _Merger Sub_. Prior to the Effective Time, Merger Sub will have
engaged in no other business activities and will have incurred no liabilities
or obligations other than as contemplated herein.

Agreement, and in any event prior to Closing, the Company shall, in
consultation with Parent and Parents tax advisors, formulate a plan to
minimize any potential adverse tax impact associated with the intercompany
loans held by Star Guide Limited in the manner and with the intended effect
set forth on Section 7.19 of the Company Disclosure Letter.

(a) This Agreement and all matters arising out of or relating hereto,
including its validity, construction and interpretation, shall be governed by
the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to the laws as to choice or
conflict of laws.

(b) Each party to this Agreement, by its execution hereof, (i) hereby
irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the applicable
state and Federal courts of competent jurisdiction located in the State of
Delaware, and any appellate court therefrom, for the purpose of any action,

proceeding or investigation arising out of or related to this Agreement or the
agreements delivered in connection herewith or the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment relating
thereto, (ii) to the extent not prohibited by Applicable Law, hereby waives
and agrees not to assert by way of motion, as a defense or otherwise, in
any such action, claim, cause of action or suit (in contract, tort or
otherwise), inquiry, proceeding or investigation that it is not subject to the
personal jurisdiction of the above-named courts, that its property is exempt
or immune from attachment or execution by reason of a lack of personal
jurisdiction, that any such proceeding brought in one of the above-named
courts is improper by reason of a lack of personal jurisdiction or venue, or
that this Agreement or the subject matter hereof may not be enforced in or by
such court by reason of a lack of personal jurisdiction or improper venue, and
(iii) hereby agrees not to commence any action, claim, cause of action or suit
(in contract, tort or otherwise), inquiry, proceeding or investigation

connection herewith or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby other

other action seeking or intending to cause the transfer or removal of any
such action, claim, cause of action or suit (in contract, tort or otherwise),
inquiry, proceeding or investigation to any court other than one of the above-
named courts. Each party hereby consents to and accepts service of process in
any such proceeding in any manner permitted by Delaware law or if served by
registered mail addressed to it at its address provided in Section 10.5. Each
party agrees that a final judgment in any such action, claim, cause of action
or suit (in contract, tort or otherwise), inquiry, proceeding or investigation
shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the
judgment or in any other manner provided by Applicable Law.

 



74 (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing and without limiting Section 10.13, each
party to this Agreement agrees that it will not bring or support any
proceeding of any kind or description, whether in law or in equity, whether in
contract or in tort or otherwise, against the Financing Sources in any way
relating to this Agreement, including any dispute arising out of the
Commitment Letter or the performance thereof, in any forum other than the
Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York, or, if under
Applicable Law exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the Federal courts, the
United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, County of
New York (and of the appropriate appellate courts therefrom).

 

Section 10.10 _Waiver_. At any time prior to the Closing, Parent, on the one
hand, and the Company, on the other, may (a) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the Company in the case
of Parent, or of Parent or Merger Sub, in the case of the Company, (b) waive
any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained herein or in
any document delivered pursuant hereto of the Company in the case of Parent,
or of Parent, in the case of the Company, and (c) waive compliance with any of
the agreements or conditions contained herein of the Company, in the case of
Parent, or of Parent, in the case of the Company. Any agreement on the part of
a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set
forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. No failure
or delay by any party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder
shall act as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise
thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any
other right, power or privilege hereunder.

Section 10.11 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY
APPLICABLE LAW WHICH CANNOT BE WAIVED, EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY
WAIVES, AND COVENANTS THAT IT WILL NOT ASSERT (WHETHER AS PLAINTIFF, DEFENDANT

ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING (IN CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR
BASED UPON THIS AGREEMENT, ANY DEBT FINANCING (OR AGAINST ANY FINANCING
SOURCE) OR THE SUBJECT MATTER HEREOF OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH OR RELATED
OR INCIDENTAL TO THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. THE
PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS SECTION 10.11 CONSTITUTES A MATERIAL INDUCEMENT
UPON WHICH THEY ARE RELYING AND WILL RELY IN ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, AND
ANY OTHER AGREEMENTS RELATING HERETO OR CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. ANY PARTY HERETO
MAY FILE AN ORIGINAL COUNTERPART OR A COPY OF THIS SECTION 10.11 WITH ANY
COURT AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE CONSENT OF EACH SUCH PARTY TO THE WAIVER OF
ITS RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF ANY
ACTION, CLAIM, CAUSE OF ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING, SEEK TO ENFORCE ANY OF THE

are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
each party hereby waives

 



75  any objections to any remedy referred to in this Section 10.12. For the
avoidance of doubt, the parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in
the event that any provision of this Agreement was not performed in
accordance with its specific terms or was otherwise breached or the Closing
was not consummated, and that money damages would not be an adequate remedy,
even if available. It is accordingly agreed that, notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary (but subject to and without limitation of the
last sentence of this Section 10.12), the parties shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent or remedy breaches or threatened breaches
of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof
and to any further equitable relief, this being in addition to any other
remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. In the event any party
seeks any remedy referred to in this Section 10.12, such party shall not be
required to prove damages or obtain, furnish, post or provide any bond or
other security in connection with or as a condition to obtaining any such
remedy.

 

Section 10.13 _Recourse Against Financing Sources_. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Agreement or any document delivered under this
Agreement, the Company agrees that none of the Financing Sources, nor their
respective Affiliates, successors or assigns (collectively, the " _Lender
Related Parties_ ") shall have any liability or obligation to the Company and
their Affiliates relating to this Agreement, any document delivered under this
Agreement, the Commitment Letter or any of the transactions contemplated
herein or therein including in connection with any funding or failure to fund.

and Representatives, their respective successors and assigns and each other

of action of every kind and nature, whether foreseen or
unforeseen, contingent or actual, and whether now known or hereafter
discovered, which any of the Parent Releasing Parties had, now has or may in
the future have, at law or in equity, against any Parent Released Party in any
way arising out of, in connection with, pertaining to or by reason of events,
circumstances or actions occurring, existing or taken prior to the or as of

contained herein or otherwise, this Agreement may only be enforced against,
and any claims or causes of action that may be based upon, arise out of or
relate to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, may only be made
against the entities and Persons that are expressly identified as parties to
this Agreement in their capacities as such and no former, current or future
stockholders, equity holders, controlling persons, directors, officers,
employees, general or limited partners, members, managers, agents or
Affiliates of any party hereto, or any former, current or future direct or
indirect stockholder, equity holder, controlling person, director, officer,
employee, general or limited partner, member, manager, agent or Affiliate of
any of the foregoing (each, a " _Non-Recourse Party_ ") shall have any
liability for any obligations or liabilities of the parties to this Agreement
or for any claim (whether in tort, contract or otherwise) based on, in
respect of, or by reason of, the transactions contemplated hereby or in
respect of any oral representations made or alleged to be made in connection
herewith. Without limiting the rights of any party against the other parties
hereto, in no event shall any party or any of its Affiliates seek to enforce
this Agreement against, make any claims for breach of this Agreement against,
or seek to recover monetary damages from, any Non-Recourse Party.

 

Section 10.16 _Disclosure Letters_. Disclosure in any section or subsection of
the Company Disclosure Letter or the Parent Disclosure Letter shall apply
only to the indicated Section of this Agreement, except to the extent that it
is reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure that such disclosure is
applicable to or relevant to another Section of this Agreement. The inclusion
of information in the Company Disclosure Letter or the Parent Disclosure
Letter shall not be construed as an admission that such information is
material to any of the Company or its Subsidiaries or to any of Parent or its
Subsidiaries, as applicable. In addition, matters reflected in the Company
Disclosure Letter or the Parent Disclosure Letter are not necessarily limited
to matters required by this Agreement to be reflected in the Company
Disclosure Letter or the Parent Disclosure Letter. Such additional matters
are set forth for informational purposes only and do not necessarily include
other matters of a similar nature. Neither the specifications of any dollar
amount in any representation, warranty or covenant contained in this
Agreement nor the inclusion of any specific item in the Company Disclosure
Letter or the Parent Disclosure Letter is intended to imply that such amount,
or higher or lower amounts, or the item so included or other items, are or
are not material, and shall not be construed as an admission of liability or
responsibility under any Law or in any dispute or controversy. Further,
neither the specification of any item or matter in any representation,
warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement nor the inclusion of any
specific item in the Company Disclosure Letter or the Parent Disclosure Letter
is intended to imply that such item or matter, or other items or matters, are
or are not in the ordinary course of business (except where expressly stated
in the relevant representation, warranty or covenant), and shall not be
construed as an admission of liability or responsibility under any Law or in
any dispute or controversy.

 



77 Section 10.17 _Waiver of Conflicts_. Recognizing that Simpson Thacher
and Bartlett LLP has acted as legal counsel to the Company, its Subsidiaries,
certain of the direct and indirect holders of shares of Company Common Stock
and their Affiliates prior to date hereof, and that Simpson Thacher and Bartlett
LLP intends to act as legal counsel to certain of the direct and indirect

Parent, Merger Sub and the Company hereby waives, on its own behalf and
agrees to cause its Affiliates, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries
to waive, any conflicts that may arise in connection with Simpson Thacher and
Bartlett LLP representing any direct or indirect holders of the Company
