                          AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

the 14th day of January, 2005, by and between FFLC BANCORP, INC. ("Acquired

and Texas; and

         WHEREAS, Acquired Corporation wishes to merge with BancGroup; and

         WHEREAS, it is the intention of BancGroup and Acquired Corporation that
such Merger shall qualify for federal income tax purposes as a "reorganization"

                         MERGER -- TERMS AND CONDITIONS

         2.1  APPLICABLE LAW. On the Effective Date, Acquired Corporation shall
              --------------

mixed) and choses in action shall be transferred to and vested in the Resulting
Corporation by virtue of the Merger without any deed or other transfer. The
Resulting Corporation on the Effective Date, and without any order or other
action on the part of any court or otherwise, shall hold and enjoy all rights of
property, franchises and interests, including appointments, designations and
nominations and all other rights and interests as trustee, executor,
administrator, transfer agent and registrar of stocks and bonds, guardian of
estates, assignee, and receiver and in every other fiduciary capacity and in
every agency, and capacity, in the same manner and to the same extent as such
rights, franchises and interests were held or enjoyed by Acquired Corporation
and BancGroup, respectively, on the Effective Date.

         2.3  ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION AND BYLAWS. On the Effective Date, the
              ------------------------------------

         2.4  RESULTING CORPORATION'S OFFICERS AND BOARD. The board of directors
              ------------------------------------------
and the officers of the Resulting Corporation on the Effective Date shall
consist of those persons serving in such capacities of BancGroup as of the
Effective Date.

         2.5  SHAREHOLDER APPROVAL. This Agreement shall be submitted to the
              --------------------
shareholders of Acquired Corporation at the Shareholders' Meeting to be held as
promptly as practicable consistent with the satisfaction of the conditions set
forth in this Agreement. Upon approval by the requisite vote of the shareholders
of Acquired Corporation as required by applicable Law, and the satisfaction of
such other conditions as set forth herein, the Merger shall become effective as
soon as practicable thereafter in the manner provided in section 2.7 hereof.

         2.6  FURTHER ACTS. If, at any time after the Effective Date, the
              ------------
Resulting Corporation shall consider or be advised that any further assignments
or assurances in law or any other acts are necessary or desirable (i) to vest,
perfect, confirm or record, in the Resulting Corporation, title to and
possession of any property or right of Acquired Corporation or BancGroup,
acquired as a result of the Merger, or (ii) otherwise to carry out the purposes
of the Merger and this Agreement, BancGroup and its officers and directors shall
execute and deliver all such proper deeds, assignments and assurances in law and
do all acts necessary or proper to vest, perfect or confirm title to, and
possession of, such property or rights in the Resulting Corporation and
otherwise to carry out the purposes of this Agreement; and the proper officers

Parties may mutually agree.

              -------------------------

merge with and into Colonial Bank, N.A., BancGroup's Subsidiary bank (the "Bank
Merger"). The exact timing and structure of the Bank Merger have not been
finalized at this time, and BancGroup in its discretion will determine if such
Bank Merger shall proceed and will finalize such timing and structure at a later
date. Acquired Corporation will cooperate with BancGroup in consummating the
Bank Merger, including the calling of any special meetings of the board of
directors of the Bank and the filing of any regulatory applications.

                                    ARTICLE 3
                    CONVERSION OF ACQUIRED CORPORATION STOCK

         3.1      CONVERSION OF ACQUIRED CORPORATION STOCK.
                  ----------------------------------------

                  (a) (i) On the Effective Date, and subject to sections
3.1(a)(ii), 3.1(a)(iii), 3.1(a)(iv), 3.3 and 3.5, each share of common stock of
Acquired Corporation outstanding and held by Acquired Corporation's shareholders
("Acquired Corporation Stock"), shall be converted into the right to receive
shares of BancGroup Common Stock and/or cash (the "Merger Consideration") as
specified below. Each outstanding share of Acquired Corporation Stock on the
Effective Date shall be converted into the right to receive either (A) 2.0
shares (subject to section 3.3 hereof) of BancGroup Common Stock or (B) $42.00
in cash in accordance with sections 3.1(a)(ii), (iii) and (iv) of this
Agreement.

                  (ii) A holder of Acquired Corporation Stock may, prior to the
Shareholders Meeting, file a written election form (an "Election Form") with the
Acquired Corporation specifying whether such holder (an "Electing Shareholder")
prefers to have the Merger Consideration paid to such holder in shares of
BancGroup Common Stock only, cash only, or any proportion of cash and whole
share of BancGroup Common Stock that such holder desires to receive, subject to
the limitation on cash consideration in sections 3.1(a)(iii) and (iv) of this
Agreement.

                  (iii) Notwithstanding section 3.1(a)(ii) of this Agreement and
notwithstanding any elections made pursuant to the Election Forms, the aggregate
amount of cash to be distributed in the Merger (the "Maximum Cash Amount") shall
not be more than the amount of 35% of the outstanding Acquired Corporation Stock
at the time of the Closing times $42 ($79,501,819 assuming 5,408,287 shares of
Acquired Corporation Stock are outstanding at the time of the Closing) even if
the aggregate amount of cash elected by stockholders (the "Aggregate Cash
Amount") exceeds the Maximum Cash Amount. If the Aggregate Cash Amount exceeds
the Maximum Cash Amount, the Merger Consideration distributable to each holder
of Acquired Corporation Stock shall be adjusted by taking the following steps:
(1) determine the amount by which the Aggregate Cash Amount exceeds the Maximum
Cash Amount; (2) reduce the amount of cash that each Electing Shareholder
electing cash will receive on a pro rata basis until the Aggregate Cash Amount
is equal to the Maximum Cash Amount (the aggregate amount of this reduction
shall be referred to as the "Excess Cash Election"); (3) determine the number of


                                       3

<PAGE> 9


shares of Acquired Corporation Stock that each Acquired Corporation
Shareholder's pro rata portion of the Excess Cash Election represents (which
will be the pro rata portion of the Excess Cash Election divided by $42); (4)
increase such Electing Shareholder's stock component of such Electing
Shareholder's Merger Consideration by 2.0 shares of BancGroup Common Stock for
each share of Acquired Corporation Stock determined in step (3) above.

                  (iv) Elections made shall apply to all shares of record of
Acquired Corporation Stock held by a record holder making the election. If an
Acquired Corporation shareholder does not submit an Election Form, then such
holder will receive BancGroup Common Stock and no cash as his or her Merger
Consideration. For purposes of this section 3.1(a), and in accordance with
section 3.6, cash to be paid to holders exercising dissenter's rights of
appraisal under section 3.5 hereof shall be included as part of the Merger
Consideration for determining the amount of cash to be paid under section
3.1(a). Interest will not be paid on any cash to be paid as part of the Merger
Consideration.

                  (b)(i) On the Effective Date, BancGroup shall assume all
Acquired Corporation Options outstanding, and each such option shall cease to
represent a right to acquire Acquired Corporation common stock and shall,
instead, represent the right to acquire BancGroup Common Stock on substantially
the same terms applicable to the Acquired Corporation Options except as
specified below in this section. The number of shares of BancGroup Common Stock
to be issued pursuant to such options shall equal the number of shares of
Acquired Corporation common stock subject to such Acquired Corporation Options
multiplied by the Option Exchange Ratio (defined below), provided that no
fractions of shares of BancGroup Common Stock shall be issued and the number of
shares of BancGroup Common Stock to be issued upon the exercise of Acquired
Corporation Options, if a fractional share exists, shall equal the number of
whole shares obtained by rounding to the nearest whole number, giving account to
such fraction, or by paying for such fraction in cash, based upon a value of
$42.00 per share. The exercise price for the acquisition of BancGroup Common
Stock shall be the exercise price for each share of Acquired Corporation common
stock subject to such options divided by the Option Exchange Ratio, adjusted
appropriately for any rounding to whole shares that may be done. The Option
Exchange Ratio shall be 2.0 shares of BancGroup Common Stock for each share of
Acquired Corporation Stock. It is intended that the assumption by BancGroup of
the Acquired Corporation Options shall be undertaken in a manner that will not
constitute a "modification" as defined in Section 424 of the Code as to any
stock option which is an "incentive stock option." Schedule 3.1(b) hereto sets
forth the names of all persons holding Acquired Corporation Options, the number
of shares of Acquired Corporation common stock subject to such options, the
exercise price and the expiration date of such options.

                           (ii) BancGroup shall file at its expense a
registration statement with the SEC on Form S-8 or such other appropriate form
(including the Form S-4 to be filed in connection with the Merger) with respect
to the shares of BancGroup Common Stock to be issued pursuant to such options
and shall use its reasonable best efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such
registration statement for so long as such options remain outstanding. Such
shares shall also be registered or qualified for sale under the securities laws
of any state in which registration or qualification is necessary.

                  (c) In lieu of the conversion specified in paragraph (b)(i) of
Section 3.1 of this Agreement, no later than five days prior to the Effective
Date, each holder of outstanding Acquired Corporation Options may provide
written notice to Acquired Corporation (in form and substance reasonably


                                       4

<PAGE> 10


satisfactory to BancGroup) that he or she wishes to exchange his or her Acquired
Corporation Options, as of the Effective Date, and, to receive an amount of cash
in exchange therefore. The amount of cash to be received shall be determined by
calculating the difference between (i) the number obtained by multiplying the
number of shares of Acquired Corporation Stock issuable pursuant to his or her
Acquired Corporation Options times $42.00 less (ii) the number obtained by
multiplying the number of shares of Acquired Corporation Stock issuable pursuant
to his or her Acquired Corporation Options times the exercise price per share
(as determined pursuant to the applicable stock option plan and stock option
agreement of the Acquired Corporation). In the event that the exercise prices of
all Acquired Corporation Options are not the same, the above calculation shall
be made for each series of options. The amount of cash paid to Option holders
shall not be included in the Maximum Cash Amount. Acquired Corporation shall
inform all holders of Acquired Corporation Options of their ability to exchange
their options for cash as described in this Section 3.1(c).

         3.2  FRACTIONAL SHARES. No fractional shares of BancGroup Common Stock
              -----------------
shall be issued, and each holder of shares of Acquired Corporation Stock having
a fractional interest arising upon the conversion of such shares into shares of
BancGroup Common Stock shall, at the time of surrender of the certificates
previously representing Acquired Corporation Stock, be paid by BancGroup an
amount in cash equal to $42.00 per share.

         3.3  ADJUSTMENTS. In the event that prior to the Effective Date
              -----------
BancGroup Common Stock shall be changed into a different number of shares or a
different class of shares by reason of any recapitalization or reclassification,
stock dividend, combination, stock split, or reverse stock split of the
BancGroup Common Stock, an appropriate and proportionate adjustment shall be
made in the number of shares of BancGroup Common Stock into which the Acquired
Corporation Stock shall be converted.

         3.4  BANCGROUP STOCK. The shares of Common Stock of BancGroup issued
              ---------------
and outstanding immediately before the Effective Date shall continue to be
issued and outstanding shares of the Resulting Corporation.

         3.5  DISSENTING RIGHTS. Any shareholder of Acquired Corporation who
              -----------------
shall not have voted in favor of this Agreement and who has complied with the
applicable procedures set forth in the DGCL, relating to rights of dissenting
shareholders, shall be entitled to receive payment for the fair value of his
Acquired Corporation Stock. If after the Effective Date a dissenting shareholder
of Acquired Corporation fails to perfect, or effectively withdraws or loses his
right to appraisal and payment for his shares of Acquired Corporation Stock,
BancGroup shall issue and deliver the consideration to which such holder of
shares of Acquired Corporation Stock is entitled under Section 3.1 (without
interest) upon surrender by such holder of the certificate or certificates
representing shares of Acquired Corporation Stock held by him or her.

         3.6  ELECTION AND EXCHANGE PROCEDURES. Each holder of record of shares
              --------------------------------
of the Acquired Corporation Common Stock (other than Dissenting Shares)
("Holder") shall have the right, subject to the limitations set forth in this
Article 3, to submit an election in accordance with the following procedures:



                                       5

<PAGE> 11


         (a) Each Holder may specify in a request made in accordance with the
provisions of this Section 3.6 (herein called an "Election") (x) the number of
shares of Acquired Corporation Common Stock owned by such Holder with respect to
which such Holder desires to make a Stock Election and (y) the number of shares
of Acquired Corporation Common Stock owned by such Holder with respect to which
such Holder desires to make a Cash Election.

         (b) BancGroup shall prepare a form reasonably acceptable to the
Acquired Corporation (the "Form of Election") which shall be mailed to the
Acquired Corporation's stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting of the
stockholders of the Acquired Corporation at which the stockholders of the
Acquired Corporation consider and vote on this Agreement (the "Acquired
Corporation Stockholders Meeting") so as to permit the Acquired Corporation's
stockholders to exercise their right to make an Election prior to the Election
Deadline.

         (c) BancGroup shall make the Form of Election initially available at
the time that the Proxy Statement (as defined herein) is made available to the
stockholders of the Acquired Corporation, to such stockholders, and shall use
all reasonable efforts to make available as promptly as possible a Form of
Election to any stockholder of the Acquired Corporation who requests such Form
of Election following the initial mailing of the Forms of Election and prior to
the Election Deadline. In no event shall the Form of Election be made available
less than twenty (20) days prior to the Election Deadline.

         (d) Any Election shall have been made properly only if the Person
authorized to receive the Elections and to act as Exchange Agent under this
Agreement, which Person shall be designated by BancGroup and not reasonably
objected to by the Acquired Corporation (the "Exchange Agent"), pursuant to an
agreement entered into prior to Closing and not reasonably objected to by the
Acquired Corporation, shall have received, by 5:00 p.m. local time in the city
in which the principal office of such Exchange Agent is located, on the date of
the Election Deadline, a Form of Election properly completed and signed and
accompanied by certificates of the shares of Acquired Corporation Common Stock
(the "Company Stock Certificates") to which such Form of Election relates or by
an appropriate customary guarantee of delivery of such certificates, as set
forth in such Form of Election from a member of any registered national
securities exchange or a commercial bank or trust company in the United States;
provided, that such certificates are in fact delivered to the Exchange Agent by
the time required in such guarantee of delivery. Failure to deliver shares of
Acquired Corporation Common Stock covered by such a guarantee of delivery within
the time set forth on such guarantee shall be deemed to invalidate any otherwise
properly made Election, unless otherwise determined by BancGroup, in its sole
discretion. As used herein, "Election Deadline" means 5:00 p.m. on the date that
is the day prior to the date of the Acquired Corporation Stockholder Meeting.
The Acquired Corporation and BancGroup shall cooperate to issue a press release
reasonably satisfactory to each of them announcing the date of the Election
Deadline not more than fifteen (15) business days before and at least five (5)
Business Days prior to, the Election Deadline.


                                       6

<PAGE> 12


         (e) Any Acquired Corporation stockholder may, at any time prior to the
Election Deadline, change or revoke his or her Election by written notice
received by the Exchange Agent prior to the Election Deadline accompanied by a
properly completed and signed, revised Form of Election. If BancGroup shall
determine in its reasonable discretion that any Election is not properly made
with respect to any shares of Acquired Corporation Common Stock, such Election
shall be deemed to be not in effect, and the shares of Acquired Corporation
Common Stock covered by such Election shall, for purposes hereof, be deemed to
be Non-Election Shares, unless a proper Election is thereafter timely made.

         (f) Any Acquired Corporation stockholder may, at any time prior to the
Election Deadline, revoke his or her Election by written notice received by the
Exchange Agent prior to the Election Deadline or by withdrawal prior to the
Election Deadline of his or her Acquired Corporation Stock Certificate, or of
the guarantee of delivery of such certificates, previously deposited with the
Exchange Agent. All Elections shall be revoked automatically if the Exchange
Agent is notified in writing by BancGroup or the Acquired Corporation that this
Agreement has been terminated in accordance with Article 13.

         (g) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a
Person other than the Person in whose name an Acquired Corporation Stock
Certificate so surrendered is registered, it shall be a condition to such
payment that such Acquired Corporation Stock Certificate shall be properly
endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the Person requesting
such payment shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other similar Taxes
required as a result of such payment to a Person other than the registered
holder of such Acquired Corporation Stock Certificate, or establish to the
reasonable satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is
not payable. The Exchange Agent (or, subsequent to the six month anniversary of
the Effective Time, BancGroup) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
Merger Consideration (including cash in lieu of fractional shares of BancGroup
Common Stock) otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of
Acquired Corporation Common Stock such amounts as the Exchange Agent or
BancGroup, as the case may be, is required to deduct and withhold under the
Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law, with respect to the
making of such payment. To the extent the amounts are so withheld by the
Exchange Agent or BancGroup, as the case may be, such withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of
shares of Acquired Corporation Common Stock in respect of whom such deduction
and withholding was made by the Exchange Agent or BancGroup, as the case may be.

         (h) BancGroup, in the exercise of its reasonable discretion, shall have
the right to make all determinations, not inconsistent with the terms of this
Agreement, governing (A) the validity of the Forms of Election and compliance by
any Acquired Corporation Stockholder with the Election procedures set forth
herein, (B) the manner and extent to which Elections are to be taken into
account in making the determinations prescribed by this Article 3, (C) the
issuance and delivery of BancGroup Stock Certificates into which shares of
Acquired Corporation Common Stock are converted in the Merger and (D) the method
of payment of cash for shares of Acquired Corporation Common Stock converted
into the right to receive the Cash Consideration and cash in lieu of fractional
shares of BancGroup Common Stock where the holder of the applicable Acquired
Corporation Stock Certificate has no right to receive whole shares of BancGroup
Common Stock.


                                       7

<PAGE> 13


         (i) Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of its Acquired Corporation
Stock Certificate or Acquired Corporation Stock Certificates, accompanied by a
properly completed Form of Election a Holder of Acquired Corporation Common
Stock will be entitled to receive promptly after the Effective Time the Merger
Consideration (elected or deemed elected by it) in respect of the shares of
Acquired Corporation Common Stock represented by its Acquired Corporation Stock
Certificate. Until so surrendered, each such Acquired Corporation Stock
Certificate shall represent after the Effective Time, for all purposes, only the
right to receive the Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional
shares of BancGroup Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor
upon surrender of such certificate in accordance with Section 3.1 and any
dividends or distributions to which such holder is entitled under this
Agreement.

         3.7   EXCHANGE PROCEDURES.
               -------------------

         (a)   Exchange Agent. Prior to the Effective Time, BancGroup shall
               --------------
appoint an exchange agent (the "Exchange Agent") for the purpose of exchanging
certificates (other than Dissenting Shares) which immediately prior to the
Effective Time evidenced shares of Acquired Corporation Common Stock (the
"Acquired Corporation Certificates") for the Merger Consideration.

         (b)  Exchange Fund. BancGroup or the Resulting Corporation, as the case
              -------------
may be, agrees to make available to the Exchange Agent from time to time as
needed, certificates representing the BancGroup Common Stock, cash sufficient to
pay the Cash Consideration, cash in lieu of fractional shares and any dividends
and other distributions. Any cash and certificates of BancGroup Common Stock
deposited with the Exchange Agent shall hereinafter be referred to as the
"Exchange Fund."

         (c)  Exchange Procedures. Within five (5) Business Days after the
              -------------------
Effective Time, the Resulting Corporation shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail
to each holder of an Acquired Corporation Certificate: (i) a letter of
transmittal ("Letter of Transmittal") which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected and risk of loss and title to the Acquired Corporation Certificates
shall pass only upon delivery of the Acquired Corporation Certificates to the
Exchange Agent and which Letter of Transmittal shall be in customary form and
have such other provisions as BancGroup or the Resulting Corporation, as the
case may be, may reasonably specify and (ii) instructions for effecting the
surrender of such Acquired Corporation Certificates in exchange for the Merger
Consideration. Upon surrender of an Acquired Corporation Certificate to the
Exchange Agent together with such Letter of Transmittal, duly executed and
completed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents
as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Acquired
Corporation Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (i)
one or more shares of BancGroup Common Stock (which may be in uncertificated
book-entry form unless a physical certificate is requested) representing, in the
aggregate, the whole number of shares that such holder has the right to receive
pursuant to this Agreement and (ii) a check for any cash portion of the Merger
Consideration and for the cash that such holder has the right to receive
pursuant to this Agreement, including cash in lieu of any fractional shares of
BancGroup Common Stock and dividends and other distributions required or
permitted by this Agreement. No interest will be paid or will accrue on any cash
payable for the cash portion of the Merger Consideration. In the event of a
transfer of ownership of Acquired Corporation Common Stock which is not
registered in the transfer records of Acquired Corporation, one or more shares
of BancGroup Common Stock evidencing, in the aggregate, the proper number of
shares of BancGroup Common Stock and a check for the cash portion of the Merger
Consideration, the cash in lieu of any fractional shares of BancGroup Common
Stock and any dividends or other distributions to which such holder is entitled
pursuant to this Agreement, may be issued with respect to such Acquired
Corporation Common Stock to such a transferee if the Acquired Corporation
Certificate representing such shares of Acquired Corporation Common Stock is
presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to
evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock
transfer taxes have been paid.

<PAGE> 14


         (d)  No Further Ownership Rights in Acquired Corporation Common Stock.
              ----------------------------------------------------------------
All shares of BancGroup Common Stock issued and cash paid upon conversion of
shares of Acquired Corporation Common Stock in accordance with the terms of this
Article 3 (including any cash paid pursuant to this Agreement) shall be deemed
to have been issued or paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the
shares of Acquired Corporation Common Stock. Until surrendered as contemplated
by this Section 3.7, each Acquired Corporation Certificate shall be deemed at
any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon
such surrender the Merger Consideration (and any cash to be paid pursuant to
this Agreement).

         (e)  Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
              ----------------------------
which remains undistributed to the holders of the Acquired Corporation
Certificate six months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the
Resulting Corporation and any holders of the Acquired Corporation Certificates
who have not theretofore complied with this Section 3.7 shall thereafter look
only to the Resulting Corporation for the Merger Consideration with respect to
the shares of Acquired Corporation Common Stock formerly represented thereby to
which such holders are entitled pursuant to this Agreement, any cash in lieu of
fractional shares of BancGroup Common Stock to which such holders are entitled
pursuant to this Agreement and any dividends or distributions with respect to
shares of BancGroup Common Stock to which such holders are entitled pursuant to
this Agreement.

         (f)  No Liability. Neither BancGroup, Acquired Corporation, the
              ------------
Resulting Corporation nor the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person in
respect of any Merger Consideration from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

         (g)  Lost Certificates. If any Acquired Corporation Certificate shall
              -----------------
have been lost, stolen, destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact
by the Person claiming such Acquired Corporation Certificate to be lost, stolen,
or destroyed and, if required by the Resulting Corporation that posting by such
Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as the Resulting Corporation may
direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect
to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will deliver in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Acquired Corporation Certificate the applicable Merger
Consideration with respect to the shares of Acquired Corporation Common Stock
formerly represented thereby, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of BancGroup
Common Stock, and unpaid dividends and distributions on shares of BancGroup
Common Stock deliverable in respect thereof, in each case, pursuant to this
Agreement.

         (h)  Stock Transfer Books. The stock transfer books of the Acquired
              --------------------
Corporation shall be closed immediately upon the Effective Time and there shall
be no further registration of transfers of shares of Acquired Corporation Common
Stock thereafter on the records of Acquired Corporation. On or after the
Effective Time, any Acquired Corporation Certificates presented to the Exchange
Agent or the Resulting Corporation for any reason shall be converted into the
Merger Consideration with respect to the shares of Acquired Corporation Common
Stock formerly represented thereby, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of
BancGroup Common Stock to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to
this Agreement and any dividends or other distributions to which the holders
thereof are entitled pursuant to this Agreement.


                                    ARTICLE 4
             REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND COVENANTS OF BANCGROUP

          BancGroup represents, warrants and covenants to and with Acquired
Corporation as follows:

         4.1  ORGANIZATION. BancGroup is a corporation duly organized, validly
              ------------
existing and in good standing under the Laws of the State of Delaware. BancGroup
has the necessary corporate powers to carry on its business as presently
conducted and is qualified to do business in every jurisdiction in which the
character and location of the Assets owned by it or the nature of the business
transacted by it requires qualification or in which the failure to qualify
could, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect.
BancGroup is duly registered as a financial holding company under the Bank
Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended.

         4.2      CAPITAL STOCK.
                  -------------

                  (a) The authorized capital stock of BancGroup consists of (i)
200,000,000 shares of Common Stock, $2.50 par value per share, of which as of
September 30, 2004, 133,617,232 shares were validly issued and outstanding,
fully paid and nonassessable and are not subject to preemptive rights (not
counting additional shares subject to issue pursuant to stock option and other
plans and convertible debentures), and (ii) 1,000,000 shares of Preference
Stock, $2.50 par value per share, none of which are issued and outstanding. The
shares of BancGroup Common Stock to be issued in the Merger are duly authorized
and, when so issued, will be validly issued and outstanding, fully paid and
nonassessable, will have been registered under the 1933 Act, and will have been
registered or qualified under the securities laws of all jurisdictions in which
such registration or qualification is required, based upon information provided
by Acquired Corporation.

                  (b) The authorized capital stock of each Subsidiary of
BancGroup is validly issued and outstanding, fully paid and nonassessable, and
each Significant Subsidiary (as defined in Section 1-02 of Regulation S-X under
the Securities Act of 1933, as amended) is wholly owned, directly or indirectly,
by BancGroup.

         4.3      FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS;  TAXES. (a) BancGroup has delivered to
                  -----------------------------
Acquired  Corporation copies of the following financial statements of BancGroup:



                                       10

<PAGE> 16


                           (i) Consolidated balance sheets as of December 31,
2002, December 31, 2003, and September 30, 2004;

                           (ii) Consolidated statements of operations for each
of the three years ended December 31, 2001, 2002 and 2003, and for the nine
months ended September 30, 2004;

                           (iii) Consolidated statements of cash flows for each
of the three years ended December 31, 2001, 2002 and 2003, and for the nine
months ended September 30, 2004; and

                           (iv) Consolidated statements of changes in
shareholders' equity for the three years ended December 31, 2001, 2002 and 2003,
and for the nine months ended September 30, 2004.

All such financial statements are in all material respects in accordance with
the books and records of BancGroup and have been prepared in accordance with
GAAP applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods indicated unless
otherwise stated, all as more particularly set forth in the notes to such
statements. Each of the consolidated balance sheets presents fairly as of its
date the consolidated financial condition of BancGroup and its Subsidiaries.
Except as and to the extent reflected or reserved against in such balance sheets
(including the notes thereto), BancGroup did not have, as of the dates of such
balance sheets, any material Liabilities or obligations (absolute or contingent)
of a nature customarily reflected in a balance sheet or the notes thereto. The
consolidated statements of operations, cash flows and changes in shareholders'
equity present fairly the results of operations and changes in financial
position of BancGroup and its Subsidiaries for the periods indicated. The
foregoing representations, insofar as they relate to the unaudited interim
financial statements of BancGroup for the nine months ended September 30, 2004,
are subject in all cases to normal recurring year-end adjustments and the
omission of footnote disclosure.

                  (b) All Tax returns required to be filed by or on behalf of
BancGroup have been timely filed (or requests for extensions therefore have been
timely filed and granted and have not expired), and all returns filed are
complete and accurate in all material respects. All Taxes shown on these returns
to be due and all additional assessments received have been paid. The amounts
recorded for Taxes on the balance sheets provided under section 4.3(a) are, to
the Knowledge of BancGroup, sufficient in all material respects for the payment
of all unpaid federal, state, county, local, foreign or other Taxes (including
any interest or penalties) of BancGroup accrued for or applicable to the period
ended on the dates thereof, and all years and periods prior thereto and for
which BancGroup may at such dates have been liable in its own right or as
transferee of the Assets of, or as successor to, any other corporation or other
party. No audit, examination or investigation is presently being conducted or,
to the Knowledge of BancGroup, threatened by any taxing authority which is
likely to result in a material Tax Liability, no material unpaid Tax
deficiencies or additional liabilities of any sort have been proposed by any
governmental representative and no agreements for extension of time for the
assessment of any material amount of Tax have been entered into by or on behalf
of BancGroup. BancGroup has withheld from its employees (and timely paid to the
appropriate governmental entity) proper and accurate amounts for all periods in
material compliance with all Tax withholding provisions of applicable federal,
state, foreign and local Laws (including without limitation, income, social
security and employment Tax withholding for all types of compensation).

<PAGE> 17


         4.4  NO CONFLICT WITH OTHER INSTRUMENT. The consummation of the
              ---------------------------------
transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not result in a breach of or
constitute a Default (without regard to the giving of notice or the passage of
time) under any material Contract, indenture, mortgage, deed of trust or other
material agreement or instrument to which BancGroup or any of its Subsidiaries
is a party or by which they or their Assets may be bound; will not conflict with
any provision of the restated certificate of incorporation or bylaws of
BancGroup or the articles of incorporation or bylaws of any of its Subsidiaries;
and will not violate any provision of any Law, regulation, judgment or decree
binding on them or any of their Assets.

         4.5  ABSENCE OF MATERIAL ADVERSE CHANGE. Since the date of the most
              ----------------------------------
recent balance sheet provided under section 4.3(a)(i) above, there have been no
events, changes or occurrences which have had or are reasonably likely to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on BancGroup.

         4.6  APPROVAL OF AGREEMENT. The board of directors of BancGroup, or its
              ---------------------
Executive Committee, has approved this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated by it and has authorized the execution and delivery by BancGroup of
this Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the legal, valid and binding
obligation of BancGroup, enforceable against it in accordance with its terms.
Approval of this Agreement by the stockholders of BancGroup is not required by
applicable Law. Subject to the matters referred to in section 8.2, BancGroup has
full power, authority and legal right to enter into this Agreement and to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. BancGroup has no
Knowledge of any fact or circumstance under which the appropriate regulatory
approvals required by section 8.2 will not be granted without the imposition of
material conditions or material delays.

         4.7  TAX TREATMENT. BancGroup has no present plan to sell or otherwise
              -------------
dispose of any of the Assets of Acquired Corporation, subsequent to the Merger,
and BancGroup intends to continue the historic business of Acquired Corporation.

         4.8  TITLE AND RELATED MATTERS. BancGroup has good and marketable title
              -------------------------
to all the properties, interests in properties and Assets, real and personal,
that are material to the business of BancGroup, reflected in the most recent
balance sheet referred to in section 4.3(a), or acquired after the date of such
balance sheet (except properties, interests and Assets sold or otherwise
disposed of since such date, in the ordinary course of business), free and clear
of all mortgages, Liens, pledges, charges or encumbrances except (i) mortgages
and other encumbrances referred to in the notes of such balance sheet, (ii)
liens for current Taxes not yet due and payable and (iii) such imperfections of
title and easements as do not materially detract from or interfere with the
present use of the properties subject thereto or affected thereby, or otherwise
materially impair present business operations at such properties. To the
Knowledge of BancGroup, the material structures and equipment of BancGroup
comply in all material respects with the requirements of all applicable Laws.

         4.9  SUBSIDIARIES. Each Subsidiary of BancGroup has been duly
              ------------
incorporated and is validly existing as a corporation in good standing under the
Laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation and each Subsidiary has been duly


                                       12

<PAGE> 18


qualified as a foreign corporation to transact business and is in good standing
under the Laws of each other jurisdiction in which it owns or leases properties,
or conducts any business so as to require such qualification and in which the
failure to be duly qualified could have a Material Adverse Effect upon BancGroup
and its Subsidiaries considered as one enterprise; BancGroup's banking
subsidiary has its deposits fully insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation to the extent provided by the Federal Deposit Insurance Act; and the
businesses of the non-bank Subsidiaries of BancGroup are permitted businesses of
registered bank holding companies that are financial holding companies.

         4.10  CONTRACTS. Neither BancGroup nor any of its Subsidiaries is in
               ---------
violation of its respective certificate of incorporation or bylaws or in Default
in the performance or observance of any material obligation, agreement, covenant
or condition contained in any Contract, indenture, mortgage, loan agreement,
note, lease or other instrument to which it is a party or by which it or its
property may be bound except where such violation could not be reasonably
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on BancGroup.

         4.11  LITIGATION. Except as disclosed in or reserved for in BancGroup's
               ----------

        REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND COVENANTS OF ACQUIRED CORPORATION

         Except as set forth in a disclosure schedule delivered by the Acquired
Corporation to BancGroup (the "Acquired Corporation Disclosure Schedule") prior
to the date hereof (which sets forth, among other things, items the disclosure
of which is necessary or appropriate either in response to an express provision
of this Agreement or as an exception to one or more of its representations and
warranties set forth below or its covenants in Articles 6 and 7, provided, that
(i) no such item is required to be set forth in the Acquired Corporation
Disclosure Schedule as an exception to any representation or warranty of the
Acquired Corporation if its absence (in combination with any other undisclosed
information) would not be reasonably likely to result in the related
representation or warranty being deemed untrue or incorrect under the standard
set forth in Section 9.1 and (ii) the mere inclusion of an item in the Acquired
Corporation Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a representation or warranty
shall not be deemed an admission by the Acquired Corporation that such item
represents a material exception or fact, event or circumstance or that such item
is or would be reasonably likely to result in a Material Adverse Effect with
respect to the Acquired Corporation.

         Acquired Corporation represents, warrants and covenants to and with
BancGroup, as follows:

         5.1  ORGANIZATION. Acquired Corporation is a Delaware corporation, and
              ------------
the Bank is a federally chartered savings and loan association. Each Acquired
Corporation Company is duly organized, validly existing and in active status
under the respective Laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation or association
and has all requisite power and authority to carry on its business as it is now
being conducted and is qualified to do business in every jurisdiction in which
the character and location of the Assets owned by it or the nature of the
business transacted by it requires qualification and in which the failure to
qualify could, individually, or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse
Effect.

         5.2  CAPITAL STOCK. As of the date of this Agreement, the authorized
              -------------
capital stock of Acquired Corporation consisted of 10,000,000 shares of common
stock, $0.01 par value per share, 5,408,287 shares of which are issued and
outstanding. All of such shares which are outstanding are validly issued, fully
paid and nonassessable and not subject to preemptive rights. Acquired
Corporation has 199,891 shares of its common stock subject to issuance pursuant
to the exercise of stock options under its stock option plans. Except for the
foregoing, Acquired Corporation does not have any other arrangements or
commitments obligating it to issue shares of its capital stock or any securities
convertible into or having the right to purchase shares of its capital stock,
including the grant or issuance of Acquired Corporation Options.

         5.3 SUBSIDIARIES. Acquired Corporation has no direct Subsidiaries other
             ------------
than the Bank and FFLC Statutory Trust I (the "Trust"), and there are no
Subsidiaries of the Bank other than Lake County Service Corporation ("LCSC").
Acquired Corporation owns all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of the
Bank free and clear of any liens, claims or encumbrances of any kind. All of the
issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of each Acquired Corporation
Company have been validly issued and are fully paid and non-assessable. As of
the date of this Agreement, there were (i)with respect to the Bank, 10,000,000
shares of common stock, par value $1.00 per share, authorized and 1,000 shares
outstanding and 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $1.00 per share

$1.00 per share, authorized and 6,500 shares outstanding, all of which are
wholly owned by Acquired Corporation (or the Bank in the case of LCSC). Other
than as listed above, no Acquired Corporation Company has any other form of
stock authorized or outstanding. The Bank has no arrangements or commitments
obligating it to issue shares of any of its capital stock or any securities
convertible into or having the right to purchase shares of any of its capital
stock.

         5.4 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS; TAXES (a) Acquired Corporation has delivered
             ---------------------------
to BancGroup copies of the following financial statements of Acquired
Corporation:

                           (i) Consolidated balance sheets as of December 31,
2002, December 31, 2003 and September 30, 2004;

                           (ii) Consolidated statements of income for each of
the three years ended December 31, 2001, 2002 and 2003, and for the nine months
ended September 30, 2004;

                           (iii) Consolidated statements of cash flows for each

months ended September 30, 2004; and

                           (iv) Consolidated statements of changes in
shareholders' equity for the three years ended December 31, 2001, 2002 and 2003,
and for the nine months ended September 30, 2004.

         All of the foregoing financial statements are in all material respects
in accordance with the books and records of Acquired Corporation and have been
prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis throughout the
periods indicated, except for changes required by GAAP, all as more particularly
set forth in the notes to such statements. Each of such balance sheets presents
fairly as of its date the financial condition of Acquired Corporation. Except as
and to the extent reflected or reserved against in such balance sheets
(including the notes thereto), Acquired Corporation did not have, as of the date
of such balance sheets, any material Liabilities or obligations (absolute or
contingent) of a nature customarily reflected in a balance sheet or the notes
thereto. The statements of income, shareholders' equity and cash flows present


                                       16

<PAGE> 22


fairly the results of operation, changes in shareholders' equity and cash flows
of Acquired Corporation for the periods indicated. The foregoing
representations, insofar as they relate to the unaudited interim financial
statements of Acquired Corporation for the nine months ended September 30, 2004,
are subject in all cases to normal recurring year-end adjustments and the
omission of footnote disclosure.

                  (b) Except as set forth on Schedule 5.4(b), all Tax returns
required to be filed by or on behalf of Acquired Corporation have been timely
filed (or requests for extensions therefore have been timely filed and granted
and have not expired), and all returns filed are complete and accurate in all
material respects. All Taxes shown on these returns to be due and all additional
assessments received have been paid. The amounts recorded for Taxes on the
balance sheets provided under section 5.4(a) are, to the Knowledge of Acquired
Corporation, sufficient in all material respects for the payment of all unpaid
federal, state, county, local, foreign and other Taxes (including any interest
or penalties) of Acquired Corporation accrued for or applicable to the period
ended on the dates thereof, and all years and periods prior thereto and for
which Acquired Corporation may at such dates have been liable in its own right
or as a transferee of the Assets of, or as successor to, any other corporation
or other party. No audit, examination or investigation is presently being
conducted or, to the Knowledge of Acquired Corporation, threatened by any taxing
authority which is likely to result in a material Tax Liability, no material
unpaid Tax deficiencies or additional liability of any sort has been proposed by
any governmental representative and no agreements for extension of time for the
assessment of any material amount of Tax have been entered into by or on behalf
of Acquired Corporation. Acquired Corporation has not executed an extension or
waiver of any statute of limitations on the assessment or collection of any Tax
due that is currently in effect.

                  (c) Each Acquired Corporation Company has withheld from its
employees (and timely paid to the appropriate governmental entity) proper and
accurate amounts for all periods in material compliance with all Tax withholding
provisions of applicable federal, state, foreign and local Laws (including
without limitation, income, social security and employment Tax withholding for
all types of compensation). Each Acquired Corporation Company is in compliance
with, and its records contain all information and documents (including properly
completed IRS Forms W-9) necessary to comply with, all applicable information
reporting and Tax withholding requirements under federal, state and local Tax
Laws, and such records identify with specificity all accounts subject to backup
withholding under section 3406 of the Code.

                  (g) suffered any Losses or waived any rights of value which in

material respects with the requirements of all applicable Laws.

board, bureau, agency or instrumentality, domestic or foreign, or before any

order, writ, injunction, decree, award, rule or regulation of any court,

and Regulations including those imposing Taxes, of any applicable jurisdiction
and of all states, municipalities, other political subdivisions and Agencies, in
respect of the ownership of its properties and the conduct of its business,

<PAGE> 26


         5.11  NO CONFLICT WITH OTHER INSTRUMENT. Except as disclosed on
               ---------------------------------
Schedule 5.11, the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement will not result in the breach of any term or provision of or
constitute a Default under any material Contract, indenture, mortgage, deed of
trust or other material agreement or instrument to which any Acquired
Corporation Company is a party and will not conflict with any provision of the
charter or bylaws of any Acquired Corporation Company.

         5.12  GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORIZATION. Each Acquired Corporation Company has
               --------------------------
all Permits that, to the Knowledge of Acquired Corporation, are or will be
legally required to enable any Acquired Corporation Company to conduct its
business in all material respects as now conducted by each Acquired Corporation
Company.

         5.13  ABSENCE OF REGULATORY COMMUNICATIONS. Except as provided in
               ------------------------------------
Schedule 5.13, no Acquired Corporation Company is subject to, nor has any
Acquired Corporation Company received during the past three years, any written
communication directed specifically to it from any Agency to which it is subject
or pursuant to which such Agency has imposed or has indicated it may impose any
material restrictions on the operations of it or the business conducted by it or
in which such Agency has raised any material question concerning the condition,
financial or otherwise, of such company.

         5.14  ABSENCE OF MATERIAL ADVERSE CHANGE. To the Knowledge of Acquired
               ----------------------------------
Corporation, since the date of the most recent balance sheet provided under
section 5.4(a)(i), there have been no events, changes or occurrences which have
had, or are reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on any Acquired Corporation Company.

         5.15  INSURANCE. Each Acquired Corporation Company has in effect
               ---------
insurance coverage and bonds with reputable insurers which, in respect to
amounts, types and risks insured, management of Acquired Corporation reasonably
believes to be adequate for the type of business conducted by such company. No
Acquired Corporation Company is liable for any material retroactive premium
adjustment. To the Knowledge of Acquired Corporation, all insurance policies and
bonds are valid, enforceable and in full force and effect, and no Acquired
Corporation Company has received any notice of any material premium increase or
cancellation with respect to any of its insurance policies or bonds. Within the
last three years, no Acquired Corporation Company has been refused any insurance
coverage which it has sought or applied for, and nothing has come to its
attention which would lead it to believe that existing insurance coverage cannot
be renewed as and when the same shall expire, upon terms and conditions as
favorable as those presently in effect, other than possible increases in

that any decisions to offer employment to any such person shall be made in the
sole discretion of BancGroup.

                  (g) BancGroup will take no action that would prevent or impede
the merger from qualifying as a tax-free reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368 of the Code.

                           (ii) BancGroup shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause individuals serving as directors and officers of the Acquired
Corporation on the Closing Date to be covered for at least three years from the
Closing Date by the directors' and officers' liability insurance policy
maintained by the Acquired Corporation immediately prior to the Closing Date

                           (iii) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim
indemnification under this subsection (h), upon learning of any such Liability
or Litigation, shall promptly notify BancGroup thereof. In the event of any such
Litigation (whether arising before or after the Effective Date) (A) BancGroup or
Colonial Bank, N.A. shall have the right to assume the defense thereof with
counsel reasonably acceptable to such Indemnified Party and, upon assumption of
such defense, BancGroup shall not be liable to such Indemnified Parties for any
legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred by
such Indemnified Parties in connection with the defense thereof, except that if
BancGroup or Colonial Bank, N.A. elects not to assume such defense or counsel
for the Indemnified Parties advises that there are substantive issues which
raise conflicts of interest between BancGroup and the Indemnified Parties, the
Indemnified Parties may retain counsel satisfactory to them, and BancGroup or
Colonial Bank, N.A. shall pay all reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel
for the Indemnified Parties promptly as statements therefor are received;

for only one firm of counsel for all Indemnified Parties in any jurisdiction,

Litigation; and (C) BancGroup shall not be liable for any settlement effected
without its prior consent; and provided further that BancGroup and Colonial

when and if a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine, and such
determination shall have become final, that the indemnification of such
Indemnified Party in the manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by applicable
Law, or (ii) it is determined that indemnification is prohibited under 12 USC
ss.1828(K) or 12 CFR Part 359.

                           (iv) In consideration of and as a condition precedent
to the effectiveness of the indemnification obligations provided by BancGroup in
this section to a director or officer of the Acquired Corporation, such director
or officer of the Acquired Corporation shall have delivered to BancGroup on or
prior to the Effective Date a letter in form reasonably satisfactory to
BancGroup concerning claims such directors or officers may have against Acquired
Corporation. In the letter, the directors or officers shall: (A) acknowledge the
assumption by BancGroup as of the Effective Date of all Liability (to the extent
Acquired Corporation is so liable) for claims for indemnification arising under
section 6.1(h) hereof; (B) affirm that they do not have nor are they aware of
any claims they might have (other than those referred to in the following clause

warrants to BancGroup that it has no Knowledge of any claim, pending or
threatened, or of any facts or circumstances that could give rise to any
obligation by BancGroup to provide the indemnification required by this section
6.1(h) other than as disclosed in the letters of the directors and executive
officers referred to in section 6.1(h)(iii) hereof or described in any schedule
to this Agreement and claims arising from any transaction contemplated by this

                      ----------
and the business of each Acquired Corporation Company in a proper and prudent

                  (c) Prohibited Negotiations. (i) Except with respect to this
                      -----------------------
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, no Acquired Corporation
Company nor any affiliate thereof nor any investment banker, attorney,
accountant, or other representative (collectively, "Representatives") retained
by an Acquired Corporation Company shall directly or indirectly solicit any
Acquisition Proposal by any Person. Except to the extent necessary to comply


                                       28

<PAGE> 34


with the fiduciary duties of Acquired Corporation's Board of Directors as
advised by counsel to such Board of Directors, no Acquired Corporation Company
or any Representative thereof shall furnish any non-public information that it
is not legally obligated to furnish, negotiate with respect to, or enter into
any Contract with respect to, any Acquisition Proposal, and each Acquired
Corporation Company shall direct and use its reasonable efforts to cause all of
its Representatives not to engage in any of the foregoing, but Acquired
Corporation may communicate information about such an Acquisition Proposal to
its shareholders if and to the extent that it is required to do so in order to
comply with its legal obligations as advised in writing by counsel to such Board
of Directors. Acquired Corporation shall promptly notify BancGroup orally and in
the event that any Acquired Corporation Company receives any inquiry or proposal
relating to any such Acquisition Proposal. Acquired Corporation shall
immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing activities,
discussions, or negotiations with any Persons other than BancGroup conducted
heretofore with respect to any of the foregoing.

                           (ii) If Acquired Corporation (A) willfully breaches
this Agreement and the Merger is not consummated, (B) enters into a letter of
intent or definitive agreement regarding an Acquisition Proposal with any third
party (other than BancGroup or any of its Subsidiaries) prior to the earlier of
(i) the Effective Date or (ii) the termination of this Agreement pursuant to
Article 13 hereof (other than a termination pursuant to paragraph (a) of section
13.2 hereof or by Acquired Corporation pursuant to paragraphs (b), (c) or (d) of
section 13.2 hereof), or (C) if Acquired Corporation receives or is the subject
of an Acquisition Proposal from a third party (other than BancGroup or its

hereof (other than a termination pursuant to paragraph (a) of section 13.2
hereof or by Acquired Corporation pursuant to paragraphs (b), (c) or (d) of

Acquired Corporation regarding an Acquisition Proposal or (Z) at any time on or

BancGroup for its direct and indirect costs and expenses in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including BancGroup's management
time devoted to negotiation and preparation for the Merger and BancGroup's loss

         15.3  GOVERNING LAW. Except to the extent the Laws of the State of
               -------------
Delaware apply to the Merger, this Agreement shall be governed by, and construed
in accordance with the Laws of the State of Alabama without regard to any
conflict of Laws.

         15.4  COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts,
               ------------
each of which shall be deemed to constitute an original. Each such counterpart
shall become effective when one counterpart has been signed by each Party
thereto.

         15.5  HEADINGS. The headings of the various articles and sections of
               --------
this Agreement are for convenience of reference only and shall not be deemed a
part of this Agreement or considered in construing the provisions thereof.

         15.6  SEVERABILITY. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is
               ------------
prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction,
be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without
invalidating the remaining terms and provisions thereof or affecting the
validity or enforceability of such provision in any other jurisdiction, and if
any term or provision of this Agreement is held by any court of competent
jurisdiction to be void, voidable, invalid or unenforceable in any given
circumstance or situation, then all other terms and provisions, being severable,
shall remain in full force and effect in such circumstance or situation and the
term or provision shall remain valid and in effect in any other circumstances or
situation, except if such omitted term or provision would so materially
adversely impact the economic benefits of the transaction to a Party as
contemplated by this Agreement so as to render inadvisable the consummation of
the Merger.

               ------------
to refer to the feminine and neuter genders and the use of singular references

               ---------------------
Agreement prior to the Effective Date, each Party shall return to the other,

papers and other materials obtained from the other Party in connection with the
transactions contemplated in this Agreement and shall keep such information
confidential, not disclose such information to any other person or entity, and
not use such information in connection with its business.

         15.9  EQUITABLE REMEDIES. The parties hereto agree that, in the event
               ------------------
of a breach of this Agreement by either Party, the other Party may be without an
adequate remedy at law owing to the unique nature of the contemplated
transactions. In recognition thereof, in addition to (and not in lieu of) any
remedies at law that may be available to the non-breaching Party, the
non-breaching Party shall be entitled to obtain equitable relief, including the
remedies of specific performance and injunction, in the event of a breach of
this Agreement by the other Party, and no attempt on the part of the
non-breaching Party to obtain such equitable relief shall be deemed to



                                       47

<PAGE> 53


constitute an election of remedies by the non-breaching Party that would
preclude the non-breaching Party from obtaining any remedies at law to which it
would otherwise be entitled.

         15.10  ATTORNEYS' FEES. If any Party hereto shall bring an action at
                ---------------
law or in equity to enforce its rights under this Agreement (including an action
based upon a misrepresentation or the breach of any warranty, covenant,
agreement or obligation contained herein), the prevailing Party in such action

                ---------
exercising any right, power or remedy upon any breach or Default of any other
Party shall impair any such rights, powers or remedies of the Party not in
breach or Default, nor shall it be construed to be a wavier of any such right,
power or remedy, or an acquiescence in any similar breach or Default; nor shall
any waiver of any single breach or Default be deemed a waiver of any other
breach or default theretofore or thereafter occurring. Any waiver, permit,
consent or approval of any kind or character on the part of any Party of any
provisions of this Agreement must be in writing and be executed by the Parties
to this Agreement and shall be effective only to the extent specifically set
forth in such writing.

         15.12   REMEDIES CUMULATIVE.  All remedies provided in this Agreement,
                 -------------------
by law or otherwise, shall be cumulative and not alternative.

         15.13   ENTIRE CONTRACT.   This Agreement, the Confidentiality

considered and at every adjournment thereof, provided that the foregoing is
subject to Shareholder's receipt of the Proxy Statement, as defined in the
Merger Agreement.

         2.  Voting Trusts. Shareholder agrees that Shareholder will not, nor
             -------------
will Shareholder permit any entity directly or indirectly controlled by him or
her, to place any Shares in a voting trust or subject the Shares to any

         5. Specific Performance and Remedies. Shareholder acknowledges that it
            ---------------------------------
will be impossible to measure in money the damages to BancGroup if Shareholder
fails to comply with the obligations imposed by this Agreement and that, in the
event of any such failure, BancGroup will not have an adequate remedy at law or
in damages. Accordingly, Shareholder agrees that injunctive relief or other
equitable remedy, in addition to remedies at law or in damages, is the
appropriate remedy for any such failure and will not oppose the granting of such
relief on the basis that BancGroup has an adequate remedy at law. In addition to
all other rights or remedies which BancGroup may have against Shareholder in the
event of a default in Shareholder's performance of Shareholder's obligations
under this Agreement, Shareholder shall be liable to BancGroup for all
reasonable litigation costs and attorneys' fees incurred by BancGroup in
connection with the enforcement of any of its rights or remedies against
Shareholder. In addition, after discussing the matter with Shareholder,
BancGroup shall have the right to inform any third party that BancGroup
reasonably believes to be, or to be contemplating, participating with
Shareholder or receiving from Shareholder assistance in violation of this
Agreement, of the terms of this Agreement and of the rights of BancGroup
hereunder, and that participation by any such persons with Shareholder in
activities in violation of this Agreement with BancGroup set forth in this
Agreement may give rise to claims by BancGroup against such third party.

         6.  Term of Agreement; Termination. The term of this Agreement shall
             ------------------------------
commence on the date hereof and such term and this Agreement shall terminate
upon the earlier to occur of (i) the Effective Time of the Merger, and (ii) the
date on which the Merger Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms.
Such termination shall not affect the provisions of Sections 3 and 4, which
shall continue according to their terms and the enforceability of which under
the other provisions of this Agreement shall also continue. Termination shall
not relieve any party from liability for any breach of this Agreement prior to
such termination.

         7. Future Payments. Except for benefits set forth on Schedule A to this
            ---------------
Agreement, Shareholder acknowledges that after the Effective Date, no
remuneration or other benefit of any kind will be paid to Shareholder, except in
accordance with BancGroup's established policies and procedures.

         8.  Entire Agreement. This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements,
             ----------------
written or oral, among the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter
hereof and contains the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof. This Agreement may not be amended, supplemented or
modified, and no provisions hereof may be modified or waived, except by an
instrument in writing signed by each party hereto. No waiver of any provisions
hereof by either party shall be deemed a continuing waiver of any provision
hereof by such party.

         9.  Notices. All notices, requests, claims, demands or other
             -------
communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed given when

                       (OPINION OF COUNSEL FOR BANCGROUP)

                                     [DATE]

FFLC Bancorp, Inc.

----------------------
----------------------
----------------------

Ladies and Gentlemen:

         We have acted as counsel to The Colonial BancGroup, Inc. ("BancGroup"),
a Delaware corporation, in connection with the merger of FFLC Bancorp, Inc.
("Acquired Corporation"), a Delaware corporation, with and into BancGroup,
pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Agreement") dated as of
____________________, by and between BancGroup and Acquired Corporation. We have
also acted as counsel to BancGroup in connection with the preparation and filing
with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "1933 Act"), of a Registration Statement
on Form S-4, Registration No. 333-_______ (the "Registration Statement"), and
other related matters. Unless otherwise defined herein, capitalized terms in
this opinion are used as defined in the Agreement.

         We deliver this opinion pursuant to section 9.4 of the Agreement. In
connection therewith, we have examined originals or copies of the following
documents:

         1.       A certified copy, such certificate dated as of _____________,
                  of the restated certificate of incorporation of BancGroup
                  filed with the Delaware Secretary of State on February 21,
                  1995, as amended on April 16, 1997 and filed on April 16,
                  1997, and as amended on May 15, 1998 and filed on May 19,
                  1998;

         2.       Bylaws of BancGroup, dated January 18, 1995;

         3.       Certificate of Good Standing for BancGroup issued by the
                  Secretary of State of Delaware, dated as of _______________;

         4.       Certificate of Existence of Colonial Bank, N.A. from the
                  Alabama Secretary of State, dated as of _____________;

         5.       Certificate of Good Standing of Colonial Bank, N.A. from the
                  Alabama Department of Revenue, dated as of _____________;

<PAGE> 61



         6.       Officers' Certificate of BancGroup dated _____________;

         7.       The Agreement; and

         8.       The Registration Statement.

         We have further reviewed such other papers, documents, certificates and
proceedings, and such laws, statutes, ordinances, codes, orders, decrees,
regulations and rules, as we have deemed necessary as a basis for the opinions
set forth herein.

         As to matters of fact, we have relied on the statements,
representations and warranties of the officers of BancGroup contained in the
Agreement and the Officers' Certificate dated _________________. We have not
independently verified the accuracy and completeness of the information
contained therein, although we have no knowledge of any inaccuracies in or
incompleteness of such information.

         In reaching the opinions set forth below, we have assumed, and to our
knowledge there are no facts inconsistent with, the following:

         1. (a) the genuineness of all signatures, (b) the authenticity of all
documents submitted to us as originals, (c) the conformity to the original
documents of documents submitted to us as certified or photostatic copies, (d)
the legal capacity of all natural persons, and (e) as to documents executed by
parties other than BancGroup: (i) such parties' power to enter into and perform
their obligations under such documents, and (ii) that such documents have been
duly authorized, executed and delivered by, and are binding upon and enforceable
against, such parties; and

         2. the accuracy and correctness of the indexes and filing systems
maintained at the public offices at which we have searched or inquired, and we
have assumed the authority of the person or persons who have executed any such
documents on behalf of any state or other entity.

         Although some members and associates of this firm are licensed to
practice law in other jurisdictions, we do not purport to be experts in, or to
express any opinion herein concerning, any law other than the law of the State
of Alabama, the general corporate law of the State of Delaware, and the law of
the United States of America. This opinion is limited to the matters expressly
set forth herein, and no opinion is implied or may be inferred beyond the
matters expressly stated herein.

         Upon the basis of the foregoing and subject to the limitations,
qualifications and assumptions herein contained, we are of the opinion that:




                                       56
<PAGE> 62


         (i) Based solely upon the certificate issued by the Secretary of State
thereof, BancGroup is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in
good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware with full corporate power
and authority to carry on its business as now conducted, and Colonial Bank,
N.A., based solely upon certificates issued by the Secretary of State and the
Department of Revenue of Alabama, is duly incorporated, validly existing and in
good standing under the laws of the State of Alabama with full power and
authority to carry on its business as now conducted;

         (ii) The Agreement has been duly authorized, approved and adopted by
all requisite corporate action of the board of directors of BancGroup, this
being the only corporate authorization required under BancGroup's restated
certificate of incorporation, bylaws and applicable law, has been duly executed
and delivered by BancGroup, and constitutes a valid and legally binding
agreement of BancGroup enforceable in accordance with its terms except as such
enforceability may be limited by or subject to any bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws now or hereafter in effect
relating to creditors' rights and except that the remedies of specific
performance, injunction and other forms of equitable relief are subject to
certain tests of equity jurisdiction, equitable defenses and the discretion of
the court before which any proceeding therefor may be brought;

         (iii) The execution, delivery and performance by BancGroup of the
Agreement will not violate the restated certificate of incorporation or bylaws
of BancGroup and, to the best of our knowledge but without independent
verification, will not violate, result in a breach of, or constitute a default
under any material lease, loan agreement, indenture, mortgage, deed of trust or
other material agreement or instrument known to us to which BancGroup is a
party;

         (iv) All consents, approvals, authorizations or orders required to be
obtained by BancGroup for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
the Agreement have been obtained;

         (v) The shares of BancGroup Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the
Agreement are duly authorized and will be when so issued, validly issued and
outstanding, fully paid and nonassessable;

         (vi) The authorized, issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of
BancGroup are as stated in the Agreement, all of which are validly issued, fully
paid and nonassessable and not issued in violation of the preemptive rights of
any shareholder;

         (vii) To our knowledge, there is no Litigation pending or currently
threatened against BancGroup which questions the validity of the Agreement or
the right of BancGroup to enter into the Agreement, or to consummate the
transactions contemplated thereby, or which might result, either individually or
in the aggregate, in any changes in the assets, condition, affairs or prospects
of BancGroup which are materially adverse to BancGroup, financially or
otherwise, or any change in the current equity ownership of BancGroup. To our
knowledge, BancGroup is not a party to nor is BancGroup subject to the
provisions of any currently effective Order of any court or government agency or
instrumentality which would materially affect the Agreement or the Merger.


                                       57

<PAGE> 63


         (viii) To our knowledge, BancGroup is in compliance with all applicable
federal, state, municipal and other political subdivision or governmental agency
statutes, ordinances and regulations in every applicable jurisdiction, in
respect of the ownership of its properties and the conduct of its business,
including, without limitation, antitrust and fair trade practice laws, the
violation of which would materially affect the Agreement or the Merger. To our
knowledge, there are no investigations, audits or other proceedings by any
federal, state or municipal governmental agency pending or threatened against
BancGroup which would materially affect the Agreement or the Merger.

         (ix) To our knowledge, BancGroup is not in default under any term or
condition of any instrument evidencing, creating or securing any material
indebtedness of BancGroup and there has been no default in any material
obligation to be performed by BancGroup under any other material contract,
lease, agreement, commitment or undertaking to which it is a party or by which
it or its assets or properties are bound; nor has BancGroup waived any material
right under any such contract, lease, agreement, commitment or undertaking.

         (x) The Registration Statement has become effective and, to our
knowledge, no stop order suspending its effectiveness has been issued nor have
any proceedings for that purpose been instituted; and

         (xi) The Registration Statement complies as to form in all material
respects with the requirements of the 1933 Act and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder. We do not know of any contracts or other documents of a
character required to be filed as an exhibit to the Registration Statement, or
required to be incorporated by reference into the Proxy Statement or required to
be described in the Registration Statement or Proxy Statement which have not
been filed or incorporated by reference or described as required. While we have
made no independent investigation or verification of factual information
relating to BancGroup set forth in the Registration Statement, during the course
of our representation of BancGroup, nothing has come to our attention to
indicate that the Proxy Statement delivered to Acquired Corporation's
shareholders, or any amendments or revisions thereto so delivered, as of the
date thereof, contained or incorporated by reference any untrue statement of a
material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in light of
the circumstances under which they were made (it being understood that we do not
hereby express an opinion as to the financial statements, the notes thereto or
other financial or statistical data contained or incorporated by reference in
such Registration Statement or as to any information concerning or provided by
Acquired Corporation for inclusion in the Registration Statement).

         The foregoing opinions are subject to the following qualifications and
exceptions:

                  A. We express no opinion as to the enforceability of remedies
and obligations of the Agreement, as such rights and remedies may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, arrangement, moratorium, fraudulent


                                       58


<PAGE> 64


conveyance and other similar laws relating to or affecting the rights of
creditors. We advise you that the enforceability of the Agreement may be limited
by (i) certain equitable, legal or statutory principles affecting the
enforcement of contractual rights generally, regardless of whether such
enforcement is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law, including,
without limitation, concepts of notice, materiality, impairment of security,
reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing, jurisdiction, service of process,
venue and applicable statutes of limitations and (ii) judicial discretion or
statutory limitations with respect to the availability of equitable remedies or
defenses, the calculation of damages and the entitlement to attorneys' fees and
other costs.

                  B. Whenever our opinion is qualified by the phrase "to our
knowledge," it is intended to indicate the current and actual (as opposed to
imputed) knowledge of Hugh C. Nickson, III, and Michael A. White, the attorneys
in our office most likely to have actual personal knowledge of the matters
discussed herein.

         The opinions rendered herein are as of the date hereof. We assume no
obligation, and specifically disclaim any responsibility, to update or
supplement these opinions to reflect any facts which hereafter may come to our
attention or any changes in facts or law subsequent to the date hereof.

         These opinions have been furnished to you at your request, and we
consider them to be a confidential communication which may not be furnished,
reproduced, distributed, or disclosed to anyone without our prior written
consent. These opinions are rendered solely for your information and assistance
in connection with the transactions contemplated in the Agreement. They may not
be relied upon by any other person or for any other purpose without our prior
written consent.

                                     Sincerely,

                                     MILLER, HAMILTON, SNIDER & ODOM, L.L.C.

                  (OPINION OF COUNSEL FOR ACQUIRED CORPORATION)

                              _______________, 2003

The Colonial BancGroup, Inc.
One Commerce Street, Suite 800
Montgomery, AL  36104

Gentlemen:

         We have acted as counsel to FFLC Bancorp, Inc. ("Acquired
Corporation"), a Delaware corporation, in connection with the transactions
contemplated by that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Agreement")
dated as of __________, 2005, by and between Acquired Corporation and The
Colonial BancGroup, Inc. ("BancGroup"). We render this opinion pursuant to
section 10.4 of the Agreement. Capitalized terms not otherwise defined in this
letter have the definitions set forth in the Agreement.

         In connection with our representation of Acquired Corporation and in
order to render this opinion pursuant to section 10.4 of the Agreement, we have
examined and relied upon the accuracy of original, certified, conformed or
photographic copies of such records, agreements, instruments, documents, and
certificates of officers and employees of Acquired Corporation and of other
persons, and such questions of law, as we deemed necessary or appropriate. In
all such examinations, we have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the
authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals and the conformity to
the original documents of documents submitted to us as certified or photo static
copies. We have relied on certificates issued to us by the secretaries of state
and other appropriate government officials of the various states in which
Acquired Corporation is incorporated or qualified and, except as expressly set
forth in any such documents or hereinafter, we have assumed the authority of the
person or persons who have executed any such documents on behalf of any person

         7. To our knowledge, Acquired Corporation is not in default under any
term or condition of any instrument evidencing, creating or securing any
material indebtedness of Acquired Corporation, and there has been no default in
any material obligation to be performed by Acquired Corporation under any other
material contract, lease, agreement, commitment or undertaking to which it is a
party or by which it or its assets or properties are bound.

         Our opinion concerning the validity, binding effect and enforceability
of the Agreement means that: (a) the Agreement constitutes an effective contract
under applicable law; (b) the Agreement is not invalid in its entirety because
of a specific statutory prohibition or public policy, and is not subject in its
entirety to a contractual defense; and (c) subject to the last sentence of this
paragraph, some remedies are available if Acquired Corporation is in material
default under the Agreement. This opinion does not mean that (a) any particular
remedy is available upon a material default, or (b) every provision of the
Agreement will be upheld or enforced in any circumstance by a court.
Furthermore, the validity, binding effect, and the enforceability of the
Agreement may be limited or otherwise affected by (a) bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance or other similar statutes,
rules and regulations, or other laws affecting the enforcement of creditors
rights and remedies generally, and (b) the unavailability of, or limitation on
the availability of, a particular right or remedy (whether in a proceeding in
equity or at law) because of an equitable principle or a requirement as to
commercial reasonableness, conscientability or good faith.
