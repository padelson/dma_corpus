actually produced, purchased or sold or proceeds of sale, as applicable,
before, or at and after, the Effective Time. After the Closing, each Party
shall be entitled to participate in all joint interest audits and other audits
of Property Costs for which such Party is entirely or in part responsible

from the outcome of any pending or executed exploration,
development, production or abandonment operations solely to the extent such
actions are taken in accordance with Section 6.3 or are not a
material deviation therefrom.

Section 2.3 _Adjustments to Purchase Price_.

from the sale of Hydrocarbons (net of any royalties, overriding royalties or

transportation costs and any Property Taxes not reimbursed to Seller by the
purchaser of production) produced from the Properties from and after
the Effective Time;

  



  

(b) Reduced in accordance with Section 6.6(a), by an amount equal to the
Allocated Value of the Assigned Interest in those Assets excluded under
Section 1.3 resulting from the timely exercise prior to Closing of a

(c) Reduced in accordance with Section 6.6(b), by an amount equal to the
Allocated Value of the Assigned Interest in those Properties not
transferred to Purchaser at Closing due to an unsatisfied Transfer

(d) Subject to Section 7.1(d) and Section 7.3, reduced by (A) the applicable

any affected Property not retained by Purchaser, and (B) the Allocated Value
of any Asset retained by Seller pursuant to Section 7.3;

  



  

(e) Subject to Section 7.2(d) and Section 7.3, reduced by (A) any amounts
pursuant to Section 7.3 regarding Environmental Defects for any affected

(f) Increased by the value of all of Seller's inventories of Hydrocarbons
produced and saved from or attributable to the Assigned Interest in the
Properties that are in storage or existing in pipelines, plants and/or
platforms (including inventory) above the load line or pipeline connection,
as applicable, as of the Effective Time (which value shall be computed using
the applicable contract price as of the Effective Time), less any applicable
severance Taxes, royalties and similar burdens; _provided, however_ , that
the adjustment contemplated by this paragraph shall be only made to the
extent that Seller does not receive and retain the proceeds, or portion
thereof, attributable to the sale of such Hydrocarbons;

  



  

(g) Increased by the amount of all Property Costs attributable to the
ownership and operation of the Assigned Interests that are paid by or
on behalf of Seller and are attributable to the period at or after the
Effective Time, except any Property Costs and other such costs already
deducted in the determination of proceeds in Section 2.3(a) or already
reimbursed to Seller pursuant to Section 6.7(a);

  



    

10

 



    

(h) Reduced by an amount equal to the Suspense Funds (in accordance with

ownership and operation of the Assigned Interests that are paid by or
on behalf of Purchaser and are attributable to the period before the
Effective Time, except any Property Costs and other such costs already
reimbursed to Purchaser pursuant to Section 6.7(a); and

  



  

(j) Reduced or increased by an amount equal to the sum of any downward or
upward adjustment provided for elsewhere in this Agreement or as agreed to in
writing by Seller and Purchaser.

  



  

Subject to Section 11.1, the adjustment described in Section 2.3(a) shall
serve to satisfy Purchaser's entitlement under Section 1.4 to
Hydrocarbon production from or attributable to, and other income, proceeds,
receipts and credits earned with respect to, the Assigned Interest in the
Properties for the period between the Effective Time and the Closing Date. For
the avoidance of doubt, (i) no item taken into account in calculating an
adjustment under this Agreement will be taken into account in calculating any
other adjustment as to result in a Party making or receiving a payment twice
in respect of any such item and (ii) no adjustment to the Purchase Price will
result from the actual or projected changes in production rates, alternate
interpretations of reserves or normal wear and tear on the Assets.

  



  

Section 2.4 _Allocation of Purchase Price_.

  



  

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable following the Closing Date, but in no
case more than one hundred twenty (120) days after Closing, Seller shall
deliver to Purchaser for its review and approval a statement (the "Tax
Allocation Statement"), allocating the Adjusted Purchase Price (plus assumed
liabilities, to the extent properly taken into account under Section 752
or 1060 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") and the
Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder), among the Assigned Interests.
The Tax Allocation Statement shall be prepared by Seller in a manner
consistent with the Allocated Values to the maximum extent permitted by
applicable Law. Purchaser shall provide Seller with any comments to the Tax
Allocation Statement within thirty (30) days after the date of receipt by
Purchaser. If Purchaser does not deliver any written notice of objection to
the Tax Allocation Statement within such 30-day period, the Tax Allocation
Statement shall be final, conclusive and binding on all Parties. If a written
notice of objection is timely delivered to Seller, Seller and Purchaser will
negotiate in good faith for a period of twenty (20) days to resolve such
dispute (the "Tax Allocation Dispute Resolution Period"). If, during the Tax
Allocation Dispute Resolution Period, Seller and Purchaser resolve their
differences in writing as to any disputed amount, such resolution shall be
deemed final and binding with respect to such amount for the purpose of
determining that component of the Tax Allocation Statement. In the event that
Seller and Purchaser do not resolve all of the items disputed in the Tax
Allocation Statement prior to the end of the Tax Allocation Dispute
Resolution Period, all such unresolved disputed items shall be submitted by
Purchaser or Seller to the Independent Expert for resolution in accordance
with the procedures of Section 9.5, _mutatis mutandis._  Any subsequent
adjustments to purchase price for U.S. federal income Tax purposes shall be
allocated in a

  



    

11

 



    

manner consistent with the Tax Allocation Statement as finally determined
hereunder. Seller and Purchaser agree (i) to act in accordance with the Tax
Allocation Statement in the preparation, filing and audit of any Tax Return,
unless otherwise required by Law and (ii) that neither Purchaser or Seller,
nor any of their Affiliates, will take any position that is inconsistent with
the Tax Allocation Statement for any Tax purpose, including but not limited
to, in notices to government authorities, in audit or other Proceedings with
respect to Taxes, except (x) to the extent otherwise required pursuant to a
"determination" within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code (or any
similar provision of applicable state, local or foreign Law) or (y) with the
consent of the other Party; _provided, however,_ that no Party shall be
unreasonably impeded in its ability and discretion to concede, negotiate,
compromise or settle any Tax audit or other Proceeding in connection with the
Tax Allocation Statement. Not later than 30 days prior to the filing of their
respective Internal Revenue Service Forms 8594 relating to this transaction,
each Party shall deliver to the other Party a copy of its Internal Revenue
Service Form 8594. The Parties shall also negotiate in good faith to agree to
an allocation of the K/M Contingent Payment and the Non-K/M Contingent
Payment to particular Assigned Interests in a manner consistent with the
Tax Allocation Statement as finally determined hereunder for purposes of
applying the contingent installment sales provisions under Section 453 of the
Code and the Treasury regulations thereunder. In the event that the Parties
are unable to agree to an allocation of the K/M Contingent Payment and the
Non-K/M Contingent Payment, any disputed items with respect thereto shall be
submitted by Purchaser or Seller to the Independent Expert for resolution in
accordance with the procedures of Section 9.5, _mutatis mutandis_.

  



  

(b) The "Allocated Value" for the Assigned Interest in any Asset equals the
portion of the unadjusted Purchase Price allocated to such Assigned Interest,
increased or decreased as described in Section 2.3. Concurrent with the
execution of this Agreement, Purchaser shall deliver to Seller for its review
and, subject to the Parties' mutual agreement, approval of Schedule 2.4
reflecting the Allocated Values for the Assigned Interest. Purchaser and
Seller agree to act in accordance with Schedule 2.4 in connection with notice
to holders of Preference Rights as provided for in Section 6.6(a), and in
other documents or notices provided for elsewhere in this Agreement. Any
adjustments to the Purchase Price (including adjustments under Section 2.3(b)
shall, to the extent attributable to a particular Assigned Interest, be
applied to that Assigned Interest with other adjustments applied on a pro
rata basis in proportion to the amounts set forth on Schedule 2.4 for all
Assigned Interests. Purchaser and Seller further agree that, on or before the
Closing Date, they will mutually agree as to the further allocation of the
Allocated Values included in Schedule 2.4 as to the relative portion of those
values attributable to leasehold costs and depreciable equipment;
_provided that_ any such allocation to costs and equipment be disregarded for
all purposes hereunder (including for the avoidance of doubt, with respect to
any Title Defects or Environmental Defects alleged hereunder) other than this
Section 2.4(b). After Seller and Purchaser have agreed on the Allocated
Values for the Assigned Interests, Seller will be deemed to have accepted such
Allocated Values for purposes of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, but otherwise makes no representation or warranty as to
the accuracy of such values.

  



  

Section 2.5 _FIRPTA_. To the extent Seller has not delivered the certificates
set forth in Section 9.2(i) at Closing, Purchaser shall be entitled to deduct
and withhold from any proceeds

  



    

12

 



    

payable to Seller at or after Closing such amounts that are required to be
deducted and withheld under Section 1445 of the Code or Section 1446(f) of the
Code. Any amounts that are so deducted and withheld shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to Seller.

  



  

 _Article 3 
 CASUALTY OR CONDEMNATION LOSS_

  



  

Section 3.1 _Casualty or Condemnation Loss_.

  



  

If, after the date of this Agreement but prior to the Closing Date, any
portion of the Assets is destroyed by fire or other casualty or is taken
in condemnation or under right of eminent domain (such loss, for the
avoidance of doubt, not to be the result of normal wear and tear; mechanical
failure; gradual structural deterioration of materials, equipment or
infrastructure; wellbore downhole failure; or normal production decline
mechanism, including wellbore failures arising or occurring during drilling or
completion, or reworking or re-completion or production operations, junked or
lost holes or wellbores, sidetracking or deviating a well and production
profile or reservoir changes), and the loss as a result of such individual
casualty or taking equals or exceeds Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000) net to
the Assigned Interests in the relevant Asset or portion thereof, then Seller
shall be required to repair the affected Asset or portion thereof and if
Seller repairs such casualty loss or condemnation prior to Closing, then there
shall be no adjustment to the Purchase Price; _provided however_ that if
Seller does not repair such casualty loss or condemnation prior to
Closing, then the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the lesser of the agreed
cost to repair the affected Asset or the Allocated Value of the affected
Asset. If such casualty loss or condemnation is less than Five Million Dollars
($5,000,000) net to the Assigned Interest in the affected Asset or portion
thereof, then, to the extent any such casualty loss or condemnation is not
repaired by Seller prior to Closing, Seller shall (i) pay to Purchaser all
sums paid to Seller by third parties by reason of the destruction or
taking of such Asset, including under any policy or agreement of insurance or
indemnity, and (ii) assign, transfer and set over unto Purchaser all of
Seller's rights in and to any insurance or indemnity claims, causes of action,
unpaid proceeds or similar rights from third parties, to the extent arising
out of such destruction or taking (in the case of clauses (i) and (ii), in the
aggregate only up to the Allocated Value thereof); _provided, further,_ that
no such loss shall affect Purchaser's obligations to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby.

24

neither Seller nor Purchaser, nor any of their respective Affiliates, shall
be required to divest itself or themselves from any business operations,
assets or properties, including without limitation, any of the Assets, in
order to obtain any clearance, approval or waiver under the HSR Act or any

and (ii) the obligations of each Party under this Section 6.1 shall not apply
to any (A) governmental approvals (which are addressed in Section 6.9), (B)

Section 6.2 _Operatorship_.

and Purchaser acknowledges that the transfer of operatorship to any Assets

Section 6.3 _Operation of Business_.

  



  

(a) Except as set forth on Schedule 6.3, and except as required pursuant to
this Agreement, the Leases or the Contracts or as otherwise consented to in
writing by Purchaser, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned, during the period between the Execution Date and the
Closing Date (the "Interim Period"), Seller:

  



  

(i) shall (A) maintain all Assets and maintain and operate the Seller

the applicable operating agreement, including maintaining Seller's rights in
and to the Leases and Material Contracts in full force and effect with
respect to all respective depths of the Leases; and (B) except with respect to
the activities expressly set forth on Schedule 6.3(a), obtain Purchaser's
approval prior to consenting to any future capital expenditures and
proposed contracts and agreements relating to the Assets that involve
individual commitments of ($2,000,000.00) or more (net to the
Assigned Interests); _provided_ , that if Purchaser does not respond in
writing to such request for approval within ten (10) Business Days of its
receipt of such request (or within such lesser time as is required under the
terms of any applicable third-party agreement and stated in Seller's request
for approval, but in no event less than

  



    

25

 



    

twenty-four (24) hours after Purchaser's receipt), Purchaser shall be deemed
to have rejected such request;

  



  

(ii) subject to Section 2.3(g), shall timely pay all Property Costs and
other costs, expenses and payments incurred with respect to the
Assets (including those incurred by Seller in connection with maintaining the
Leases and Contracts) in the ordinary course of business;

  



  

(iii) shall give prompt notice to Purchaser of (A) any written notice
received by Seller or any of its Affiliates of any material (i) damage or

the Assets; or (C) any notice to Seller or any of its Affiliates of an
emergency with respect to the Assets and any related emergency operation; and

  



  

(iv) shall not, to the extent within the control of Seller, (A) transfer,
farmout, sell, pledge, hypothecate, encumber (other than
Permitted Encumbrances) or otherwise dispose of any Asset, other than sales
of current production or products in the ordinary course of business and
dispositions in the ordinary course of business of any item of personal
property or equipment that is unnecessary for operations or that is promptly

or other similar right to purchase any Assigned Interests; (C) enter into,
terminate or amend any Material Contract relating to the Assigned Interests,
other than in the ordinary course of business; (D) enter into a Contract that

contemplated hereby; or (F) agree or commit to do any of the foregoing.

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the face of a force majeure event or a
serious risk to life, property, or the environment, Seller may take,
or consent to, such action as a prudent operator, or non-operator, as the
case may be, would take without obtaining Purchaser's prior consent.

  



  

(c) Purchaser acknowledges that Seller owns an undivided interest in certain
of the Assets that Seller does not operate, and Purchaser agrees that the
acts or omissions of the operator and the other working interest owners who
are not affiliated with Seller shall not constitute a violation of the
provisions of this Article 6 nor shall any action required by a vote of
working interest owners constitute such a violation so long as Seller has
voted its interest in a manner consistent with the provisions of this Article
6.

  



  

(d) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, during the
Interim Period, Seller shall not enter into any agreement (including
any purchase order or

  



    

26

 



    

change order in excess of Two Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($250,000)
individually and Two Million Dollars ($2,000,000) in the aggregate) make any
election, amend, waive or modify any existing agreement (including the HHI
Contract), in each case, related to the King's Quay FPS without the prior
written consent of Purchaser, including entering into any financing or
investing arrangements (other than financing or investment arrangements that
would not be binding on the Assets or Purchaser after Closing). Purchaser
shall have the right to (i) directly participate in negotiations related to
the King's Quay FPS and any financing or investing arrangements
related thereto and (ii) participate and observe any activities under the HHI
Contract.

  



  

Section 6.4 _Indemnity Regarding Access_.

  



  

Seller will provide Purchaser, and its agents, with access to the Seller
Operated Assets subject to the prior execution by such parties of
Seller's standard access or boarding agreement and shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to arrange for Purchaser's, and its agent's, access to the
Assets not operated by Seller. Purchaser, on behalf of itself and the
Purchaser Indemnitees, hereby releases and agrees to indemnify, defend and
hold harmless Seller Indemnitees and the other owners of interests in the
Assets from and against any and all claims, liabilities, losses, costs and
expenses (including court costs, expert fees and reasonable attorneys' and
engineers' fees) attributable to personal injuries, death, or property damage,
arising out of or relating to any and all access to the Assets and the
Records (and other related information) by the Purchaser Indemnitees or their
agents, and any related activities by Purchaser Indemnitees or their agents
prior to Closing, EVEN IF CAUSED IN WHOLE OR IN PART BY THE
NEGLIGENCE (WHETHER SOLE, JOINT OR CONCURRENT), STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER
LEGAL FAULT OF ANY INDEMNIFIED PERSON EXCLUDING, HOWEVER, ANY
CLAIMS, LIABILITIES, LOSSES, COSTS OR EXPENSES CAUSED BY THE GROSS NEGLIGENCE
OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OF ANY INDEMNIFIED PERSON.

  



  

Section 6.5 _Public Announcements_.

  



  

Except as may be required by applicable Law or as otherwise contemplated
under this Agreement, neither Purchaser, on the one hand, nor Seller, on the
other, shall issue any press release or otherwise make any statement to the
public generally with respect to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby without the prior written approval of the
other Party. Any such press release or statement required by applicable Law
shall only be made after reasonable notice to the other Party.

  



  

Section 6.6 _Preferential Rights to Purchase and Consents_.

  



  

(a) Following the execution of this Agreement by the Parties, Seller shall
send to each third party holding a preferential right to purchase or acquire
any Asset or any interest therein as a result of or in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (a "Preference Right"), a notice
offering to sell to such holders, in accordance with the provisions of
the agreement applicable to such Preference Right, the Asset covered by such
Preference Right on substantially the same terms hereof and for the value
allocated by Purchaser to such Asset on Schedule 2.4. If a third party who has
been offered an interest in an Asset pursuant to a Preference Right makes a
timely election prior to Closing

  



    

27

 



    

to purchase all or part of such Asset pursuant to the aforesaid offer and
Seller receives written notice of such election at least five (5) Business
Days prior to the Closing Date, the Asset or part thereof so affected will be
eliminated from the Assets and (i) if all of such Asset is affected by the
Preference Right, then the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the value of
such Asset set forth on Schedule 2.4, or (ii) if only an interest in such
Asset is affected by the Preference Right, then the Purchase Price shall be
reduced by the value of such interest determined in accordance with the
method set forth in Section 7.1 as if such interest failed on account of a
Title Defect. If such third party has not made its election prior to Closing
and the time to make such election has not yet expired, the transfer of the
Asset or interest therein affected shall be conditioned upon the waiver of, or
the expiration of, the time for election and the affected Asset or interest
therein, together with the Allocated Value attributable thereto, shall be
made the subject of an escrow agreement in the manner provided for in Sections
7.3 and 7.4 but shall not be considered a Title Defect for the purposes of
this Agreement. If following the Closing the third party timely elects to
purchase such Asset or interest therein in accordance with its Preference
Right, Seller shall convey such Asset or interest therein to such third party
and shall retain the proceeds from such sale, the Allocated Value
attributable to such Assets held in escrow, together with any accrued
interest, shall be released to Purchaser and thereafter such Assets shall be
deemed to be an Excluded Asset for purposes of this Agreement. If, however,
following the Closing the third party elects to waive its right to purchase,
or the time to make such election expires, within ten (10) Business Days
thereafter, Seller shall convey such Asset, or interest therein, to Purchaser
in the same manner as if such conveyance had been made at Closing, and the
Allocated Value attributable to such Asset or interest therein held
in escrow, together with any accrued interest, shall be released to Seller.

  



  

(b) Following the execution of this Agreement by the Parties, Seller will
notify third parties that have rights to require a consent to the transfer of
an Asset (a "Transfer Requirement") in order to comply with or attempt to
obtain waivers of such Transfer Requirements, except with respect to any
Transfer Requirements deemed a Permitted Encumbrance in clause (D) of the
definition thereof. If any Transfer Requirement that would (i) cause the
assignment to Purchaser of the Assets affected thereby to be void or
nullified, (ii) cause the termination of any Lease or Contract, or (iii)
result in liquidated damages is not obtained, complied with or
otherwise satisfied prior to the Closing Date, such Transfer Requirement
shall be deemed a Post-Closing Defect and, accordingly, subject to the
provisions of Section 7.3 and of Section 7.4. The Adjusted Purchase Price
shall be reduced in accordance with Section 2.3(c) for any Transfer
Requirement deemed a Post-Closing Defect and paid into the Defects Escrow
Account provided for in Section 7.3 with respect to Post-Closing Defects, and
the Asset subject to the Transfer Requirement will not be transferred to
Purchaser at the Closing. The amount of such reduction to the Adjusted
Purchase Price shall be treated in the same manner and subject to the same
escrow provisions as expressly set forth in Section 7.3 for a Post-Closing
Defect. If, however, the Transfer Requirement relates merely to incidental
rights and privileges such as, without limitation, rights-of-way, easements,
inter-connect agreements, facility usage agreements and service agreements,
Purchaser and Seller may mutually agree that Seller shall transfer the
affected Asset at Closing and Seller shall thereafter indemnify and hold
Purchaser harmless from any claims caused by, arising out of or
resulting from a failure to secure such Transfer Requirement. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Section

  



    

28

 



    

6.6(b), if the Transfer Requirement pertains to a Contract and Purchaser is
assigned the Property to which the Contract relates, but the Contract is not
transferred to Purchaser due to the unwaived Transfer Requirement, Seller
shall continue after Closing to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
the applicable consent so that Seller's right, title, and interest in such
Contract can be transferred to Purchaser upon the receipt of such consent.
Seller may proceed to secure such Transfer Requirements post-Closing and be
released early from indemnification to the extent of the particular agreement
as to which such Transfer Requirement was secured.

  



  

Section 6.7 _Tax Matters_.

  



  

(a) Subject to the provisions of Section 12.4, Seller shall be responsible
for all ad valorem, real property, personal property, severance, production,
sales, use and similar Taxes based upon or measured by the ownership or
operation of the Assigned Interests or the production of Hydrocarbons or
receipt of proceeds therefrom ("Property Taxes") that are attributable to
any period of time prior to the Effective Time. Purchaser shall be
responsible for all Property Taxes that are attributable to any period of
time at and after the Effective Time. Regardless of which Party is
responsible, Seller shall handle payment to the appropriate Governmental Body
of all Property Taxes which are required to be paid prior to Closing (and
shall file all Tax Returns with respect to such Property Taxes), and
Purchaser shall handle payment to the appropriate Governmental Body of all
Property Taxes which are required to be paid on or after Closing (and shall
file all Tax Returns with respect to such Property Taxes). Except to the
extent taken into account pursuant to Section 2.3 or Section 9.5, each Party
shall reimburse the other Party within 10 days after request therefor for the
payment of any Property Taxes for which such Party is responsible pursuant to
this Section and that the other Party has paid. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, this Section 6.7(a) shall not apply to income, franchise,
corporate, business and occupation, business license or similar Taxes, or Tax
Returns therefor, which shall be borne, paid and filed by the Party
responsible for such Taxes under applicable Law. If requested by Purchaser,
Seller will assist Purchaser with preparation of all Property Tax Returns due
on or before thirty (30) days after Closing (including any extensions
requested).

  



  

(b) If Seller or Purchaser (or an Affiliate of Seller or Purchaser) receives
a refund of any Property Taxes (whether by payment, credit, offset or
otherwise, with any interest thereon) covered by Section 6.7(a) that are paid
by and required to be borne by the other Party, the Party that received (or
whose Affiliate that received) such refund shall promptly (but no later than
thirty (30) days after receipt) remit payment to such other Party of an
amount equal to the refund amount, including all relevant documentation. Each
Party shall cooperate with the other and its Affiliates in order to take all
commercially reasonable steps necessary to claim any refund to which it is
entitled. Purchaser agrees to notify Seller within ten (10) days following the
discovery of a right to claim any refund to which Seller is entitled and upon
receipt of any such refund. Except to the extent required by applicable
Laws, Purchaser shall not amend and shall not permit its Affiliates to amend
any Tax Return with respect to Taxes for which Seller is responsible under
this Section 6.7 or for which Seller may be liable to indemnify Purchaser
under Section 11.2.

  



    

29

 



    

(c) Each Party shall provide the other Party with reasonable access to all
relevant documents, data and other information (other than that which is
subject to an attorney-client privilege) which may be required by the other
Party for the purpose of preparing Tax Returns, filing refund claims and
responding to any audit by any taxing authority. Each Party shall cooperate,
at the requesting Party's expense, with all reasonable requests of the other
Party made in connection with contesting the imposition of Property Taxes.
Except where disclosure is required by applicable Law, any information
obtained by a Party pursuant to this Section 6.7(c) shall be
kept confidential by such Party, except to the extent disclosure is required
in connection with the filing of any Tax Returns or claims for refund or in
connection with the conduct of an audit, or other Proceedings in response to
an audit, by a taxing authority.

  



  

(d) Purchaser agrees to cooperate with Seller so that Seller's transfer of
the Assets to Purchaser shall, at Seller's election, be accomplished in a
manner enabling the transfer of all or part of the Assets to qualify as a part
of a like-kind exchange of property by Seller within the meaning of Section
1031 of the Code; _provided_ that in no event shall the purchase of the Assets
be contingent or otherwise subject to the consummation of such a like-kind
exchange or shall such like-kind exchange extend, delay, or otherwise affect,
impede, or interfere with the Closing. If Seller so elects, Purchaser shall
reasonably cooperate with Seller to effect such like-kind exchange, which
cooperation shall include taking such actions as Seller reasonably requests in
order to pay the Purchase Price in a manner which enables such transfer to
qualify as part of a like-kind exchange of property within the meaning of
Section 1031 of the Code, and Purchaser agrees that Seller may assign its
rights (but not its obligations) under this Agreement to a "qualified
intermediary" (as that term is defined in Section 1.1031(k)-1(g)(4)(iii) of
the United States Treasury Regulations) or an "exchange accommodation
titleholder" (as that term is defined in Rev. Proc. 2000-37, 2000-2 C.B.
308), to qualify the transfer of the Purchase Price as a part of a like-kind
exchange of property within the meaning of Section 1031 of the Code. Seller
shall be obligated to pay all additional costs or expenses associated with any
such like-kind exchange.

  



  

(e) Seller shall prior to the Closing request for the other members and the
applicable governing body or governing members of each of DH Lateral and DH
FPS, and Seller shall provide any necessary Seller approvals or consents, to
cause (i) each of DH Lateral and DH FPS to make an election under Section 754
of the Code for the Tax period of each of DH Lateral or DH FPS, as applicable,
that includes the Closing Date, and (ii) all items of income, gain, loss, or
deduction of any of the DH Lateral or DH FPS attributable to the Assigned
Interests for the Tax period of each of DH Lateral or DH FPS, as applicable,
that includes the Closing Date to be allocated based on the interim closing
method as of and including the Closing Date pursuant to Section 706 of the
Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder and not be based on
a proration of such items for the entire Tax period; _provided, however_ ,
that exemptions, allowances or deductions that are calculated on an annual
basis, such as the deduction for depreciation, shall be apportioned on a
daily basis to the extent permitted under Section 706 of the Code and the
Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder.

Section 6.8 _Change of Name_.

  



  

(a) Unless otherwise authorized by Seller in writing, as promptly as
practicable, but in any case within sixty (60) days after Purchaser
receives affirmative approval from BOEM of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, Purchaser shall eliminate the name "LLOG Exploration", "LLOG
Bluewater" and any variants thereof from the Assets acquired pursuant to this
Agreement and, except with respect to such grace period for eliminating
existing usage, shall have no right to use any logos, trademarks or
trade names belonging to Seller or any of its Affiliates.

  



  

(b) Seller reserves a right of access to the Assets to remove its signs and
name from all Assets, or to confirm that Purchaser has done so, and Purchaser
agrees to reimburse Seller promptly for any reasonable and documented third
party costs incurred by Seller as a result of Purchaser's failure to comply
with the preceding paragraph. With respect to any Assets that Purchaser
operates after the Closing, Purchaser shall promptly install signs complying
with applicable governmental regulations

  



  

Section 6.9 _Governmental Body Approval_.

  



  

(a) With respect to any Seller Operated Asset situated in the federal waters
of the Outer Continental Shelf in which Purchaser is able to succeed Seller
as the designated operator, Purchaser, as soon as possible after the Closing
Date, shall file with BOEM or BSEE, as applicable, for approval all forms or
other documents as may be required in connection with this Agreement,
including any necessary Designation of Operator Forms (Form BOEM-1123), and
any other forms or filings required by BSEE to name a successor operator,
and diligently pursue BOEM's approval of such change of operatorship. With
respect to such Seller Operated Assets, the filing for approval of the
aforementioned Designation of Operator Form 1123 shall precede the filing with
BOEM or BSEE for approval of any Assignments of Record Title Interest (BOEM
Form 150) or Assignments of Operating Rights (BOEM 151), or Assignments of
Federal OCS Pipeline Right-of-Way Grant (BSEE Form 149), as applicable, in
order to avoid any delay in BOEM's or BSEE's approval of the change of
operatorship. With respect to the remaining Assets situated in the federal
waters of the Outer Continental Shelf, Purchaser, as soon as possible after
the Closing Date, shall file with BOEM or BSEE, as applicable, for approval of
any Assignments of Record Title Interest (BOEM Form 150), Assignment of
Operating Rights (BOEM Form 151), and Assignment of Federal OCS
Pipeline Right-of-Way Grant (BSEE Form 149), and associated forms, as
necessary to obtain approval of such transfers.

  



  

(b) In furtherance of the foregoing, promptly after the Closing Date,
Purchaser shall actively pursue BOEM or BSEE approval, as applicable, of the
assignments of the Assigned Interests situated in the federal waters of the
Outer Continental Shelf, and ownership thereof, from Seller to Purchaser.
Purchaser shall take any and all action required by BOEM and BSEE, including
posting of bonds or other security, in order to obtain such approval and
shall provide Seller with evidence of such approval.

  



  

(c) With respect to any Asset that is not situated in the federal waters of
the Outer Continental Shelf, the transfer of which requires approval of a
Governmental Body,

  



    

31

 



    

Purchaser, as soon as possible after the Closing Date, shall file with such
Governmental Body for approval all forms and other documents as may be
required in connection with this Agreement, including, where applicable, any
necessary forms to succeed Seller as operator of such Asset and shall post
such bonds or other security as may be required by such Governmental Body in
connection with such approval request and thereafter provide Seller with
evidence of such approval.

  



  

Section 6.10 _Replacement of Bonds, Letters of Credit and Guarantees_.

  



  

The Parties understand that none of the bonds, letters of credit, guarantees
and other financial assurances (collectively, "Financial Assurances"), if
any, posted by Seller with Governmental Bodies (including BOEM) and relating
to the Assets are to be transferred to Purchaser. On or before Closing,
Purchaser shall obtain, or cause to be obtained in the name of Purchaser, the
corresponding Financial Assurances as necessary to permit the cancellation of
the Financial Assurances posted by Seller to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. On or before Closing, Purchaser may also
provide evidence satisfactory to Seller that such new Financial
Assurances are not necessary as a result of existing Financial Assurances
that Purchaser has previously posted as long as such existing
Financial Assurances are adequate to comply with applicable Law and the
requirements of Governmental Bodies.

  



  

Section 6.11 _Further Assurances_.

  



  

After Closing, Seller and Purchaser each agrees to execute, acknowledge and
deliver all such further documents as are reasonably requested by the
other Party for carrying out the purposes of this Agreement or of any
document delivered pursuant to this Agreement.

  



  

Section 6.12 _Conveyances and Special Warranty_.

  



  

The conveyances of the Assigned Interests to be delivered by Seller to
Purchaser shall be substantially in the form of Exhibit B (the
"Conveyances"). Certain Assigned Interests or specific portions of the
Assigned Interests that are leased from, or require the approval to
transfer by, a Governmental Body are conveyed under the Conveyances and, as
applicable, also are described and covered by Assignments of Record Title
Interest (BOEM Form 150 or BSEE Form 149) and Assignments of Operating Rights
(BOEM Form 151), and other separate assignments made by Seller to Purchaser
on officially approved forms, or forms reasonably acceptable to such entity,
in sufficient multiple originals to satisfy applicable statutory and
regulatory requirements. The interests conveyed by such separate
assignments are the same, and not in addition to, the interests conveyed in
any of such Conveyances. Further, except for the Special Warranty, such
assignments shall be made without warranty of title, whether express, implied
or otherwise and shall be made with all of the exceptions, reservations,
rights, titles, power and privileges set forth herein and in the Conveyances
as fully and only to the extent as though they were set forth in each such
separate assignment. Should the law of a state other than Texas or
Louisiana be deemed applicable under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act,
then any provisions of applicable Law of such state parallel to those
referenced in Sections 11.7, 11.8 and 11.9 shall also be deemed waived by
Purchaser to the maximum extent allowed by applicable Law.

  



    

32

 



    

Section 6.13 _Notice of Certain Events_.

  



  

(a) Each Party shall promptly give to the other Party written notice of: (i)
its receipt of any notice or other communication from any Person alleging
that the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and (ii) to the extent permitted
by applicable Law, any notice or other communication from any Governmental
Body in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Party's good-faith
failure to comply with Section 6.13(a) shall not provide the other Party
hereto the right not to effect the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, except, in each case, to the extent that any other provision of
this Agreement would independently provide such right.

  



  

Section 6.14 _Insurance Matters_ _._

  



  

Purchaser understands and acknowledges that, upon the Closing, the Assets and
the Assigned Interests shall no longer be covered by Seller's and/or its
Affiliates' insurance policies (the "Seller Policies") and, accordingly, (i)
from and after the Closing, Purchaser and/or its Affiliates shall be solely
responsible to provide insurance coverage for the Assets and (ii) except as
expressly set forth in Section 3.1 and for Claims of indemnification, no
claims regarding any matter whatsoever, whether or not arising from events
occurring prior to the Closing, shall be made against or with respect to the
Seller Policies by Purchaser Indemnitees, or any of its Affiliates or any of
their respective successors or assigns, or any Person subrogated to their
rights.

  



  

Section 6.15 _Seller 's Right to Supplement Schedules_.

  



  

Prior to Closing, Seller has the right to supplement, correct or amend its
Schedules relating to the representations and warranties set forth in
Article 4 ("Seller's Supplemented Schedules"); _provided that_ solely in the
event that (a) such Seller's Supplemented Schedules would give rise to
Purchaser's right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section
10.1(c)(iii), (b) Purchaser affirmatively waives its right to so terminate
and (c) Closing occurs, then such Seller's Supplemented Schedules shall be
deemed to have been included in Seller's representations and warranties for
all purposes of this Agreement and Purchaser shall be deemed to have waived
the matters relating to such Schedules in regard to Purchaser's obligation to
close this transaction pursuant to Section 10.1(c)(iii).

  



  

Section 6.16 _Suspense Funds_.

  



  

Seller shall transfer and remit to Purchaser, in the form of an adjustment to
the Purchase Price pursuant to Section 2.3(i), the Suspense Funds.
Purchaser shall be solely responsible for the proper distribution of such
Suspense Funds, solely to the extent of such adjustment, to the Person or
Persons which or who are entitled to receive payment of the same.

  



  

Section 6.17 _[ ]_.

  



  

Seller has disclosed and discussed with Purchaser the actions that Seller has
taken and proposes to take with respect to [ ], particularly the [ ] (the "[
]"). Notwithstanding anything in

  



    

33

 



    

this Agreement to the contrary, the provisions of this Section 6.17 (and
Seller's indemnity for breach thereof in Section 11.2(c)(i)) are the exclusive
rights and remedies against Seller related to any matters caused by, arising
out of or resulting from [ ]. For the avoidance of doubt, the inspection and
repairs contemplated by this Section 6.17 need not be completed prior to
Closing and shall not be deemed conditions to the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

(a) Promptly, but in any event no later than October 1, 2019, Seller shall
perform, or cause to be performed, [ ]. The cost of [ ] will be shared by the
working interest owners as determined by Seller with Purchaser's proportionate
working interest share of such cost paid by Seller.

  



  

(b) If [ ] ("[ ]") determines that [ ], then Seller will have no further
obligation or indemnity to Purchaser under this Section 6.17.

  



  

(c) If [ ] determines that [ ], then Seller and Purchaser agree that
Purchaser shall (i) repair the [ ] by [ ] identified on Exhibit A-2 and (ii)
perform, or cause to be performed, [ ]. The Purchaser's proportionate working
interest share of such cost for (i) repair by [ ] (up to an amount equal to
$7,400,000, proportionately reduced to Purchaser's proportionate working
interest share of such costs) and (ii) the [ ], in each case, shall be paid
by Seller.

  



  

(d) If [ ] determines that [ ], Seller and Purchaser agree that Purchaser
shall repair [ ], and Seller shall reimburse Purchaser's proportionate
working interest share of all reasonable costs and expenses incurred in
repairing [ ]; _provided_ that Seller's maximum liability for repairs on any
individual [ ] shall be no more than Seller's (or after Closing,
Purchaser's) proportionate working interest share of $7,400,000 per [ ].

  



  

(e) Purchaser shall reasonably accommodate Seller's performance of any [ ]
that may be conducted after Closing.

  



  

Section 6.18 _Management of Audits_.

  



  

From and after the Closing Date, either Party shall inform the other Party in
writing of any JV Audit Claims received by the receiving Party. Seller shall
discharge its obligations under Section 1.4(b) in respect of each of the JV
Audit Claims in a manner consistent with how Seller has previously conducted
and managed similar audit claims prior to the Closing Date until a final
resolution of such JV Audit Claim including any compromise or settlement
thereof that has been agreed and accepted by the Auditing Party (provided
that such settlement complies with the procedures set forth in Section
11.3(c) (including, for the avoidance of doubt, procedures for defending
Third Party Claims) and, if applicable, provides for sufficient amount of time
for Purchaser to make payments (if needed) consistent with the rest of this
Section 6.18) or such JV Audit Claim has been withdrawn by the Auditing Party
("Audit Resolution"). Within five (5) Business Days following the Audit
Resolution, Seller will notify Purchaser in writing of the same and of any
amount owed to or by the Auditing Party ("Resolution Amount") and the terms of
the Audit Resolution. If the Resolution Amount is to be paid to the Auditing
Party, then Purchaser shall promptly remit, or cause to be remitted, the
Resolution Amount to the Auditing Party in accordance with the Audit
Resolution. If the Resolution Amount is owed to the Auditing Party,

  



    

34

 



    

Purchaser will invoice Seller for the Resolution Amount within five (5)
Business Days following Purchaser's payment of the Resolution Amount and
Seller shall reimburse Purchaser within five (5) Business Days following
Seller's receipt of said invoice. If the Resolution Amount is to be paid by
the Auditing Party then Purchaser shall promptly remit, or cause to be
remitted, such amount to Seller within five (5) Business Days
following Purchaser's receipt of such amount.

  



  

Section 6.19 _Joint Account Billing_.

  



  

(a) Seller has paid the Exmar Payment prior to the Effective Time, and
Purchaser agrees that upon approval of a development plan that uses such
floating production system, Purchaser shall bill the other parties this cost
as a direct cost under the applicable offshore operating agreements subject
to such development plan such other parties' proportionate share of the Exmar
Payment. Amounts received from such billings shall be remitted to Seller.

  



  

(b) If Seller pays more than its proportionate share with respect to a [ ],
at the request of Seller, Purchaser shall bill such excess to the other
parties to the applicable offshore operating agreement. Amounts received from
such billing shall be remitted to Seller.

  



  

(c) If the [ ] identified on Exhibit A-2 is utilized pursuant to Section
6.17(c), Purchaser shall bill the cost of such replacement [ ] to the parties
to the applicable offshore operating agreement. Amounts received from such
billing shall be remitted to Seller.

  



  

 _Article 7 
 TITLE AND ENVIRONMENTAL DUE DILIGENCE_

  



  

Section 7.1 _Title Due Diligence Examination_.

  



  

(a) For a period extending from the Execution Date up to 5:00 p.m. (local
time in Houston, Texas) on the 30th day thereafter (the "Examination
Period"), Seller shall afford to Purchaser and its authorized representatives
reasonable access during normal business hours to the office, personnel and
books and records of Seller in order for Purchaser to conduct a
title examination as it may in its sole discretion choose to conduct with
respect to the Assets in order to determine whether Title Defects (as below
defined) exist ("Purchaser\'s Title Review"); _provided, however_ , that such
investigation shall be upon reasonable notice and shall not unreasonably
disrupt the personnel and operations of Seller or impede the efforts of
Seller to comply with its other obligations under this Agreement. Such books
and records shall include all abstracts of title, title opinions, title
files, lease files, assignments, division orders, operating records and
agreements, and financial and accounting records appropriate for a title
examination, in each case insofar as same may now be in existence and in the
possession of Seller, excluding, however, any information that Seller is
prohibited from disclosing by third party confidentiality restrictions for
which Seller is unable to obtain consent to disclose after using commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain such consent. The cost and expense of
Purchaser\'s Title Review, if any, shall be borne solely by Purchaser. All
requests for access to Seller\'s employees, contractors, offices, properties,
books and records shall be made to such

  



    

35

 



    

representatives as designated in writing by Seller (the "Designated
Representatives"), which Designated Representatives shall be solely
responsible for coordinating all such requests and all access permitted
hereunder. Purchaser shall not contact any of the customers or suppliers of
Seller or its working interest co-owners or operators, in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby, whether in person or by telephone, mail or
other means of communication, without the specific prior authorization of
Seller\'s Designated Representatives, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld.

  



  

(b) "Title Defect" shall mean any particular defect in or failure of
Seller\'s ownership of any Asset: (A) that causes Seller to not have
Defensible Title to such Asset and (B) regarding which a Title Defect Notice
has been timely and otherwise validly delivered and that has attributable
thereto a Title Defect Amount in excess of Five Hundred Thousand Dollars
($500,000). Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the
contrary, the following matters shall not constitute, and shall not be
asserted as, a Title Defect: (1) defects or irregularities arising out of
lack of corporate or company authorization or a variation in corporate or
company name, unless Purchaser provides affirmative evidence that such
corporate or company action was not authorized and results in another
person\'s superior claim of title to the relevant Asset; (2) defects or
irregularities that have been cured or remedied by the passage of time,
including applicable statutes of limitation or statutes for prescription; (3)
conventional rights of reassignment normally activated by an intent to
abandon or release a lease and requiring notice to the holders of such rights;
(4) defects or irregularities in the chain of title consisting of the failure
to recite marital status in documents; (5) limitations, defects or
irregularities expressly noted on Exhibits A or A-1 as constituting a
limitation, defect or irregularity; and (6) any failure to record any Lease
or transfers in the chain of title to a Lease in the county or parish records;
provided, however, any such transfer is on file with BOEM insofar as the same
pertains to a federal offshore lease.

  



  

(c) If Purchaser discovers any Title Defect affecting any of the Assets,
Purchaser shall notify Seller of such alleged Title Defect prior to the
expiration of the Examination Period. To be effective, such notice ("Title
Defect Notice") must (i) be in writing, (ii) be received by Seller prior to
the expiration of the Examination Period, (iii) describe the Title Defect in
detail (including the basis for any alleged variance in a Net Revenue
Interest or Working Interest), (iv) identify the specific Asset affected by
such Title Defect and (v) suggest a value of such Title Defect as determined
by Purchaser in good faith; _provided, however_ , that the failure to include
any of the above shall not invalidate any Title Defect if Purchaser has
materially complied with the notice requirements set forth above. Any matters
that may otherwise constitute Title Defects, but of which Seller has not been
specifically notified by Purchaser in accordance with the foregoing, shall be
deemed to have been waived by Purchaser for all purposes. Upon the receipt of
an effective Title Defect Notice from Purchaser, Seller shall have the option,
but not the obligation, to attempt to cure the Title Defect prior to Closing.
The Asset affected by such uncured Title Defect shall be a "Title Defect
Property".

  



  

(d) With respect to each Title Defect that is not cured or waived on or
before the Closing, the rights of Seller shall be as set forth in Sections
7.3 and 7.5, and in connection therewith, the Parties shall make a mutual
determination as to the "Title Defect 

  



    

36

 



    

Amount", which shall mean, with respect to a Title Defect Property, the
amount by which such Title Defect Property is impaired as a result of the
existence of one or more Title Defects, which amount shall be determined as
follows:

  



  

(i) If Purchaser and Seller agree on the Title Defect Amount, then that
amount shall be the Title Defect Amount;

  



  

(ii) The Title Defect Amount with respect to a Title Defect Property shall
be determined by taking into consideration the "Allocated Value" (as set
forth in Schedule 2.4) of the Asset subject to such Title Defect as follows:
(A) if such Title Defect is in the nature of Seller\'s Net Revenue Interest
in an Asset being less than the Net Revenue Interest set forth on Exhibit A-1
then Purchaser and Seller agree that the Purchase Price shall be reduced in
an amount equal to the Allocated Value for the relevant Asset, or portion
thereof, multiplied by the percentage reduction in such Net Revenue Interest
as a result of such Title Defect; and (B) if such Title Defect is in the
nature of a Lien, then Seller and Purchaser agree that the Purchase Price
shall be reduced in the amount equal to the amount required to fully
discharge such Lien; and

  



  

(iii) If the Title Defect results from any matter not described in Section
7.1(d)(ii) above, then the Title Defect Amount shall be determined by taking
into account the Allocated Value of the Title Defect Property, the portion of
the Title Defect Property affected by the Title Defect, the legal effect of
the Title Defect, the potential economic effect of the Title Defect over the
life of the Title Defect Property, the values placed upon the Title Defect by
Purchaser and Seller and such other reasonable factors as are necessary to
make a proper evaluation.

  



  

(e) As used in this Section 7.1:

  



  

(i) "Defensible Title" means, as of the Closing Date, with respect to the
Assets, such record title and ownership by Seller that:

  



  

(A) entitles Seller to receive and retain not less than the percentage set
forth in Exhibit A and Exhibit A-1 as Seller\'s "Net Revenue Interest" of all
Hydrocarbons produced, saved and marketed from each well, unit or Exploratory
Lease comprising such Asset as set forth in Exhibit A-1, through plugging,
abandonment and salvage of all wells comprising or included in such Asset, and
except for changes or adjustments that result from the establishment of
units, changes in existing units (or the participating areas therein), non-
consent elections under applicable operating agreements, or the entry into of
pooling or unitization agreements, in each case, arising after the date
hereof unless made in breach of the provisions of Section 6.3;

  



  

(B) obligates Seller to bear not greater than the percentage set forth in
Exhibit A and Exhibit A-1 as Seller's Working Interest of the costs and
expenses relating to the maintenance, development and operation of each

  



    

37

 



    

well, unit or Exploratory Lease comprising such Asset, through plugging,
abandonment and salvage of all wells comprising or included in such Asset,
without a corresponding increase in the Net Revenue Interest for such well or
unit, and except for changes or adjustments that result from the
establishment of units, changes in existing units (or the participating areas
therein), non-consent elections under applicable operating agreements, or the
entry into of pooling or unitization agreements, in each case, arising after
the date hereof unless made in breach of the provisions of Section 6.3; and

  



  

(C) is free and clear of all defects, encumbrances and Liens, except
Permitted Encumbrances.

  



  

(ii) "Permitted Encumbrances" shall mean (A) Liens for Taxes which are not
yet delinquent or which are being contested in good faith and for which
adequate reserves have been established; (B) normal and customary liens of co-
owners under operating agreements, unitization or similar agreements, and
pooling orders relating to the Assets, which obligations are not yet due and
pursuant to which Seller is not in default; (C) mechanic\'s and
materialman\'s liens relating to the Assets, which obligations are not
yet due and pursuant to which Seller is not in default; (D) all approvals or
rights to consent by, required notices to, filing with or other actions by
Governmental Bodies, including the Louisiana State Mineral Board acting on
behalf of the State of Louisiana and the BOEM, in connection with the sale or
conveyance of oil and gas leases or interests therein if they are customarily
obtained subsequent to the sale or conveyance; (E) easements, rights-of-way,
servitudes, permits, surface leases and other rights in respect of
operations, pipelines, or facilities or the like; (F) easements, rights-of-
way, servitudes, permits and other rights, on, over or in respect of any of
the Leases that do not materially interfere with the ownership or operation of
the Assets as currently owned and operated; (G) all rights reserved to or
vested in any Governmental Body to control or regulate any of the Assets in
any manner, and all applicable laws, rules and orders of governmental
authority; (H) preferential rights to purchase and consent to transfer
requirements of any person, other than a party hereto or any Governmental Body
(i) to the extent not triggered by the consummation of the transactions
contemplated herein or (ii) if triggered by the consummation of the
transactions contemplated herein, with respect to which waivers or consents
shall have been obtained from the appropriate parties or the time period to
exercise the preferential right to purchase or to withhold consent has
expired; (I) warranties, encumbrances, carried interests,
production payments, non-participating royalty interests, net profit
interests and any overriding royalty interests, reversionary interests and
other burdens to the extent they do not, individually or in the aggregate,
reduce Seller's Net Revenue Interest below that shown in Exhibit A-1, or
increase Seller's Working Interest above that shown in Exhibit A-1 without a
corresponding increase in the Net Revenue Interest; (J) all Contracts
applicable to the Assets to the extent they do not, individually or in the
aggregate: (i) reduce Seller's Net Revenue Interest below that shown in
Exhibit A-1, or increase Seller's Working Interest above that shown in
Exhibit A-1 without a corresponding increase in the Net Revenue Interest,

  



    

38

 



    

and (ii) materially interfere with the ownership or operation of the Assets
as currently owned and operated; and (K) any Title Defects as Purchaser may
have expressly waived in writing, or, except with respect to any claims
relating to or arising under the Special Warranty, which are deemed to have
been waived under this Agreement.

  



  

Section 7.2 _Environmental Due Diligence Examination_.

  



  

(a) Purchaser shall have the right to cause an environmental consultant
reasonably acceptable to Seller ("Purchaser\'s Environmental Consultant") to
conduct a visual, non-invasive environmental review of the Assets during the
Examination Period ("Purchaser\'s Environmental Review"). Purchaser's
Environmental Review shall not include any sampling, testing, monitoring
or any invasive environmental review or investigation commonly referred to as
a Phase II without the prior written consent of Seller, which such consent
with respect to a Phase II may be withheld by Seller in its sole discretion.
The cost and expense of Purchaser\'s Environmental Review, if any, shall be
borne solely by Purchaser.

  



  

(b) Unless otherwise required by applicable Law, Purchaser shall (and shall
cause Purchaser\'s Environmental Consultant, if applicable, to) treat
confidentially any matters revealed by Purchaser\'s Environmental Review and
any reports or data generated from such review (the "Environmental
Information"), and Purchaser shall not (and shall cause Purchaser\'s
Environmental Consultant, if applicable, to not) disclose any Environmental
Information to any Governmental Body or other third party without the prior
written consent of Seller. Unless otherwise required by applicable Law,
Purchaser may use the Environmental Information only in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. If Purchaser, Purchaser\'s
Environmental Consultant, if applicable, or any third party to whom Purchaser
has provided any Environmental Information become legally compelled to
disclose any of the Environmental Information to any Governmental Body or
other third party, Purchaser shall provide Seller with prompt notice
sufficiently prior to any such disclosure so as to allow Seller, at Seller\'s
expense, to file any protective order, or seek any other remedy, as it deems
appropriate under the circumstances. If this Agreement is terminated prior to
the Closing, Purchaser shall, only upon Seller's request, deliver the
Environmental Information to Seller, which Environmental Information shall
become the sole property of Seller. Purchaser, upon Seller's request, shall
provide copies of any final environmental report(s) prepared by
Purchaser's Environmental Consultant to Seller without charge.

  



  

(c) If Purchaser\'s Environmental Consultant discovers any Environmental
Defect (as herein defined) affecting the Assets prior to the expiration of
the Examination Period as a result of Purchaser's Environmental Review,
Purchaser shall notify Seller prior to the expiration of the Examination
Period of such alleged Environmental Defect. To be effective, such notice (an
"Environmental Defect Notice") must (i) be in writing, (ii) be received by
Seller prior to the expiration of the Examination Period, (iii) describe the
Environmental Defect in reasonable detail, including, (A) the written
conclusion of Purchaser\'s Environmental Consultant, if applicable, that an
Environmental Defect exists, which conclusion shall be reasonably
substantiated by the factual data gathered in

  



    

39

 



    

Purchaser\'s Environmental Review, and (B) a separate, reasonably specific
citation to at least one (1) provision of applicable Environmental Law alleged
to be violated and the related facts that substantiate such violation, (iv)
identify the specific Assets affected by such Environmental Defect and (v)
set forth Purchaser\'s good faith estimate of the Environmental Defect Value,
including the basis for such estimate and any material assumptions used by
Purchaser's Environmental Consultant to support such estimate; _provided,
however_ , that the failure to include any of the above shall not invalidate
any Environmental Defect if Purchaser has materially complied with the notice
requirements set forth above, except that Purchaser must provide at least one
(1) provision of applicable Environmental Law. Any matters that may otherwise
constitute Environmental Defects, but of which Seller has not been
specifically notified by Purchaser in accordance with the foregoing, together
with any environmental matter that does not constitute an Environmental
Defect, shall be deemed to have been waived by Purchaser for purposes of this
Section 7.2. Upon the receipt of an effective notice from Purchaser, Seller
shall have the option, but not the obligation, to attempt to Remediate such
Environmental Defect at any time prior to Closing. To give Seller an
opportunity to commence reviewing and curing Environmental Defects, Purchaser
agrees to give Seller, on or before the end of each calendar week prior to
the expiration of the Examination Period, written notice of all
alleged Environmental Defects discovered by Purchaser during the preceding
calendar week, which notice may be preliminary in nature and supplemented
prior to the expiration of the Examination Period. Notwithstanding anything
contained herein to the contrary, the failure to include a matter on a
preliminary defect notice shall not waive any Environmental Defect if its
properly set forth in a timely Environmental Defect Notice.

  



  

(d) If any Environmental Defect described in a notice delivered in
accordance with Section 7.2 is not Remediated on or before the Closing, the
rights of Seller shall be as set forth in Sections 7.3 and 7.5.

  



  

(e) As used in this Section 7.2:

  



  

(i) "Environmental Defect" shall mean, with respect to any given Asset, an
Environmental Condition which is a current or unresolved violation of, or
gives rise to current obligations to Remediate such Environmental Conditions
under, Environmental Laws, regarding which an Environmental Defect Notice has
been timely and otherwise validly delivered and that has attributable thereto
an Environmental Defect Value in excess of Five Hundred Thousand Dollars
($500,000). It is specifically acknowledged and agreed that (i) the
presence in any wellbore, equipment, pipeline, flowline or vessel on or
related to the Assets of, or any condition caused by or relating to, NORM,
asbestos or asbestos containing materials and (ii) any Decommissioning
Obligations shall not be deemed to constitute an Environmental Defect for
purposes of this Agreement. The Parties agree that each Environmental Defect
will be addressed as a single incident or condition, but that Environmental
Defects of the same nature affecting multiple Assets may be aggregated
to meet the attributable Environmental Defect Value minimum of Five Hundred
Thousand Dollars ($500,000).

(ii) "Environmental Defect Value" shall mean the costs to Remediate a
particular Environmental Defect; _provided, however,_ "Environmental Defect
Value" shall not include (i) the costs of Purchaser's and/or its Affiliate's
employees or agents, (ii) expenses for matters that are ordinary costs of
doing business regardless of the presence of an Environmental Defect (e.g.,
those costs that would ordinarily be incurred in the day-to-day operations of
the Assets or in connection with Permit renewal/amendment activities), (iii)
overhead costs of Purchaser and/or its Affiliates, or (iv) costs and expenses
that would not have been required under Environmental Laws as they exist at
the Effective Time.

  



  

(iii) "Remediate" shall mean action taken to correct an Environmental Defect
to the extent required by Environmental Law in the most cost effective manner
reasonably available, consistent with applicable Environmental Laws, taking
into account that non-permanent remedies (such as mechanisms to contain or
stabilize Hazardous Materials, including monitoring site conditions, natural
attenuation, risk-based corrective action, institutional controls or other
appropriate restrictions on the use of property, caps, dikes,
encapsulation, leachate collection systems, etc.) may be the most cost
effective manner reasonably available.

  



  

Section 7.3 _Options of Seller with Respect to Title Defects and
Environmental Defects_.

  



  

With respect to Title Defects which Seller has elected not to cure, or
Environmental Defects which Seller has elected not to Remediate, and/or has
been unable to cure, or with respect to Environmental Defects, Remediate, on
or before Closing, Seller shall have the option, by notice in writing to
Purchaser on or before Closing, in each case subject to Purchaser's rights
under Section 7.6 below: (i) solely to the extent the aggregate value of the
Title Defects and Environmental Defects affecting an Asset exceeds seventy-
five percent (75%) of the Allocated Value of such Asset, to exclude the
affected Asset from the purchase and sale and reduce the Purchase Price by an
amount equal to the Allocated Value for such affected Asset as set forth in
Schedule 2.4; (ii) solely with respect to Title Defects, to attempt to cure
such Title Defect after the Closing (with any such Title Defect being called a
"Post-Closing Defect"); (iii) to reduce the Purchase Price by the Title
Defect Amount or Environmental Defect Value and complete the transaction
contemplated, as provided herein, as to the affected Asset; (iv) to submit a
dispute between Seller or Purchaser over the existence of a Title Defect or
an Environmental Defect or the amount to remedy such Title Defect or
Environmental Defect to arbitration pursuant to Section 12.17, or (v) only
upon the prior written consent from Purchaser, indemnify Purchaser
pursuant to a mutually agreed indemnity agreement, against any Covered
Liabilities attributable to or resulting from the relevant Title Defect or
Environmental Defect (the "Defect Indemnity"), in which case the affected
Asset shall be conveyed to Purchaser at Closing and no adjustment shall be
made to the Purchase Price. If Seller notifies Purchaser that Seller
elects to exclude an Asset in accordance with subpart (i) above, then
Purchaser shall have the right at its option, to elect to waive the Title
Defect or Environmental Defect, in which case the affected Asset shall be
conveyed to Purchaser at Closing with no adjustment to the Purchase Price. In
the event Seller elects the option described in clause (ii), the transactions
contemplated hereby will close as provided herein pursuant to the provisions
of Section 7.4 and the amount equal to the lesser of (A) the applicable
Title Defect Amount or Environmental Defect Value and (B) the Allocated Value
for the Asset to which the

  



    

41

 



    

Post-Closing Defect pertains shall be deducted from the Adjusted Purchase
Price otherwise payable at Closing and paid into an escrow account (the
"Defects Escrow Account") established with a federally insured savings or
banking institution mutually acceptable to Purchaser and Seller (the
"Defects Escrow Agent") pursuant to the terms of an escrow agreement in a
form mutually agreeable by Purchaser and Seller and to be styled the "Defects
Escrow Agreement" (and for the avoidance of doubt, any portion of the
Allocated Value of such Asset not paid into the Defects Escrow Account
pursuant to this sentence shall be paid to Seller at Closing). In the
event Seller elects the option described in clause (iv), the transactions
contemplated hereby will close as provided herein pursuant to the provisions
of Section 7.4 and the amount equal to Purchaser's asserted Title Defect
Amount shall be deducted from the Adjusted Purchase Price otherwise payable
at Closing and paid into the Defects Escrow Account (and for the avoidance of
doubt, any portion of the Allocated Value of such Asset not paid into the
Defects Escrow Account pursuant to this sentence shall be paid to Seller at
Closing). Any amount deposited into the Defects Escrow Account pursuant to
this Section 7.3 will remain therein until released as provided in the
Defects Escrow Agreement and in accordance with the provisions of Section 7.4.
The Parties will structure the Defects Escrow Agreement in a manner to allow
Seller to report the transaction under Section 453 of the Code.

  



  

Section 7.4 _Resolution of Post-Closing Defects_.

  



  

In the event that Seller elects the option described in Section 7.3(ii) or
with respect to any Transfer Requirement deemed a Post-Closing Defect,
Purchaser and Seller will act in good faith and reasonably cooperate after
the Closing with respect to curing, a Post-Closing Defect. Purchaser shall
provide Seller and its agents reasonable access to the Assets to cure any
Post-Closing Defects. If Seller and Purchaser mutually agree that a Post-
Closing Defect has been cured, then within two (2) Business Days after such
determination, the amount withheld in the Defects Escrow Account with respect
thereto (together with any interest earned thereon) shall be released to the
Seller in accordance with the terms of the Defects Escrow Agreement. If
Seller and Purchaser mutually agree that a Post-Closing Defect has been
partially cured, then the Seller and Purchaser shall mutually determine the
portion of the amount retained in the Defects Escrow Account with respect
thereto (together with any interest earned thereon) that should be paid to
Purchaser to compensate it for the uncured portion thereof (together with
interest earned thereon), and the remaining portion of such amount shall be
released to the Seller (together with any interest earned thereon) in
accordance with the terms of the Defects Escrow Agreement. If, at the end of
the one hundred seventy five (175) day period commencing on the Closing Date
(the "Cure Period"), Seller has been unable to cure a Post-Closing Defect
(and there is no dispute as to whether or not it has been cured), the
amount held in the Defects Escrow Account with respect to such Post-Closing
Defect (together with any interest earned thereon), as adjusted to the extent
the Title Defect Amount with respect to such Post-Closing Defect has decreased
as a result of Seller's efforts to cure, shall be the released to the
Purchaser in accordance with the terms of the Defects Escrow Agreement. If, at
the end of the Cure Period, the Seller and Purchaser are unable to agree
whether there has been a satisfactory resolution of a Post-Closing Defect or
are unable to agree on an adjusted Title Defect Amount, then such disagreement
shall be resolved as provided in Section 12.17. With respect to any Transfer
Requirement deemed a Post-Closing Defect that is not cured or waived at the
end of the Cure Period despite commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the
Transfer Requirement, Purchaser shall have the option to (a) exclude the
Assets subject to the Transfer Requirements and such Assets shall be deemed
Excluded Assets for all purposes

  



    

42

 



    

hereunder, (b) waive such Transfer Requirements and have Seller convey such
Assets within five (5) Business Days of Purchaser's election or (c) elect to
have the Parties use commercially reasonably efforts to take such other
action or put into place such other arrangements as are permissible
with respect to the affected Asset so as to provide the Parties with the same
economic results as would otherwise resulted if the Transfer Requirement had
been obtained. In regards to such uncured or unwaived Transfer Requirement, if
Purchaser elects option (a) above, then the Parties shall instruct the
Defects Escrow Agent to release to Purchaser the amount deposited into the
Defects Escrow Account for such Post-Closing Defect, and if Purchaser elects
option (b) above, then the Parties shall instruct the Defects Escrow Agent to
release to Seller the amount deposited into the Defects Escrow Account for
such Post-Closing Defect. With respect to any Assets subject to a dispute
pursuant to Section 7.3(iv) within two (2) Business Days after an arbitration
decision is rendered pursuant to Section 12.17, Seller and Purchaser shall
release from the Defects Escrow Account to Seller or Purchaser, as applicable,
the amounts set forth in such arbitration decision (together with any
interest earned thereon) in accordance with the terms of the Defects Escrow
Agreement.

  



  

Section 7.5 _Condition Precedent to Any Adjustment of the Purchase Price for
Title Defects and Environmental Defects_.

  



  

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, and
subject to the effect of the alternative remedies set forth in Section 7.3
and Section 7.6, (i) if the aggregate adjustment to the Purchase Price,
determined in accordance with this Agreement for all Title Defects and
Environmental Defects, is less than or equal to two percent (2%) of the
Purchase Price (the "Defect Deductible"), then no adjustment of the Purchase
Price shall be made therefor, and all such defects shall be considered as
waived by Purchaser for all purposes under this Agreement; and (ii) if the
aggregate adjustment to the Purchase Price, determined in accordance
with this Agreement for all Title Defects and Environmental Defects, is
greater than the Defect Deductible, then the Purchase Price shall be adjusted
by the amount of Title Defects and Environmental Defects in excess of the
Defect Deductible, subject, however, to the alternative remedies provided for
in Section 7.3. The Title Defect Amount or Environmental Defect Value
associated with any Asset excluded by Seller pursuant to Section 7.3(i), or
associated with any Asset subject to a Defect Indemnity under Section 7.3(v),
or associated with a Title Defect or Environmental Defect that has been cured
prior to Closing or associated with an uncured Transfer Requirement deemed a
Post-Closing Defect, shall not be included in the calculations conducted
pursuant to this Section 7.5.

  



  

Section 7.6 _Purchaser 's Right to Exclude_. Purchaser, at its option, may
exclude an Asset, which, for Environmental Defects must be exercised on or
before Closing, and for Title Defects, must be exercised as follows: (i) for
Post-Closing Defects that are not cured during the Cure Period, Purchaser
must exercise such right within five (5) Business Days after the end of the
Cure Period, (ii) for any Title Defects determined to exist pursuant to an
arbitration decision rendered pursuant to Section 12.17, Purchaser must
exercise such right within five (5) Business Days after such arbitration
decision is rendered) and (iii) for all other Title Defects, Purchaser must
exercise such right on or before Closing (the "Exclusion Option"), if such
Asset is subject to a Title Defect or Environmental Defect for which the
amount of the adjustment asserted by Purchaser exceeds seventy-five (75%) of
the Allocated Value for such Asset. If Purchaser elects to exclude an Asset
on or prior to Closing (in accordance with this Section 7.6), then the
affected Asset shall not be conveyed at Closing and the Adjusted Purchase
Price shall be reduced in

  



    

43

 



    

accordance with Section 2.3(e). If Purchaser elects to exclude an Asset after
Closing has occurred (in accordance with this Section 7.6), then if such Asset
was conveyed to Purchaser at Closing, Purchaser shall then execute and
deliver to Seller or its designee a conveyance (in a form mutually agreed by
the Parties) of such Asset. In such case, the Adjusted Purchase Price will be
reduced in an amount equal to the Allocated Value of such Asset (subject to
repayment of any Purchase Price adjustments having previously been made in
respect thereof, if any) and the Parties shall cause the Defects Escrow Agent
to disburse the applicable funds to Purchaser; _provided, however_ , that to
the extent the entire Allocated Value of such Asset was not deposited into the
Defects Escrow Account at Closing, then Seller shall, concurrently with the
delivery of the conveyance, pay to Purchaser by wire transfer of immediately
available funds, any amounts delivered to Seller at Closing with respect to
such Asset. Any such Asset excluded by Purchaser pursuant to this Section 7.6
shall be an Excluded Asset.

  



  

Section 7.7 _Waiver and Remedies_.

  



  

Except as set forth in Section 4.16 and subject to any Defect Indemnity
entered into pursuant to this Article 7 with respect to an Environmental
Defect, Purchaser waives for all purposes all objections associated with the
Environmental Condition of the Assets (including Environmental Defects),
unless raised in a valid Environmental Defect Notice prior to the expiration
of the Examination Period. Except as set forth in Section 4.16, the rights
and remedies granted Purchaser in this Article 7 are the exclusive rights and
remedies against Seller related to any matters constituting an Environmental
Defect or any environmental, health or safety matter.

prepare and deliver to Purchaser a preliminary settlement statement
setting forth Seller's good-faith estimate of the Adjusted Purchase Price
after giving effect to all Purchase Price adjustments set forth in this
Agreement (including Section 2.3). The estimate delivered in accordance with
this Section 9.4 shall constitute the dollar amount to be paid by Purchaser
to Seller at the Closing, after crediting the amount of the Deposit then held

Section 9.5 _Final Settlement_.

  



  

No later than one hundred eighty (180) days following the Closing Date
("Final Settlement Date"), Seller shall prepare and deliver to Purchaser a
statement setting forth the final calculation of the Adjusted Purchase Price
and showing the calculation of each adjustment, based, to the extent
possible, on actual credits, charges, receipts and other items before and
after the Effective Time and taking into account all adjustments (including
any amounts otherwise owed by Purchaser to Seller under the terms of this
Agreement or the Transition Service Agreement) provided for in this Agreement
(the "Adjusted Purchase Price Notice"). If Purchaser objects to or disputes
the calculation of the Adjusted Purchase Price, it will notify Seller in
writing (such notice, the "Objection Notice") of its disputes or objections
no later than sixty (60) days after Purchaser's receipt of the Adjusted
Purchase Price Notice and will set forth, in writing and in reasonable detail,
the reasons for the disputes or objections, and Purchaser shall be deemed to
have agreed with all other items and amounts contained in the Adjusted
Purchase Price Notice. If Purchaser fails to provide an Objection Notice on
or before twenty (20) days after Purchaser's receipt of the Adjusted Purchase
Price Notice, Purchaser will be deemed to have accepted the

  



    

49

 



    

Adjusted Purchase Price as set out in the Adjusted Purchase Price Notice, and
the Parties shall proceed under the terms of Section 9.6. If Purchaser
delivers an Objection Notice prior to the end of such twenty (20) day period,
Seller and Purchaser will endeavor in good faith to resolve any
disputed matters no later than fifteen (15) Business Days after receipt by
Seller of the Objection Notice. If Seller and Purchaser are unable to resolve
the disputed matters within ten (10) Business Days after such fifteen (15)
Business Day period, Seller and Purchaser will appoint one of the "big four"
public accounting firms with which neither Purchaser nor Seller has a material
relationship (the "Independent Expert") to resolve the matters in dispute,
and Seller and Purchaser shall cooperate to provide the Independent Expert
with all requested information such firm deems necessary to resolve the
dispute. In resolving the matters in dispute, the Independent Expert shall
consider only the calculation made by Seller in the Adjusted Purchase Price
Notice as to which Purchaser has disagreed, and make its own calculation with
respect to those items solely based on the terms and conditions set forth in
this Agreement. Such independent accountants shall deliver to Purchaser and
Seller, as promptly as practicable, a report setting forth such calculation;
the determination of such firm in respect of the correctness of each matter
remaining in dispute will be final, binding and conclusive on Seller and
Purchaser. The fees and expenses related to the work of the
Independent Expert will be paid by fifty percent (50%) by Seller and fifty
percent (50%) by Purchaser. For the sake of clarity, the Independent Expert
shall act solely as an accountant expert, and not as an arbitrator, and shall
reject any disputes brought to it on any matter other than those expressly
provided for in this Section 9.5.

  



  

Section 9.6 _Final Settlement Payments_.

  



  

Within ten (10) days after the date on which the Parties or the Independent
Expert, as applicable, finally determines the disputed matters or after the
date on which Purchaser accepts or is deemed to have accepted Seller's
calculation of the Adjusted Purchase Price under Section 9.5, (i) Purchaser
shall pay to Seller the amount by which the Adjusted Purchase Price exceeds
the Closing Payment or (ii) Seller shall pay to Purchaser the amount by which
the Closing Payment exceeds the Adjusted Purchase Price, as applicable. Any
post-closing payment pursuant to Section 9.5 shall bear interest from the
Closing Date to the date of payment at the Agreed Interest Rate. All payments
made or to be made hereunder to Seller shall be by electronic transfer of
immediately available funds to the account of Seller set forth in Section
12.3. All payments made or to be made hereunder to Purchaser shall be by
electronic transfer of immediately available funds to the account of
Purchaser set forth in Section 12.3.

  



  

Section 9.7 _Filings and Related Matters_.

  



  

From and after Closing, Purchaser shall be responsible for filing and
recording of the Conveyances and other instruments of transfer contemplated by
this Agreement. Purchaser shall bear all costs and fees associated with such

Purchase Price Notice. Purchaser shall supply the other Party with a true and
accurate photocopy of each recorded and filed Conveyance and governmental
form of transfer within a reasonable period of time after such documents are
available. As promptly as practicable after the Closing, Purchaser shall
notify all pertinent operators, non-operators, oil or gas
purchasers, Government Bodies, lessors and royalty owners that it has
purchased the Assigned Interests.

(a) by mutual written consent of Seller and Purchaser;

  



  

(b) by Seller, except as provided otherwise below, by written notice to
Purchaser, if:

  



  

(i) the Closing shall not have occurred on or prior to August 1, 2019 (the
"Termination Date") or such later date as the Parties may agree upon;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Seller's right to terminate this Agreement under
this Section 10.1(b)(i) shall not be available if Seller's failure to fulfill
any obligation under this Agreement shall have been the cause of, or shall
have resulted in, the failure of the Closing to occur on or prior to the
Termination Date; or

  



  

(ii) a Governmental Body having competent jurisdiction shall have issued an
Order (other than a temporary restraining order), or shall have taken any
other action, having the effect of permanently restraining, enjoining or
otherwise prohibiting the Closing, and such Order or action is final and non-
appealable; _provided, however_ , that Seller's right to terminate this
Agreement under this Section 10.1(b)(ii) shall not be available if Seller's
failure to perform any of its obligations pursuant to this Agreement resulted
in the entry of the Order or the taking of such other action; or

  



  

(iii) if a breach of any representation or warranty or failure to perform
any covenant or agreement on the part of Purchaser set forth in this
Agreement shall have occurred that would cause the conditions set forth in
Section 8.1(a) or Section 8.1(b) not to be satisfied, and such conditions are
incapable of being satisfied by the Termination Date or, if curable, is not
cured within thirty (30) days of receipt by Purchaser of written notice of
such breach or failure; _provided_ that Seller is not then in breach of
this Agreement so as to cause any of the other conditions in Article 8 that
are to be observed or performed by Seller not to be satisfied; or

  



  

(iv) (A) The conditions set forth in Section 8.2 have been satisfied or
waived (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied
at the Closing) as of the Target Closing Date; (B) Seller has provided notice
to Purchaser in writing, which such notice may not be delivered prior to the
Target Closing Date that Seller is ready, willing and able to consummate the
Closing; and (C) Purchaser shall have failed to consummate the Closing within
five (5) Business Days following the receipt of such notice; then Seller may
either (y) terminate this Agreement or (z) enforce specific performance
pursuant to Section 10.3, in each case, with prior written notice; _provided
that_ , for clarity, in no event shall the termination right

  



    

51

 



    

provided in this Section 10.1(b)(iv) be available to Seller prior to the
Target Closing Date; or

  



  

(v) if Purchaser fails to pay the Deposit on or before 5:00 p.m. (Central
Time) on the first (1st) Business Day immediately following the Execution
Date.

  



  

(c) by Purchaser, by written notice to Seller, if:

  



  

(i) the Closing shall not have occurred on or prior to the Termination Date
or such later date as the Parties may agree upon; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,
that Purchaser's right to terminate this Agreement under this Section
10.1(c)(i) shall not be available if Purchaser's failure to fulfill any
obligation under this Agreement shall have been the cause of, or shall have
resulted in, the failure of the Closing to occur on or prior to the
Termination Date; or

  



  

(ii) a Governmental Body having competent jurisdiction shall have issued an
Order (other than a temporary restraining order), or shall have taken any
other action, having the effect of permanently restraining, enjoining or
otherwise prohibiting the Closing, and such Order or action is final and non-
appealable; _provided_ , _however_ , that Purchaser's right to terminate
this Agreement under this Section 10.1(c)(ii) shall not be available if
Purchaser's failure to perform any of its obligations pursuant to this
Agreement resulted in the entry of the Order or the taking of such other
action; or

  



  

(iii) if a breach of any representation or warranty or failure to perform
any covenant or agreement on the part of Seller set forth in this Agreement
shall have occurred that would cause the conditions set forth in Section
8.2(a) or Section 8.2(b) not to be satisfied, and such conditions are
incapable of being satisfied by the Termination Date or, if curable, is not
cured within thirty (30) days of receipt by Seller of written notice of such
breach or failure, provided that Purchaser is not then in breach of this
Agreement so as to cause any of the other conditions in Article 8 that are to
be observed or performed by Purchaser not to be satisfied.

  



  

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the
Termination Date may be extended one time for a period not to exceed thirty
(30) days by either Seller or Purchaser by written notice to the other Party
prior to the Termination Date if the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall not have been consummated as a result of the conditions set
forth in Section 8.1(e) or Section 8.2(e) failing to have been satisfied;
_provided_ , _however_ , that such right of extension shall not be available
to any Party unless such Party has performed or is ready, willing and able to
perform all of the conditions precedent that it must perform for the benefit
of the other Party and which are to be performed or observed at or prior to
Closing.

  



  

(e) If this Agreement is terminated (i) pursuant to Section 10.1(b)(i) (and
with respect to such termination, the Termination Date is reached solely due
to a material breach of Purchaser, and Seller is not also in material breach
of this Agreement as of such time), Section 10.1(b)(iii), or Section
10.1(b)(iv), the Parties shall instruct the Escrow Agent to

  



    

52

 



    

deliver the Deposit to Seller or (ii) for any other reason (excluding
termination pursuant to Section 10.1(b)(v)), the Parties shall instruct the
Escrow Agent to deliver the Deposit to Purchaser, in either case, free of any
claims by the other Party or any other Person with respect thereto, and each
Party shall have no further liability hereunder of any nature whatsoever to
the other Party, including any Covered Liabilities (except for the provisions
of Section 4.5, Section 5.4, Section 6.4, and Section 12.6 and the
Confidentiality Agreement which shall continue in full force and effect in
accordance with their terms), and the Seller shall be free immediately to
enjoy all rights of ownership of the Assets and to sell, transfer, encumber
or otherwise dispose of the Assets to any Person without any restriction
under this Agreement. Within two (2) Business Days following termination of
this Agreement, the Parties shall execute and deliver to the Escrow Agent a
written instruction directing the Escrow Agent to disburse the Deposit to the
Party entitled to same pursuant to this Section 10.1(e).

  



  

(f) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 10.1(b)(v), each
Party shall have no further liability hereunder of any nature whatsoever to
the other Party, including any liability for Damages (except for the
provisions of Section 4.5, Section 5.4, Section 6.4, and Section 12.6 and the
Confidentiality Agreement which shall continue in full force and effect in
accordance with their terms), and Seller shall be free immediately to enjoy
all rights of ownership of the Assets and to sell, transfer, encumber or
otherwise dispose of the Assets to any Person without any restriction or

Section 10.2 _Effect of Termination_.

  



  

No termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.1 shall be effective
until written notice thereof is given to the non-terminating Party
specifying the provision hereof pursuant to which such termination is made.
If validly terminated pursuant to Section 10.1, this Agreement shall, subject
to this Section 10.2, become wholly void and of no further force and effect
(except for the provisions of Sections 4.5, 5.4, 6.4, 6.5, 10.2, 10.3, 11.7,
11.8, 11.9, 12.2, 12.7, 12.8, 12.9, 12.10, 12.11, 12.12, 12.13, 12.14, 12.15,
12.16, 12.17(a), 12.18, 12.19 and of the Confidentiality Agreement all which
shall survive the termination of this Agreement and continue in full force
and effect in accordance with their respective terms) and the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be abandoned without any further action by or
liability to any Party or to any Affiliate of a Party, or their respective
members or shareholders or representatives, and following such termination
Seller shall be free immediately to enjoy all rights of ownership of the
Assets and to sell, transfer, encumber or otherwise dispose of the Assets to
any Person without any restriction under this Agreement, and no Party shall
have any liability under this Agreement or relating to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement to any other Party except as set forth in
Section 10.3; provided, that the termination of this Agreement shall not
relieve any party hereto from any liability for (i) fraud or (ii) any willful
breach of, or willful failure to perform any obligation under, any
covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement (including, in the case of
Purchaser, any failure to have sufficient immediately available funds for the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby).

  



  

Section 10.3 _Specific Performance_.

  



    

53

 



    

In lieu of seeking the Deposit as a remedy in accordance with Section
10.1(e), as the non-breaching Party's sole remedy under this Agreement, the
Parties shall be entitled to specific performance of this Agreement, it being
specifically agreed that monetary damages will not be sufficient to
compensate the non-breaching Party, and this right shall include the right of
the non-breaching Party to cause the transactions contemplated hereby to be
consummated in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. The breaching
Party hereby agrees not to raise any objections to the availability of the
equitable remedy of specific performance to specifically enforce the terms
and provisions of this Agreement to enforce compliance with, the covenants and
agreements of the breaching Party under this Agreement. The non-breaching
Party shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in
connection with seeking an injunction or injunctions to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement. The Parties hereto further
agree that (a) by seeking the remedies provided for in this Section 10.3, the
non-breaching Party shall not in any respect waive its right to seek any
other form of relief in law or in equity that may be available to it and (b)
nothing set forth in this Section 10.3 shall require the non-breaching Party
to institute any Proceeding for (or limit the non-breaching Party's right to
institute any Proceeding for) specific performance under this Section 10.3
prior or as a condition to exercising any termination right under this
Article 10. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, (x) if
Seller elects to receive the Deposit as liquidated damages in accordance with
Section 10.1(e), then Seller shall not be entitled to seek specific
performance of this Agreement, and (y) if the non-breaching Party elects to
seek specific performance, the non-breaching Party shall not be entitled to
receive the Deposit under Section 10.1(e); _provided that_ if the non-
breaching Party withdraws its claim for specific performance or is unable to
enforce specific performance, it may elect to receive the Deposit as its sole
remedy, or, if the non-breaching Party is Purchaser, in addition to a return
of the Deposit, sue for Damages not to exceed an amount equal to the Deposit.

 LIMITATIONS; DISCLAIMERS AND WAIVERS_

  



  

Section 11.1 _Receipts_.

  



  

(a) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, any production from or
attributable to the Assigned Interests (and all products and
proceeds attributable thereto) and any other income, proceeds, receipts and
credits attributable to the Assigned Interests (excluding the Purchase Price)
which are not reflected in the adjustments to the Purchase Price following the
final adjustment pursuant to Section 9.5 shall be treated as follows: (i) all
production from or attributable to the Assigned Interests (and all products
and proceeds attributable thereto) and all other income, proceeds, receipts
and credits earned and Property Costs incurred with respect to the Assigned

and, to the extent received by or invoiced to Seller, Seller shall fully
disclose, account for and remit the same to Purchaser within ten (10) days of
Seller's receipt of the same, and (ii) all production from or attributable to
the Assigned Interests (and all products and proceeds attributable thereto)
and all other income, proceeds, receipts and credits earned and Property
Costs incurred with respect to the Assigned Interests to which Seller is

entitlement and responsibility of Seller and, to the extent received by or
invoiced to

  



    

54

 



    

Purchaser, Purchaser shall fully disclose, account for and remit the same to
Seller within ten (10) days of Purchaser's receipt of the same.

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement to the contrary,
Seller shall be entitled to retain (and Purchaser shall not be entitled to
any decrease to the Purchase Price in respect of) all overhead charges it has
collected, billed or which shall be billed later, relating to the Assets
operated by Seller and relating to the period from the Effective Time to the
date Seller relinquishes operatorship of the applicable Assets operated by
Seller, even if after the date of Closing.

  



  

(c) Following Closing, Purchaser agrees to reasonably cooperate with Seller,
at Seller's reasonable request (and at Seller's sole cost and expenses) in
Seller's exercise of its rights to refunds of, or rebate, abatement or
recovery for, certain costs in clause (c) in the definition of Excluded
Assets.

  



  

Section 11.2 _Assumption and Indemnification_.

  



  

(a) Without limiting Purchaser's rights to indemnity under this Article 11,
on the Closing Date, and except with respect to any Retained Obligations and
any Excluded Assets, Purchaser shall assume and hereby agrees to fulfill,
perform, pay and discharge (or cause to be fulfilled, performed, paid or
discharged) all of the Covered Liabilities of Seller related to, caused by,
arising out of, or attributable to or arising under or from the Assigned
Interests prior to, on, or after the Effective Time, including,
without limitation, the HHI Contract, the Decommissioning Obligations, the
Environmental Obligations and any other Covered Liabilities related to,
attributable to or arising under the operation and/or ownership of the Assets
(the foregoing, collectively, in each case including obligations triggered by
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, the "Assumed
Seller Obligations").

  



  

(b) From and after the Closing, Purchaser shall indemnify, defend and hold
harmless Seller Indemnitees from and against all Damages incurred or suffered
by Seller Indemnitees:

  



  

(i) caused by, arising out of or resulting from the Assumed Seller
Obligations;

  



  

(ii) caused by, arising out of or resulting from Purchaser's breach of any
of Purchaser's covenants or agreements that survive the Closing; or

  



  

(iii) caused by, arising out of or resulting from any breach of any
representation or warranty made by Purchaser contained in this Agreement or
in the certificate delivered by Purchaser pursuant to Section 9.3(k).

  



  

EVEN IF SUCH DAMAGES ARE CAUSED IN WHOLE OR IN PART BY THE NEGLIGENCE
(WHETHER SOLE, JOINT OR CONCURRENT, BUT EXCLUDING GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL
MISCONDUCT), STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER LEGAL FAULT OF SELLER INDEMNITEES OR
ANY OTHER PERSON.

  



    

55

 



    

(c) From and after the Closing, Seller shall indemnify, defend and hold
harmless Purchaser Indemnitees against and from all Damages actually suffered
by Purchaser Indemnitees to the extent (the "Seller Indemnity Obligations"):

  



  

(i) caused by, arising out of or resulting from any breach during the
applicable survival period of any of Seller's covenants or agreements that
survive the Closing;

  



  

(ii) caused by, arising out of or resulting from any breach during the
applicable survival period of any representation or warranty made by Seller
contained in this Agreement or in the certificate delivered by Seller pursuant
to Section 9.2(h);

  



  

(iii) caused by, arising out of or resulting from the Excluded Assets; and

  



  

(iv) caused by, arising out of or resulting from the Retained Obligations.

  



  

(d) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, any
claim for indemnity to which a Seller Indemnitee or Purchaser Indemnitee
is entitled must be asserted by and through Seller or Purchaser, as
applicable.

  



  

Section 11.3 _Indemnification Actions_.

  



  

(a) For purposes of this Article 11, the term "Indemnifying Party" when used
in connection with particular Damages shall mean the Party or Parties against
whom indemnification is sought pursuant to this Article 11, and the term
"Indemnified Party" when used in connection with particular Damages shall
mean the Person or Persons asserting the right to be indemnified with respect
to such Damages by another Party or Parties pursuant to this Article 11.
Without prejudice to and subject to Section 12.19 and the limitations of LBH
and LEO as the Seller, all claims by any Indemnified Party under this Article
11 shall be asserted and resolved as follows:

  



  

(b) In the event that (i) any suit, action, or legal, administrative,
arbitration or other alternative dispute resolution proceeding, hearing or
investigation (each, a "Proceeding") is asserted or instituted by any Person
other than the Parties or their Affiliates which could give rise to Damages
for which an Indemnifying Party could be liable to an Indemnified Party
under this Agreement (such Proceeding, a "Third Party Claim") or (ii) any
Indemnified Party under this Agreement shall have a claim to be indemnified
by any Indemnifying Party under this Agreement which does not involve a Third
Party Claim (such claim, a "Direct Claim" and, together with Third Party
Claims, "Claims"), the Indemnified Party shall, promptly after it becomes
aware of a Third Party Claim, or facts supporting a Direct Claim, send to the
Indemnifying Party a written notice specifying the nature of such Proceeding
and the amount or estimated amount thereof (which amount or estimated amount
shall not be conclusive of the final amount, if any, of such Proceeding) (a
"Claim Notice"), together with copies of the complaint served on or received
by the Indemnified Party in the case of a Third Party Claim; _provided_  that
the failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the
Indemnifying Party of its

  



    

56

 



    

obligations hereunder, except to the extent that such failure shall have
adversely prejudiced the Indemnifying Party.

  



  

(c) In the event of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall have
the right to defend the Indemnified Party against such Third Party Claim and
be entitled to appoint counsel of the Indemnifying Party's choice at the
expense of the Indemnifying Party in connection with such Proceeding (in
which case the Indemnifying Party shall not thereafter be responsible for the
fees and expenses of any separate counsel retained by any Indemnified Party
or any other costs or expenses with respect to the defense of a Third Party
Claim except as set forth below). Notwithstanding an Indemnifying Party\'s
election to defend such Third Party Claim and appoint counsel to represent an
Indemnified Party in connection with a Third Party Claim, an Indemnified Party
shall have the right to employ separate counsel, but the Indemnifying Party
shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate
counsel only if (i) the use of counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party to
represent the Indemnified Party would present such counsel with a material
conflict of interest that would prevent the retained counsel from providing an
adequate defense for the Indemnified Party or (ii) the Indemnifying Party
shall not have employed counsel to represent the Indemnified Party within a
reasonable time after notice of the institution of such Third Party Claim;
_provided_ , that notwithstanding such failure to employ counsel within a
reasonable time, the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to assume the
defense of such Third Party Claim by appointment of counsel reasonably
acceptable to the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall
thereafter cease to be responsible for the fees and expenses of counsel
appointed by the Indemnified Party. If requested by the Indemnifying Party,
the Indemnified Party agrees to cooperate with the Indemnifying Party and its
counsel in defending and contesting any Proceeding which the
Indemnifying Party defends, or, if appropriate and related to the Proceeding
in question, in making any counterclaim against the Person asserting the
Third Party Claim, or any cross-complaint against any Person. No Third Party
Claim may be settled or compromised (i) by the Indemnified Party without the
prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party or (ii) by the Indemnifying
Party without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (which
consent, in either case, shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned), unless, in the case of this clause (ii), the sole relief
provided is monetary damages that are paid in full by the Indemnifying Party.
In the event any Indemnified Party settles or compromises or consents to the
entry of any judgment with respect to any Third Party Claim without the prior
written consent of the Indemnifying Party (except in the event the
Indemnifying Party unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned its
consent), each Indemnified Party shall be deemed to have waived all rights
against the Indemnifying Party for indemnification under this Article 11 with
respect to such Third Party Claim. If the Indemnifying Party makes any
payment on any Third Party Claim, then the Indemnifying Party shall be
subrogated, to the extent of such payment, to all rights and remedies of the
Indemnified Party to any insurance benefits or other claims of the Indemnified
Party with respect to such Third Party Claim. Solely with respect to Third
Party Claims, from and after the delivery of a Claim Notice under this
Agreement, at the reasonable request of the Indemnifying Party, each
Indemnified Party shall grant the Indemnifying Party and its representatives
reasonable access to the books, records, representatives and properties of
such Indemnified Party to the extent reasonably related to the matters to
which the Claim Notice relates; _provided, however_ , that access shall not be
granted to any information which

  



    

57

 



    

is protected by attorney work product protections, attorney client
privileges, or any similar protections and privileges. All such access shall
be granted during normal business hours and shall be granted under conditions
which will not unreasonably interfere with the business and operations of
such Indemnified Party.

  



  

(d) In the event of a Direct Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall notify the
Indemnified Party within thirty (30) days of receipt of a Claim Notice in
case the Indemnifying Party disputes such claim.

  



  

Section 11.4 _Limitation on Actions_.

  



  

(a) All representations and warranties of Seller and Purchaser contained
herein as well as the Special Warranty set forth in the Conveyances shall
survive until the date that is eighteen (18) months counted from and after the
Closing Date and expire thereafter; _provided, however_ , that the
representations and warranties of Seller contained in Sections 4.2, 4.3, and
4.5, and the representations and warranties of Purchaser contained in
Sections 5.1, 5.2 and 5.4 shall survive indefinitely, the representations and
warranties of Seller contained in Section 4.7 shall survive until the date
that is thirty (30) days after the expiration of the applicable statute of
limitations. The covenants and other agreements of Seller and Purchaser set
forth in this Agreement to be performed on or before Closing shall expire on
the day following the Closing Date and each other covenant and agreement of
Seller and Purchaser shall survive the Closing until fully performed in
accordance with its terms and expire thereafter. Representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements shall terminate and be of no further
force and effect after the respective date of their expiration, after which
time no claim may be asserted thereunder by any Person; _provided_ that there
shall be no termination of any bona fide claim for indemnity asserted
pursuant to this Agreement with respect to such a representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement prior to its expiration or termination date.

  



  

(b) The indemnities in Sections 11.2(b)(ii) and 11.2(b)(iii) shall terminate
as of the termination date of each respective representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement that is subject to indemnification, except in each case
as to matters for which a specific written claim for indemnity has been
delivered to the Indemnifying Party on or before such termination date.
Purchaser's indemnities in Sections 6.4, and 11.2(b)(i) shall continue
without time limit, subject however to the applicable statute of limitations.
Seller's indemnities in Section 11.2(c)(i) and (ii) shall terminate as of the
termination date of each respective representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement that is subject to indemnification, except in each case as to
matters for which a specific written claim for indemnity has been delivered
to the Indemnifying Party on or before such termination date. Seller's
indemnity in Section 11.2(c)(iii) shall continue without time limit, subject
however to applicable statutes of limitations. Seller's indemnity in Section
11.2(c)(iv) shall terminate thirty (30) days after the expiration of the
applicable statute of limitations, unless terminated earlier as provided in
the definition of Retained Obligations under Article 13. Seller's indemnity in
Section 6.6 shall survive until the date that is eighteen (18) months counted
from and after the Closing Date and expire thereafter.

  



    

58

 



    

(c)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained elsewhere in this
Agreement, except for claims based on a breach of Seller's representations
and warranties in Sections 4.2, 4.3, 4.5 or 4.7:

  



  

(i) Seller shall not be required to defend and indemnify any Person under
Section 11.2(c)(ii) for any individual liability, loss, cost, expense, claim,
award or judgment that does not exceed Two Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars
($250,000);

  



  

(ii) Seller shall not have any liability for defense and indemnification
under Section 11.2(c)(ii) until and unless the aggregate amount of the
liability for all Damages for which Claim Notices are timely delivered by
Purchaser exceeds a deductible amount equal to two percent (2%) of the
Purchase Price (the "Indemnity Deductible"), after which point Purchaser (or
Purchaser Indemnitees) shall be entitled to claim Damages only in excess of
the Indemnity Deductible; and

  



  

(iii) Seller shall not be required to defend and indemnify Purchaser and
Purchaser Indemnitees under Section 11.2(c)(ii) for aggregate Damages in
excess of the Contingent Payments (as defined in Exhibit E hereto), and
notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any indemnification pursuant
to Section 11.2(c)(ii) shall be satisfied solely as follows: (A) solely with
respect to any such Claims that are covered by the Seller Policies, first by
any amounts recovered thereunder and (B) with respect to any amounts not so
recovered, as well as all other such Claims, effected and discharged solely
by satisfying any such Claims resolved in accordance with Section 11.3
against the Contingent Payments (including against any such Contingent
Payments made prior to such Claim).

  



  

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained elsewhere in this
Agreement, all (i) Claims based on a breach of Seller's representations and
warranties in Sections 4.2, 4.3, 4.5, or 4.7 or (ii) Claims under Sections
11.2(c)(i), 11.2(c)(iii) or 11.2(c)(iv) shall be satisfied first, from and to
the extent of the Contingent Payments (including against any such Contingent
Payments made prior to such Claim) (which shall in no way limit Seller's
liability under this Agreement except as expressly set forth in
Section 11.4(c)(iii) above) and, following the date upon which a Contingent
Payment is no longer potentially payable pursuant to the terms of Exhibit E,
shall thereafter be recoverable directly from Seller.

  



  

(e) Each Indemnified Party shall use commercially reasonably efforts to
mitigate any loss for which such Indemnified Party may seek
indemnification under this Agreement. If such Indemnified Party mitigates its
loss after the Indemnifying Party has paid the Indemnified Party under any
indemnification provision of this Agreement in respect of that loss, the
Indemnified Party must notify the Indemnifying Party and pay to the
Indemnifying Party the extent of the value of the benefit to the Indemnified
Party of that mitigation (less the Indemnified Party\'s reasonable costs of
mitigation) within two Business Days after the benefit is received.

  



  

(f) The amount of any Damages payable under Section 11.2 by the Indemnifying
Party shall be net of any amounts actually recovered by the Indemnified

  



    

59

 



    

Party under applicable insurance policies or from any other Person alleged to
be responsible therefor. If the Indemnified Party receives any amounts under
applicable insurance policies, or from any other Person alleged to be
responsible for any Damages, then such Indemnified Party shall
promptly reimburse the Indemnifying Party for any payment made or expense
incurred by such Indemnifying Party in connection with providing such
indemnification payment up to the amount received by the Indemnified Party,
net of any expenses incurred by such Indemnified Party in collecting such
amount.

  



  

(g) Each Indemnified Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
collect any amounts available under insurance coverage, or from any other
Person alleged to be responsible, for any Damages payable under Section 11.2.

  



  

(h) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, for purposes
of determining whether there has been a breach of a representation
or warranty, and for purposes of calculating the amount of Damages resulting
therefrom, all representations and warranties qualified by materiality,
Material Adverse Effect or other similar qualification shall be disregarded.

  



  

(i) (i) The representations and warranties of each of the Parties set forth

No amendment, modification or discharge of this Agreement, and no waiver
under this Agreement, shall be valid or binding unless set forth in writing
and duly executed by the Party against whom enforcement of the amendment,
modification, discharge or waiver is sought. Any such waiver shall constitute

any other respect or at any other time. The waiver by either of the Parties of
a breach of or a default under any of the provisions of this Agreement, or to
exercise any right or privilege under this Agreement, shall not be construed
as a waiver of any other breach or default of a similar nature, or as a waiver
of any of such provisions, rights or privileges under this Agreement.

  



  

Section 12.10 _Assignment; No Third Party Beneficiaries_.

Section 12.11 _Confidentiality Agreement_.

  



    

66

 



    

Subject to and upon the occurrence of Closing and as between the Parties
hereto only, the Confidentiality Agreement shall be deemed to have
terminated;  _provided, however_ , the Confidentiality Agreement shall remain
in force and effect with respect to the following, each of which shall be
considered "Confidential Information" as defined in and under the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement, (a) the terms of this Agreement and any documents
or information exchanged between the Parties pursuant hereto (except to the
extent the same constitutes an Asset hereunder), (b) any matters made
expressly subject to the Confidentiality Agreement pursuant to
this Agreement, (c) in the event Purchaser does not acquire all of the Assets
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, then all such Assets that are
not so acquired by Purchaser and any information or data related thereto and
(d) any information obtained by Seller or its Affiliates from Purchaser after
the Closing, including any information related to the Contingent Payments
described in Exhibit E; _provided, however_ , that with respect to any
information described in subparts (a), (b) or (d) above that is received by
Seller and/or its Affiliates post-Closing, Seller shall be deemed a "Receiving
Party" under the Confidentiality Agreement with respect to such information
and the obligations therein with respect to the Receiving Party shall be
applicable to Seller and/or its Affiliates with respect to such information.
In the event of a conflict between the Confidentiality Agreement and this
Agreement, then as between the Parties hereto the terms and provisions of this
Agreement shall prevail.

  



  

Section 12.12 _Entire Agreement_.

  



  

This Agreement and the documents to be executed hereunder and the Exhibits
and Schedules attached hereto, together with the Confidentiality
Agreement, constitute the entire agreement between the Parties pertaining to
the subject matter hereof, and supersede all prior
agreements, understandings, negotiations and discussions, whether oral or
written, of the Parties pertaining to the subject matter hereof. In the event
of a conflict between the Confidentiality Agreement and this Agreement, the
terms and provisions of this Agreement shall prevail.

  



  

Section 12.13 _Severability_.

  



  

If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced by any Law or public policy, all other terms
and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and
effect. Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon such determination that any term
or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to
effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in an
acceptable manner in order that the investments and the other transactions
contemplated hereby are consummated as originally contemplated to the
greatest extent possible.

  



  

Section 12.14 _Interpretation_.

  



  

(a) When a reference is made in this Agreement to Sections or Articles, such
reference shall be to a Section of this Agreement or an Article of this
Agreement, respectively, unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents and
headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and
shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.
The Schedules attached to this Agreement are incorporated herein by reference
and made a part hereof for all purposes, and references to

  



    

67

 



    

this Agreement also include such Schedules, unless the context in which used
shall otherwise require. Any capitalized terms used in any Schedule but not
otherwise defined therein shall have the meaning as defined in this
Agreement. References to any agreement or contract are to that agreement or
contract as amended, modified or supplemented from time to time in accordance
with the terms hereof and thereof. References to any Person include the
successors and permitted assigns of that Person. References to any statute are
to that statute, as amended from time to time, and to the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder. The words "hereby," "herein," "hereof,"
"hereunder," and words of similar import refer to this Agreement as a whole
(including any Schedules and Exhibits delivered herewith) and not merely to
the specific section, paragraph or clause in which such word appears. The
word "or" is not exclusive and whenever the words "include," "includes" or
"including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed
by the words "without limitation." Words in the singular form shall be
construed to include the plural and vice versa, unless the context otherwise
requires. Words importing the masculine gender shall include the feminine and
neutral genders and vice versa. "Writing," "written" and comparable terms
refer to printing, typing and other means of reproducing words (including
electronic media) in a visible form. References from or through any date
mean, unless otherwise specified, from and including or through and including,
respectively. For the purposes of this Agreement, any document that is
described as being "delivered," "furnished" or "made available" shall be
treated as such if a copy of such document has been put in the Data Room no
later than April 17, 2019, at 6:00 P.M. (Central Standard Time) or otherwise
provided to Purchaser or any of its representatives in electronic or hard-copy
format. In the event an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation
arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the
Parties and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or
disfavoring any Party by virtue of the authorship of any provisions of this
Agreement.

  



  

(b) Matters disclosed in each Schedule shall qualify both the representation
and warranty in which such Schedule is referenced. Matters may be disclosed
on a Schedule to this Agreement for purposes of information only. The fact
that any item of information is disclosed in a Schedule to this Agreement
shall not constitute an admission by such Party that such item is material,
that such item has had or would have a Material Adverse Effect or a material
adverse effect, as applicable, or that the disclosure of such be construed to
mean that such information is required to be disclosed by this Agreement.

  



  

Section 12.15 _Construction_.

  



  

Each of Seller and Purchaser has had substantial input into the drafting and
preparation of this Agreement and has had the opportunity to

to either punitive, SPECIAL, INDIRECT or

  



    

68

 



    

consequential damages in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby AND, AS SUCH, ENTITLEMENT IS ONLY WITH RESPECT TO ACTUAL
DAMAGES, and each of Purchaser and Seller, for itself and on behalf of its
Affiliates AND INDEMNITEES, hereby expressly waives any right to punitive,

brought in the United States federal courts located within Harris County,

courts, to personal jurisdiction in any action brought in the state courts
located in Harris County, Texas) with respect to any dispute, claim or
controversy arising out of or in relation to or in connection with this
Agreement, and each of the Parties agrees that any action instituted by it
against the other with respect to any such dispute, claim or
controversy (except to the extent a dispute, claim or controversy arising out
of or in relation to or in connection with (i) the determination of Purchase
Price adjustments pursuant to Section 9.5 is referred to an Independent
Expert, or (ii) any dispute, claim or controversy pertaining to title or
environmental matters, whether pursuant to Section 7.1 through 7.6 or
otherwise set forth in the Agreement, shall be finally and exclusively
submitted to, and determined by, binding arbitration as provided for in this
Section 12.17) will be instituted exclusively in the United States District
Court for the Southern District of Texas, Houston Division (or, if
jurisdiction is not available in the United States District Court for the
Southern District of Texas, Houston Division, then exclusively in the state
courts located in Harris County, Texas). THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE TRIAL BY
JURY IN ANY PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM BROUGHT BY ANY PARTY AGAINST ANOTHER
IN ANY MANNER WHATSOEVER ARISING OUT OF OR IN RELATION TO OR IN CONNECTION
WITH THIS AGREEMENT.

  



  

(b) It is agreed, as a severable and independent arbitration agreement
separately enforceable from the remainder of this Agreement, that any
dispute, claim or controversy pertaining to any title or any environmental
matter shall be finally and exclusively submitted to, and determined by,
binding arbitration to be conducted in Houston, Texas.

  



  

(c) Any arbitration pertaining to an environmental matter, including,
without limitation, Environmental Defect, Environmental Defect
Notice, Environmental Defect Value, Remediation, Environmental Information,
Environmental Laws or Environmental Obligations, shall be conducted before
Hunton Andrews Kurth LLP or, if the Parties mutually agree, another
environmental consultant or attorney experienced in the examination of
environmental matters regarding properties located in the Outer Continental
Shelf and which environmental consultant or attorney shall have at least ten

  



    

69

 



    

(10) years\' experience (the "Environmental Referee"); provided, however, if
an Environmental Referee elects not to accept such appointment, a new
environmental consultant or attorney shall be selected by the Parties in
accordance with the same criteria. If Seller and Purchaser cannot agree on a
substitute Environmental Referee within fifteen (15) days following
notification that an Environmental Referee has elected to not accept the
appointment, the Houston office of the American Arbitration Association shall
select a substitute Environmental Referee in accordance with the same
criteria. For any such dispute resolution process, Seller and Purchaser shall
present a written statement of their respective positions on the dispute
(including their respective calculations of any Remediation or
Environmental Defect Value in dispute) to the Environmental Referee within
thirty (30) days after the Closing Date or, if an Environmental
Referee elects not to accept the appointment, within fifteen (15) days
following the date a substitute Environmental Referee is selected, whichever
is later, and the Environmental Referee shall make a determination of all
points of disagreement in accordance with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement within thirty (30) days of receipt of such statements. The
determination by the Environmental Referee shall be conclusive and binding on
the Parties and shall be enforceable against any Party in any court of
competent jurisdiction. In making the determination, the Environmental
Referee shall be bound by the rules set forth in this Section 12.17 and, in
each case, may consider such other matters as in the opinion of the
Environmental Referee are necessary or helpful to make a
proper determination. Additionally, each Environmental Referee may consult
with and engage disinterested third Persons to advise the
Environmental Referee, including environmental attorneys or consultants. The
Environmental Referee shall act as an expert for the limited purpose of
determining the specified disputed matters submitted to it pursuant to this
Section 12.17(c) and may not award (i) damages, interest or penalties to any
Party with respect to any matter, (ii) any Environmental Defect Value of an
alleged Environmental Condition of more than the Environmental Defect Value
claimed by Purchaser, (iii) any Environmental Defect Value of an
alleged Environmental Condition of less than the Environmental Defect Value
claimed by Seller, (iv) any Environmental Defect Value of an alleged
Environmental Condition greater than the Allocated Value of the affected Asset
or (v) attorneys' fees incurred in connection with such arbitration.

  



  

(d) Any arbitration pertaining to a title matter, including, without
limitation, Title Defect, Title Defect Notice, Title Defect Property, Title
Defect Amount, Defensible Title, Permitted Encumbrances or Special Warranty,
shall be conducted before a Defect Referee pursuant to the then current
Commercial Arbitration Rules of the AAA. In making a determination, the Defect
Referee shall be bound by the rules set forth in this Section 12.17 and may
consider such other matters as in the opinion of the Defect Referee are
necessary or helpful to make a determination; provided, however, in
determining the existence or amount of any Title Defect or Title
Defect Amount, Purchaser may not submit any evidence, records, materials,

delivered to Seller prior to the expiration of the Examination Period, unless

Referee may consult with and engage any disinterested third party to advise
the Defect Referee, including title attorneys and petroleum engineers. In
rendering the award, the Defect Referee shall be limited to selecting either
Seller's position or Purchaser's position on each of the disputed Title

70

 



    

to the contrary, the Defect Referee shall have exclusive, final, and binding
authority with respect to the scope of the Defect Referee's authority with
respect to any dispute arising under or related to this Section 12.17(d), or
any disputed Title Defects or Title Defect Amounts and in no event shall any
dispute as to the authority of the Defect Referee to determine any such
disputes be subject to litigation in any court of competent jurisdiction. The
Defect Referee shall act as an expert for the limited purpose of determining
the interpretation and effect of this Section 12.17(d) and any and all
specific disputed Title Defect Amounts submitted by any Party and may not
award any damages, interest, penalties or attorneys' fees to any Party with
respect to any matter.

  



  

(e) The Environmental Referee and Defect Referee (each an "Arbitrator")
shall apply the laws specified in Section 12.7 of this Agreement.

  



  

(f) No Arbitrator shall be selected who has had an affiliation with either
Party or any Affiliate of either Party within the five (5) year period
preceding the arbitration, or have any financial interest in the dispute,
controversy, or claim. If any Arbitrator should die, withdraw, or otherwise
become incapable of serving, or refuse to serve, a successor Arbitrator shall
be selected and appointed in the same manner as the original Arbitrator.

  



  

(g) In the event of any conflict between the Commercial Arbitration Rules of
the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") and the provisions of this
Section 12.17, the provisions of this Section 12.17 shall govern and control.
To the extent that they are not inconsistent with the Commercial Arbitration
Rules of the AAA, evidentiary questions shall be governed by the Texas
Rules of Evidence. Any arbitration shall proceed in the absence of a Party
who, after due notice, fails to answer or appear; provided, however, that an
award shall not be made solely on the default of a Party, but the Arbitrator
shall require the Party who is present to submit such evidence as the
Arbitrator may determine is reasonably required to make an award. The
Arbitrator's award shall be in writing and shall set forth findings and
conclusions upon which the Arbitrator based the award. Except as may be
required by law, neither a Party nor the Arbitrator may disclose the
existence, content, or results of any arbitration hereunder without the prior
written consent of all of Parties. The Parties agree that failure or refusal
of a Party to pay its required share of the deposits for Arbitrator
compensation or administrative charges shall constitute a waiver by that Party
to present evidence or cross-examine witness. In such event, the other Party
shall be required to present evidence and legal argument as the
Arbitrator may require for the making of an award. Such waiver shall not
allow for a default judgment against the non-paying Party in the absence of
evidence presented as provided for above. Consequential, indirect, special,
exemplary or punitive damages shall not be allowed except those payable to
third parties (and permitted under Section 12.16) for which liability is
allocated among the Parties by the arbitration award. Any award pursuant to
any arbitration shall be final and binding upon the Parties and judgment on
the award may be entered in any federal or state court having jurisdiction, or
application may be made to such court for a judicial confirmation of the
award and an order and judgment enforcing the same, as the case may be. The
provisions of this Section shall survive the termination of this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section shall not prevent either Party
from seeking temporary or preliminary injunctive relief from a court of
competent

  



    

71

 



    

jurisdiction under appropriate circumstances; provided, however, such action
shall not constitute a waiver of the provisions of this Section.

  



  

Section 12.18 _Non-Recourse_.

  



  

The Parties hereby acknowledge and agree that no Person other than the
Parties hereto, including any current or former director, officer,
employee, member, manager, director, partner, investor, shareholder, agent,
representative or Affiliate (the "Non-Recourse Parties"), shall have any
liability to the Parties hereto, and the Parties hereto shall have no recourse
against any Person other than the Parties hereto in connection with any
Damages, claim or cause of action arising out of, or in relation to, this
Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby and any instruments,
documents or discussions in connection therewith, whether pursuant to
any claims for negligence or misconduct or any other claims otherwise
available or asserted at Law or in equity; provided that the foregoing is not
intended to prevent any claims against any Non-Recourse Party arising under
the theory of piercing the corporate veil or out of such Non-Recourse Party's
fraud or willful misconduct. Each Non-Recourse Party is expressly intended as
a third-party beneficiary of this Agreement.

  



  

Section 12.19 _Limitation on Liability_.

  



  

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, or in any exhibit
or schedule hereto, each of the obligations, liabilities,
