soon as practicable after the acquisition of Shares in accordance with the
Offer and in accordance with Section 251(h) of the Delaware General
Corporation Law (the " _DGCL_ "), at the Effective Time Merger Sub will merge

approved this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including

and subject to the conditions set forth herein;

 



 

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company (the " _Company Board of
Directors_ ") has determined that the consideration to be paid for each Share
in the Offer is fair to the holders of such Shares, and that the Merger and
the transactions contemplated hereby are advisable, fair to and in the best

WHEREAS, Parent, as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub, will approve this
Agreement immediately following its execution;

 



 

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and
as a condition and inducement to Parent entering into this Agreement, certain
holders of the Shares (the " _Principal Stockholders_ ") have entered into
tender agreements, dated as of the date of this Agreement, in substantially

WHEREAS, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the
Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

NOW, THEREFORE, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows:

 



 

SECTION 1 \- THE OFFER AND THE MERGER

 



 

1.1. _The Offer_.

 



 

(a) Provided that this Agreement has not been validly terminated in accordance
with _Section 8_ of this Agreement, Merger Sub will, and Parent will cause
Merger Sub to, commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 promulgated under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (together with the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder, the " _Exchange Act_ ")), the Offer no
later than the tenth (10th) business day following the date of this Agreement.
The obligations of Merger Sub to accept for payment and to pay for any Shares
validly tendered and not withdrawn prior to the expiration of the Offer (as it
may be extended in accordance with this _Section 1.1(a)_) will be subject
only to the conditions set forth in _Annex II_ (each such condition, an "
_Offer Condition_ "). Subject to the prior satisfaction or waiver by Parent
and Merger Sub of the Offer Conditions, Merger Sub will consummate the Offer
in accordance with the terms of such Offer, and accept for payment and pay for
all Shares tendered and not withdrawn promptly following the acceptance of
Shares for payment in accordance with the Offer. The Offer will be made by an
offer to purchase (the " _Offer to Purchase_ ") that contains the terms set
forth in this Agreement and the Offer Conditions. Parent and Merger Sub shall
cause the Acceptance Time to be 12:01 AM ET on the business day that
immediately follows the Expiration Date. Parent and Merger Sub reserve the
right to waive any of such conditions, to increase the Offer Price and to make
any other changes in the Offer. Merger Sub will not, and Parent will cause
Merger Sub not to, decrease the Offer Price, change the form of consideration
payable in the Offer, decrease the number of Shares sought in the Offer,
amend, modify or waive the Minimum Condition, impose additional conditions to,
or amend, modify or waive the conditions in a manner adverse to any holder of
Shares, or provide for a "subsequent offering period" in accordance with Rule
14d-11 promulgated under the Exchange Act, except as set forth below, in each
case, without the prior written consent of the Company. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, but subject to the
parties respective termination rights under _Section 8_:

 



 

(i) Merger Sub shall extend the Offer (A) for any extension period required by
any rule, regulation or interpretation of the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission (the " _SEC_ "), its staff or the New York Stock Exchange (the "
_NYSE_ "), the Nasdaq Stock Market or their respective staffs, (B) for one or
more extension periods of up to ten (10) business days per extension period
(or a longer extension period approved by the Company), if, as of the
applicable Expiration Date, either (I) any waiting period (and any extensions
thereof) or any approvals or clearances applicable to the Offer or the
consummation of the Merger in accordance with the HSR Act have not expired,
been terminated or been obtained, as applicable or (II) any of the Offer
Conditions set forth in Section 1 or Section 2 of _Annex II_ hereof is not
satisfied; and (C) for up to two (2) successive extension periods of ten (10)
business days per extension period, if, at the applicable Expiration Date, (I)
there has not been a Company Adverse

 



      
 

 



 

Recommendation Change, (II) each Offer Condition other than the Minimum
Condition is capable of being satisfied, and (III) the Minimum Condition is
not satisfied; and

 



 

(ii) Merger Sub, without the consent of the Company, may extend the Offer if,
as of any Expiration Date, any Offer Condition is not satisfied and has not
been irrevocably waived by Parent and Merger Sub in writing, for additional
periods of up to ten (10) business days per extension period (or a longer
extension period as may be approved in advance by the Company), to permit all
of the Offer Conditions to be satisfied;

 



 

 _provided_ _,_ _however_ , that in no event will Merger Sub be required to
extend the Offer beyond the valid termination of this Agreement in compliance
with Section 8. Merger Sub will not terminate the Offer prior to any scheduled
Expiration Date without the prior written consent of the Company except in the
event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 8_. In addition,
in the event this Agreement is terminated in accordance with the terms of
_Section 8_, Merger Sub will at such time irrevocably and unconditionally
terminate the Offer.

 



 

(b) On the date of commencement of the Offer, Parent and Merger Sub will file
with the SEC, in accordance with Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange
Act, a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with respect to the Offer
(together with all amendments, supplements and exhibits thereto, the "
_Schedule TO_ "). The Schedule TO will include, as exhibits, the Offer to
Purchase and a form of letter of transmittal and summary advertisement and all
information required by applicable Law (collectively, together with any
amendments and supplements thereto, the " _Offer Documents_ "). Subject to
_Section 5.2_, the Company hereby consents to the inclusion in the Offer
Documents of the recommendation and the approval of the Company Board of
Directors referenced in _Section 3.3(b)_. Subject to the Companys compliance
in all material respects with _Section 1.2(c)_, Parent and Merger Sub will
take all actions necessary to cause the Offer Documents to be filed with the
SEC and disseminated to holders of the Shares, in each case, as and to the
extent required by Law. Parent, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other
hand, will promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the
Offer Documents if and to the extent that such information will have become
false or misleading in any material respect or as otherwise required by Law.
Parent and Merger Sub will take all actions necessary to cause the Offer
Documents as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to holders
of the Shares, in each case, as and to the extent required by Law. The Company
will be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Schedule
TO and any amendment thereto before it is filed with the SEC, and Parent and
Merger Sub will consider any such comments in good faith. In addition, Parent
and Merger Sub will provide the Company with any comments, whether written or
oral, that Parent, Merger Sub or their counsel may receive from time to time
prior to the expiration or termination of the Offer, from the SEC or its staff
with respect to the Offer Documents, promptly after receipt of such comments,
and any written or oral responses thereto, and the Company will have the right
to consult with Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel prior to responding to
any such comments, either in written or oral form.

 



 

(c) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, unless extended in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the Offer shall expire at 12:00
midnight Eastern Time on the twentieth (20th) business day (calculated in
accordance with Rule 14d-1(g)(3) and 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) following
the commencement of the Offer (the " _Initial_

 



      
 

 



 

 _Expiration Date_ ") or, if the Offer has been extended in accordance with
this Agreement, at the time and date to which the Offer has been so extended
(the Initial Expiration Date, or such later time and date to which the Offer
has been extended in accordance with this Agreement, the " _Expiration Date_
").

 



 

(d) Parent will provide, or cause to be provided, to Merger Sub promptly
following the Acceptance Time, all funds necessary to pay the aggregate Offer
Price with respect to Shares that have been validly tendered and not withdrawn
in accordance with the Offer and that Merger Sub is obligated to accept for
payment in accordance with the Offer and permitted to accept for payment in
accordance with Law.

 



 

1.2. _Company Actions_.

 



 

(a) Subject to _Section 5.2_, the Company hereby approves of and consents to
the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

(b) On the date the Offer is commenced, the Company will, in a manner that
complies with Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act, file with the SEC
a Tender Offer Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9
(together with all amendments, supplements and exhibits thereto, the "
_Schedule 14D-9_ ") which will, subject to _Section 5.2_, contain the
recommendation of the Company Board of Directors referenced in _Section
3.3(b)_, all information required by Law, and the notice and other information
required by Section 262(d)(2) of the DGCL such that the Schedule 14D-9 will
constitute a valid notice of appraisal rights under Section 262(d)(2) of the
DGCL). Subject to Parent and Merger Subs compliance in all material respect
with the terms of _Section 1.1(b)_, the Company further agrees to take all
actions necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9 to be filed with the SEC and
disseminated to holders of the Shares, in each case, as and to the extent
required by Law. The Company will adopt the Stockholder List Date as the
record date for the purpose of receiving the notice required by Section
262(d)(2) of the DGCL; _provided_ , _however_ , that such record date will not
be more than ten (10) calendar days prior to the date that the Schedule 14D-9
is first mailed. The Company will forward to Parent, solely for informational
purposes, a correct and complete copy of the written version of the opinion
from the Companys financial advisors referenced in _Section 3.26_ promptly
following the execution of this Agreement and in no event later than two (2)
business days after the date of this Agreement. The Company, on the one hand,
and Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, will promptly correct and
supplement any information provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and
to the extent that such information will have become false or misleading in
any material respect or as otherwise required by Law. The Company agrees to
take all actions necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9 as so corrected to be
filed with the SEC and disseminated to holders of the Shares, in each case, as
and to the extent required by Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that any such
filing of the corrected Schedule 14D-9 will not, without the prior written
consent of Parent, waive, extend or restart the notice period for purposes of
Section 262(d)(2) of the DGCL. Parent and Merger Sub will be given the
opportunity to review and comment on the Schedule 14D-9 and any amendment
thereto before filing with the SEC, and the Company will consider any such
comments in good faith. In addition, the Company agrees to provide Parent and
Merger Sub any comments, whether written or oral, that the Company or its
counsel may receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff with respect
to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after receipt of such comments, and to consult
with

 



      
 

 



 

Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel prior to responding to any such comments,
either in written or oral form.

 



 

(c) The Company will promptly furnish, or cause to be furnished, to Parent or
Merger Sub mailing labels, security position listings and all available
listings and computer files containing the names and addresses of the record
holders of the Shares as of a recent date (such date, the " _Stockholder List
Date_ "), and of those Persons becoming record holders subsequent to such
date, and will promptly furnish Parent or Merger Sub with such information and
assistance (including lists of holders of the Shares, updated periodically,
and their addresses, mailing labels and lists of security positions) as Parent
or Merger Sub or its agents may reasonably request. Subject to Law, such
information will be held confidential by Parent and Merger Sub in accordance
with the Confidentiality Agreement, dated July 31, 2018, by and between Parent
and the Company (as amended, the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "). Parent and
Merger Sub shall, and shall cause their agents to, use such information only
in connection with the making of the Offer pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement. If this Agreement shall be terminated, Parent shall, upon request,
deliver, and shall cause its agents to deliver, to the Company (or destroy)
all copies and any extracts or summaries from such information then in their
possession or control. For the avoidance of doubt, the parties agree that the
Confidentiality Agreement does not restrict any action taken to prepare, file
or disseminate the Offer Documents and any other documents necessary to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, in each case, in the manner
contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

1.3. _The Merger_.

 



 

(a) On the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, at the

Merger Sub will be vested in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts,
liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub will be the debts,
liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

(b) At the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation of the Company

(c) At the Effective Time, and without any further action on the part of the
Company or Merger Sub, the bylaws of the Company will be amended and restated
in their entirety to be identical to the bylaws of Merger Sub as in effect
immediately prior to the

 



      
 

 



 

Effective Time (except that such bylaws will be amended to reflect that the
name of the Surviving Corporation will be Invuity, Inc.), and, as so amended,
will be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or
amended as provided by the DGCL, the certificate of incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation and such bylaws.

 



 

1.4. _Effective Time_. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company will cause a
certificate of merger complying with Section 251 of the DGCL (the "
_Certificate of Merger_ "), to be executed and filed on the Closing Date (or
on such other date as Parent and the Company may agree) with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware as provided in the DGCL. The Merger will become
effective on the time and date on which the Certificate of Merger has been
duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or such later
time and date as is specified in the Certificate of Merger, such time referred

1.5. _The Closing_. On the terms and subject to the conditions of this
Agreement and in accordance with the DGCL (including Section 251(h) of the
DGCL), the closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") will occur at 9:00 a.m.
(Eastern time) on the same date as the date on which the Acceptance Time
occurs unless otherwise agreed by the parties hereto, except that if of all of
the conditions set forth in _Section 7_ capable of satisfaction prior to the
Closing have not at such time been satisfied or waived, then the Closing will
occur no later than the first business day on which all such conditions are
satisfied or waived (the " _Closing Date_ "), at the offices of Ropes and Gray
LLP, Prudential Tower, 800 Boylston Street, Boston, Massachusetts 02199,
unless another date or place is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto.

 



 

1.6. _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation_. The directors of
Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time will, from and after the
Effective Time, be the directors of the Surviving Corporation, and the
officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time will, from and
after the Effective Time, be the officers of the Surviving Corporation, in
each case, until their respective successors have been duly elected,
designated or qualified, or until their earlier death, disqualification,
resignation or removal in accordance with the Surviving Corporations
certificate of incorporation and bylaws.

 



 

1.7. _Subsequent Actions_. The parties hereto will take all necessary action
to cause the Merger to become effective as soon as practicable following the
Expiration Date without a meeting of the stockholders of the Company, as
provided in Section 251(h) of the DGCL. If at any time after the Effective
Time the Surviving Corporation determines, in its sole discretion, that any
deeds, bills of sale, assignments, assurances or any other actions or things
are necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise
in the Surviving Corporation its right and title to, or interest in, any of
the rights, properties or assets of either the Company or Merger Sub held or
to be held by the Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in connection with,
the Merger or otherwise to carry out this Agreement, then the officers and
directors of the Surviving Corporation will be authorized to execute and
deliver, in the name and on behalf of either the Company or Merger Sub, all
such deeds, bills of sale, instruments of conveyance, assignments and
assurances and to take and do, in the name and on behalf of each such
corporation or otherwise, all such other actions and things as may be
necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm all right and title to, or
interest in, such rights, properties or assets in the Surviving Corporation or
otherwise to carry out this Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

SECTION 2 \- CONVERSION OF SECURITIES

 



 

2.1. _Conversion of Capital Stock_. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holders of any Shares or any
shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of Merger Sub (" _Merger
Sub Common Stock_ "):

 



 

(a) _Sub Common Stock_. Each issued and outstanding share of Merger Sub Common
Stock will be converted into and become one (1) fully paid and nonassessable
share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

(b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock. _All Shares that
are owned by the Company as treasury stock and any Shares owned by Parent or
Merger Sub will automatically be cancelled and retired and will cease to
exist, and no consideration will be payable in exchange therefor.

 



 

(c) _Conversion of Shares_. Each issued and outstanding Share (other than
Shares to be cancelled in accordance with _Section 2.1(b)_ and other than
Dissenting Shares) will be converted into the right to receive the Offer
Price, payable to the holder thereof in cash, without interest (the " _Merger
Consideration_ "). From and after the Effective Time, all such Shares will no
longer be outstanding and will automatically be cancelled and retired and will
cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate (a " _Certificate_ ") or
book-entry share (a " _Book-Entry Share_ ") representing any such Shares will
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the
Merger Consideration therefor, without interest thereon, upon the surrender of
such Certificate or Book-Entry Share in accordance with _Section 2.2_.

 



 

2.2. _Exchange of Certificates_.

 



 

(a) _Paying Agent_. Parent will designate Computershare Trust Company, N.A. or
another bank or trust company that is reasonably acceptable to the Company to
act as agent for the holders of the Shares in connection with the Merger (the
" _Paying Agent_ ") and to receive the funds to which holders of the Shares
will become entitled in accordance with _Section 2.1(c)_. Parent will cause
the Surviving Corporation to provide to the Paying Agent, immediately after
the Effective Time, cash necessary to pay for all Shares converted in the
Merger into the right to receive the Merger Consideration (the " _Exchange
Fund_ "). If the Exchange Fund is inadequate to pay the amounts to which
holders of the Shares are entitled in accordance with _Section 2.1(c)_,
Parent will promptly deposit, or cause the Surviving Corporation promptly to
deposit, additional cash with the Paying Agent sufficient to make all payments
of Merger Consideration, and Parent and the Surviving Corporation will in any
event be liable for payment thereof. The Paying Agent may invest the cash in
the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent. Any interest and other income
resulting from such investments will be paid to Parent.

 



 

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time, the Paying Agent
will mail to each holder of record of a Certificate or a Book-Entry Share,
which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding Shares,
whose shares were converted in accordance with _Section 2.1(c)_ into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration (i) a letter of transmittal (which
will specify that delivery will be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificate or Book-Entry Shares will pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates or Book-

 



      
 

 



 

Entry Shares to the Paying Agent and will be in such form and have such other
customary provisions as Parent and the Company may reasonably agree) and (ii)
instructions for effecting the surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares in exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of
a Certificate or Book-Entry Share for cancellation to the Paying Agent or to
such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with such
letter of transmittal, duly executed and properly completed and such other
documents as may be reasonably requested by the Paying Agent, the holder of
such Certificate or Book-Entry Share will be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor the Merger Consideration (such payments to be net of applicable Taxes
withheld in accordance with _Section 2.7_) for each Share formerly
represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share, and the Certificate or
Book-Entry Share so surrendered will forthwith be cancelled. Until surrendered
as contemplated by this _Section 2.2_, each Certificate or Book-Entry Share
will be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the
right to receive the Merger Consideration in cash as contemplated by this
_Section 2.2_, without interest thereon, and will not evidence any interest
in, or any right to exercise the rights of a stockholder or other equity
holder of, the Company or the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

(c) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Shares_. At the Effective
Time, the stock transfer books of the Company will be closed and thereafter
there will be no further registration of transfers of Shares on the records of
the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares evidencing ownership of Shares outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time will cease to have any rights with respect to such
Shares, except as otherwise provided for herein or by Law. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the
Surviving Corporation, then they will be cancelled and exchanged as provided
in this _Section 2_.

 



 

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund; No Liability_. At any time following twelve
(12) months after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will be
entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any
interest received with respect thereto) made available to the Paying Agent and
not disbursed (or for which disbursement is pending subject only to the Paying
Agents routine administrative procedures) to holders of Certificates and
Book-Entry Shares, and thereafter such holders will be entitled to look only
to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other
similar Laws) only as general creditors thereof with respect to the Merger
Consideration payable upon due surrender of their Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares, without any interest thereon. Nonetheless, none of Parent, the
Surviving Corporation nor the Paying Agent will be liable to any holder of a
Certificate or Book-Entry Share for Merger Consideration delivered to a public
official in accordance with any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law. If Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are not surrendered prior to
two (2) years after the Effective Time, unclaimed Merger Consideration payable
with respect to such Shares will, to the extent permitted by Law, become the
property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or
interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 



 

(e) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate will have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent,
the posting by such Person of a bond in such amount as Parent may reasonably
direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made

 



      
 

 



 

against it or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Certificate, the
Paying Agent will deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate the applicable Merger Consideration with respect thereto.

 



 

2.3. _Dissenting Shares_.

 



 

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Shares
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who
is entitled to demand, and has properly demanded, appraisal of such Shares
pursuant to, and who has complied with the terms of, Section 262 of the DGCL
(the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") will not be converted into a right to receive
the Merger Consideration, unless such holder fails to perfect or withdraws or
otherwise loses his, her or its right to appraisal. From and after the
Effective Time, a stockholder who has properly exercised such appraisal rights
will not have any rights of a stockholder of the Company or the Surviving
Corporation with respect to such Shares, except those provided in accordance
with Section 262 of the DGCL. A holder of Dissenting Shares will be entitled
to receive payment of the appraised value of such Shares held by him, her or
it in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL, unless, after the Effective
Time, such holder fails to perfect or withdraws or otherwise loses his, her or
its right to appraisal, in which case such Shares will be converted into and
represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without interest
thereon, upon surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, in
accordance with _Section 2.2_.

 



 

(b) The Company will give Parent (i) prompt written notice of any written
demands for appraisal (including copies of such demands), attempted
withdrawals of such demands and any other communications received by the
Company relating to rights of appraisal and (ii) the opportunity to
participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for
appraisal. Except with the prior written consent of Parent, the Company will
not voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or
settle or offer to settle any such demands for appraisal.

 



 

2.4. _Company Incentive Plans_.

 



 

(a) At least twenty-four (24) hours prior to the Effective Time, each stock
option (the " _Company Options_ ") granted in accordance with either of the
Companys 2005 Stock Incentive Plan or 2015 Equity Incentive Plan (the "
_Company Stock Plans_ ") and that is outstanding at such time will vest with
respect to time-based vesting in full and with respect to performance-based
vesting assuming performance metrics are achieved at target, to the extent not
already vested. At the Effective Time, each then-outstanding Company Option
will be canceled and will immediately cease to be outstanding, without any
payment with respect to such Company Option or cancellation thereof except as
provided in the following sentence. In full satisfaction of the cancellation
of any Company Option described in the immediately preceding sentence that had
a per-share exercise price less than the Offer Price, Parent will cause the
Surviving Corporation to, following the Effective Time, pay from its payroll
account, in accordance with the general payroll practices of the Surviving
Corporation, to the holder of such Company Option, an amount in cash in
respect thereof equal to the product of (i) the excess, if any, of the Offer
Price over the per-share exercise price of such Company Option, _multiplied
by_ (ii) the number of Shares subject thereto (such payments, if any, to be
net of applicable Taxes

 



      
 

 



 

withheld in accordance with _Section 2.7_ and without interest). For the
avoidance of doubt, no consideration will be paid with respect to any Company
Option that has a per-share exercise price that is greater than, or equal to,
the Offer Price. As of the Effective Time, no Person will retain any rights
with respect to any previously outstanding Company Options other than the
rights of a holder to receive any payment contemplated by this _Section
2.4(a)_.

 



 

(b) At the Acceptance Time, each restricted stock unit granted by the Company
in accordance with a Company Stock Plan (the " _Company RSUs_ ") that is
unvested and outstanding immediately prior to the Acceptance Time will vest in
full to the extent not already vested. At the Effective Time, each then-
outstanding Company RSU will be canceled and will immediately cease to be
outstanding, without any payment with respect to such Company RSU or
cancellation thereof except as provided in the following sentence. In full
satisfaction of the cancellation of any Company RSU described in the
immediately preceding sentence, Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation
to, following the Effective Time, pay from its payroll account, in accordance
with the general payroll practices of the Surviving Corporation, to the holder
of such Company RSU, an amount in cash in respect thereof equal to the Merger
Consideration (such payments, if any, to be net of applicable Taxes withheld
in accordance with _Section 2.7_ and without interest). As of the Effective
Time, no Person will retain any rights with respect to any previously
outstanding Company RSUs other than the rights of a holder to receive any
payment contemplated by this _Section 2.4(b)_.

 



 

(c) As of the Effective Time, the Company Stock Plans will terminate and all
rights under any other plan, program or arrangement providing for the issuance
or grant of any other interest with respect to the capital stock of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary will be cancelled. The Company will take, or
cause to be taken, all actions reasonably necessary to effectuate this
_Section 2.4_, including sending the requisite notices, obtaining any
necessary resolutions of the Company Board of Directors or a committee
thereof, and obtaining all consents necessary to cash out and cancel, as
described in _Sections 2.4(a)_ through _2.4(b)_ all Company Options, Company
RSUs and any other awards under the Company Stock Plans (the " _Company Stock
Plan Awards_ ") so as to ensure that, after the Effective Time, no Person will
have any rights under the Company Stock Plans other than the right to receive
the payments, if any, contemplated by _Section 2.4(a)_ or _2.4(b)_.

 



 

2.5. _Treatment of Warrants_. At the Effective Time, each warrant to purchase
Shares (each, a " _Warrant_ ") that remains unexercised and outstanding prior
to the Closing, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of
the holder thereof, be cancelled and in full consideration of such
cancellation, will be converted into and thereafter evidence the right to
receive, without interest, an amount in cash equal to the product of (a) the
aggregate number of Shares underlying such Warrant, _multiplied by_ (b) the
excess, if any, of the Offer Price over the per Share exercise price under
such Warrant. _Section 2.5_ of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth, as
of the close of business on the Capitalization Date, (i) each Warrant, (ii)
the number of Shares issuable thereunder, (iii) the expiration date, (iv) the
exercise price or strike price (if any) relating thereto, (v) the grant date
and (vi) the applicable vesting schedule, the amount vested and outstanding
and the amount unvested and outstanding. For the avoidance of doubt, if the
per share exercise price under any Warrant is equal to or greater than the
Offer Price, such Warrant will be cancelled as of the Effective Time without
payment therefor and will have no further force or effect.

 



       
 

 



 

2.6. _Section 16_. The Company Board of Directors will, to the extent
necessary, take appropriate action, prior to or as of the Acceptance Time, to
approve, for purposes of Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act the disposition and
cancellation of Shares (and related derivative securities) resulting from the
transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

2.7. _Withholding_. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation
will be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause the Paying Agent to deduct
and withhold, from any amounts payable or otherwise deliverable in accordance
with this Agreement or any ancillary agreement to any holder or former holder
of Shares, or Company Stock Plan Awards, in each case, directly or through an
authorized payroll agent, such amounts as are required to be deducted or
withheld therefrom in accordance with the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the " _Code_ "), or any other applicable federal, state, local or
non-U.S. Tax Law. To the extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld, such
amounts will be treated for all purposes under this Agreement and any other
agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would
otherwise have been paid. Any amount so withheld will timely be remitted to
the appropriate Governmental Authority. Without limiting the foregoing and for
the avoidance of doubt, the Company will satisfy, or cause to be satisfied,
timely and in full, all tax withholdings required with respect to the vesting
or payment events with respect to any Company Stock Plan Award for which the
required tax remittance is due prior to the Effective Time.

 



 

2.8. _Transfer Taxes_. If any payment in accordance with the Offer or the
Merger is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the
surrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Share is registered, it will be a
condition of payment that (a) the Certificate or Book-Entry Shares surrendered
will be properly endorsed or will be otherwise in proper form for transfer and
(b) the Person requesting such payment will have paid all transfer and other
Taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered
holder of the Certificate or Book-Entry Share surrendered or will have
established to the satisfaction of Parent that such Tax either has been paid
or is not applicable. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation
will not have any liability for the transfer Taxes and other similar Taxes
described in this _Section 2.8_ under any circumstances.

 



 

SECTION 3 \- REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF COMPANY

 



 

Except (a) as disclosed in the particular section or subsection of the Company
Disclosure Letter referenced therein (it being understood and agreed that any
information set forth in one section or subsection of the Company Disclosure
Letter also will apply to each other section and subsection of this Agreement
to which its applicability is reasonably apparent on its face from the text of
the disclosure) or (b) other than with respect to _Sections 3.1_ , _3.2_ ,
_3.3_ , _3.4_ and _3.5_ , as disclosed in the Company SEC Documents filed
with, or furnished to, the SEC by the Company at least three (3) business days
prior to the date of this Agreement (but, in each case, excluding any
disclosure contained under the heading "Risk Factors" or in any "forward-
looking statements" legend or any similar non-specific, predictive,
precautionary or forward-looking statements) and to the extent publicly
available on the SECs Electronic Data Gathering Analysis and Retrieval System
(" _EDGAR_ "), the Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Merger
Sub as follows:

 



      
 

 



 

3.1. _Organization; Qualification_. The Company and each Company Subsidiary is
a legal entity duly organized and validly existing and in good standing under
the Laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation, formation or organization,
as applicable, and has the requisite power and authority to conduct its
business as it is now being conducted and to own, lease and operate its
properties and assets in the manner in which its properties and assets are
currently owned, leased and operated. The Company and each Company Subsidiary
is duly qualified or licensed to do business and is in good standing in each
jurisdiction in which the character or location of the property owned, leased
or operated by it or the nature of the business conducted by it makes such
qualification or licensing necessary, except where the failure to be so duly
qualified or licensed and in good standing has not had, and would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect. The Companys Amended and Restated Certificate of
Incorporation (the " _Certificate of Incorporation_ ") and Amended and
Restated Bylaws (the " _Bylaws_ "), each as amended as of the date of this
Agreement, have been made available to Parent and are in full force and
effect, and the Company is not in violation of any of the provisions thereof.
The organizational or governing documents of each of the Companys
Subsidiaries are in full force and effect, and none of the Companys
Subsidiaries is in violation of any of the respective provisions thereof.

 



 

3.2. _Capitalization; Subsidiaries_.

 



 

(a) As of the close of business on September 7, 2018 (the " _Capitalization
Date_ "), the authorized capital stock of the Company consisted of (i)
100,000,000 Shares, 24,073,678 of which were issued and outstanding and none
of which were held by the Company as treasury stock and (ii) 10,000,000 shares
of preferred stock of the Company, par value $0.001 per share (" _Company
Preferred Stock_ "), no shares of which were issued and outstanding. There are
no other classes of capital stock of the Company and no bonds, debentures,
notes or other Indebtedness or securities of the Company having the right to
vote (or convertible into or exercisable for Securities having the right to
vote) on any matters on which holders of capital stock of the Company may vote
authorized, issued or outstanding. As of the close of business on the
Capitalization Date, there were (A) outstanding Company Options to purchase
2,572,016 Shares, (B) 917,512 outstanding Company RSUs, (C) 1,705,906 Shares
reserved for future issuance under the Company Stock Plans and (D) outstanding
Warrants to purchase 235,415 Shares. Since the close of business on the
Capitalization Date and except as disclosed on _Section 3.2(a)_ of the
Company Disclosure Letter, as of the date of this Agreement there has been no
issuance or grant of any Shares, Company Preferred Stock or any other
securities of the Company, other than any _de minimis_ issuances of Shares or
other securities in accordance with the exercise, vesting or settlement, as
applicable, of any Company Stock Plan Awards outstanding as of the close of
business on the Capitalization Date in accordance with the Company Stock Plan
Awards and disclosed on _Section 3.2(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter.

 



 

(b) All of the issued and outstanding Shares have been, and all of the Shares
that may be issued in accordance with any of the Company Stock Plan Awards,
the Company Stock Plans will be, when issued in accordance with the respective
terms thereof, duly authorized and validly issued and are, or will be when
issued, fully paid, non-assessable and free of preemptive rights. The Company
has made available to Parent or its counsel correct and complete copies of
each Company Stock Plan and the forms of stock option and restricted stock
unit agreements evidencing the Company Stock Plan Awards, and with respect to
the foregoing

 



      
 

 



 

forms, other than differences with respect to the number of Shares covered
thereby, the grant date and the exercise price applicable thereto; no such
stock option or restricted stock unit agreement with respect to Company Stock
Plan Awards contains material terms that are not consistent with, or in
addition to, such forms. _Section 3.2(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter
sets forth, as of the close of business on the Capitalization Date, each
outstanding Company Stock Plan Award and, to the extent applicable, (i) the
name (or employee identification number) and country of residence (if outside
the U.S.) of the holder thereof, (ii) the number of Shares issuable
thereunder, (iii) the expiration date, (iv) the exercise price or strike price
(if any) relating thereto, (v) the grant date, (vi) the amount vested and
outstanding and the amount unvested and outstanding, (vii) the Company Stock
Plan in accordance with which the award was made and (viii) whether such award
is subject to Section 409A of the Code. Each grant of a Company Option was
duly authorized no later than the date on which the grant of such Company
Option was by its terms to be effective (the " _Company Option Grant Date_ ")
by all necessary corporate action, including, as applicable, approval by the
Company Board of Directors (or a duly constituted and authorized committee
thereof or other authorized designee) and any required stockholder approval by
the necessary number of votes or written consents. No Company Option has been
granted with a per share exercise price less than the fair market value of a
Share on the applicable Company Option Grant Date, and the Company has not
granted any Company Options that are subject to Section 409A of the Code.
There is no agreement or arrangement (whether in writing or otherwise) to
which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party or with respect to
which the Company or any Company Subsidiary has or could expect to have
liability (contingent or otherwise), in each case, that contains a promise or
commitment to grant a Company Option or Company Options and such promise or
commitment has not been satisfied by the granting of such Company Option or
Options or need not be satisfied for failure to satisfy a condition to promise
or commitment. Each grant of a Company Stock Plan Award was made in all
material respects in accordance with (A) the applicable Company Stock Plan,
(B) all applicable securities Laws, including the NASDAQ Listing Rules, (C)
the Code and (D) all other Laws. The Company has the requisite power and
authority, in accordance with the applicable Company Stock Plan, the
applicable award agreements and any other applicable contract, to take the
actions contemplated by _Section 2.4_ and the treatment of Company Stock Plan
Awards and described in _Section 2.4_ will, as of the Effective Time, be
binding on the holders of Company Stock Plan Awards and purported to be
covered thereby. All of the outstanding Shares have been sold all material
respects in accordance with an effective registration statement filed in
accordance with the federal securities Laws or an appropriate exemption
therefrom. No Company Subsidiary owns any securities of the Company.

 



 

(c) As of the date of this Agreement, other than the Company Stock Plan Awards
and the Warrants, there are no (i) existing options, warrants, calls,
preemptive rights, subscriptions or other Securities or rights, stock
appreciation rights, restricted stock awards, restricted stock unit awards,
convertible securities, agreements, arrangements or commitments of any kind
obligating the Company or any Company Subsidiary to issue, transfer, register
or sell, or cause to be issued, transferred, registered or sold, any shares of
capital stock of, or other securities of, the Company or any Company
Subsidiary or securities convertible into or exchangeable for such shares or
other securities, or obligating the Company or any Company Subsidiary to
grant, extend or enter into such options, warrants, calls, preemptive rights,
subscriptions or other securities or rights, stock appreciation rights,
restricted stock awards, restricted stock unit awards, convertible securities,
agreements, arrangements or commitments,

 



      
 

 



 

(ii) outstanding obligations of the Company or any Company Subsidiary to
repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any securities of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary, or any securities representing the right to purchase or
otherwise receive any other securities of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary, (iii) agreements with any Person to which the Company or any
Company Subsidiary is bound by anything (A) restricting the transfer of the
securities of the Company or any Company Subsidiary or (B) affecting the
voting rights of securities of the Company or any Company Subsidiary
(including stockholder agreements, voting trusts or similar agreements) or
(iv) outstanding or authorized equity or equity-based compensation awards,
including any equity appreciation rights, security-based performance units,
"phantom" stock, profit-participation or other security rights issued by the
Company or any Company Subsidiary, or other agreements, arrangements or
commitments of any character (contingent or otherwise) to which the Company or
any Company Subsidiary is bound, in each case, in accordance with which any
Person is entitled to receive any payment from the Company or any Company
Subsidiary based in whole or in part on the value of any securities of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary.

 



 

(d) Each Company Subsidiary existing on the date of this Agreement is listed
on _Section 3.2(d)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter. The Company owns,
beneficially and of record, directly or indirectly, all of the issued and
outstanding company, partnership, corporate or similar (as applicable)
ownership, voting or similar securities or interests in each such Subsidiary,
free and clear of all Liens, and all company, partnership, corporate or
similar (as applicable) ownership, voting or similar securities or interests
of each of the Company Subsidiaries are duly authorized and validly issued and
are fully paid, non-assessable and free of preemptive rights. The Company has
made available to Parent correct and complete copies of the currently
effective corporate or other organizational documents for each Subsidiary.
Other than investments in cash equivalents (and ownership by the Company or
any Company Subsidiary of securities of any other Company Subsidiary), neither
the Company nor any Company Subsidiary (i) owns directly or indirectly any
securities or (ii) has any obligation or has made any commitment to acquire
any securities of any Person or to provide funds to or make any investment (in
the form of a loan, capital contribution or otherwise) in any Person.

 



 

(e) All dividends or distributions on any securities of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary that have been declared or authorized have been paid in
full.

 



 

3.3. _Authority Relative to Agreement_.

perform its obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the

3.4. _No Conflict; Required Filings and Consents_.

 



 

(a) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company nor
the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby, nor
compliance by the Company with this Agreement, will (i) violate any provision

3.5. _Company SEC Documents; Financial Statements_.

 



 

(a) Since June 11, 2015 (the " _Lookback Date_ "), the Company has timely
filed with, or furnished to, the SEC all registration statements, forms,
reports, schedules, statements, exhibits and other documents (including
exhibits, financial statements and schedules thereto and all other information
incorporated therein and amendments and supplements thereto) required by it to
be filed or furnished pursuant to the Exchange Act or the Securities Act of
1933, as amended (the " _Securities Act_ ") (the " _Company SEC Documents_ ").
Correct and complete copies of all Company SEC Documents are publicly
available on EDGAR. To the extent that any Company SEC Document available on
EDGAR contains redactions in accordance with a request for confidential
treatment or otherwise, the Company has made available to Parent the full text
of all such Company SEC Documents that it has so filed or furnished with the
SEC. As of its filing or furnishing date or, if amended prior to the date of
this Agreement, as of the date of the last such amendment or superseding
filing (and, in the case of registration statements and proxy statements, on
the dates of effectiveness and the dates of the relevant meetings,
respectively) each Company SEC Document has complied in all material respects
with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act, the Securities Act and
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the " _Sarbanes-Oxley Act_ "), as the case may
be, and the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder applicable to such
Company SEC Documents. As of its filing date or, if amended or superseded by a
subsequent filing prior to the date of this Agreement, as of the date of the
last such amendment or superseding filing, each Company SEC Document filed
pursuant to the Exchange Act did not contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Each Company SEC
Document that is a registration statement, as amended or supplemented, if
applicable, filed pursuant to the Securities Act, as of the date such
registration statement or amendment became effective prior to the date of this
Agreement, did not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make

 



      
 

 



 

the statements made therein not misleading. As of the date of this Agreement,
there are no amendments or modifications to the Company SEC Documents that are
required to be filed with, or furnished to, the SEC, but that have not yet
been filed with, or furnished to, the SEC. No Company Subsidiary is subject to
the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act. All of the audited
financial statements and unaudited interim financial statements of the Company
included in the Company SEC Documents (i) have been derived from the
accounting books and records of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, (ii)
comply in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements
and with the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto,
(iii) have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles in the United States, applied on a consistent basis (" _GAAP_ ")
during the periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto
and except, in the case of the unaudited interim statements of the Company, as
may be permitted in accordance with Form 10-Q of the Exchange Act) and (iv)
fairly present in all material respects the financial position, the
stockholders equity, the results of operations and cash flows of the Company
and its consolidated Subsidiaries, as applicable, as of the times and for the
periods referenced therein (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto
and subject, in the case of unaudited interim financial statements, to normal
and recurring year-end adjustments, none of which, individually or in the
aggregate, will be material). No Company Subsidiary is required to separately
file any form, report or other document with the SEC. _Section 3.5(a)_ of the
Company Disclosure Letter sets forth all effective registration statements
filed by the Company on Form S-3 or Form S-8 or otherwise relying on Rule 415
promulgated under the Securities Act.

 



 

(b) Prior to the date of this Agreement, the Company has delivered or made
available to Parent correct and complete copies of all comment letters from
the SEC since the Lookback Date through the date of this Agreement with
respect to any of the Company SEC Documents, together with all written
responses of the Company thereto, if such comment letters or responses are not
available on EDGAR at least three (3) business days prior to the date of this
Agreement. There are no outstanding or unresolved comments in comment letters
received from the SEC staff with respect to any of the Company SEC Documents,
and, to the Knowledge of the Company, none of the Company SEC Documents are
subject to ongoing SEC review or investigation.

 



 

(c) The Company is in compliance in all material respects with the applicable
provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the applicable listing and governance
rules and regulations of NASDAQ.

 



 

(d) The Company maintains a system of internal control over financial
reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act)
sufficient to provide reasonable assurance with respect to the reliability of
the Companys financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
for external purposes in conformity with GAAP, including that (i) material
transactions are executed in accordance with managements general or specific
authorizations, (ii) access to material assets is permitted only in accordance
with managements general or specific authorization and (iii) the recorded
accountability for assets is compared with the existing assets at reasonable

Parent and Merger Sub is duly qualified or licensed to do business and is in
good standing in each jurisdiction in which the character or location of the
property owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of the business

proposal relating to any transaction or proposed transaction or series of

hereby, involving (i) any consolidation, business combination,
recapitalization, restructuring, merger or similar transaction involving the
Company or any Company Subsidiary pursuant to which any Person or group of
related Persons would beneficially own or control, directly or indirectly,

or any resulting parent company of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
(ii) any liquidation or dissolution of the Company or any Company Subsidiary,

consideration equal to fifteen percent (15%) or more of the market value of
all of the outstanding Shares on the last trading day prior to the date of
this Agreement or fifteen percent (15%) of the consolidated total assets of
the Company and each Company Subsidiary (each of _clauses (i)_ through _(iv)_
above, an " _Acquisition Proposal_ "). Except as provided in this _Section
5.2_, from the date of this Agreement until the earlier of termination of this
Agreement or the Effective Time, the Company will not and will cause its

breach of this Agreement (including this _Section 5.2_) by the Company.
Subject to the other provisions of this Section 5.2, the Company and their
Representatives may in any event (A) seek to clarify and understand the terms
and conditions of any inquiry or proposal made by any Person solely to
determine whether such inquiry or proposal constitutes an Acquisition Proposal
and (B) inform a Person that has made or, to the Knowledge of the Company, is
considering making an _Acquisition Proposal_ of the provisions of this
_Section 5.2_.

 



 

(b) Nonetheless, prior to the acceptance of Shares in accordance with the
Offer (the " _Acceptance Time_ "), the Company and its Representatives may
furnish non-public information concerning its business, properties or assets
to any Person in accordance with a confidentiality agreement with terms no
less favorable in the aggregate to the Company than those contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement ( _provided_ , _however_ , that no such
confidentiality agreement will be required to include any standstill or
similar provisions) and may participate in discussions and negotiations with
such Person concerning, and facilitate such person in making, an Acquisition
Proposal if, but only if, such Person has submitted a written proposal to the
Company relating to such Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a
breach of _Section 5.2(a)_ by the Company and that the Company Board of
Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial
advisor, is or would reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal.
From and after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Acceptance Time,
the Company will promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours
after any Director or executive officer of the Company becomes so aware)
notify Parent if the Company or any Company Subsidiary or Representatives
receives (i) any Acquisition Proposal or indication by any Person that it is
considering making an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) any request for non-public
information relating to the Company or any Company Subsidiary other than
requests for

 



      
 

 



 

information in the ordinary course of business and unrelated to an Acquisition
Proposal or (iii) any inquiry or request for discussions or negotiations with
respect to any Acquisition Proposal. The Company will provide Parent promptly
(and in any event within such twenty-four (24) hour period) with the identity
of such Person and a correct and complete copy of such Acquisition Proposal,
indication, inquiry or request (or, where such Acquisition Proposal is not in
writing, a description of the material terms and conditions of such
Acquisition Proposal, indication, inquiry or request), including any material
modifications thereto. The Company will keep Parent reasonably informed
(orally or in writing) on a current basis (and in any event no later than
twenty-four (24) hours after any Director or executive officer of the Company
becomes aware of the occurrence of any material changes or developments) of
the status of any Acquisition Proposal, indication, inquiry or request
(including the material terms and conditions thereof and of any modification
thereto), and any material developments, including furnishing copies of any
draft new and revised versions of term sheets, letters of intent, offer
letters, definitive agreements and similar documents with respect thereto.
Without limiting the foregoing, the Company will promptly (and in any event
within twenty-four (24) hours) notify Parent orally or in writing if it
determines to begin providing information or to engage in discussions or
negotiations concerning an Acquisition Proposal. The Company will not, and
will cause each Company Subsidiary not to, enter into any agreement with any
Person subsequent to the date of this Agreement that would restrict the
Companys ability to provide such information to Parent. The Company will
promptly provide to Parent any non-public information concerning the Company
or any Company Subsidiary provided or made available in accordance with this
_Section 5.2(b)_ which was not previously provided or made available to
Parent. For purposes of this Agreement, a " _Superior Proposal_ " is an
unsolicited _bona fide_ written Acquisition Proposal to acquire more than
fifty percent (50%) of the equity securities or consolidated total assets of
the Company and each Company Subsidiary on terms which the Company Board of
Directors determines in its good faith judgment to be more favorable to the
holders of the Shares than the transactions contemplated hereby (after
consultation with its financial and legal advisors), taking into account all
the terms and conditions of such proposal and this Agreement, including the
timing and likelihood of consummating the transactions contemplated by such
proposal and this Agreement.

 



 

(c) Except as set forth herein, neither the Company Board of Directors nor any
committee thereof will (i) make any Company Adverse Recommendation Change or
(ii) enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement
in principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement, or similar agreement
(an " _Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ ") providing for the consummation of
a transaction contemplated by any Acquisition Proposal (other than a
confidentiality agreement referenced in _Section 5.2(b)_ entered into in the
circumstances referenced in _Section 5.2(b)_). The Company will promptly
following a determination by the Company Board of Directors that an
Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal, notify Parent of such
determination.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything in _Section 5.2(c)_ to the contrary, prior to
the Acceptance Time, if (i) the Company receives a written Acquisition
Proposal from a third Person, that did not result from a breach by the Company
of _Section 5.2(a)_ and (ii) the Company Board of Directors concludes in good
faith, after consultation with outside counsel and its financial advisors,
such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal after giving effect
to all of the adjustments of this Agreement that may be offered by Parent, the
Company Board of Directors may, if it determines in good faith, after
consultation with outside counsel, that failure

 



      
 

 



 

to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the
holders of the Shares in accordance with Law, (A) effect a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change or (B) terminate this Agreement to enter into an
Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Company will not terminate this Agreement in
accordance with _clause (B)_ above, and any purported termination in
accordance with _clause (B)_ above will be void and of no force or effect,
unless in advance of or concurrently with such termination the Company (1)
pays the fee required by and in accordance with _Section 8.2_ and (2)
immediately following such termination enters into a binding definitive
Alternative Acquisition Agreement for such Superior Proposal; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that the Company Board of Directors may not effect a change of its
recommendation in accordance with _clause (A)_ above or terminate this
Agreement in accordance with _clause (B)_ above unless (I) the Company has
not materially breached its obligations in this _Section 5.2_ with respect to
the applicable Acquisition Proposal, (II) the Company has provided prior
written notice to Parent, at least four (4) business days in advance (the "
_Notice Period_ "), of its intention to take such action with respect to such
Superior Proposal, which notice will specify the material terms and conditions
of any such Superior Proposal (including the identity of the party making such
Superior Proposal), and has contemporaneously provided a correct and complete
copy of the then-proposed Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to
such Superior Proposal, (III) prior to effecting such Company Adverse
Recommendation Change or terminating this Agreement to enter into a definitive
Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal, the
Company has, and have caused its Representatives to, during the Notice Period,
negotiate with Parent in good faith (to the extent Parent desires to
negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this
Agreement so that such Acquisition Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior
Proposal and (IV) following any negotiation described in _clause (III)_
above, the Company Board of Directors concludes in good faith, after
consultation with outside counsel and its financial advisors, that such
Acquisition Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Proposal. In the event
of any material revisions to the Superior Proposal after the start of the
Notice Period, the Company is required to deliver a new written notice to
Parent and to comply with the requirements of this _Section 5.2(d)_ with
respect to such new written notice, and the Notice Period will be deemed to
have re-commenced on the date of such new notice, _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the four (4) business day period contemplated by the prior sentence will
in such event be reduced to three (3) business days. Any Company Adverse
Recommendation Change will not change the approval of the Company Board of
Directors for purposes of causing any state takeover statute or other Law to
be inapplicable to the transactions contemplated hereby, including each of the
Offer and the Merger, or to the Tender Agreements.

 



 

(e) Nonetheless, the Company Board of Directors may make a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change in the absence of an Acquisition Proposal if an event
has occurred or circumstances have arisen (either, an " _Intervening Event_ ")
after the date of this Agreement not reasonably foreseeable prior to the date
of this Agreement, and the Company Board of Directors has concluded in good
faith, after consultation with its outside counsel, that failure to make a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change on account of the Intervening Event
would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties, _provided_ , _however_ , that
the Company Board of Directors will not make a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change unless the Company has (i) provided to Parent at least four (4)
business days prior written notice advising Parent that the Company Board of
Directors intends to take such action and specifying the Intervening Event in
reasonable detail and (ii) during such four (4) business day, or shorter,

 



      
 

 



 

period, if requested by Parent, engaged in good faith negotiations with Parent
to amend this Agreement in such a manner that obviates the need or reason for
the Company Adverse Recommendation Change.

 



 

(f) The Company will promptly (but in no event later than two (2) business
days after the date of this Agreement) demand that each Person that has
executed a confidentiality agreement in connection with potential Acquisition
Proposal prior to the date of this Agreement return (or destroy, to the extent
permitted by the applicable confidentiality agreement) all confidential
information furnished to such individual or entity by or on behalf of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary.

 



 

(g) Nothing in this Agreement will prohibit the Company Board of Directors
from (i) taking and disclosing to the stockholders of the Company a position
contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act or complying with the
provisions of Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act and (ii) making
any disclosure to the stockholders of the Company that the Company Board of
Directors determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal
counsel) that the failure to make such disclosure would be inconsistent with
such directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_
, that any such disclosure referred to in _clauses (i)_ or _(ii)_ above that
relates to an Acquisition Proposal will be deemed to be a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change unless (x) the Company Board of Directors expressly
reaffirms the Company Recommendation in such disclosure or (y) such disclosure
is a "stop, look and listen" communication to the stockholders of the Company
pursuant to Rule 14d-9(b) promulgated under the Exchange Act; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that this _Section 5.2(g)_ will not be deemed to permit the
Company Board of Directors to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or
to take any of the actions referred to in _Section 5.2(d)_ or _Section
5.2(e)_, except, in each case, to the extent expressly permitted by _Section
5.2(d)_ or _Section 5.2(e)_, as applicable.

 



 

5.3. _Merger Sub_. Parent will take all actions necessary to cause Merger Sub
to perform its obligations in accordance with this Agreement and to consummate
the Merger on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement. All
obligations of Merger Sub under this Agreement will be deemed joint
obligations of Parent, as a principal obligor thereof and not merely as
guarantor.

 



 

5.4. _Rule 16b-3 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company will take
all such actions as may be reasonably necessary or advisable (to the extent
permitted under Law and no-action letters issued by the SEC) to cause any
dispositions of Company Common Stock (including derivative securities with
respect to Company Common Stock) resulting from the transactions contemplated
hereby by each individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company immediately
prior to the Effective Time to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under
the Exchange Act, to the extent permitted by Law.

 



 

5.5. _Rule 14d-10(d)(1)_. The Company will take all actions as may be
required to cause all employment compensation, severance, and employee benefit
agreements and arrangements entered into by the Company or any Company
Subsidiary or contemplated hereby with any of their respective officers,
directors or employees to be approved as an "employment

 



      
 

 



 

compensation, severance or other employee benefit arrangement" within the
meaning of Rule 14d-10(d)(1) promulgated under the Exchange Act and to satisfy
the requirements of the non-exclusive safe harbor set forth in Rules
14d-10(d)(1) promulgated under the Exchange Act. The Company will provide
Parent with correct and complete copies of all such actions.

 



 

5.6. _Repayment and Termination of Existing Credit Agreements_. At least two
(2) business days prior to the Closing Date, the Company will deliver to
Parent an executed copy of a customary payoff letter from the agents under the
Existing Credit Agreements in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
Parent relating to the repayment in full of all obligations thereunder or
secured thereby, the termination of all commitments in connection therewith
and the release of all Liens securing the obligations thereunder, in each
case, effective as of the Closing (the " _Payoff Letter_ "). The Company will,
and will cause each Company Subsidiary to, deliver to Parent (or the agent
under the Existing Credit Agreements, in the case of prepayment and
termination notices) at or prior to the Closing, in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to Parent, all of the documents, filings and notices
required for the termination of commitments under the Existing Credit
Agreement and the release of all Liens securing the obligations thereunder,
including the filing of UCC releases, termination of control agreements and
delivery of possessory collateral, which will, in each case, be subject to the
occurrence of the Closing and the repayment in full of all obligations then
outstanding under the Existing Credit Agreements. At the Closing, Parent will
pay, or cause to be paid, in full and in immediately available funds, all
amounts outstanding and then due and payable under the Existing Credit
Agreements in accordance with the Payoff Letter.

 



 

5.7. _Director Resignations_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company will
use its reasonable best efforts to cause each director of the Company and each
Company Subsidiary to execute and deliver a letter effectuating such
directors resignation, effective as of the Effective Time, as a director of
the Company or such Company Subsidiary, as applicable.

 



 

5.8. _Employee Matters_.

 



 

(a) For the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the earlier
of (x) the date that is twelve (12) months following the Effective Time and
(y) the date on which the employment of an employee of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary who continues his or her employment with Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates following the
Effective Time (each, a " _Continuing Employee_ ") terminates, Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates will provide each
Continuing Employee with (i) an annual base salary, at least equal to the
annual base salary, provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to
the Effective Time, (ii) cash bonus or incentive opportunities that are no
less favorable than the cash bonus or incentive opportunities provided to
similarly situated employees of Parent and its Affiliates, and (iii) employee
benefits that are no less favorable (in the aggregate) to the employee
benefits (including severance benefits but excluding for such purposes any
equity or equity-related awards, transaction and change-in-control bonuses and
benefits, and any defined benefit pension benefits) provided to similarly
situated employees of Parent and its Affiliates; provided, however, that
during the period commencing on the Effective Time and ending on the earlier
of (x) the date that is six (6) months following the Effective Time and (y)
the date on which the employment of a Continuing Employee terminates, Parent,
the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates may, in their
discretion

 



      
 

 



 

provide each Continuing Employee with employee benefits that are no less
favorable (in the aggregate) to the employee benefits (including severance
benefits but excluding for such purposes any equity or equity-related awards,
transaction and change-in-control bonuses and benefits, and any defined
benefit pension benefits) provided to such Continuing Employees immediately
prior to the Effective Time.

 



 

(b) Parent agrees that each Continuing Employee will, as of the Effective
Time, receive full credit for service with the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time for purposes of determining
eligibility to participate and vesting under the employee benefit plans,
programs and policies of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective Affiliates in which such Continuing Employee becomes a participant
(excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, with respect to any equity or equity-
related awards, transaction and change in control benefits, or defined benefit
pension benefits), subject to the terms and conditions of such employee
benefit plans, programs, and policies; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing
herein will result in the duplication of any benefits for the same period of
service. Parent agrees that each Continuing Employee shall, as of the
Effective Time, receive full credit for service with the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time for purposes of determining the
amount of benefits under the employee benefit plans, programs and policies of
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates that
provide for severance, paid-time off and vacation in which such Continuing
Employee becomes a participant. With respect to each health or welfare benefit
plan maintained by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective Affiliates for the benefit of Continuing Employees (including any
medical, dental, pharmaceutical or vision benefit plans), Parent will, subject
to the terms and conditions of the applicable health or welfare benefit plan,
(i) cause to be waived any eligibility waiting periods, any evidence of
insurability requirements or required physical examinations, actively-at-work
requirements and the application of any pre-existing condition limitations
under such plan to the extent such were waived or satisfied under the
comparable health or welfare benefit plan of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) cause each
Continuing Employee to be given credit under such plan for all amounts paid
(or otherwise deemed paid) by such Continuing Employee under any similar
Benefit Plan for the plan year that includes the Effective Time for purposes
of applying deductibles, co-payments and out-of-pocket maximums as though such
amounts had been paid in accordance with the terms and conditions of the plans
maintained by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
Affiliates, as applicable, for the plan year in which the Effective Time
occurs; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parents obligations under this _clause
(ii)_ will be subject to its receipt of all necessary information, from either
the Company or such Continuing Employee, related to such amounts paid by such
Continuing Employee.

 



 

(c) If the Companys 401(k) Plan terminates prior to the scheduled expiration
date of the Offer pursuant to _Section 6.7_, each Continuing Employee who is
a participant in the Companys 401(k) Plan will be allowed to participate,
effective as of the Effective Time, in a tax qualified plan which includes a
cash or deferred arrangement intended to satisfy the provisions of Section
401(k) of the Code that is sponsored by Parent or an Affiliate of Parent (the
" _Parent 401(k) Plan_"). In the event that the Companys 401(k) Plan
terminates in accordance with the foregoing sentence, Parent will, or will
cause an Affiliate to, take all actions reasonably necessary so that the
Parent 401(k) Plan will accept rollover contributions of "eligible rollover
distributions" (within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code,
inclusive of loans to the

 



      
 

 



 

extent administratively practicable) from the Companys 401(k) Plan and Parent
(or its Affiliate) will thereafter maintain such loan under the Parent 401(k)
Plan.

 



 

(d) The provisions of this _Section 5.8_ are solely for the benefit of the
parties to this Agreement, and no Continuing Employee (including any
beneficiary or dependent thereof) will be regarded for any purpose as a third-
party beneficiary of this Agreement, and no provision of this _Section 5.8_
will create such rights in any such Persons. Nothing herein will (i) guarantee
employment for any period of time or preclude the ability of Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates, as applicable, to
terminate the employment of any Continuing Employee at any time and for any
reason, (ii) require Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective Affiliates, as applicable, to continue any Benefit Plans, or other
employee benefit plans or arrangements or prevent the amendment, modification
or termination thereof after the Effective Time or (iii) amend any Benefit
Plans or other employee benefit plans or arrangements.

 



 

SECTION 6 \- ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

 



 

6.1. _Nasdaq; Post-Closing SEC Reports_. During the Pre-Closing Period, the
Company will cooperate with Parent and use reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions, and do or cause to be done all things,
reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its part under Laws and rules and
policies of The Nasdaq Stock Market to enable the delisting by the Surviving
Corporation of the Shares from The Nasdaq Stock Market and the deregistration
of the Shares in accordance with the Exchange Act promptly after the Effective
Time. Parent will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Surviving
Corporation to file with the SEC (a) a Form 25 on the Closing Date and (b) a
Form 15 on the first (1st) business day that is at least ten (10) days after
the date the Form 25 is filed (such period between the Form 25 filing date and
the Form 15 filing date, the " _Delisting Period_ "). If the Surviving
Corporation is reasonably likely to be required to file any reports in
accordance with the Exchange Act during the Delisting Period, the Company will
deliver to Parent at least five (5) business days prior to the Closing a
substantially final draft of any such reports reasonably likely to be required
to be filed during the Delisting Period (" _Post-Closing SEC Reports_ "). The
Post-Closing SEC Reports provided by the Company in accordance with this
_Section 6.1_ will (i) not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading and (ii) comply in all material
respects with Laws.

 



 

6.2. _Access to Information_. During the Pre-Closing Period, Parent will be
entitled, through its employees and representatives, to have such access to
the assets, properties, business and operations of the Company and each
Company Subsidiary as is reasonably necessary in connection with Parents
investigation of the Company with respect to the transactions contemplated
hereby. Any such investigation and examination will be conducted at reasonable
times upon reasonable advance notice and under reasonable circumstances,
except as may otherwise be required or restricted by Law, so as to limit
disruption to or impairment of the Companys business, and the Company will
cooperate fully therein. No investigation by Parent will diminish or obviate
any of the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the Company
contained in this Agreement. In order that Parent may have full opportunity to
make such investigation, the Company will furnish the representatives of
Parent during such period

 



      
 

 



 

with all such information and copies of such documents concerning the affairs
of the Company as such representatives may reasonably request and cause its
Representatives to cooperate fully with such representatives of Parent in
connection with such investigation. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, nothing in this Agreement or otherwise will require the Company or any
Company Subsidiary to disclose any information to Parent if such disclosure
would, upon the advice of counsel (and after notice to Parent) (i) jeopardize
any attorney-client or other legal privilege (so long as the Company has
reasonably cooperated with Parent to permit such inspection of or to disclose
such information on a basis that does not waive such privilege with respect
thereto) or (ii) contravene any applicable Law or binding agreement entered
into prior to the date of this Agreement (including any confidentiality
agreement to which the Company or its Affiliates is a party, provided that no
such agreement will constrain the obligations of the Company set forth in
_Section 5.2_); _provided_ , _further_ , that (A) the Company will use
commercially reasonable efforts during the Pre-Closing Period to provide
Parent with redacted versions of any documents withheld in accordance with
_clause (ii)_ above and (B) information will be disclosed subject to
execution of a joint defense agreement in customary form, to external counsel
for Parent to the extent reasonably required for the purpose of complying with
applicable Laws. Any information or documents provided or obtained pursuant to
this _Section 6.2_ will be subject to the Confidentiality Agreement.

 



 

6.3. _Public Disclosure_. The Company, Merger Sub and Parent agree that the
Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, shall
each cause a separate press release announcing the execution and delivery of
this Agreement, which shall not be issued prior to the approval of each of the
Company and Parent. Thereafter, so long as this Agreement is in effect,
neither Parent, Merger Sub nor the Company will disseminate any press release
or other announcement concerning the Merger, the Offer, this Agreement or the
other transactions contemplated hereby to any third Person, except as may be
required by Law or by any listing agreement with a national stock exchange,
without the prior consent of each of the other parties hereto, which consent
will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Nonetheless, (a)
the restrictions set forth in this _Section 6.3_ will not apply to any press
release or other announcement (i) made by the Company with respect to, or in
connection with, a Company Adverse Recommendation Change effected by the
Company Board of Directors in accordance with this Agreement, (ii) made by the
Company or Parent with respect to, or in connection with, an Acquisition
Proposal, (iii) made by the Company or Parent concerning this Agreement, the
Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby in connection with a
determination by the Company or the Company Board of Directors in accordance
with _Section 5.2(b)_ or _5.2(d)_ that an Acquisition Proposal constitutes a
Superior Proposal, (iv) by the Company as contemplated by _Section 5.2(g)_,
or (v) by the Company or Parent with respect to any dispute between the
parties hereto with respect to this Agreement, the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the case of
each of _clause (i)_ or _(iv)_ above, to the extent not prohibited by Law,
the disclosing party gives the other party reasonable advance notice of
(including contents of) its intended press release or other announcement, and
(b) to the extent the content of any press release or other announcement has
been previously approved and made in accordance with this _Section 6.3_, no
separate approval will be required with respect to a subsequent press release
or other announcement if substantially consistent with a previously approved
press release or announcement.

 



       
 

 



 

6.4. _Regulatory Filings; Reasonable Efforts_.

 



 

(a) As promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement and in
compliance with all applicable regulatory requirements, each of Parent, Merger
Sub and the Company will make all filings, notices, petitions, statements,
registrations, submissions of information, application or submission of other
documents required by any Governmental Authority in connection with the Offer,
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, including, (i)
Notification and Report Forms with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and the
Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice if required by the HSR
Act (which should be submitted no later than ten (10) business days after the
date of this Agreement), (ii) filings required by the merger notification or
control Laws of any applicable jurisdiction, as agreed by the parties hereto
and (iii) any filings required in accordance with the Securities Act, the
Exchange Act, any applicable state or securities or "blue sky" Laws and the
securities Laws of any foreign country or any other Laws or rules and
regulations of any Governmental Authority relating to the Offer and the
Merger. Each of Parent and the Company will cause all documents that it is
responsible for filing with any Governmental Authority in accordance with this
_Section 6.4_ to comply in all material respects with all Laws and rules and
regulations of any Governmental Authority.

 



 

(b) Each of Parent, Merger Sub, and the Company will promptly supply the other
with any information which may be reasonably required in order to effectuate
any filings, applications, or responses to information requests in accordance
with this _Section 6.4_.

 



 

(c) Each of Parent, Merger Sub, and the Company will, unless prohibited by
applicable Law or by the applicable Governmental Authority, promptly inform
the other of any communication from any Governmental Authority regarding any
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in connection with any
filings or investigations with, by or before any Governmental Authority
relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, including
any proceedings initiated by a private party. If Parent, Merger Sub, or the
Company will receive a request for additional information or documentary
material from any Governmental Authority with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement pursuant to any applicable Laws (including
Antitrust Laws) with respect to which any such filings have been made, then
such party will use its reasonable best efforts to make, or cause to be made,
as soon as reasonably practicable and, unless prohibited by applicable Law or
by the applicable Governmental Authority, after consultation with such other
party, an appropriate response in compliance with such request. In connection
with and without limiting the foregoing, to the extent reasonably practicable
and unless prohibited by applicable Law or by the applicable Governmental
Authority, each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company will (i) give each other
reasonable advance notice of all meetings with any Governmental Authority
relating to the Offer and the Merger, (ii) give each other an opportunity to
participate in each of such meetings, (iii) keep such other party reasonably
apprised with respect to any oral communications with any Governmental
Authority regarding the Offer and the Merger, (iv) cooperate in the filing of
any analyses, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions or other
written communications explaining or defending the Merger, articulating any
regulatory or competitive argument and/or responding to requests or objections
made by any Governmental Authority, (v) provide each other with a reasonable
advance opportunity to review and comment upon, and consider in good faith the
views of the other with respect to, all written

 



      
 

 



 

communications (including any analyses, presentations, memoranda, briefs,
arguments and opinions) with a Governmental Authority regarding the Offer and
the Merger, (vi) provide each other (or counsel of each party, as appropriate)
with copies of all written communications to or from any Governmental
Authority relating to the Merger and (vii) cooperate and provide each other
with a reasonable opportunity to participate in, and consider in good faith
the views of the other with respect to, all material deliberations with
respect to all efforts to obtain approval, clearance, consents, or expiration
of applicable waiting periods under the Antitrust Laws.

 



 

(d) On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
each of the parties hereto will use its reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist
and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner
practicable, the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby, including complying in all material respects with all Laws and with
all rules and regulations of any Governmental Authority and using its
reasonable best efforts to accomplish the following (i) the causing of all the
Offer Conditions and the conditions set forth in _Section 7_ to be satisfied
and to consummate and make effective the Offer, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) the obtaining of all reasonably
requested actions or non-actions, waivers, consents, clearances, approvals,
orders and authorizations from Governmental Authorities and the making of all
reasonably requested registrations, declarations and filings (including
registrations, declarations and filings with Governmental Authorities, if
any), (iii) the obtaining of all reasonably requested consents, approvals or
waivers from third parties, (iv) the defending of any suits, claims, actions,
investigations or proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging
this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,
including seeking to have any stay or temporary restraining order entered by
any court or other Governmental Authority vacated or reversed and (v) the
execution or delivery of any additional instruments necessary to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby, and to carry out fully the purposes of,
this Agreement. In connection with and without limiting the foregoing, the
Company and the Company Board of Directors will, if any state takeover statute
or similar statute or regulation is or becomes applicable to the Offer, the
Merger, this Agreement or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby,
use reasonable best efforts to ensure that the Offer, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as promptly as practicable
on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise to minimize the effect of such
statute or regulation on the Offer, the Merger, this Agreement and the other
transactions contemplated hereby. In case at any time after the Effective Time
any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement in accordance with the terms hereof, the proper officers and
directors of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub will use reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all such necessary actions. Parent will
cause Merger Sub to fulfill all Merger Subs obligations in accordance with
this Agreement. To the extent so requested in writing by Parent with respect
to any agreement referenced in _Section 3.4(a)_, the Company will use its
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any consent, approval, or waiver
with respect to such agreement(s); _provided_ , _however_ , neither the
Company nor any Company Subsidiary will be required, in connection with the
foregoing, to grant or offer to grant any accommodation or concession
(financial or otherwise), or make any payment, to any Person in connection
with seeking or obtaining its consent to the transactions contemplated by the
foregoing that is not conditioned upon the Closing. Nothing in this Agreement
will require Parent, the Company or any Company Subsidiary, the Surviving
Corporation or any other

 



      
 

 



 

Subsidiary of Parent to (a) sell, hold separate, license or otherwise dispose
of any assets or conduct their business in a specified manner, (b) agree or
proffer to sell, hold separate, license or otherwise dispose of any assets or
conduct their business in a specified manner or (c) permit or agree to the
sale, holding separate, licensing or other disposition of, any assets of
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any other Subsidiary of Parent or the
Company, whether as a condition to obtaining any approval from, or to avoid
potential litigation or administrative action by, a Governmental Authority or
any other Person or for any other reason, except assets of the Company the
divestiture of which would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
be expected to be material to the Company.

 



 

6.5. _Notification of Certain Matters; Litigation_.

 



 

(a) Each party hereto will deliver prompt notice to the other parties hereto
of (i) the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event the occurrence or non-
occurrence of which would cause any representation or warranty made in this
Agreement by such party hereto to be untrue or inaccurate at any time from the
date of this Agreement to the Effective Time and (ii) any failure of such
party hereto or any of its representatives to comply with or satisfy any
covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it
hereunder, in each case of _clauses (i)_ and _(ii)_ above, in a manner as
would cause any Offer Condition to fail to be satisfied; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (A) no such notification will affect the representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties by such party, the
conditions to the obligations of the parties by such party in accordance with
this Agreement or the remedies available to the party receiving such
notification and (B) an unintentional failure to give notice under this
_Section 6.5(a)_ will not be deemed to be a breach of covenant under this
_Section 6.5(a)_ but instead will only constitute, if applicable, a breach of
the underlying representation, warranty, covenant, condition or agreement, as
the case may be.

 



 

(b) Without limiting the terms of the preceding _Section 6.5(a)_, the Company
will, within twenty-four (24) hours after it has notice of any of the
following notify Parent of (i) any notice or other communication from any
Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) any written notice
or other material communication from any Governmental Authority in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby, (iii) any actions, suits, claims,
investigations or proceedings instituted or threatened against the Company or
any of its directors, officers or Affiliates, including by any holders of the
Shares of the Company, before any court or Governmental Authority, relating to
or involving or otherwise affecting the Company or any Company Subsidiary
that, if pending on the date of this Agreement, would have been required to
have been disclosed in accordance with this Agreement or relating to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, or seeking damages or
discovery in connection with such transactions or (iv) any actions, suits,
claims, investigations or proceedings instituted or threatened against the
Company or any of its directors, officers or Affiliates, including by any
holders of the Shares of the Company, before any court or Governmental
Authority, relating to the Offer or the Merger. Parent will have the right to
participate in the defense of any such actions, suits, claims, investigations
or proceedings in accordance with _clause (iv)_ above, and the Company will
consult with Parent with respect to the defense or settlement of any such
actions, suits, claims, investigations or proceedings, will consider Parents
views with respect to such actions, suits, claims, investigations or
proceedings, and will not settle or materially stipulate with respect to

 



      
 

 



 

any such actions, suits, claims, investigations or proceedings without
Parents written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed).

 



 

6.6. _Indemnification_.

 



 

(a) Parent agrees that any rights to indemnification or exculpation now
existing in favor of the directors or officers of the Company, the directors
or officers of each Company Subsidiary and any other employee of the Company
or a Company Subsidiary signatory to an indemnity agreement listed in Section
6.6(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter (the " _Indemnified Parties_ " and,
each, an " _Indemnified Party_ ") as provided in their respective
organizational documents or any agreement listed in _Section 6.6(a)_ of the
Company Disclosure Letter, providing for indemnification by the Company or any
Company Subsidiary of such Indemnified Parties or other employees thereof, in
each case, in effect as of the date of this Agreement, with respect to matters
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time will survive the Merger and will
continue in full force and effect for a period of six (6) years after the
Effective Time. During such period, Parent will not, nor will it permit the
Surviving Corporation to, amend, repeal or otherwise modify such provisions
for indemnification in any manner that would materially and adversely affect
the rights thereunder of individuals who at any time on or prior to the
Effective Time were directors or officers of the Company or directors or
officers of any Company Subsidiary with respect to actions or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including the transactions
contemplated hereby), unless such modification is required by Law; _provided_
, _however_ , that if any claim is asserted or made either prior to the
Effective Time or within such six (6) year period, all rights to
indemnification with respect to any such claim or claims will continue until
disposition of all such claims. From and after the Effective Time, Parent will
guarantee and stand surety for, and will cause the Surviving Corporation to
honor, in accordance with their respective terms, each of the covenants
contained in this _Section 6.6_.

 



 

(b) Prior to the Closing, the Company may, at its option, (a) purchase a six
(6) year extended reporting period endorsement (a " _Reporting Tail
Endorsement_ ") with respect to the current policies of the directors and
officers liability insurance maintained by the Company (the " _Current D andO
Insurance_") so long as the premium therefor would not be in excess of three
hundred percent (300%) of the last annual premium paid prior to the Effective
Time (such three hundred percent (300%), the " _Maximum Premium_ ") or (b)
allow Parent to arrange for the purchase of a Reporting Tail Endorsement with
a premium therefor not in excess of the Maximum Premium. In the event the
Company does purchase the Reporting Tail Endorsement prior to the Closing, the
Surviving Corporation will, and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation
to, maintain such Reporting Tail Endorsement in full force and effect for its
full term. Prior to purchasing a Reporting Tail Endorsement, the Company will
provide Parent with an opportunity to arrange for the purchase of alternative
coverage on terms and conditions no less advantageous to the Indemnified
Parties. If either the Reporting Tail Endorsement or the Companys or the
Surviving Corporations existing insurance expires, is terminated or canceled
during such six (6) year period (or, with respect to such existing insurance,
the annual premium in respect thereof exceeds the Maximum Premium), the
Surviving Corporation will obtain, and Parent will cause the Surviving
Corporation to obtain, as much directors and officers liability insurance as
can be obtained for the remainder of such period for an annualized premium not
in excess of the Maximum Premium, on terms and conditions no less advantageous
to the Indemnified Parties than the Companys existing directors and
officers liability insurance.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) The covenants contained in this _Section 6.6_ are intended to be for the
benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties and
their respective heirs and will not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to
which any such Person is entitled, whether pursuant to applicable Law,
contract or otherwise. Unless required by Law, this _Section 6.6_ may not be
amended, altered or repealed in such a manner as to adversely affect the
rights of any Indemnified Person or any of their successors, assigns or heirs
without the prior written consent of the affected Indemnified Person.

 



 

(d) In the event that Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and will not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity
of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, proper provision will be made so that the successors or
assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, will
assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 6.6_ to the extent such
obligations are not assumed by operation of law.

 



 

6.7. _401(k)_. If requested by Parent in writing ( _provided_ , that such
written request is submitted to the Company at least five (5) business days
prior to the scheduled expiration date of the Offer), the Company will
terminate the Companys 401(k) plan prior to the scheduled expiration date of
the Offer.

 



 

6.8. _State Takeover Laws_. If any "fair price", "business combination" or
"control share acquisition" statute or other similar statute or regulation is
or may become applicable to any of the transactions contemplated hereby, the
parties hereto will use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to
(a) take such actions as are reasonably necessary so that the transactions
contemplated hereunder may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the
terms contemplated hereby and (b) otherwise take all such actions as are
reasonably necessary to eliminate or minimize the effects of any such statute
or regulation on such transactions.

 



 

6.9. _FIRPTA Certificate_. Prior to each of the Acceptance Time and the
Effective Time, the Company will execute and deliver to Parent and Merger Sub
a certificate (in a form reasonably acceptable to Parent and Sub) and related
IRS notice conforming to the requirements of Treasury Regulations Sections
1.1445-2(c)(3) and 1.897-2(h).

 



 

SECTION 7 \- CONDITIONS PRECEDENT TO THE OBLIGATION 
OF PARTIES TO CONSUMMATE THE MERGER

 



 

7.1. _Conditions to Obligations of Each Party to Effect the Merger_. The
respective obligations of each party hereto to effect the Merger will be
subject to the satisfaction or written waiver at or prior to the Closing Date
of the following conditions:

 



 

(a) _Acceptance of Tendered Shares_. Merger Sub (or Parent on behalf of Merger
Sub) will have accepted for payment all of the Shares validly tendered in
accordance with the Offer and not properly withdrawn.

 



 

(b) _Statutes; Court Orders_. No order or injunction of a court of competent
jurisdiction is in effect preventing or making illegal the consummation of the
Merger.

 



      
 

 



 

7.2. _Frustration of Closing Conditions_. No party hereto may rely on the
failure of any condition set forth in _Section 7.1_ to be satisfied if such
failure was caused by such partys failure to act in good faith or use its
reasonable best efforts to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, as
required by and subject to _Section 6.4(d)_, or whose action or failure to
fulfill any obligation under this Agreement has been the principal cause of,
or resulted in, the failure of such condition to be satisfied.

 



 

SECTION 8\- TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER

 



 

8.1. _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated and the transactions
contemplated hereby may be abandoned at any time before the Acceptance Time:

 



 

(a) by mutual written consent of Parent and the Company duly authorized by the
Board of Directors of Parent and the Company Board of Directors; or

 



 

(b) by either Parent or the Company:

 



 

(i) if a court of competent jurisdiction or other Governmental Authority will
have issued an order, decree or ruling or taken any other action, and such
order, decree or ruling or other action will have become final and non-
appealable, or there will exist any statute, rule or regulation, in each case,
permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting (collectively, "
_Restraints_ ") the consummation of the Offer or the Merger; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the party seeking to terminate this Agreement in accordance
with this _Section 8.1(b)(i)_ will have used reasonable best efforts to
prevent the entry of and to remove such Restraints;

 



 

(ii) if the Acceptance Time has not occurred by the date that is six (6)
months after the date of this Agreement (the " _Outside Date_ "); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement in accordance with this
_Section 8.1(b)(ii)_ will not be available to any party hereto whose action
or failure to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement has been the
principal cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the Acceptance Time to
occur by such date;

 



 

(c) by Parent if, (i) there has been a breach by the Company of, or inaccuracy
in, any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of the Company set
forth in this Agreement such that the events described in _clause (3)_ or
_clause (4)_ of _Annex II_ have occurred (and any such breach has not been
cured within twenty (20) days following notice by Parent thereof or such
breach is not reasonably capable of being cured) and (ii) at such time Parent
is not in material breach of this Agreement;

 



 

(d) by the Company if (i) (A) there has been a breach by Parent or Merger Sub
of, or any inaccuracy in, any representation or warranty, of Parent or Merger
Sub set forth in this Agreement, which breach or inaccuracy is reasonably
expected to have a material adverse effect on the ability of Parent or Merger
Sub to perform the obligations and covenants required to be performed by
Parent or Merger Sub under this Agreement or (B) Parent or Merger Sub has
breached or failed to perform or to comply with any agreement, obligation or
covenant to be performed or complied with by Parent or Merger Sub in
accordance with this Agreement, in each case, in any material respect (and
with respect to each of _clauses (A)_ and _(B)_ above, any such breach,
inaccuracy or failure has not been cured within twenty (20) days following
notice by the

 



      
 

 



 

Company thereof or such breach, inaccuracy or failure is not reasonably
capable of being cured) and (ii) at such time the Company is not in material
breach of this Agreement;

 



 

(e) by Parent, at any time prior to the Acceptance Time, if the Company Board
of Directors has effected a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or the
Company has materially breached its obligations under _Section 5.2_; or

 



 

(f) by the Company, at any time prior to the Acceptance Time, if the Company
has received a Superior Proposal that did not result from a breach of _Section
5.2(a)_, and that, after giving effect to all of the modifications that may be
offered by Parent in accordance with _Section 5.2_, the Company Board of
Directors determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial
advisors) continues to constitute a Superior Proposal; _provided_ , _however_
, the Company will have complied in all material respects with its obligations
under _Section 5.2_ with respect to such Superior Proposal and will have paid
the Termination Fee, or pays such Termination Fee contemporaneously with such
termination.

 



 

8.2. _Effect of Termination_.

 



 

(a) Any termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Section 8.1_ will
be effective immediately upon the delivery of a written notice of the
terminating party to the other party hereto and, if then due, payment of the
Termination Fee. If this Agreement is terminated in accordance with _Section
8.1_, this Agreement will forthwith become null and void and be of no further
force or effect and there will be no liability on the part of Parent, Merger
Sub or the Company (or any of their respective directors, officers, employees,
stockholders, agents or representatives), except as set forth in the last
sentence of _Section 6.2_, _Section 8_ and _Section 9_, each of which will
remain in full force and effect and survive any termination of this Agreement;
_provided_ _,_ _however_ , that nothing herein will relieve any party from
liability for fraud or intentional or willful breach of any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement.

 



 

(b) If Parent will have terminated this Agreement in accordance with _Section
8.1(e)_, the Company will promptly pay Parent a termination fee (the "
_Termination Fee_ ") of $5,900,000, but in no event later than two (2)
business days after the date of receipt of Parents termination notice. If the
Company intends to terminate this Agreement in accordance with _Section
8.1(f)_, it will, in connection with and as a condition to such termination,
pay Parent the Termination Fee. If (i) Parent or the Company, when applicable,
terminates this Agreement in accordance with (A) _Section 8.1(b)(ii)_ or (B)
_Section 8.1(c)_ due to a material breach of a Company covenant; and (ii)
prior to such time, an Acquisition Proposal has been publicly disclosed and
not publicly withdrawn, then the Company will pay Parent the Termination Fee
upon signing a binding, definitive agreement providing for the consummation of
an Acquisition Proposal (or, if earlier, the consummation of a transaction
contemplated by an Acquisition Proposal); _provided_ , _however_ , that (A)
such signing (or, if earlier, such consummation) occurs within twelve (12)
months after the Termination Date and (B) for purposes of this _Section
8.2(b)_, the references to "fifteen percent (15%)" in the definition of
Acquisition Proposal will be deemed to be references to "fifty percent (50%)".
All amounts due hereunder will be payable by wire transfer in immediately
available funds to such account as Parent may designate in writing to the
Company. If the Company fails to promptly make any payment required in
accordance

 



      
 

 



 

with this _Section 8.2(b)_, the Company will indemnify Parent for its
reasonable and documented fees and expenses (including attorneys fees and
expenses) incurred in collecting such payment and will pay interest on the
amount of the payment at the prime rate of Bank of America (or its successors
or assigns) in effect on the date the payment was payable in accordance with
this _Section 8.2(b)_, or such lesser rate as is the maximum permitted by
applicable Law.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the
parties hereto agree that in no event will the Company be required to pay the
Termination Fee on more than one occasion. The payment, when due and paid, by
the Company to Parent of the Termination Fee pursuant to _Section 8.2(b)_
will, absent intentional or willful breach by the Company of any of its
covenants or agreements set forth in _Section 5.2_ of this Agreement, be the
sole and exclusive remedy of Parent and Merger Sub in the event of the
termination of this Agreement under the circumstances requiring the payment of
the Termination Fee pursuant to _Section 8.2(b)_. For the avoidance of doubt,
in the event Parent actually receives the Termination Fee (and, to the extent
applicable, any other amounts payable under _Section 8.2(b)_), the receipt
thereof will be deemed to be liquidated damages for any and all losses or
damages suffered or incurred by Parent or Merger Sub that Parent or Merger Sub
may be otherwise entitled to pursue under this _Section 8.2_, and in such
case neither Parent nor Merger Sub will be entitled to bring or maintain any
Proceeding or make any claim against the Company or any of its Representatives
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby, except as set forth in the last sentence of _Section
8.2(b)_.

 



 

8.3. _Fees and Expenses_. Except as set forth in _Section 8.2_, all fees,
costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby will be paid by the party incurring such
expenses whether or not the Merger is consummated.

 



 

8.4. _Amendment_. Subject to Law and as otherwise provided in the Agreement,
this Agreement may be amended, modified and supplemented, by written agreement
of the parties hereto. This Agreement may not be amended except by an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto.

 



 

8.5. _Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, either party hereto
may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other
acts of the other party hereto or (b) waive compliance with any of the
agreements of the other party hereto or any conditions to its own obligations,
in each case, only to the extent such obligations, agreements and conditions
are intended for its benefit; _provided_ , _however_ , that any such extension
or waiver will be binding upon a party hereto only if such extension or waiver
is set forth in a writing executed by such party.

9.3. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the Schedules, Annexes and
Exhibits hereto and the documents and instruments referenced herein) contains
the entire agreement among the parties hereto with respect to the Offer, the
Merger and related transactions, and supersedes all prior agreements, written
or oral, among the parties hereto with respect thereto, other than (a) the
Confidentiality Agreement, which, other than Section 10 thereof, will survive

further force or effect and (b) the Tender Agreements with the Principal

9.4. _Governing Law_. This Agreement and all actions arising under or in
connection therewith will be governed by and construed in accordance with the
Laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the Laws that might otherwise

9.5. _Binding Effect; No Assignment; No Third-Party Beneficiaries_.

 



 

(a) This Agreement will not be assigned by any of the parties hereto (whether
by operation of Law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the
other parties hereto, except that Merger Sub may assign, in its sole
discretion and without the consent of any other party hereto, any or all of
its rights, interests and obligations hereunder to (i) Parent or (ii) to
Parent and one or more direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiaries of Parent
(each, an " _Assignee_ "). Any such Assignee may thereafter assign, in its
sole discretion and without the consent of any other party hereto, any or all
of its rights, interests and obligations hereunder to one or more additional
Assignees; _provided_ , _however_ , that in connection with any assignment to
an Assignee, Parent and Merger Sub (or the assignor) will remain liable for
the performance by Parent and Merger Sub (and such assignor, if applicable) of
their obligations hereunder. Subject to the preceding sentence, but without
relieving any party hereto of any obligation hereunder, this Agreement will be
binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties hereto
and their respective successors and assigns.

 



 

(b) Other than _Section 6.6_, which will confer third-party beneficiary
rights to the parties identified therein, nothing in this Agreement, express
or implied, will confer upon any Person other than Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company and their respective successors and permitted assigns any right,
benefit or remedy of any nature by reason of this Agreement.

 



 

9.6. _Counterparts and Signature_. This Agreement may be executed in two (2)
or more counterparts (including by facsimile or by an electronic scan
delivered by electronic mail), each of which will be deemed an original but
all of which together will be considered one and the same agreement and will
become effective when counterparts have been signed by each of the parties
hereto and delivered to the other parties hereto, it being understood that all
parties hereto need not sign the same counterpart. This Agreement may be
executed and delivered by facsimile or by an electronic scan delivered by
electronic mail.

 



 

9.7. _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid or
unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction, the other provisions of
this Agreement will remain in full

 



      
 

 



 

force and effect. Any provision of this Agreement held invalid or
unenforceable only in part or degree will remain in full force and effect to
the extent not held invalid or unenforceable. The parties hereto will replace
such invalid or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid and
enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the economic,
business and other purposes of such invalid or unenforceable provision.

 



 

9.8. _Submission to Jurisdiction; Waiver_. Each of the Company, Parent and
Merger Sub irrevocably agrees that any legal action or proceeding with respect
to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or for recognition
and enforcement of any judgment in respect hereof brought by the other party
hereto or its successors or assigns may be brought and determined in the Court
of Chancery in the State of Delaware and, if such court declines jurisdiction,
any other state court of the State of Delaware or the United States District
Court for the District of Delaware, and each of the Company, Parent and Merger
Sub hereby irrevocably submits with respect to any action or proceeding for
itself and in respect to its property, generally and unconditionally, to the
nonexclusive jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts. Each of the Company, Parent
and Merger Sub hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of
motion, as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any action or proceeding
with respect to this Agreement, (a) any claim that it is not personally
subject to the jurisdiction of the above-named courts for any reason other
than the failure to lawfully serve process, (b) that it or its property is
exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process
commenced in such courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior
to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment
or otherwise) and (c) to the fullest extent permitted by Law, that (i) the
suit, action or proceeding in any such court is brought in an inconvenient
forum, (ii) the venue of such suit, action or proceeding is improper and (iii)
this Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by
such courts.

 



 

9.9. _Rules of Construction_. Except where stated otherwise in this
Agreement, the following rules of interpretation apply to this Agreement, (a)
"either" and "or" are not exclusive and "include", "includes" and "including"
are not limiting, (b) "hereof", "hereto", "hereby", "herein" and "hereunder"
and words of similar import when used in this Agreement refer to this
Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement,
(c) "extent" in the phrase "to the extent" means the degree to which a subject
or other thing extends, and such phrase does not mean simply "if", (d)
descriptive headings, the table of defined terms and the table of contents are
inserted for convenience only and do not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement, (e) definitions contained in this Agreement
are applicable to the singular as well as the plural forms of such terms, (f)
references to a Person are also to its permitted successors and assigns, (g)
references to a "Section", "Exhibit", "Annex" or "Schedule" refer to a Section
of, or an Exhibit, Annex or Schedule to, this Agreement, (h) references to "$"
or otherwise to dollar amounts refer to the lawful currency of the United
States, (i) references to a federal, state, local or foreign statute or Law
include any rules, regulations and delegated legislation issued thereunder and
(j) references to any communication by any Governmental Authority includes a
communication by the staff of such Governmental Authority in their capacity as
such. The language used in this Agreement will be deemed to be the language
chosen by the parties hereto to express their mutual intent, and no rule of
strict construction will be applied against any party hereto. No summary of
this Agreement prepared by any party will affect the meaning or interpretation
of this Agreement. The parties hereto agree that they have been represented by
counsel during the negotiation and execution of this

 



      
 

 



 

Agreement and, therefore, waive the application of any Law, regulation,
holding or ruling of construction providing that ambiguities in an agreement
or other document will be construed against the party drafting such agreement
or document.

 



 

9.10. _No Waiver; Remedies Cumulative_. No failure or delay by any party
hereto in the exercise of any right hereunder will impair such right or be
construed to be a waiver of, or acquiescence in, any breach of any
representation, warranty or agreement herein, nor will any single or partial
exercise of any such right preclude other or further exercise thereof or of
any other right. All rights and remedies existing under this Agreement are
cumulative to, and not exclusive to, and not exclusive of, any rights or
remedies otherwise available.

 



 

9.11. _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF PARENT, COMPANY AND MERGER SUB HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR
COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED IN CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF,
UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY RELATED DOCUMENT, OR ANY
COURSE OF CONDUCT, COURSE OF DEALINGS, STATEMENT OR ACTION RELATED HERETO OR
THERETO.

         
 

 



 

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed this Agreement and Plan
of Merger as of the date first written above.

in part at any time and from time to time, at or prior to the expiration of
the Offer, and in the sole discretion of Parent or Merger Sub (except the

structure, in each case, whether now owned or hereafter acquired by the
Stockholder (the " _Securities_ ").

 



 

 **RECITALS**

 



 

WHEREAS, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company have entered into an Agreement and
Plan of Merger dated as of the date of this Agreement (as the same may be
amended or supplemented, other than to lower the price to be paid in the Offer
or Merger, the " _Merger Agreement_ "), in accordance with which Merger Sub
has agreed to make a cash tender offer described therein and thereafter merge
with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ ") with the result that the Company
becomes a wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent;

 



 

WHEREAS, as of the date of this Agreement, Stockholder beneficially owns and
has the power to dispose of the Securities set forth in _Schedule I_ and has
the power to vote the Shares set forth thereon;

 



 

WHEREAS, Parent and Merger Sub desire to enter into this Agreement in

NOW, THEREFORE, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows:

 



 

1. _Certain Covenants_.

 



 

1.1 _Lock-Up_. Subject to _Section 1.5_, except as contemplated by the Merger
Agreement, Stockholder hereby covenants and agrees that between the date of
this Agreement and the Termination Date, Stockholder will not (a) directly or
indirectly, sell, transfer, assign, pledge, hypothecate, tender, encumber or
otherwise dispose of or limit its right to vote in any manner any of the
Securities, or agree to do any of the foregoing or (b) take any action which
would have the effect of preventing or disabling Stockholder from performing
its obligations in accordance with this Agreement. Nonetheless, in connection
with any transfer not involving or relating to any Acquisition Proposal (as
defined in the Merger Agreement), Stockholder may

      
 

 



 

transfer any or all of the Securities as follows (i) in the case of a
Stockholder that is an entity, to any Subsidiary, partner or member of
Stockholder and (ii) in the case of a Stockholder is an individual, either (x)
to Stockholders spouse, ancestors, descendants or any trust for any of their
benefits or to a charitable trust and (y) to any person or entity if and to
the extent required by any non-consensual legal order, by divorce decree or by
will, intestacy or other similar Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that in any
such case as described in _clauses (i)_ and _(ii)(x)_ above, prior to and as
a condition to the effectiveness of such transfer, (A) each Person to which
any of such Securities or any interest in any of such Securities is or may be
transferred (1) will have executed and delivered to Parent and Merger Sub a
counterpart to this Agreement, in accordance with which such Person will be
bound by this Agreement and (2) will have agreed in writing with Parent and
Merger Sub to hold such Securities or interest in such Securities subject to
this Agreement and (B) this Agreement will be the legal, valid and binding
agreement of such Person, enforceable against such Person in accordance with
its terms.

 



 

1.2 _Certain Events_. This Agreement and the obligations hereunder will attach
to the Securities and will be binding upon any Person to which legal or
beneficial ownership of any or all of the Securities passes, whether by
operation of Law or otherwise, including Stockholders successors or assigns.
This Agreement and the obligations hereunder will also attach to any
additional Shares or other Securities of the Company issued to or acquired by
Stockholder.

 



 

1.3 _Tender of Securities_. Stockholder agrees, in exchange for the
consideration described in the Merger Agreement, to tender the Shares
beneficially owned as of the date of this Agreement and set forth in _Schedule
I_ to Merger Sub in the Offer as soon as practicable following the
commencement of the Offer, and in any event not later than five (5) business
days following the commencement of the Offer, and Stockholder will not
withdraw any such Shares so tendered unless the Offer is terminated.

 



 

1.4 _Public Announcement_. Stockholder will consult with Parent before issuing
any press releases or otherwise making any public statements with respect to
the transactions contemplated herein and will not issue any such press release
or make any such public statement without the approval of Parent, except as
may be required by Law, including any filings with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the " _SEC_ ") in accordance with the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended (the " _Exchange Act_ "). This _Section 1.4_ will terminate
and be null and void upon the earlier of the (a) Termination Date and (b)
consummation of the Merger.

 



 

1.5 _Disclosure_. Stockholder hereby authorizes Parent and Merger Sub to
publish and disclose in any announcement or disclosure required by the SEC,
the NYSE, the Nasdaq Stock Market or any other national securities exchange
and in the Offer Documents (as defined in the Merger Agreement), including all
documents and schedules filed with the SEC in connection with either of the
foregoing, its identity and ownership of the Securities and the nature of its
commitments, arrangements and understandings under this Agreement. Parent and
Merger Sub hereby authorize Stockholder to make such disclosure or filings, in
each case, in a form and substance reasonably acceptable, subject to Law, to
Parent and Merger Sub, as may be required by the SEC or The Nasdaq Stock
Market or any other national securities exchange.

 



 

Annex III-2     
 

 



 

2. _Representations and Warranties of Stockholder_. Stockholder hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub, as of the date of this Agreement and as of the date Merger Sub purchases Shares in accordance with the Offer, that:

 



 

2.1 _Ownership_. Stockholder has good and marketable title to, and is the sole
legal and beneficial owner of the Securities set forth in _Schedule I_ , in
each case, free and clear of all liabilities, claims, liens, options, proxies,
charges, participations and encumbrances of any kind or character whatsoever,
other than those arising under the securities Laws or under the Companys
governance documents or under any registration rights agreement between the
Company and Stockholder (collectively, " _Liens_ "). At the time Merger Sub
purchases the Shares in accordance with the Offer, Stockholder will transfer
and convey to Parent or its designee good and marketable title to the Shares
included in the Securities, free and clear of all Liens created by or arising
through Stockholder.

 



 

2.2 _Authorization_. Stockholder has all requisite power and authority to
execute and deliver this Agreement and to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby and has sole voting power and sole power of disposition,
with respect to the Securities with no restrictions on its voting rights or
rights of disposition pertaining thereto. Stockholder has duly executed and
delivered this Agreement and this Agreement is a legal, valid and binding
agreement of Stockholder, enforceable against Stockholder in accordance with
its terms. If Stockholder is married and the Securities constitute community
property, this Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by

agreement of Stockholders spouse, enforceable against Stockholders spouse in
accordance with its terms.

 



 

2.3 _No Violation_. Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will (a) require
Stockholder to file or register with, or obtain any permit, authorization,
consent or approval of, any governmental agency, authority, administrative or
regulatory body, court or other tribunal, foreign or domestic, or any other
entity other than filings with the SEC in accordance with the Exchange Act or
(b) violate, or cause a breach of or default under, or conflict with any
contract, agreement or understanding, any Law binding upon Stockholder, other
than such violations, breaches, defaults or conflicts which are not,
reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on Stockholders ability
to satisfy its obligations under this Agreement. No proceedings are pending
which, if adversely determined, will have an adverse effect on any ability to
vote or dispose of any of the Securities. The Stockholder has not previously
assigned or sold any of the Securities to any third Person.

 



 

2.4 _Stockholder Has Adequate Information_. Stockholder is a sophisticated
seller with respect to the Securities and has adequate information concerning
the business and financial condition of the Company to make an informed
decision with respect to the sale of the Securities and has independently and
without reliance upon either Merger Sub or Parent and based on such
information as Stockholder has deemed appropriate, made its own analysis and
decision to enter into this Agreement. Stockholder acknowledges that neither
Merger Sub nor Parent has made and neither makes any representation or
warranty, whether express or implied, of any kind or character except as
expressly set forth in this Agreement. Stockholder acknowledges that the
agreements contained herein with respect to the Securities by Stockholder

 



 

Annex III-3     
 

 



 

are irrevocable (prior to the Termination Date), and that Stockholder will
have no recourse to the Securities, Parent or Merger Sub, except with respect
to breaches of representations, warranties, covenants and agreements expressly
set forth in this Agreement.

 



 

2.5 _No Setoff_. The Stockholder has no liability or obligation related to or
in connection with the Securities other than the obligations to Parent and
Merger Sub as set forth in this Agreement. There are no legal or equitable
defenses or counterclaims that have been or may be asserted by or on behalf of
the Company or Stockholder to reduce the amount of the Securities or affect
the validity or enforceability of the Securities.

 



 

2.6 _No Amounts Payable to Stockholder_. Except as disclosed in the Merger
Agreement, there are no amounts due or payable by the Company or any Company
Subsidiary to Stockholder or any of its affiliates or associates in connection
with the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement or this Agreement
or otherwise (other than any payments required in accordance with the Merger
Agreement solely in exchange for equity securities of the Company).

 



 

3. _Representations and Warranties of Parent and Merger Sub_. Parent and Merger Sub hereby represent and warrant to Stockholder, as of the date of this Agreement and as of the date Merger Sub purchases Shares in accordance with the Offer, that:

 



 

3.1 _Authorization_. Parent and Merger Sub have all requisite power and
authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby. Parent and Merger Sub have duly executed and
delivered this Agreement and this Agreement is a legal, valid and binding
agreement of each of Parent and Merger Sub, enforceable against each of Parent
and Merger Sub in accordance with its terms.

 



 

3.2 _No Violation_. Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will violate, or
cause a breach of or default under, any contract or agreement, any statute or
law, or any judgment, decree, order, regulation or rule of any governmental
agency, authority, administrative or regulatory body, court or other tribunal,
foreign or domestic, or any other entity or any arbitration award binding upon
Parent or Merger Sub, other than such violations, breaches or defaults which
are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on either Parents
or Merger Subs ability to satisfy its obligations under this Agreement.

 



 

4. _Survival of Representations and Warranties_. The respective representations and warranties of Stockholder, Parent and Merger Sub contained herein will not be deemed waived or otherwise affected by any investigation made by the other party hereto. The representations and warranties contained herein will terminate at the closing of the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

5. _Specific Performance_. Stockholder acknowledges that Merger Sub and Parent will be irreparably harmed and that there will be no adequate remedy at law for a violation of any of the covenants or agreements of Stockholder which are contained in this Agreement. It is accordingly agreed that, in addition to any other remedies which may be available to Merger Sub and Parent upon the breach by Stockholder of such covenants and agreements, Merger Sub and

 



 

Annex III-4     
 

 



 

Parent will have the right to obtain injunctive relief to restrain any breach
or threatened breach of such covenants or agreements or otherwise to obtain
specific performance of any of such covenants or agreements.

 



 

6. _Miscellaneous_.

the earlier of (a) the day after the Merger is consummated, (b) the Outside

reduces the amount or changes the form of consideration payable thereunder to
Stockholder, (ii) imposes any additional material restrictions on or
additional conditions on the payment of any such consideration to stockholders
of the Company, (iii) imposes any additional material restrictions or
obligations on the Stockholder or (iv) otherwise amends the Merger Agreement
in a manner materially adverse to the Stockholder relative to the other
stockholders of the Company (excluding, in all cases, any amendments affecting
directors, officers or employees of the Company or any Subsidiary of the
Company in their capacities as such who are stockholders of the Company) and
(d) the termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with _Section 8_
thereof and, if due in connection therewith, the payment in full of the
Termination Fee (the earliest of the date specified in any of _clauses (a)_ ,
_(b)_ , _(c)_ and _(d)_ above, the " _Termination Date_ ").

 



 

6.2 _Fiduciary Duties_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, (a) Stockholder makes no agreement or understanding herein in any
capacity other than in Stockholders capacity as a record holder and
beneficial owner of Securities and (b) nothing herein will be construed to
limit or affect any action or inaction by Stockholder or any Representative of
Stockholder, as applicable, serving on the Company Board of Directors or on
the board of directors of any Company Subsidiary or as an officer or fiduciary
of the Company or any of Company Subsidiary, acting in such Persons capacity
as a director, officer or fiduciary of the Company or any Company Subsidiary.
