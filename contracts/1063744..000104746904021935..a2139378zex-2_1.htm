 SECTION 2.9. _ Surrender of Shares; Stock Transfer Book._ 

  

 

 (a)

 _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the mailing of the Proxy Statement, Parent shall appoint a bank or trust company to act as exchange agent (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") for the payment of the Merger Consideration. Immediately after the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock, funds in amounts and at the times necessary for the payment for exchange in accordance with this Article II, of the Merger Consideration (such cash consideration being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The Exchange Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions of Parent, make payments of the Merger Consideration out of the Exchange Fund. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose (except as provided in SECTION 2.9(f)).  


(b)

 _Exchange Procedures_. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate (i) a form of letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates held by such Person shall pass, upon proper delivery to the Exchange Agent of such Certificate and shall be in a form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions in effecting the surrender of such Certificate for the Merger Consideration. Each holder of record of a Certificate upon surrender thereof to the Exchange Agent (together with the letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be requested by the Exchange Agent), shall be entitled to the amount of cash, if any, into which the number of shares of Company Common Stock previously represented by such Certificate surrendered shall have been converted pursuant to SECTION 2.7(a). The Exchange Agent shall accept such Certificate upon compliance with the terms and conditions of this SECTION 2.9 and such other reasonable terms and conditions as the Exchange Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices. After the Effective Time, there shall be no further transfer on the records of the Company or its transfer agent of any Certificate which has been 
 

      

   

converted, in whole or in part, pursuant to this Agreement into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration, and if such Certificates are presented to
the Company for transfer, they shall be cancelled against delivery of the
Merger Consideration. If any cash is to be remitted to a name other than that
in which the Certificate surrendered for exchange is registered, it shall be a
condition of such exchange that the Certificate so surrendered shall be
properly endorsed, with signature guaranteed, or otherwise in proper form for
transfer and that the Person requesting such exchange shall pay to the
Surviving Corporation, its transfer agent, or the Exchange Agent any transfer
or other Taxes required by reason thereof, or establish to the satisfaction of
the Surviving Corporation, its transfer agent or Exchange Agent that such Tax
has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this
SECTION 2.9, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective
Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger
Consideration as contemplated by SECTION 2.7(a). No interest will be paid or
will accrue on any cash payable as Merger Consideration. Parent shall pay all
charges and expenses of the Exchange Agent in connection with payment of the
Merger Consideration.

   

 (c)

 _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock Exchanged for Cash_. All cash paid upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates representing shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms of this Article II shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock exchanged for cash theretofor represented by such Certificates.  


(d)

 _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates for one year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent and any holders of shares of Company Common Stock prior to the Merger who have not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to Parent and only as general creditors thereof for payment of the Merger Consideration. Any portion of the Exchange Fund remaining unclaimed by holders of shares of Company Common Stock as of a date which is immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Entity shall, as of such date and to the extent permitted by law, become the property of Parent free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.  


(e)

 _No Liability_. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent, or any employee, officer, director, agent or Affiliate thereof, shall be liable to any Person in respect of any cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.  


(f)

 _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund, as directed by Parent in: (i) direct obligations of, or obligations the principal of and interest on which are unconditionally guaranteed by, the United States with a remaining term at the time of acquisition thereof not in excess of 90 days; (ii) money market accounts or certificates of deposit maturing within 90 days of the acquisition thereof and issued by a bank or trust company organized under the laws of the United States or a state thereof having a combined capital surplus in excess of $500,000,000 (a " _United States Bank_ "); (iii) commercial paper issued by a domestic 
 

      

   

corporation and given the highest rating by Standard and Poor\'s Corporation
and Moody\'s Investors Service, Inc. with a remaining term at the time of
acquisition thereof not in excess of 90 days; or (iv) demand deposits with
any United States Bank. Any interest and other income resulting from such
investments shall be paid to Parent. To the extent that there are losses with
respect to such investments, or the Exchange Fund diminishes for other reasons
below the level required to make prompt payments of the Merger Consideration
as contemplated hereby, Parent shall promptly replace or restore the portion
of the Exchange Fund lost through investments or other events so as to ensure
that the Exchange Fund is, at all times, maintained at a level sufficient to
make such payments.

   

 (g)

 _Withholding Rights_. Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock such amounts as Parent is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld by Parent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent.  


(h)

 _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen, defaced or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen, defaced or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in such form and reasonable amount as Parent may require as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen, defaced or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof, pursuant to this Agreement. 
 

  

 SECTION 2.10. _ Options and Option Plans._ 

  

 The Company shall take all reasonable actions necessary to provide that, as of the Effective Time, each then outstanding option to purchase shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Options_ ") granted under the Company\'s 1998 Stock Option Plan, as amended (the " _Option Plan_ "), whether or not then exercisable or vested, shall be cancelled and shall be of no further force or effect and, in consideration of such cancellation, the holders thereof shall be entitled to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the amount by which (x) the Merger Consideration exceeds (y) the applicable per share exercise price of the Option subject to cancellation, if any, and (ii) the number of shares subject to such Option at the time of such cancellation. Such amount shall be subject to reduction by applicable Tax withholding.

 SECTION 5.2. _ No Solicitation._ 

  

 (a) The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and use reasonable efforts to cause its officers, directors, representatives and agents (" _Company Representatives_ ") to immediately cease any discussions or negotiations with any Third Party that may be ongoing with respect to a Takeover Proposal. The Company shall not, nor shall it permit any of its Subsidiaries to, nor shall it authorize or permit any of its Company Representatives to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or encourage, any inquiries or the making of any proposal which constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to lead to, any Takeover Proposal or (ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any Person (other than Parent or Merger Sub) any information in connection with, any Takeover Proposal; _provided, however,_ that if, at any time prior to obtaining the Stockholder Approval, the Board of Directors determines in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel) that the failure to take the following-described action would be inconsistent with the Board of Directors\' fiduciary duties to the Company\'s stockholders under applicable law, the Company may, in response to a Takeover Proposal (which the Board of Directors determines in good faith is reasonably likely to result in a Superior Proposal) which was unsolicited and did not otherwise result from a breach of this SECTION 5.2, and subject to providing three Business Days\' prior written notice of its decision to take such action to Parent and subject to compliance with SECTION 5.2(c), (x) furnish information with respect to the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of its or its Subsidiaries\' officers, directors, employees, representatives and agents to the Person making such Takeover Proposal pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement which contains terms that are in no respect less favorable to the Company than the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement and (y) participate in discussions and negotiations with such Person (and its representatives) regarding such Takeover Proposal. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, it is understood that any violation of the restrictions set forth in the preceding sentence by any Subsidiary of the Company or any Company Representative shall be deemed to be a breach of SECTION 5.2(a) by the Company. The Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, release any Third Party from, or waive any provision of, any confidentiality or standstill agreement, unless, the Board of Directors determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel) that the failure to take such action with respect to a standstill agreement would be inconsistent with the Board of Directors\' fiduciary duties to the Company\'s 

        

stockholders under applicable law, but in any case, only prior to the
Stockholder Approval being obtained.

   

 (b) Except as set forth in this SECTION 5.2, neither the Board of Directors nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw or modify, or propose publicly to withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, the approval or recommendation or declaration of advisability by the Board of Directors, or any committee thereof, of this Agreement or the Merger or the transactions contemplated hereby, or resolve or agree to take any such action, (ii) approve or recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend, any Takeover Proposal or resolve or agree to take any such action (any such action or any such resolution or agreement to take such action described in the preceding clause (i) or this clause (ii) being referred to herein as an " _Adverse Recommendation Change_ ") or (iii) cause or permit the Company to enter into any letter of intent, agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, joint venture or partnership agreement, option agreement or other similar agreement (each, a " _Company Acquisition Agreement_ ") related to any Takeover Proposal or resolve or agree to take any such action. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that prior to the Stockholder Approval being obtained, (x) the Company receives a Superior Proposal and which was unsolicited and did not otherwise result from a breach of this SECTION 5.2 and (y) the Board of Directors determines in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel) that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the Board of Directors\' fiduciary duties to the Company\'s stockholders under applicable law, the Board of Directors may, prior to the Stockholder Approval being obtained, and so long as at such time such Takeover Proposal continues to be a Superior Proposal (A) withdraw, modify or change its approval or recommendation or not make any recommendation of the Merger, (B) approve or recommend such Superior Proposal and/or (C) terminate this Agreement pursuant to SECTION 8.1(c)(i) (while concurrently causing the Company to enter into a definitive Company Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal). 

  

 (c) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this SECTION 5.2, the Company shall promptly advise Parent orally or in writing of any request for information or of any Takeover Proposal and the material terms and conditions of such request or Takeover Proposal, the identity of the Person making such request or Takeover Proposal and any changes in any such request or to any such Takeover Proposal. The Company shall promptly provide to Parent any information concerning the Company or any of its Subsidiaries provided to any other Third Party who submitted a Takeover Proposal, which was not previously provided to Parent. 

  

 (d) Nothing contained in this SECTION 5.2 shall prohibit the Company from (i) taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2 or Item 1012 of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making a "stop-look-and-listen" communication of the nature contemplated in, and otherwise in compliance with, Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii) making such disclosure to the Company\'s stockholders as, in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors (after consultation with outside legal counsel) would be required under applicable law; _provided_ that the Company (and the Board of Directors and any 

       

 committee thereof) may not, except as permitted by SECTION 5.2(b), withdraw
or modify, or publicly propose to withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to
Parent or Merger Sub, the approval or recommendation or declaration of
advisability by the Board of Directors or any committee thereof of this
Agreement, or the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, or
resolve or agree to take any such action, or approve or recommend, or
publicly propose to approve or recommend, any Takeover Proposal or resolve or
agree to take any such action or cause the Company to enter into any Company

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

  

 SECTION 6.1. _Proxy Statement_. 

  

  

 (a) As promptly as practicable after the date of the Agreement, the Company shall prepare and file with the SEC, and shall use all reasonable efforts to have cleared by the SEC, and promptly thereafter shall mail to stockholders, a proxy statement in connection with a meeting of the Company\'s stockholders (the " _Stockholders Meeting_ ") to consider the Merger (such proxy statement, as amended or supplemented, is herein referred to as the " _Proxy Statement_ "). The Company shall as promptly as practicable (i) notify Parent of (A) the receipt of any oral or written comments from the SEC and (B) any request by the SEC for any amendment to the Proxy Statement or for additional information and (ii) provide Parent with copies of all written correspondence between the Company and the SEC or members of its staff with respect to the Proxy Statement.

The Proxy Statement shall contain the recommendation of the Board of Directors in favor of the Merger. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if (x) the Company receives a Superior Proposal which was unsolicited and did not otherwise result from a breach of SECTION 5.2 and (y) the Board of Directors has determined (in good faith after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors under applicable law, the Board of Directors may, as long as at such time such Takeover Proposal continues to be a Superior Proposal, determine (A) not to make or may withdraw, modify or change, such recommendation (provided that such determination shall not allow the Company to fail to file, mail and clear with the SEC the Proxy Statement and hold the Stockholders Meeting as described herein). The Company may, if it has complied with the provisions of SECTION 5.2 and this SECTION 6.1 and if it receives a Takeover Proposal (which is reasonably likely to result in a Superior Proposal) which was unsolicited and did not otherwise result from a breach of SECTION 5.2, delay the mailing of the Proxy Statement or the holding of the Stockholders Meeting, in each case, for such time (not to 

  

      

  

exceed five Business Days) as is necessary for the Board of Directors to
consider such Takeover Proposal and to determine the effect, if any, on its
recommendation in favor of the Merger.

  

 (b) Parent and Merger Sub will furnish the Company with such information concerning Parent and Merger Sub and their Subsidiaries as is necessary in order to cause the Proxy Statement, insofar as it relates to Parent and Merger Sub and any of their Subsidiaries, to comply with applicable law. The Company, Parent and Merger Sub agree to cooperate in making any preliminary filings of the Proxy Statement with the SEC, as promptly as practicable, pursuant to Rule 14a-6 under the Exchange Act.

The obligations pursuant to this SECTION 6.2 shall not be affected by the commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or communication of any Takeover Proposal. 

  

 SECTION 6.3. _Compliance with Law_. 

  

 Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub will comply in all material respects with all applicable laws and with all applicable rules and regulations of any Governmental Entity in connection with its execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. 

  

 SECTION 6.4. _Notification of Certain Matters_. 

   

 Each party shall give prompt notice to the others of (i) the occurrence or nonoccurrence of any event whose occurrence or nonoccurrence would reasonably be likely to cause any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect (or if any representation or warranty qualified by materiality or a Material Adverse Effect, then notification is required as to the occurrence or nonoccurrence of any event whose occurrence, or nonoccurrence would reasonably be likely to cause such representation or warranty contained in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate in all respects), (ii) any notice or other communication alleging that the consent of any Third Party is or may be required in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, _provided_ that such consent would have been required to have been disclosed in this Agreement, (iii) receipt of any material notice or other communication from any Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or (iv) the commencement or, to the respective party\'s knowledge, the threat of any litigation involving or affecting the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any of their respective properties or assets, or, to the respective party\'s knowledge, any employee, agent, director or officer, in his or her capacity as such, of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries which, if pending on the date hereof, would have been required to have been disclosed in this Agreement. The delivery of notice pursuant to this 

        

SECTION 6.4 is for informational purposes and shall not limit or otherwise
affect the remedies available hereunder to any party or parties receiving such
notice. Except as otherwise provided in such notice, the delivery of any such
notice shall not be deemed an admission or an acknowledgment (x) that the
subject matter of such notice is material or would reasonably be likely to
result in a Material Adverse Effect or is outside of the ordinary course of
business or inconsistent with past ractices or (y) that there has occurred an
actual or anticipatory breach of, or failure to comply with or satisfy, any
representation, warranty, covenant, condition or agreement.

  

 SECTION 6.5. _Access to Information_.

The Confidentiality Agreement shall apply with respect to the information furnished thereunder and hereunder and other activities contemplated thereby or hereby. 

  

 SECTION 6.6. _Public Announcements_. 

  

 So long as this Agreement is in effect, no party hereto shall issue or permit their Affiliates to issue any press release or otherwise make any public statements with respect to the Merger without the prior consent of the other parties hereto (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), except as may be required by law, rule or regulation (including, but not limited to, any NYSE rule or regulation) in which circumstances reasonable efforts shall be made 

        

to consult with the other party to the extent reasonably practicable.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company and Parent shall be permitted to

 SECTION 6.8. _Agreement to Defend and Indemnify_. 

  

  

 (a) The Company shall, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law and regardless of whether the Merger becomes effective, indemnify and hold harmless, and 

  

      

  

after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and
the Surviving Corporation shall for a period of six years following the
Effective Time, indemnify and hold harmless, each of the Company\'s and its
Subsidiaries\' officers, directors, and employees, including, without
limitation, officers and directors serving as such on the date hereof
(collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") against any costs or expenses
(including reasonable attorneys\' fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims,
damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation arising out of or pertaining
to any of the transactions contemplated hereby, including without limitation
liabilities arising under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act in connection with the Merger, and in each case to the
extent provided under the Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and
Restated Bylaws of the Company. In the event of any such claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation (whether arising before or after the Effective
Time), (i) the Company shall, and following the Effective Time, Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to, and the Surviving Corporation shall, pay
the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel selected by the Indemnified
Parties, which counsel shall reasonably be satisfactory to the Company or
Parent and the Surviving Corporation, promptly as statements therefor are
received, to the extent that the Company is permitted to make such payments
under applicable law and the Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and
Restated Bylaws of the Company, and (ii) the Company, Parent and the Surviving
Corporation will cooperate in the defense of any such matter;
_provided, however_ , that neither the Company, Parent nor the Surviving
Corporation shall be liable for any settlement effected without its prior
written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed); and _provided further_ that neither the Company, Parent nor the
Surviving Corporation shall be obliged pursuant to this SECTION 6.8 to pay
the fees and disbursements of more than one counsel for all Indemnified
Parties in any single action except to the extent that, in the reasonable
opinion of counsel for the Indemnified Parties, two or more of such
Indemnified Parties have conflicting interests in the outcome of such action.
For six years after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
be required to maintain or obtain officers\' and directors\' liability
insurance covering the Indemnified Parties who are currently covered by the
Company\'s officers and directors liability insurance policy on terms not
less favorable than those in effect on the date hereof in terms of coverage
and amounts and shall continue in effect the indemnification provisions
currently provided by the Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and
Restated Bylaws of the Company for a period of not less than six years
following the Effective Time to the extent that it is permitted to do so
by applicable law. In satisfying its obligations under this SECTION 6.8, the
Surviving Corporation shall not be obligated to pay premiums in excess of 200%
of the annualized premium for such policy based on the rate thereof as of the
date of this Agreement (which annualized premium is hereby represented and
warranted by the Company to be $929,500). If, during such six-year period,
such insurance coverage cannot be obtained at all or can be obtained only for
an amount in excess of 200% of the Company\'s annual premium therefor, the
Surviving Corporation shall cause to be obtained as much insurance as can be
obtained for an amount equal to 200% of the Company\'s annual premium on the
date of this Agreement, on terms not less favorable than those in effect on
the date hereof in terms of coverage and amounts.

  

      

  

 (b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, this SECTION 6.8 is intended to be for the benefit of and to grant Third Party rights to Indemnified Parties whether or not parties to this Agreement, and each of the Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to enforce the covenants contained herein. If the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation assume the obligations set forth in this SECTION 6.8. 

  

  

 SECTION 6.9. _State Takeover Laws_. 

  

 If any state takeover statute or other similar statute or regulation becomes or is deemed to become applicable to the Merger, this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Company shall take all reasonable action necessary to render such statute or regulation inapplicable to the foregoing. 

  

 SECTION 6.10. _Employee Matters_. 

  

 As of the Effective Time, the Parent shall assume, or cause the Surviving Corporation to assume, all employment agreements and termination benefit agreements and arrangements which are in effect at the Company on the date hereof and Parent shall honor and satisfy, or cause the Surviving Corporation to honor and satisfy, all obligations and liabilities with respect to the Company Employee Benefit Plans. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Surviving Corporation shall not be required to continue any particular Company Employee Benefit Plan after the Effective Time, and any Company Employee Benefit Plan may be amended or terminated in accordance with its terms and applicable law. To the extent that any Company Employee Benefit Plan (other than an equity-based compensation plan) is amended or terminated within the six-month period immediately following the Effective Time so as to reduce the benefits that are then being provided with respect to participants thereunder, Parent shall arrange for each individual who is then a participant in such terminated or amended plan to participate in a benefit plan maintained by Parent or any of its Affiliates in accordance with the eligibility criteria thereof that provides the same type of benefit, _provided_ that (i) such participants shall receive full credit for years of service with the Company or any Subsidiary (including any service with predecessor entities) prior to the Merger for purposes of eligibility and vesting but excluding benefit accrual or the amount of benefits, (ii) for at least the six-month period immediately following the Effective Time, such participants shall participate in Parent or Parent Affiliate benefit plans on terms no less favorable than those offered by Parent or its Affiliates to similarly situated employees of Parent or its Affiliates and (iii) Parent shall cause any and all preexisting conditions limitations (to the extent such limitations do not apply to a preexisting condition under the Company Employee Benefit Plan) and eligibility waiting periods under any group health plans to be waived with respect to such participants and their eligible dependents.

 The headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. 

  

 SECTION 9.5. _ Severability._ 

  

 If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law, or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner adverse to any party.

 SECTION 9.6. _ Assignment._ 

   

 This Agreement shall not be assigned by operation of law or otherwise, except that Parent and Merger Sub may assign all or any of their rights hereunder to any Affiliate of Parent; _provided_ that no such assignment shall relieve the assigning party of its obligations hereunder. 

  

 SECTION 9.7. _ Governing Law._ 

  

 This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware without regard to its rules of conflict of laws.

stockholders of the Company, no amendment may be made which would reduce the
Merger Consideration. This Agreement may not be amended except by an
instrument in writing signed by the parties hereto.

  

 SECTION 9.9. _ Waiver._ 

  

 At any time before the Effective Time, any party hereto may (i) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties hereto, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other parties hereto contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (iii) waive compliance by the other parties hereto with any of their agreements or conditions contained herein; _provided_ , _however_ , that after the stockholder approval of the Merger has been obtained, there shall be made no waiver that by law requires further approval by stockholders of the parties without the further approval of such stockholders. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only as against such party and only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by such party. The failure of any party hereto to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of those rights. 

   

 SECTION 9.10. _ Entire Agreement; No Third Party Beneficiaries._ 

  

  

 (a) This Agreement, the Disclosure Schedules and any exhibits attached hereto, as well as the Confidentiality Agreement, constitute the entire agreement and supersede any and all other prior agreements and undertakings, both written and oral, among the parties, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement is not intended to confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies hereunder, other than SECTION 6.8, "Agreement to Defend and Indemnify," which is intended to be for the benefit of and shall be enforceable by the officers and directors of the Company and its Subsidiaries and their heirs and representatives. 

  

 (b) Any information provided in any Disclosure Schedule hereto (other than in SECTION 1 or SECTION 4.8 of the Disclosure Schedules) is considered disclosed in each and every other Disclosure Schedule hereto (other than SECTIONS 4.2, 4.6 and 4.7 of the Disclosure Schedules) as to which such information is applicable, to the extent that it is apparent from the face of such disclosure that such disclosure is applicable to such other Disclosure Schedule. The Company agrees that the disclosure in SECTION 4.8 of the Disclosure Schedules does not, and is not intended to, qualify any of its representations and warranties in this Agreement other than the representations and warranties in SECTION 4.8 hereof. Any disclosure in any Disclosure Schedule of any contract, document, liability, default, breach, violation, limitation, impediment or other matter, although the provision for such disclosure may require such disclosure only if such contract, document, liability, default, breach, violation, limitation, impediment or other matter be "material," shall not be construed against the Company, as an assertion that any such contract, document, liability, default, breach, violation, limitation, impediment or other matter is, in fact, material. 

  

       

 SECTION 9.11. _ Counterparts._ 

  

 This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts (including by facsimile), and by the different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which shall constitute one and the same agreement. 

  

 SECTION 9.12. _ Interpretation._ 

  

 Except where expressly stated otherwise in this Agreement, the following rules of interpretation apply to this Agreement: (i) "either" and "or" are not exclusive and "include", "includes" and "including" are not limiting; (ii) "hereof", "hereto", "hereby", "herein\' and "hereunder" and words of similar import when used in this Agreement refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement; (iii) "extent" in the phrase "to the extent" means the degree to which a subject or other thing extends, and such phrase does not mean simply "if"; (iv) all references to "filings" with the SEC shall construed to include documents "furnished" to the SEC; (v) references to a law include any amendment or modification to such law and any rules, regulations and delegated legislation issued thereafter, whether such amendment or modification is made, or issuance of such rules, regulations or delegated legislation occurs, before or after the date of this Agreement; and (vi) references to the "ordinary course of business" refer to the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice during the past year. 

  

 SECTION 9.13. _ Enforcement; Waiver of Jury Trial._ 

  

  

 (a) The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties hereto shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, New Castle County, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. 

  

 (b) Each party hereto hereby waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any right it may have to a trial by jury in respect of any suit, action or other proceeding directly or indirectly arising out of, under or in connection with this Agreement. Each party hereto (a) certifies that no representative, agent or attorney of any other party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such party would not, in the event of any action, suit or proceeding, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver and (b) acknowledges that it and the other parties hereto have been induced to enter into this Agreement, by, among other things, the mutual waiver and certifications in this SECTION 9.13(b).
