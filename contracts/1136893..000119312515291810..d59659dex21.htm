(h) If at any time between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time

shares of Parent Common Stock that otherwise would be received by
such holder) shall, upon surrender of such holders Certificates (or, for
holders of uncertificated shares of Class L Common Stock or SCCII Preferred

cash as described in this _Section 3.1(i)_ will be returned to Parent
following Closing as and when cash is paid in lieu of any amount of

be required to (i) issue more shares of Parent Common Stock at the Closing
than the Aggregate Stock Amount less (A) the number of shares of Parent Common
Stock required to be returned to Parent pursuant to the preceding sentence
and (B) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock underlying the Converted

and without limiting the obligation of Parent to issue such shares of Parent
Common Stock upon the settlement of such Converted RSUs in accordance with the
terms thereof) or (ii) pay more cash than the Aggregate Cash Amount plus the

payable pursuant to this _Section 3.1(i)_.

Section 3.2.  _Payment of Merger Consideration_.

(a) Prior to the Closing, Parent shall appoint a bank or trust company of
national recognition reasonably acceptable to the Company, or Parents
transfer agent, to act as exchange agent (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") hereunder.
At the Closing, Parent shall deposit, or

 



30  cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent, in trust for the benefit of
the holders of shares of Class L Common Stock and SCCII Preferred Stock, for
exchange in accordance with this  _Section 3.2_, (i) certificates or
evidence of book-entry shares representing a number of shares of Parent Common
Stock sufficient to pay the holders of shares of Class L Common Stock and
SCCII Preferred Stock the Per Share Merger 1 Stock Amount and the Per Share
Merger 2 Stock Amount, respectively, in respect of each share of Class L
Common Stock and SCCII Preferred Stock held by such holders and (ii) an amount
of cash sufficient to pay (A) the holders of shares of Class L Common Stock
and SCCII Preferred Stock the Per Share Merger 1 Cash Amount and the Per Share
Merger 2 Cash Amount, respectively, in respect of each share of Class L Common
Stock and SCCII Preferred Stock held by such holders plus (B) the cash to be
paid to such holders in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to _Section
3.1(i)_ (such shares of Parent Common Stock together with such cash, the "
_Exchange Fund_ "). On the Closing Date, Parent shall cause the Exchange
Agent to pay from the Exchange Fund to each holder of Class L Common Stock and
each holder of SCCII Preferred Stock who has surrendered its Certificates, if
applicable, and delivered a properly completed and duly executed Letter of
Transmittal by the second (2nd) Business Day prior to the Closing Date, the
Per Share Merger 1 Consideration for each share of Class L Common Stock held
by such holder and the Per Share Merger 2 Consideration for each share of
SCCII Preferred Stock held by such holder, and following the Closing Date,
Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to pay from the Exchange Fund to each
other holder of Class L Common Stock (who has thereafter surrendered its
Certificates, if applicable, and delivered a properly completed and duly
executed Letter of Transmittal) the Per Share Merger 1 Consideration for
each share of Class L Common Stock held by such holder and to each other
holder of SCCII Preferred Stock (who has thereafter surrendered its
Certificates, if applicable, and delivered a properly completed and duly
executed Letter of Transmittal) the Per Share Merger 2 Consideration for each
share of SCCII Preferred Stock held by such holder, in each case in accordance
with the procedures and timing set forth herein.

 

(b) At, or as promptly as reasonably practicable after the Final Effective
Time, Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving Company to deliver (i) in
exchange for each Vested Option and Vested Appreciation Unit which is
cancelled pursuant to _Section 3.4(c)_ and _Section 3.4(d)_, the Per Share
Merger 1 Consideration for each Net Option/Appreciation Unit Class L Share
and the Per Share Merger 2 Consideration for each Net Option/Appreciation Unit
Preferred Share relating to each such Vested Option or Vested Appreciation
Unit _net of_ the Applicable Withholding Amounts in accordance with  _Section
3.4(c)_ and _Section 3.4(d)_ and (ii) in exchange for each Vested RSU which
is cancelled pursuant to _Section 3.4(f)_, the Per Share Merger 1
Consideration for each share of Class L Common Stock underlying such Vested
RSU and the Per Share Merger 2 Consideration for each share of SCCII Preferred
Stock underlying such Vested RSU _net of_ the Applicable Withholding Amount in
accordance with _Section 3.4(f)_.

 

(c) The following provisions shall be applicable to payment of the Per Share
Merger 1 Consideration and the Per Share Merger 2 Consideration:

(i) At the time specified in _Section 6.7(d)_, the Company will deliver or
mail or will cause to be delivered or mailed to each holder of Class L Common
Stock and SCCII Preferred Stock a letter of transmittal in the form attached
hereto as _Exhibit E_ (the " _Letter of Transmittal_ "), which shall specify
that delivery shall be effected, only upon proper delivery of the related
Certificates (or, for holders of uncertificated shares, upon proper delivery
of a fully

 



31  executed Letter of Transmittal) in accordance therewith to the Company or
the Surviving Company, as applicable, and instructions for use in surrendering
such shares of Class L Common Stock and SCCII Preferred Stock and receiving
the applicable Per Share Merger Consideration in respect of the Class L Common
Stock and SCCII Preferred Stock evidenced thereby. Upon the surrender of each
such Certificate, if applicable, and a properly completed and duly executed
Letter of Transmittal at least two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing
Date, the Exchange Agent shall, on the Closing Date following the Final
Effective Time, pay the holder of such shares of Class L Common Stock and
SCCII Preferred Stock the applicable Per Share Merger Consideration in
consideration therefor, and such shares of Class L Common Stock and SCCII
Preferred Stock and any related Certificate shall (A) in the case of shares of
Class L Common Stock be cancelled at and as of the Effective Time, and (B) in
the case of shares of SCCII Preferred Stock be cancelled at and as of the
Merger 2 Effective Time. Upon the surrender of each such Certificate, if
applicable, and a properly completed and duly executed Letter of Transmittal
any time after the second (2nd) Business Day prior to the Closing Date, the
Exchange Agent shall, no earlier than at the Closing following the Final
Effective Time and as soon as reasonably practicable, which shall not exceed
five (5) Business Days from receipt by the Exchange Agent of such
Certificates, if applicable, and a properly completed and duly executed Letter
of Transmittal, pay the holder of such shares of Class L Common Stock and
SCCII Preferred Stock the applicable Per Share Merger Consideration in
consideration therefor, and such shares of Class L Common Stock and SCCII
Preferred Stock and any related Certificate shall (A) in the case of shares
of Class L Common Stock be cancelled at and as of the Effective Time, and (B)
in the case of shares of SCCII Preferred Stock be cancelled at and as of the
Merger 2 Effective Time. Until so surrendered, each such Certificate (other
than Certificates representing Cancelled Shares or Dissenting Shares) shall
represent solely the right to receive the applicable Per Share Merger
Consideration relating thereto.

 

(ii) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Surviving Company of any shares of Consolidated Capital
Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after
the Effective Time, shares of Class L Common Stock and SCCII Preferred Stock
are presented to the Exchange Agent, they shall be surrendered and
cancelled against delivery of the applicable Per Share Merger Consideration
as provided in this _Article III_.

(iii) No interest shall accrue or be paid on the Per Share Merger
Consideration payable upon the delivery of Certificates or Letters of
Transmittal. None of Parent, the Surviving Company, the Exchange Agent or any
of their respective Affiliates shall be liable to a holder of Consolidated
Capital Stock or holder of Company Equity Awards for any cash or interest
thereon or other property delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws. Any portion of the
Exchange Fund remaining unclaimed by holders of Class L Common Stock and
SCCII Preferred Stock or amounts unclaimed by holders of Company Equity Awards
twelve (12) months after the applicable Merger Effective Time (or such earlier
date immediately prior to such time when the amounts would otherwise escheat
to or become property of any Governmental Entity) shall become, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, the property of the Surviving Company free and
clear of any claim or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. Any
portion of the Exchange Fund which remains unclaimed shall, at Parents
option, be paid to Parent.

 



32 (iv) After the Closing Date, any holder of Class L Common Stock and SCCII
Preferred Stock or holder of Company Equity Awards will be entitled to look
only to the Surviving Company for payment of their respective claims for the
consideration set forth in this _Article III_, without interest thereon, but
will have no greater rights against the Surviving Company than may be
accorded to general creditors thereof under applicable Law.

(v) In the event that any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent will
issue, or will cause to be issued, in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate the payments with respect to such Certificate to which
such Person is entitled pursuant to this _Article III_; _provided_ that the
Person to whom such payments are made shall, as a condition precedent to the
payment thereof, indemnify Parent and the Surviving Company against any claim
that may be made against Parent or the Surviving Company with respect to the
Certificate claimed to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

 

(vi) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Exchange
Agent, Parent and the Surviving Company shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from any amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such
amounts as are required to be deducted or withheld with respect to the making
of such payment under the Code or any applicable provision of state, local
or foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld,
such deducted or withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction
or withholding was made.

(vii) If payment of the Per Share Merger Consideration in respect of a share
of Class L Common Stock or SCCII Preferred Stock is to be made to a Person
other than the Person in whose name a surrendered Certificate is registered,
it shall be a condition to such payment that the Certificate so surrendered
shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer
and that the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and
other Taxes required by reason of such payment in a name other than that of
the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or shall have established
to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent that such Taxes either have been
paid or are not payable.

(viii) No dividends or other distributions declared or made with respect to
Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid
to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate (or uncertificated shares of
Class L Common Stock and SCCII Preferred Stock or holder of a Company Equity
Award) with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable upon
surrender thereof, and no cash payment with respect to any cash portion of Per
Share Merger Consideration or in lieu of fractional shares shall be paid to
any such holder, until the surrender of such Certificate (or uncertificated
shares of Class L Common Stock and SCCII Preferred Stock) or other relevant
provisions are followed in accordance with this _Article III_. Subject to
escheat, Tax or other applicable Law, following surrender of any such
Certificate (or uncertificated shares of Class L Common Stock and SCCII
Preferred Stock), there shall be paid to the holder of the certificate
representing whole shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange therefor,
without interest, at the time of such surrender, (A) the amount of any cash
payable in lieu of a fractional share of Parent Common Stock to which such
holder is 

 



33  entitled pursuant to _Section 3.1(i)_ and (B) the amount of dividends or
other distributions declared on the shares of Parent Common Stock with a
record date after the applicable Merger Effective Time and a payment date
prior to such surrender that is payable with respect to such whole shares of
Parent Common Stock and, at the appropriate payment date, the amount of
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the applicable
Merger Effective Time and a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable
with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock.

 

(ix) The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund,
as directed by Parent, on a daily basis; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that any
such investments shall be in short-term obligations of the United States with
maturities of no more than thirty (30) days or short-term obligations
guaranteed by the United States or backed by the full faith and credit of the
United States. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments
shall be paid to Parent upon termination of the Exchange Fund pursuant to this
_Section 3.2_. No investment of the Exchange Fund shall relieve Parent,
the Surviving Company or the Exchange Agent from promptly making the payments
required by this _Article III_, and following any losses from any such
investment, Parent shall promptly provide additional cash funds to the
Exchange Agent for the benefit of the holders of Class L Common Stock and
SCCII Preferred Stock at the Effective Time in the amount of such losses,
which additional funds will be deemed to be part of the Exchange Fund.

 

(d) (i) If applicable, for all purposes of this _Section 3.2_ and for U.S.
federal income tax purposes, and in accordance with Treasury Regulation
Section 1.358-2(a)(2)(ii), a holder of Class L Common Stock will be treated as
having surrendered, in exchange for the Aggregate Stockholder Cash
Consideration to be paid to such holder pursuant to  _Section 3.1_, a number
of shares of Class L Common Stock evidenced by Certificates (which are
specifically identified by such stockholder in the Letter of Transmittal to be
the Certificates exchanged for such stockholders Aggregate Stockholder Cash
Consideration) equal to the product of (A) the total number of shares of Class
L Common Stock held by such stockholder and converted into the right to
receive the Per Share Merger 1 Consideration pursuant to this Agreement and
(B) the Cash Ratio.

(ii) If applicable, for all purposes of this _Section 3.2_ and for U.S.
federal income tax purposes, and in accordance with Treasury Regulation
Section 1.358-2(a)(2)(ii), a holder of SCCII Preferred Stock will be treated
as having surrendered, in exchange for the Aggregate Stockholder Cash
Consideration to be paid to such holder pursuant to _Section 3.1_, a number
of shares of SCCII Preferred Stock evidenced by Certificates (which are
specifically identified by such stockholder in the Letter of Transmittal to be
the Certificates exchanged for such stockholders Aggregate Stockholder Cash
Consideration) equal to the product of (A) the total number of shares of SCCII
Preferred Stock held by such stockholder and converted into the right to
receive the Per Share Merger 2 Consideration pursuant to this Agreement and
(B) the Cash Ratio.

Section 3.3. _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, shares of Consolidated Capital Stock that are
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time or the Merger 2 Effective
Time, as the case may be, and which are held by stockholders who shall have
not voted in favor of Merger 1 or Merger 2 or

 



34  consented thereto in writing and who shall have properly demanded and are
entitled to appraisal for such shares in accordance with Section 262 of the
DGCL (collectively, the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into
or represent the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration, if any.
Such stockholders instead shall only be entitled to receive payment of the
appraised value of such shares of Consolidated Capital Stock held by them in
accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL, except that all
Dissenting Shares held by stockholders who shall have failed to perfect or who
effectively shall have waived, withdrawn, or otherwise are not entitled to,
the right to appraisal of such shares of Consolidated Capital Stock under
Section 262 of the DGCL shall thereupon be deemed to have been canceled and
converted into and to have become exchangeable, as of the Effective Time or
the Merger 2 Effective Time, as applicable, for the right to receive, without
any interest thereon, the Per Share Merger Consideration to which such shares
of Consolidated Capital Stock are entitled pursuant to this Agreement, if
any, upon surrender in the manner provided in _Section 3.2_. The Company
shall (a) give Parent prompt notice of any notice or demand for appraisal or
payment for shares of Consolidated Capital Stock or any withdrawals of
such demands received by the Company, (b) give Parent the opportunity to
participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such
demands and (c) not, without the prior written consent of Parent, make any
payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle any such demands. Any
payments made with respect to the Dissenting Shares shall be made from the
cash accounts of the Company that exist immediately prior to the Effective
Time.

 

Section 3.4. _Treatment of Company Stock Options; Company Appreciation Units;
Company Restricted Stock Units_.

 

(a) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each outstanding and unvested
Company Stock Option (other than any such Company Stock Option that is an
Underwater Option), and each outstanding and unvested Company Appreciation
Unit (other than any Company Appreciation Unit that is an Underwater
Appreciation Unit) shall, without any further action on the part of any holder
thereof, become fully vested, and shall be treated as a Vested Option and
Vested Appreciation Unit, respectively, pursuant to this _Section 3.4_.

 

(b) At the Effective Time, each outstanding Vested Option (other than any such
Vested Option that is an Underwater Option) shall, without any further action
on the part of any holder thereof, be cancelled and the holder thereof shall
be entitled to receive (i) no consideration with respect to each share of
Class A Common Stock underlying such Vested Option, (ii)(A) the Per Share
Merger 1 Consideration with respect to each Net Option/Appreciation Unit Class
L Share relating to such Vested Option _net of_ (B) the Applicable Withholding
Amount and (iii)(A) the Per Share Merger 2 Consideration with respect to each
Net Option/Appreciation Unit Preferred Share relating to such Vested Option
_net of_ (B) the Applicable Withholding Amount, and all such Vested Options
shall otherwise cease to be outstanding, shall be canceled and cease
to exist. The Applicable Withholding Amounts covered under this _Section
3.4(b)_ shall be applied pro rata to reduce (x) the aggregate amount payable
in cash in respect of the cancelation of such holders Vested Options and (y)
the aggregate amount payable in Parent Common Stock in respect of the
cancelation of such holders Vested Options (based on the Parent Measurement
Price); _provided_ that such payment shall be made at such other time or
times following the Effective Time consistent with the terms of the Company
Stock Option to the extent necessary to avoid the imposition of additional
income tax under Section 409A of the Code.

 



35 (c) At the Effective Time, each outstanding Vested Appreciation Unit (other
than any such Vested Appreciation Unit that is an Underwater Appreciation
Unit) shall, without any further action on the part of any holder thereof, in
accordance with the terms thereof, to the extent not vested, vest, be
cancelled and the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive (i) no
consideration with respect to each share of Class A Common Stock underlying
such Vested Option, (ii)(A) the Per Share Merger 1 Consideration with respect
to each Net Option/Appreciation Unit Class L Share relating to such Vested
Appreciation Unit _net of_ (B) the Applicable Withholding Amount and (iii)(A)
the Per Share Merger 2 Consideration with respect to each Net
Option/Appreciation Unit Preferred Share relating to such Vested Appreciation
Unit _net of_ (B) the Applicable Withholding Amount, and all such Vested
Appreciation Units shall otherwise cease to be outstanding, shall be canceled
and cease to exist. The Applicable Withholding Amounts covered under this 
_Section 3.4(c)_ shall be applied pro rata to reduce (x) the aggregate amount
payable in cash in respect of the cancelation of such holders Vested
Appreciation Units and (y) the aggregate amount payable in Parent
Common Stock in respect of the cancelation of such holders Vested
Appreciation Units (based on the Parent Measurement Price); _provided_ that
such payment shall be made at such other time or times following the Effective
Time consistent with the terms of the Company Appreciation Unit to the extent
necessary to avoid the imposition of additional income tax under Section 409A
of the Code.

 

(d) Each Underwater Option and each Underwater Appreciation Unit shall be
canceled and cease to exist immediately prior to the Effective Time, with no
consideration therefor.

(e) Except as set forth in _Section 3.4(f)_, at the Effective Time, by virtue
of Merger 1 and Merger 2, each Unvested RSU outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be converted into that number of restricted share
units of Parent Common Stock (" _Converted RSUs_ ") equal to the quotient
(rounded to the nearest whole number of restricted share units) obtained by
dividing (A) the Company Equity Award Aggregate Value by (B) the Parent
Measurement Price. Any Converted RSUs issued pursuant to this _Section
3.4(e)_ shall be subject to the same terms and conditions as were applicable
under such Company Restricted Stock Units (including any applicable change in
control or other accelerated vesting provisions, and this transaction shall
constitute a change in control for all relevant provisions).

(f) Notwithstanding _Section 3.4(e)_, if the Closing occurs prior to January
1, 2016, then immediately prior to the Effective Time, each Unvested RSU set
forth on _Section 3.4(f)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule shall, without
any further action on the part of any holder thereof, become fully vested, and
shall be treated as a Vested RSU pursuant to this _Section 3.4_. At the
Effective Time, each outstanding Vested RSU shall, without any further action
on the part of any holder thereof, be canceled and converted into the right to
receive (i) no consideration with respect to each share of Class A Common
Stock underlying such Vested RSU, (ii)(A) the Per Share Merger 1 Consideration
for each share of Class L Common Stock underlying such Vested RSU _net of_ (B)
the Applicable Withholding Amount and (iii)(A) the Per Share Merger 2
Consideration for each share of SCCII Preferred Stock underlying such Vested
RSU _net of_ (B) the Applicable Withholding Amount. The Applicable Withholding
Amounts 

 



36  covered under this _Section 3.4(f)_ shall be applied pro rata to reduce (x)
the aggregate amount payable in cash in respect of the cancelation of such
holders Vested RSUs and (y) the aggregate amounts payable in Parent Common
Stock in respect of the cancelation of such holders Vested RSUs (based on the
Parent Measurement Price); _provided_ that such payment shall be made at such
other time or times following the Effective Time consistent with the terms of
the Company Restricted Stock Unit to the extent necessary to avoid the
imposition of additional income tax under Section 409A of the Code.

 

(g) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company and SCCII shall take all actions
necessary to effectuate the provisions set forth in this  _Section 3.4_;
_provided_ that no action taken by the Company or SCCII shall be required to
be irrevocable until immediately prior to the Effective Time. The parties
shall, to the extent necessary, cooperate in good faith prior to
the Effective Time to minimize the tax impact of the provisions set forth in
this _Section 3.4_ with respect to Company Stock Options, Company Restricted
Stock Units and Company Appreciation Units held by individuals subject to
Taxes imposed by the Laws of a country other than the United States.

Section 3.5. _Further Action_. If at any time after the Effective Time, any
further action is necessary to vest the Surviving Company with full right,
title and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and
franchises of the Company and SCCII, the directors and officers of the
Surviving Company are fully authorized in the name of the Company, SCCII and
the Merger Subs to take all such lawful and necessary action.

as a whole.

(a) Each of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries has good title free and
clear of all Liens other than Permitted Liens to the real property set forth
on _Section 4.16(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule (the " _Company Owned

Owned Properties and the operations therein conducted conform to and comply
with all applicable health, fire, environmental, safety, zoning and building
laws, ordinances and administrative regulations, licenses and permits and
other regulations (including the Americans with Disabilities Act) and all
covenants, easements, rights of way, licenses, grants, building or use
restrictions, exceptions, encroachments, reservations or other impediments,
except for possible nonconforming uses or violations that individually, or in
the aggregate, have not had and would not result in a Company Material Adverse
Effect. To the Companys Knowledge, the Company Owned Properties and all
buildings, structures, improvements and fixtures located on the Company Owned
Properties have been maintained in accordance with normal industry practice,
are in good operating condition and repair (subject to normal wear and tear)
and are suitable for the purposes for which they are currently used, except
as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have
a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 

(b) Each lease pursuant to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary leases
any material real property (such agreements, together with any amendments,
modifications and other supplements thereto, collectively, the " _Company

(except as may be limited by bankruptcy, fraudulent conveyance, insolvency,
moratorium, reorganization or similar Laws affecting the rights of creditors

failure to be valid, binding, enforceable and in full force and effect would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect. There are no defaults by the Company or any
Company Subsidiary, as applicable, under any of the Company Leases other than
those which would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to result in the termination of such Company Leases and have a
Company Material Adverse Effect. Each Leased Real Property has been maintained
in accordance with normal industry practice, is in good operating condition
and repair (subject to normal wear and tear) and is suitable for the purposes
for which it is currently used, except as would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

Section 4.17. _State Takeover Laws_. Each of the Company and SCCII has, or
will have prior to the Effective Time, taken all necessary action so that,
assuming compliance by Parent and each Merger Sub with their respective
obligations hereunder and the accuracy of the representations and warranties
made by Parent and the Merger Subs herein, no "business combination",
"moratorium", "fair price", "control share acquisition" or other state anti-
takeover statute or regulation, nor any takeover-related provision in the
Company Charter, the Company Bylaws, the SCCII Charter or the SCCII Bylaws,
would (a) prohibit or restrict the Companys or SCCIIs ability to perform
their respective obligations under this Agreement, any related

 



51  agreement, the Support and Standstill Agreements, the Registration Rights
Agreement or the Certificates of Merger or their ability to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, (b) have the effect of
invalidating or voiding this Agreement, any related agreement, the Support and
Standstill Agreements, the Registration Rights Agreement or the Certificates
of Merger, or any provision hereof or thereof, or (c) subject Parent to any
impediment or condition in connection with the exercise of any of its rights
under this Agreement, any related agreement, the Support and Standstill
Agreements, the Registration Rights Agreement or the Certificates of Merger.

Section 4.18. _Internal Controls_.

 

(a) None of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries records, systems,
controls, data or information are recorded, stored, maintained, operated or
otherwise wholly or partly dependent on or held by any means (including any
electronic, mechanical or photographic process, whether computerized or not)
which (including all means of access thereto and therefrom) are not under
the exclusive ownership and direct control of it or the Company Subsidiaries
or accountants except as would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company
and the Company Subsidiaries have designed and maintained a system of
internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and
15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) sufficient to provide reasonable assurances
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP.

(b) Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, the "disclosure controls
and procedures" (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange
Act) of the Company are reasonably designed to ensure that all information
required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or
submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and
that all such information is accumulated and communicated to the management
of the Company as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure and to make the certifications of the chief executive officer and
chief financial officer of the Company required under the Exchange Act with
respect to such reports. The Company has disclosed, based on its most recent
evaluation prior to the date hereof, to the Companys outside auditors and the
audit committees of each of the Company and SCCII (i) any significant
deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal
control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange
Act) which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the Companys ability to
record, process, summarize and report financial information, and (ii) any
fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees
who have a significant role in the Companys internal controls over financial
reporting. These disclosures were made in writing by management to the
Companys auditors and the audit committee of the board of directors of the
Company and a copy has previously been made available to Parent. As of the
date hereof, to the Knowledge of the Company, there is no reason to believe
that the Companys outside auditors and its chief executive officer and chief
financial officer will not be able to give the certifications and attestations
required pursuant to the rules and regulations adopted pursuant to Section
404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without qualification, when next due.

 

(c) Since December 31, 2014 through the date hereof, (i) to the Knowledge of
the Company, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has received or
otherwise had or obtained knowledge of any material complaint, allegation,
assertion or claim, whether written or oral, regarding the accounting or
auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or methods of the Company
or any Company Subsidiary or their respective internal accounting controls,
including any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim that the
Company or any Company Subsidiary has engaged in questionable accounting or
auditing practices, and (ii) no attorney representing the Company or any
Company Subsidiary, whether or not employed by the Company or any Company
Subsidiary, has reported evidence of a material violation of securities Laws,
breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation by the Company or any of the
officers, directors, employees or agents to the boards of directors of the
Company or any committee thereof or to any director or officer of the Company.

 



52 Section 4.19. _Insurance_. The Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as
a whole, are insured against such losses and risks and in such amounts as its
management reasonably has determined to be prudent in accordance with industry
practice and are sufficient for compliance with applicable Law. Except as
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect, to the Knowledge of the Company, neither the
Company nor any Company Subsidiary is in breach or default of any insurance
policies maintained by the Company or any Company Subsidiary or has taken any
action or failed to take any action that, with notice or the lapse of time,
would constitute such a breach or default or permit termination (prior to the
scheduled termination or expiration thereof) or modification of any such
insurance policies. Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, to the
Knowledge of the Company, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary
has received any notice of termination or cancellation (prior to the
scheduled termination or expiration thereof) or denial of coverage with
respect to any such insurance policy, and there is no material claim pending
under such insurance policies as to which coverage has been questioned,
denied or disputed by the underwriters of such insurance policies.

Property, in each case, which are material to any business unit of the Company
subject to such claim; (iii) there are no pending or, to the Knowledge of the
Company, threatened material Actions challenging the validity or

infringement or violation) would not be material to any applicable business
unit of the Company which misappropriated, infringed or otherwise violated

Property underlying such misappropriation, infringement or violation) would

Company IP.

expected to be materially adverse to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, the Company and any relevant Subsidiary owns or has a valid

adverse to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, the
Company IT Assets used to provide software or services, directly or
indirectly, to customers of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries (i) are
in satisfactory working order, reasonably sufficient to meet current capacity,

periods then ended, as applicable, except as may be indicated in the notes to

materially adverse to Parent; each Parent Financial Statement complied at the
time it was filed as to form in all material respects with the published
rules and regulations of the SEC applicable with respect thereto; and each
Parent Financial Statement has been prepared in all material respects in
accordance with GAAP consistently applied during the periods involved,

Subsidiary, or any of their respective properties, at law or in equity, or

be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. As of the date hereof,

against) Parent or any Merger Sub that in any manner challenges or seeks to
prevent, enjoin, alter or materially delay any of the Mergers.

 



65 Section 5.10. _Compliance with Law; Permits; Regulatory Matters_.

 

(a) Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect, Parent and each Parent

Statements or the notes thereto, (b) liabilities incurred in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practice since the date of the most
recent balance sheet included in the Parent Financial Statements and (c)

Section 5.12. _State Takeover Laws_. Each of Parent and each Merger Sub has,
or will have prior to the Effective Time, taken all necessary action so that,
assuming compliance by the Company with its obligations hereunder and the
accuracy of the representations and warranties made by the Company herein, no
"business combination", "moratorium", "fair price", "control share
acquisition" or other state anti-takeover statute or regulation, nor any
takeover-related provision in the Parent Charter or the Parent Bylaws, would
(a) prohibit or restrict Parents or such Merger Subs ability to perform
their respective obligations under this Agreement, any related agreement, the
Support and Standstill Agreements, the Registration Rights Agreement or the
Certificates of Merger or their ability to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby, (b) have the effect of invalidating or
voiding this Agreement, any related agreement, the Support and Standstill
Agreements, the Registration Rights Agreement or the Certificates of Merger,
or any provision hereof or thereof, or (c) subject the Company to any

Section 5.14.  _Financing_. Parent has delivered to the Company true and
correct copies of an executed commitment letter, together with the related fee
letter (subject to customary

 



66  redactions), each in effect as of the date of this Agreement from the
financial institutions party thereto (together, as they may be amended,
modified or replaced in accordance with this  _Section 5.14_, the " _Debt
Commitment Letter_ "), to provide debt financing in an aggregate amount set
forth therein and subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein
(together with any replacement debt financing in respect thereof, being
collectively referred to as the " _Debt Financing_ "). As of the date of this
Agreement, the Debt Commitment Letter has not been amended or modified in any
manner, and to the Knowledge of Parent, no amendment or modification of the
Debt Commitment Letter that will reduce the amount of Debt Financing or
materially increase the conditionality of such Debt Financing is contemplated,
_provided_ _,_ _however_ , Parent may amend, supplement, modify or replace
the Debt Commitment Letter as in effect at the date hereof (a) to add or
replace lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar
entities who had not executed the Debt Commitment Letter as of the date of
this Agreement, (b) to increase the amount of indebtedness, (c) to effectuate
"flex" terms or (d) to replace the commitment under the Debt Commitment Letter
by the amount of the commitment obtained on the Term Facility Effective Date
as contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter. As of the date of this
Agreement, the commitment contained in the Debt Commitment Letter has not been
terminated, reduced, withdrawn or rescinded in any respect and, to the
Knowledge of Parent, no such termination, reduction, withdrawal or rescission
is contemplated other than expressly contemplated thereunder. Parent has paid
in full any and all commitment fees or other fees and amounts in connection
with the Debt Commitment Letter that are payable on or prior to the date of
this Agreement and, as of the date of this Agreement, the Debt Commitment
Letter is in full force and effect and is the valid, binding and enforceable
(in accordance with its terms) obligation of Parent and, to the Knowledge of
Parent, as of the date hereof, the other parties thereto, subject to
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and similar Laws
affecting creditors rights and remedies generally. There are no
conditions precedent or other contingencies related to the funding of the
full amount (or any portion) of the Debt Financing, other than as expressly
set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter, including any condition or other
contingency relating to the availability of the Debt Financing pursuant to
any "flex" provision, other than as expressly set forth in the Debt Commitment
Letter. Assuming the Debt Financing is funded in accordance with the Debt
Commitment Letter, the net proceeds contemplated by the Debt Commitment
Letter, together with available cash on hand at Parent and the Company, will,
in the aggregate, be sufficient for Parent and the Company to pay all of the
amounts required to be provided by Parent for the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the amounts payable in
connection with the consummation of any of the Mergers, all related fees and
expenses required to be paid as of the date of the consummation of
the Mergers and the funds to be provided by (or on behalf of) Parent to the
Company to enable the Company to fund the repayment or refinancing of the
Company Credit Agreements. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no side
letters, understandings or other agreements, contracts or arrangements of any
kind relating to the Debt Commitment Letter that could affect the availability
of the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter (other than
original issue discount provisions as part of the "flex" terms). As of the
date of this Agreement and assuming satisfaction or waiver (to the extent
permitted by law) of the conditions to Parents and Merger Subs obligation to
consummate the Mergers, (a) no event has occurred which (with or without
notice, lapse of time or both) could constitute a default or breach or failure
to satisfy a condition by Parent under the terms and conditions of the Debt
Commitment Letter and (b) Parent does not have any reason to believe that any
of the conditions to the Debt Financing will not be satisfied by Parent on a
timely basis or that the Debt Financing will not be available to Parent on the
date of the Closing.

acknowledges that the Company makes no representations or warranties to
Parent, any Merger Sub or any Parent Subsidiary as to any matter whatsoever
except as expressly made pursuant to this Agreement. The representations and
warranties made pursuant to this Agreement are made solely by the Company,

each of Parent and each Merger Sub further acknowledges and agrees that none
of the Company, SCCII or any of their stockholders, directors, officers,
employees, Affiliates, advisors, agents or other Representatives has made
any representation or warranty except pursuant to this Agreement concerning

information regarding the Company, its Subsidiaries or their respective
businesses and operations.

representations and warranties made pursuant to  _Article IV_ of this
Agreement, in the certificate to be delivered pursuant to _Section 7.2(e)_
and the Support and Standstill Agreements, each of Parent and each Merger Sub
acknowledges that neither the Company nor any other Person on behalf of the
Company makes any other express or implied representation or warranty to
Parent, any Merger Sub or any Parent Subsidiary with respect to the Company or
with respect to any other information provided to Parent or any Merger Sub,

Competing Transaction, except, in the cases of clauses (a)(iv) (and clause
(a)(iii) to the extent an action described in clause (a)(iv) would also
constitute an action described in clause (a)(iii)) and (b), to the extent
failure to do so would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the board
of directors of the Company under applicable Law. Any information described
in the foregoing clause shall only be provided pursuant to a confidentiality
agreement with confidentiality provisions that are no less favorable to the
Company than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement. The Company
shall, and shall instruct all Representatives acting on its and its
Affiliates behalf to immediately cease any existing activities, discussions
and negotiations with any Persons with respect to any of the foregoing. As
soon as reasonably practicable after the date hereof, the Company shall
instruct each Person (other than Parent and the Merger Subs and their
representatives) in possession of confidential information about the Company
that was furnished pursuant to a confidentiality agreement within the prior
twelve (12) months in connection with any actual or potential proposal by such
Person to acquire the Company (or any portion thereof) to promptly return or
destroy all such information, subject to the terms of such confidentiality
agreement.

Section 6.4. _Employee Benefits_.

 

(a) For the benefit of employees of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
(the " _Employees_ "), as of the Effective Time, and for a period of at least
twelve (12) months thereafter, Parent agrees to (i) provide or cause the
Parent Subsidiaries (including the

 



74  Surviving Company) to provide each Employee with base salary or wage rates
that, in the aggregate, are not less than those in effect for such Employee
immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) in Parents sole discretion
(which may be exercised on a plan by plan basis) either, (A) maintain or cause
the Parent Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Company) to maintain the
Company Benefit Plans (excluding the Company Equity Plan, any defined benefit
pension plan and any retiree medical plan, but including the Companys
severance practices as described on Section 6.4(a) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule) at the benefit levels that are, in the aggregate, no less favorable
than are in effect as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, or (B)
provide or cause the Parent Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Company) to
provide employee benefits (excluding the Company Equity Plan, any defined
benefit pension plan and any retiree medical plan, but including severance
entitlements) that, in the aggregate, are no less favorable to each Employee
than those in effect for similarly-situated employees of Parent or any of the
Parent Subsidiaries.

(b) With respect to each Parent Benefit Plan (including, for the purposes of
this _Section 6.4_, any plan of the Surviving Company which would be a
Parent Benefit Plan) following the Effective Time and in which any of the
Employees participate, and except to the extent necessary to avoid duplication
of benefits, for purposes of determining eligibility to participate, vesting,
accrual of, and entitlement to, benefits (but not for accrual of defined
benefit pension benefits) and all other purposes, service with the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries (or predecessor employers to the extent the Company
provides past service credit) shall be treated as service with Parent and the
Parent Subsidiaries. Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to cause each
applicable Parent Benefit Plan to waive eligibility waiting periods, evidence
of insurability requirements and pre-existing condition limitations to the
extent waived or not included under the corresponding Company Benefit Plan.
The Employees shall be given credit under the applicable Parent Benefit Plan
for amounts paid prior to the Effective Time during the calendar year in
which the Effective Time occurs under a corresponding Company Benefit Plan for
purposes of applying deductibles, co-payments and out-of-pocket maximums as
though such amounts had been paid in accordance with the terms and conditions
of the Parent Benefit Plan.

(c) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained in
this _Section 6.4_ with respect to employees of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries are included for the sole benefit of the respective parties
hereto and shall not create any right (i) in any other person,
including employees, former employees, any participant or any beneficiary
thereof in any Company Benefit Plan, Company Employment Agreement, Parent
Benefit Plan or Parent Employment Agreement or (ii) to continued employment
with the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, Parent or the Surviving
Company. Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 6.4_ to the contrary,
nothing in this Agreement, whether express or implied, shall be treated as an
amendment or other modification of any Company Benefit Plan, Company
Employment Agreement, Parent Benefit Plan, Parent Employment Agreement or any
other employee benefit plans of the Company or Parent.

 

(d) _Bonus Plans_

(i) All fiscal year 2015 bonus amounts under annual bonus cash incentive
plans of the Company and its Subsidiaries, will be calculated consistent with
past

 



75  practice and paid in the ordinary course of business to the eligible
Employees with such bonus amounts calculated based on actual results and
performance achieved in respect of fiscal year 2015 prior to the Closing Date
and for the period following the Closing Date until the end of fiscal year
2015, in order to ensure the Companys actual results and performance can be
accurately determined, Parent will maintain separate records for the Company
for such purpose; _provided_ that, any actions or decisions made by Parent
following the Closing Date that materially adversely affect the actual results
and performance of the Company for fiscal year 2015 shall be disregarded
for purposes of determining the bonus amounts payable in respect of fiscal
year 2015. Such fiscal year 2015 bonus amounts shall be paid in the ordinary
course of business but no later than March 15, 2016 in the case of Employees
who are subject to U.S. taxation (and, so long as an Employee was employed as
of the Closing Date and was not thereafter terminated for "cause" and did not
resign, without regard to whether such Employee is employed on the payment
date).

 

(ii) To the extent that the Closing Date occurs in fiscal year 2016, Employees
shall be eligible to participate (A) prior to the Closing Date, in the
Companys annual bonus cash incentive plans with such bonus amounts calculated
based on target performance and pro rated for the number of days in fiscal
year 2016 that have occurred prior to the Closing Date, with the fiscal
year targets and budget under such plans to be set in consultation with
Parent and (B) following the Closing Date, in the Parents applicable annual
bonus or cash incentive plans for similarly-situated employees of Parent or
any of the Parent Subsidiaries, with such amounts calculated based on
performance and pro rated for the number of days in fiscal year 2016 that have
occurred following the Closing Date; _provided_ that, in the case of (B)
Parent will establish individual target incentive amounts for each Employee
that are, on a pro-rata basis, at least 80% of each such Employees target
annual incentive amount for fiscal year 2015; _provided further_ , that, in
each case, that an Employee must be employed on the applicable payment date
in 2017 in order to receive a bonus payment under any such Company or Parent
plans in respect of fiscal year 2016.

 

Section 6.5. _Publicity_. The initial press release by each of Parent and the
Company with respect to the execution of this Agreement shall be acceptable
to the Company and Parent, respectively. Thereafter, neither the Company nor
Parent (nor any of their respective Affiliates) shall issue any other press
release or make any other public announcement with respect to this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby without the prior agreement of the
other party (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), except as may be required by Law or by any listing agreement with a
national securities exchange, in which case the party proposing to issue such
press release or make such public announcement shall use its reasonable best
efforts to consult in good faith with the other party before making any such
public announcements.

 

Section 6.6. _Directors  and Officers Insurance and Indemnification_.

 

(a) For six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause
the Surviving Company to indemnify and hold harmless the individuals who at
any time prior to the Effective Time were directors or officers of the Company
or any of the Company Subsidiaries (the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") against any
costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines,
losses, claims, damages or liabilities in connection with actions or omissions

 



76  occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement) to the same extent such Persons are currently
entitled to indemnification in such capacities under the organizational
documents of the Company or such Company Subsidiary, as applicable, and
applicable Law, and Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Company to,
promptly advance expenses as incurred to such Persons to the same extent such
Persons are currently entitled to such advancement in such capacities
thereunder. Each of Parent and each Merger Sub agrees that all rights to
exculpation or indemnification for acts or omissions occurring prior to the
Effective Time existing as of the Effective Time in favor of directors and
officers of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries in such capacities and
the heirs, executors, trustees, fiduciaries and administrators of such officer
or director (each, a " _D andO Indemnitee_"), as provided in the Companys or
each of the Company Subsidiaries respective certificate of incorporation and
bylaws (or comparable organizational or governing documents) or in any
indemnification agreement, shall survive the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with
their terms. After the Effective Time, the Surviving Company shall (and Parent
shall cause the Surviving Company to) fulfill and honor such obligations to
the maximum extent permitted by applicable Law. In addition, for a period of
six (6) years following the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries to, cause the limited liability
company agreement (and other similar organizational documents) of the
Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries to contain provisions with respect to
indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation that are at least as
favorable as the indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation
provisions contained in the certificate of incorporation or bylaws (or other
similar organizational documents) of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
immediately prior to the Effective Time, and during such six-year period,
such provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any
respect, except as required by applicable Law.

 

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall or, if the Company is
unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving Company as of the Effective Time
to obtain and fully pay the premium for the non-cancellable extension of the
directors and officers liability coverage of the Companys existing
directors and officers insurance policies and the Companys existing
fiduciary liability insurance policies (collectively, the " _D andO
Insurance_"), in each case for a claims reporting or discovery period of at
least six (6) years from and after the Effective Time with respect to any
claim related to any period of time at or prior to the Effective Time from an
insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Companys
current DandO Insurance carrier with respect to directors and officers
liability insurance in an amount and scope at least as favorable as the
Companys existing policies. If the Company or the Surviving Company for any
reason fails to obtain such "tail" insurance policies as of the Effective
Time, (i) the Surviving Company shall continue to maintain in effect, for a
period of at least six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, the DandO
Insurance in place as of the date of this Agreement with the Companys
current insurance carrier or with an insurance carrier with the same or better
credit rating as the Companys current DandO Insurance carrier with respect to
directors and officers liability insurance in an amount and scope at least
as favorable as the Companys existing policies, or (ii) Parent will provide,
or cause the Surviving Company to provide, for a period of not less than six
(6) years after the Effective Time, the DandO Indemnitees who are insured under
the Companys DandO Insurance with comparable DandO Insurance that provides
coverage for events occurring at or prior to the Effective Time from an
insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Companys
current DandO Insurance carrier, that is no

 



77  less favorable than the existing policy of the Company or, if substantially
equivalent insurance coverage is unavailable, the best available coverage;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Parent and the Surviving Company shall not be
required to pay an annual premium for the DandO Insurance in excess of 300% of
the annual premium currently paid by the Company for such insurance; and
_provided further_ that if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage
exceed such amount, Parent or the Surviving Company shall be obligated to
obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available, with respect to matters
occurring prior to the Effective Time, for a cost not exceeding such amount.

(c) This _Section 6.6_ is intended to benefit the Indemnified Parties and the
DandO Indemnitees, and shall be binding on all successors and assigns of
Parent, each Merger Sub, the Company and the Surviving Company. Parent hereby
guarantees the payment and performance by the Surviving Company of the
indemnification and other obligations pursuant to this  _Section 6.6_ and
limited liability company agreement of the Surviving Company.

(d) In the event that Parent, the Surviving Company or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates or amalgamates with or
merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving
Person of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys a
majority of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such
case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors, assigns and
transferees of Parent or the Surviving Company or their respective successors
or assigns, as the case may be, assume the obligations set forth in this
_Section 6.6_.

Section 6.7. _Preparation of Registration Statements_.

(a) Following the date of this Agreement, Parent shall promptly prepare, with
the cooperation and assistance of (and after review by) the Company and its
counsel and accountant and cause to be filed with the SEC, a registration
statement on Form S-4 in connection with the issuance of the shares of Parent
Common Stock in the Mergers (the " _Form S-4_" or " _Registration Statement_
"). Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to file the Form S-4 with the
SEC as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement and
to have the Form S-4 declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly
as reasonably practicable after such filing. Each of the Company and Parent
shall furnish all information concerning such Person and its Affiliates to the
other, and provide such other assistance as may be reasonably requested in
connection with the preparation, filing and distribution of the Form S-4, and
the Registration Statement shall include all information reasonably requested
by such other party to be included therein. Parent shall promptly notify the
Company upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC or any request from the
SEC for amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement and shall
provide the Company with copies of any correspondence between it and its
Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, on the other hand. Parent shall
use its reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as reasonably
practicable to any comments from the SEC with respect to the Registration
Statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to filing or mailing the
Registration Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto), or responding
to any comments of the SEC with respect thereto, Parent (i) shall provide the
Company an opportunity to review and comment on such document or response,
(ii) shall consider in good faith all comments reasonably proposed by the
Company and (iii) shall not file or mail such document or respond to the SEC
prior to receiving the approval of the Company,

 



78  which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.
Parent shall advise the Company, promptly after receipt of notice thereof, of
the time of effectiveness of the Form S-4, the issuance of any stop order
relating thereto or the suspension of the qualification of the shares of
Parent Common Stock included in the Per Share Merger Consideration for
offering or sale in any jurisdiction, and Parent shall use its
reasonable best efforts to have any such stop order or suspension lifted,
reversed or otherwise terminated. Each of the Company and Parent shall also
take any other action required to be taken under the Securities Act, the
Exchange Act, any applicable foreign or state securities or "blue sky" laws
and the rules and regulations thereunder in connection with any of the Mergers
and the issuance of the shares of Parent Common Stock included in the Per
Share Merger Consideration.

 

(b) Each of Parent and each Merger Sub agrees that none of the information
supplied or to be supplied by or on behalf of Parent or any Merger Sub for
inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Registration Statement will, at
the time such Registration Statement becomes effective under the Securities
Act, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading. If prior to the Effective Time, any event occurs with respect
to Parent or any Parent Subsidiary, or any change occurs with respect to
other information supplied by Parent for inclusion in a Registration
Statement, which is required to be described in an amendment of, or a
supplement to, the Registration Statement, Parent shall promptly notify the
Company of such event, and Parent and the Company shall cooperate in the
prompt filing with the SEC of any necessary amendment or supplement to the
Registration Statement and, as required by Law, in disseminating the
information contained in such amendment or supplement to the Companys
stockholders. Nothing in this _Section 6.7(b)_ shall limit the obligations of
any party under _Section 6.7(a)_.

 

(c) The Company agrees that none of the information supplied or to be supplied
by or on behalf of the Company for inclusion or incorporation by reference in
the Registration Statement will, at the time such Registration Statement
becomes effective under the Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. If prior to the
Effective Time, any event occurs with respect to the Company or any Company
Subsidiary, or any change occurs with respect to other information supplied
by the Company for inclusion in a Registration Statement, which is required to
be described in an amendment of, or a supplement to, such Registration
Statement, the Company shall promptly notify Parent of such event, and Parent
and the Company shall cooperate in the prompt filing with the SEC of any
necessary amendment or supplement to such Registration Statement and, as
required by Law, in disseminating the information contained in such amendment
or supplement to the Companys stockholders. Nothing in this _Section
6.7(c)_ shall limit the obligations of any party under _Section 6.7(a)_.

 

(d) The Company and SCCII shall solicit the Required Stockholder Approval via
written consent as soon as prudently practicable after the Form S-4 becomes
effective. In connection therewith, as promptly as practicable after the Form
S-4 becomes effective, the board of directors of the Company shall set a
record date for determining the stockholders entitled to provide such
written consent. The prospectus included in the Form S-4 shall also
constitute a

 



79  consent solicitation statement for the foregoing written consent (the "
_Consent Solicitation Statement/Prospectus_ "). As promptly as practicable
after the Form S-4 becomes effective, the Company and SCCII shall cause the
Consent Solicitation Statement/Prospectus to be mailed to their respective
holders, along with the Letter of Transmittal. The Company shall, through its
board of directors, recommend to its stockholders that they give the Required
Stockholder Approval and shall include such recommendation in such consent
solicitation, subject to the board of directors right to effect a change in
recommendation if required pursuant to the board of directors fiduciary
duties under applicable Law. The Company will provide Parent with copies of
all stockholder consents it receives. If the Required Stockholder Approval is
obtained, then promptly following the receipt of the required
written consents, the Company will prepare (subject to the reasonable
approval of Parent) and deliver to its stockholders who have not consented the
notice required by Section 228(e) of the DGCL.

 

(e) Parent shall promptly prepare and submit to the NYSE a listing application
covering the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable in the Mergers, and shall
use reasonable best efforts to obtain, prior to the Effective Time, approval
for the listing of such Parent Common Stock, subject to official notice of
issuance, and the Company shall cooperate with Parent with respect to
such listing.

(f) Promptly following the date of this Agreement, and in any event within
five (5) Business Days of the date hereof, the Company shall file a
registration withdrawal request with the SEC in respect of the Companys
Registration Statement on Form S-1 and exhibits in connection with a possible
initial public offering. From the date hereof until the earlier of (i) the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1_, or (ii) the Final
Effective Time, other than in connection with compliance with the immediately
preceding sentence, the Company shall and shall cause each Company Subsidiary
and all of their respective Affiliates and Representatives to cease incurring
any costs, fees or expenses of any third parties in connection with an initial
public offering of the Company or any Company Subsidiary.

 

Section 6.8. _Regulatory Matters_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the parties
hereto agree to make an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form

foreign Antitrust Laws identified in _Section 6.8(a)(i)_ of the Parent
Disclosure Schedule (collectively, " _Foreign Antitrust Approvals_ ") and to
make all filings identified in _Section 6.8(a)(ii)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule (collectively, " _Regulatory Approvals_ ") with respect to the

prior to the expiration of any applicable legal deadline ( _provided_ that the
submission or filing (i) of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR

filings shall request early termination of the applicable waiting period under
the HSR Act, (ii) for applicable Foreign Antitrust Approvals shall be

thereof, for jurisdictions where submission of a draft prior to formal
notification is appropriate, within twenty (20) days of the date of this
Agreement and (iii) for applicable Regulatory Approvals shall be submitted by
the parties with the relevant notification forms, or a draft thereof, for
jurisdictions where submission of a draft prior to formal notification is
appropriate, within ten (10) Business Days of the date of this Agreement) and
to supply as 

 



80  promptly as reasonably practicable any additional information and
documentary material that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act and any
other filings required in connection with the Foreign Antitrust Approvals or
any other Antitrust Law or any Regulatory Approvals. The parties shall also
consult and cooperate with one another, and consider in good faith the views
of one another, in connection with, and provide to the other parties
in advance, any analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs,
arguments, opinions and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any
party hereto in connection with proceedings under or relating to any such
Antitrust Laws or any such Regulatory Approvals. Without limiting the
foregoing, the parties hereto agree to (i) give each other reasonable advance
notice of all meetings, telephone calls or discussions with any Governmental
Entity in connection with or relating to any Antitrust Laws or any Regulatory
Approvals, (ii) give each other an opportunity to participate in each of such
meetings, telephone calls or discussions, (iii) to the extent practicable,
give each other reasonable advance notice of all substantive oral
communications with any Governmental Entity in connection with or relating to

Entity initiates a substantive oral communication in connection with
or relating to any Antitrust Laws or any Regulatory Approvals, promptly
notify the other party of the substance of such communication, (v) provide
each other with a reasonable advance opportunity to review and comment upon
all written communications (including any analyses, presentations, memoranda,
briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals) with a Governmental Entity in
connection with or relating to any Antitrust Laws or any Regulatory Approvals
and (vi) provide each other with copies of all written communications to or
from any Governmental Entity in connection with or relating to any Antitrust
Laws or any Regulatory Approvals. Any such disclosures or provision of copies
by one party to the other may be made on an outside counsel basis if
appropriate. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, each
of Parent and each Merger Sub agrees, and shall cause each of the Parent
Subsidiaries, to use reasonable best efforts to obtain any
consents, clearances or approvals required under or in connection with the
HSR Act, the Sherman Act, as amended, the Clayton Act, as amended, the Federal
Trade Commission Act, as amended, and any other supranational, foreign,
national, federal or state law, regulation or decree designed to prohibit,
restrict or regulate actions related to competition, antitrust, merger control
or foreign investment, including for the purpose or effect of monopolization
or restraint of trade or the significant impediment of effective competition
(collectively " _Antitrust Laws_ ") or the applicable Laws associated with any
Regulatory Approvals, and to enable all waiting periods under applicable
Antitrust Laws or any Regulatory Approvals to expire, and to avoid or
eliminate each and every impediment under applicable Antitrust Laws or the
applicable Laws associated with any Regulatory Approvals that may be asserted
by any Governmental Entity, in each case, to cause the Mergers and the other
transactions contemplated hereby to occur prior to the Termination Date (any
such action, a " _Clearance Action_ "); _provided_ that, using reasonable best
efforts shall include but not be limited to (i) promptly complying with or
modifying any requests for additional information (including any second
request) by any Governmental Entity, (ii) offering, negotiating, committing to
and effecting, by consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise, the sale,

interests or interests therein, (iii) taking or committing to take actions
that after the Closing Date would limit Parents freedom of action with
respect to, or its ability to retain, one or more of the assets, rights,
products, services or businesses of Parent, each

 



81  Merger Sub, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries or any interest or
interests therein and (iv) contesting, defending and appealing any threatened
or pending preliminary or permanent injunction or other order, decree or
ruling that would adversely affect the ability of any party hereto to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and taking any and all other
actions to prevent the entry, enactment or promulgation thereof;  _provided_
that nothing contained in this _Section 6.8(a)_ shall require Parent or any
Merger Sub to, or permit the Company or any Company Subsidiary to (without
Parent consent), (A) take any Clearance Action (1) which would, individually
or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect
on the business, results of operation or financial condition of the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (2) which
would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
material adverse effect on the business, results of operation or financial
condition of Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, assuming
for this purpose that Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries were, in the
aggregate, the same size and had the same aggregate results of operations and
financial condition as the Company and the Company Subsidiaries do as of the
applicable date of determination, or (B) make any divestitures or take other
actions or remedies, in each case, not conditioned on the consummation of the
Closing.

(b) Subject to the terms hereof, and except with regard to the Antitrust Laws
and the applicable Laws associated with any Regulatory Approvals which shall
be governed by _Section 6.8(a)_, the Company, each of Parent and any Merger
Sub shall, and Parent and the Company shall cause their respective
Subsidiaries to, use their reasonable best efforts to:

(i) take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do, or cause to be done, and
to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary,
proper or advisable to consummate and make effective the transactions
contemplated hereby as promptly as reasonably practicable; 

(ii) obtain from any Governmental Entity or any other third party any
consents, licenses, permits, waivers, approvals, authorizations, or orders
and send any notices, in each case, which are required to be obtained, made or
sent by the Company or Parent or any of their Subsidiaries in connection with
the authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ that in
connection therewith none of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries will
without the prior written consent of Parent, make or agree to make any payment
or accept any material conditions or obligations, including amendments to
existing conditions and obligations;

(iii) as promptly as practicable, make all necessary filings and
notifications, and thereafter make any other required submissions and
applications with respect to this Agreement and the Mergers required under any
applicable Law; and

 

(iv) execute or deliver any additional instruments necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated by, and to fully carry out the purposes of, this
Agreement.

The Company and Parent shall cooperate with each other in connection with the
making of all such filings, submissions, applications and requests. Each of
the Company and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to furnish to
each other (on an outside counsel basis if appropriate)

 



82  all information required for any filing, submission, application or request
to be made pursuant to applicable Law in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, Parent and the
Company agree that nothing contained in this _Section 6.8(b)_ shall modify,
limit or otherwise affect their respective rights and responsibilities under
_Section 6.8(a)_.

 

Section 6.9. _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the board of
directors of the Company, or an appropriate committee of "non-employee
directors" (as defined in Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act), shall adopt a
resolution consistent with the interpretive guidance of the SEC in the
Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP SEC No-Action Letter (January 12,
1999) providing that the disposition of Consolidated Capital Stock, Company
Stock Options, Company Appreciation Units, Performance-Based Appreciation
Units, Performance-Based Options, Performance-Based RSUs and Company
Restricted Stock Units resulting from the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement by any officer or director of the Company who is subject to the
reporting requirements of Section 16 of the Exchange Act with respect to
securities of the Company shall be an exempt transaction for purposes of
Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act. Prior to the Effective Time, the board of
directors of Parent, or an appropriate committee of "non-employee directors"
(as defined in Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act), shall adopt a resolution
consistent with the interpretative guidance of the SEC in the Skadden, Arps,
Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP SEC No-Action Letter (January 12, 1999) providing
that the acquisition of Parent Common Stock and Converted RSUs pursuant to
this Agreement by any officer or director of the Company who may become
subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16 of the Exchange Act with
respect to securities of Parent shall be an exempt transaction for purposes
of Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act.

Section 6.10. _Filing of Form S-8; Listing of Additional Shares_.
Parent agrees to file no later than the Effective Time a registration
statement on Form S-8 (or any successor or other appropriate form) with
respect to the Parent Common Stock issuable with respect to Converted RSUs and
shall use its reasonable best efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such
registration statement or registration statements (and maintain the current
status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) for so long as the
Converted RSUs assumed in accordance with this Agreement remain outstanding.
Parent shall at times ensure that there will remain a sufficient amount of
unissued Parent Common Stock to meet its share issuance obligations under the
Converted RSUs. Parent shall also use its reasonable best efforts to take any
action required to be taken by it under any applicable state securities Laws
in connection with the conversion of the Company Restricted Stock Units into
Converted RSUs and Parents certificate of incorporation in order to
duly authorize the grant of such rights to subscribe for shares in its share
capital free of preemptive rights at or prior to the Effective Time, and the
Company shall furnish to Parent any information concerning the Company and
holders of the Company Restricted Stock Units as may be reasonably requested
by Parent in connection with any such action. Parent shall take all action

of its efforts to arrange any financing required in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, including any Debt
Financing, and to satisfy the conditions thereof, including advising and
updating the Company, in a reasonable level of detail, with respect to any
material developments concerning the status of such financing, including any
Debt Financing, and the proposed funding date thereunder.

_Parachute Payments_ "), waivers that provide that no Parachute Payments with
respect to such "disqualified individual" shall, in the absence of 280G

deductible by reason of the application of Section 280G of the Code or would
result in the imposition of the excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code on
such "disqualified individual" (the " _280G Waivers_ "). Following the

with copies of documents effecting such terminations prior to the Closing
Date. Parent and its Affiliates and the Company will use reasonable best
efforts, upon the request of any Company employee, to facilitate a direct
transfer of an eligible rollover distribution (as defined in section
401(a)(31) of the Code), including any portion of such distribution
attributable to outstanding promissory notes, from any Company Qualified Plan
to a Parent Benefit Plan that is a "qualified plan" within the meaning of
Section 401(a) of the Code.

Section 6.19. _No Parent Shareholder Approval_. Parent shall not take any
action which would cause the vote of the holders of any class or series of
capital stock or other equity interests of Parent to be necessary to adopt
this Agreement or to consummate any of the transaction contemplated by this
Agreement, including the issuance of the shares of Parent Common Stock to be
issued in the Mergers.

Section 9.11. _Specific Performance_. The parties hereby acknowledge and agree
that the failure of any party to perform its agreements and covenants
hereunder, including its failure to take all actions as are necessary on its

adequate remedy. Accordingly, each party shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent or remedy breaches or threatened breaches of this
Agreement and to specifically enforce the terms and provisions
hereof (including the parties obligations to consummate the Mergers, and
Parents obligation to pay, and the right to receive the applicable Per Share

relate to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance of this

employees, general or limited partners, members, managers, agents or
Affiliates of any party hereto, or any former, current or future direct or
indirect stockholder, equity holder, controlling person, director,

partners, members, managers, agents or Affiliates of such stockholders (each
of the foregoing, a " _Released Party_ "), from any and all claims, rights,
obligations, debts, liabilities, actions or causes of action of every kind and
nature, whether foreseen or unforeseen, contingent or actual, and whether now
known or hereafter discovered, which any of the Releasing Parties had, now has
or may in the future have, at law or in equity, against any Released Party in
any way arising out of, in connection with, pertaining to or by reason of (a)
their respective status as such (or as a director of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary or a fiduciary of any employee benefit plan of the Company
or of any of its present or former Subsidiaries) or (b) any acts or omissions,
or alleged acts or omissions, by any of them in their respective capacities as
such, which acts or omissions existed or occurred at or prior to the Closing

Parties expressly do not release their rights and interests (i) under (A)

of Parent and each Merger Sub covenants and agrees that it will honor such
release and will not, and will cause the Surviving Company and its
Subsidiaries not to, take any action inconsistent therewith (including

or the Company or any Company Subsidiary made in connection with the
negotiation, preparation, execution, delivery or performance of a Support and
Standstill Agreement or the Registration Rights Agreement, it being
the intention of the Parties that all rights to such attorney-client
privilege and to control such attorney-client privilege shall be retained by
such stockholders (and, if requested by Parent, may be waived on behalf of all
such stockholders by the stockholders set forth on Section 9.20 of the
Company Disclosure Schedule); _provided_ that communications between STandB and
the Company or any Company Subsidiary that do not pertain to the negotiation,
