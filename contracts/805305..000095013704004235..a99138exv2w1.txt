         would otherwise be paid to the Employee Trust under Section 1.2(b)(ii)
         (the "Trust Stock Amount"). The Additional Trust Cash Amount shall be
         equal to the product of the Trust Stock Amount, times $17.46.

                           (ii)     The Trust Stock Amount shall be paid to
         Kenneth Block and Damon Way in proportion to their Participating
         Percentages, and the Additional Trust Cash Amount shall be deducted
         from the cash payments to be paid to Messrs. Block and Way under
         Section 1.2(b)(i) in proportion to their Participating Percentages.

         1.3      Adjustments to Cash Payment.

                  (a)      Adjustment of Cash Payment. The Cash Payment shall
also be (i) reduced by the amount by which, if any, the Historical Average
Working Capital exceeds the Closing Working Capital, or (ii) increased by the
amount by which, if any, the Closing Working Capital exceeds the Historical
Average Working Capital.

                  (b)      Adjustment Procedure. The determination of the
Working Capital of the Company on the Closing Date shall be made as follows:

                           (i)      Buyer shall prepare a balance sheet of the
         Company as of the Closing Date in accordance with Company GAAP (the
         "Closing Balance Sheet"). Buyer shall then determine the Closing
         Working Capital based upon the Closing Balance Sheet. Buyer shall
         deliver the Closing Balance Sheet and its determination of the Closing
         Working Capital to the Sellers' Representatives within ninety (90) days
         following the Closing Date.

                           (ii)     If within thirty (30) days following
         delivery of the Closing Balance Sheet and the calculations of the
         Closing Working Capital the Sellers' Representatives have not given
         Buyer written notice of their objection as to the calculations of the
         Closing Working Capital (the "Dispute Notice"), then the Closing
         Working Capital as calculated by Buyer shall be binding and conclusive
         on the parties and be used in computing the adjustments to the Cash
         Payment. Sellers' Representatives may waive this thirty (30) day period
         by providing written notice to Buyer of their acceptance of the Buyer's
         calculations of the Closing Working Capital.

                                       2
<PAGE>

                           (iii)    If the Sellers' Representatives deliver to
         Buyer the Dispute Notice (which notice shall state the basis of
         Sellers' Representatives' objection) within such thirty (30) day
         period, Buyer and Sellers' Representatives shall use commercially
         reasonable efforts for a period of ten (10) days after Buyer's receipt
         of the Dispute Notice (or such longer period as Buyer and Sellers'
         Representatives shall mutually agree upon) to resolve any disputes
         raised by Sellers' Representatives with respect to the calculation of
         the Closing Working Capital, as set forth on the Closing Balance Sheet,
         and Sellers' Representatives and Buyer shall provide information to the
         other party (as reasonably requested) related to the items of
         disagreement set forth in the Dispute Notice. Sellers' Representatives
         and their agents shall have all reasonable rights of access to the
         corporate records of the Company for such purposes. If, at the end of
         such ten (10) day period, the Sellers' Representatives and Buyer fail
         to resolve the outstanding issues with respect to the Closing Balance
         Sheet and the calculations of the Closing Working Capital, the Sellers'
         Representatives and Buyer jointly shall select an independent auditor
         of recognized national standing (who is not rendering, and during the
         preceding two (2) year period has not rendered, services to the Company
         or Buyer or any of their respective affiliates) to resolve any
         remaining disagreements. If the Sellers' Representatives and Buyer are
         unable to jointly select such independent auditor within fifteen (15)
         days after the date of the Dispute Notice, each party shall select an
         independent auditor of recognized national standing and each such
         selected independent auditor shall select a third independent auditor
         of recognized national standing (who is not rendering, and during the
         preceding two (2) year period has not rendered, services to the Company
         or Buyer or any of their respective affiliates) (such selected
         independent auditor whether pursuant to this or the preceding sentence,
         the "Independent Accountant"). If issues are submitted to the
         Independent Accountant for resolution, (i) the Sellers' Representatives
         and Buyer shall furnish or cause to be furnished to the Independent
         Accountant such work papers and other documents and information
         relating to the disputed issues as the Independent Accountant may
         reasonably request and are available to that party or its agents and
         shall be afforded the opportunity to present to the Independent
         Accountant any material relating to the disputed issues and to discuss
         the issues with the Independent Accountant; (ii) the determination by
         the Independent Accountant, as set forth in a notice to be delivered to
         both the Sellers' Representatives and Buyer within twenty (20) days of
         the submission to the Independent Accountant of the issues remaining in
         dispute, shall be final, binding and conclusive on the parties and
         shall be used in the calculations of the Closing Working Capital; and
         (iii) the Sellers and Buyer will each bear fifty percent (50%) of the
         fees and costs of the Independent Accountant for such determination.

                  (c)      Holdback. $6,000,000 of the Cash Payment (the
"Holdback Amount") shall be withheld from the Sellers in proportion to their
respective Participating Percentages. To the extent the Cash Payment is reduced
pursuant to this Section 1.3 but not by the entire Holdback Amount, the Holdback
Amount less the amount of such reduction shall be paid to the Sellers in
proportion to their respective Participating Percentages within fifteen (15)
days of the final determination of the Closing Working Capital. If the Cash
Payment is reduced by more than the Holdback Amount, the amount of any reduction
of the Cash Payment in excess of the Holdback Amount shall be set-off against
the Earnout Amounts owed to the Sellers in proportion to their Participating
Percentages, and Buyer shall retain the entire Holdback Amount. If on the other
hand the Cash Payment was increased as a result of such final determination,
then the

                                       3
<PAGE>

Buyer shall pay the Sellers in proportion to their Participating Percentages the
entire Holdback Amount plus the amount of such increase within fifteen (15) days
of such determination.

         1.4      Earnout. The Earnout Amounts payable in the aggregate for all
Earnout Periods to the Sellers shall be determined as follows:

                  (a)      For each Earnout Period and for each Target Level
listed on Exhibit 1.4(a) attached hereto, the Earnout Amounts listed on Exhibit
1.4(a) shall be determined separately. If a Target Level is achieved for an
Earnout Period, then the corresponding Earnout Amount for such Target Level
shall be due and payable to the Sellers for such Earnout Period pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement.

                  (b)      Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if a
Target Level is not achieved for the 2005 Earnout Period, the Earnout Amount for
the 2005 Earnout Period can subsequently be earned by achieving the combined
Target Levels for the 2005 Earnout Period and the 2006 Earnout Period. By
achieving such combined Target Levels, the Sellers would be entitled to the
Earnout Amounts for the 2005 and 2006 Earnout Periods. In addition, if the
Target Level is not achieved for the 2006 Earnout Period, the Earnout Amount for
the 2006 Earnout Period can subsequently be earned by achieving the combined
Target Levels for the 2006 Earnout Period and the 2007 Earnout Period. By
achieving such combined Target Levels, the Sellers would be entitled to the
Earnout Amounts for the 2006 and 2007 Earnout Periods. See Exhibit 1.4(b) for
examples of such calculations.

                  (c)      Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if a
Target Level is exceeded for the 2004 Earnout Period, 2005 Earnout Period or
2006 Earnout Period, the amount by which the applicable Target Level was
exceeded in such Earnout Period can be applied to and aggregated with the Target
Level for the Earnout Period immediately following for purposes of determining
if such Target Level is achieved for such immediately following Earnout Period.
See Exhibit 1.4(c) for examples of such calculations.

                  (d)      Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if
the Target Level is not achieved for the 2005 Earnout Period, the Earnout Amount
for the 2005 Earnout Period can subsequently be earned by achieving the combined
Target Levels for the 2005 Earnout Period, 2006 Earnout Period and the 2007
Earnout Period. If such combined Target Levels are achieved, the Earnout Amounts
for the 2005 Earnout Period, 2006 Earnout Period and the 2007 Earnout Period
would be been attained and would be due and payable. See Exhibit 1.4(d) for
examples of such calculations.

                  (e)      Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if a
Target Level is exceeded for the 2004 Earnout Period, the amount by which the
Target Level was exceeded can be applied to and aggregated with the Target Level
for the 2006 Earnout Period for purposes of determining if the Target Level for
the 2006 Earnout Period is achieved. In addition, if the Target Level is
exceeded for the 2005 Earnout Period, the amount by which the Target Level was
exceeded can be applied to and aggregated with the Target Level for the 2007
Earnout Period for purposes of determining if the Target Level for the 2007
Earnout Period is achieved. See Exhibit 1.4(e) for examples of such
calculations.

                                       4
<PAGE>

                  (f)      Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if
at least 85% but less than 100% of the amount of any Target Level for any
Earnout Period is achieved, then the Subject Percentage (as determined on
Exhibit 1.4(f) attached hereto) of the Earnout Amount for such Target Level will
be payable with respect to such Earnout Period. In addition, if a Target Level
is exceeded in the 2006 Earnout Period, the amount by which such 2006 Target
Level is exceeded may be applied to the 2005 Earnout Period for purposes of
determining the increase in the Subject Percentage to be paid for the 2005
Earnout Period. Additionally, if a Target Level Amount is exceeded in the 2007
Earnout Period the amount by which the Target Level was exceeded can be applied
to the 2005 or the 2006 Earnout Period, so that the Subject Percentage can be
calculated to increase the amount of the Earnout Amount payable for such Earnout
Period. In addition, if a Target Level Amount is exceeded in the 2004, 2005 or
2006 Earnout Periods, the amount by which the Target Level was exceeded can be
applied to the 2005, 2006 or 2007 Earnout Period, respectively, so that the
Subject Percentage can be calculated to increase the amount of the Earnout
Amount payable for such Earnout Period. In addition, if a Target Level Amount is
exceeded in the 2004 or 2005 Earnout Periods, the amount by which the Target
Level was exceeded can be applied to the 2006 or 2007 Earnout Period,
respectively, so that the Subject Percentage can be calculated to increase the
amount of the Earnout Amount payable for such Earnout Period. See Exhibit 1.4(f)
for examples of such calculations.

                  (g)      Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if a
Target Level for the last three consecutive Earnout Periods in the aggregate is
exceeded by ten percent (10%) or more, then the Earnout Amount corresponding to
each of the three Target Levels will be increased by 10% and, to the extent not
previously earned, shall be earned. See Exhibit 1.4(g) for examples of such
calculations.

                  (h)      Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, any
amount in excess of a Target Level in an Earnout Period which is applied to such
Target Level in another Earnout Period cannot be applied a second time to
another Earnout Period.

                  (i)      In addition to the foregoing Earnout Payments,
Sellers shall be paid an Earnout Amount in the amount of $3,000,000 if the
Company's EBITDA for the 2004 Earnout Period is at least seventy percent (70%)
of the EBITDA Target Level for the 2004 Earnout Period.

                  (j)      Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the
total amount paid to the Sellers pursuant to this Agreement pertaining to the
Earnout Amounts shall not exceed $57,000,000.

         1.5      Calculation of Earnout Amount. The determination of the
Earnout Amounts owed to the Sellers at the end of each Earnout Period shall be
made as follows:

                  (a)      Buyer shall prepare a consolidated statement of
income of the Acquired Companies as of the the last day of each Earnout Period
in accordance with Company GAAP (the "Earnout Income Statement"). Buyer shall
then determine the Earnout Amount due, if any, based upon the Earnout Income
Statement and applicable Target Levels for the Earnout Period detailed therein.
Buyer shall deliver the Earnout Income Statement and its determination of the

                                       5
<PAGE>

applicable Target Levels and the Earnout Amount due, if any, to the Sellers'
Representatives within ninety (90) days following the end of each Earnout
Period.

                  (b)      If within thirty (30) days following delivery of the
Earnout Income Statement and the determinations with respect to whether the
applicable Target Level has been met, the Sellers' Representatives have not
given Buyer written notice of its objection as to the calculations of the
Earnout Income Statement, the applicable Target Levels and the Earnout Amount,
if any (the "Earnout Dispute Notice"), then the determination of the Earnout
Income Statement, the applicable Target Levels and the Earnout Amount, if any,
as calculated by Buyer shall be binding and conclusive on the parties and be
used in computing the Earnout Amount due, if any. Sellers' Representatives may
waive this thirty (30) day period by providing written notice to Buyer of their
acceptance of Buyer's determination of the Earnout Income Statement, applicable
Target Levels and the Earnout Amount, if any.

                  (c)      If the Sellers' Representatives deliver to Buyer the
Earnout Dispute Notice (which notice shall state the basis of Sellers'
Representatives objection) within such thirty (30) day period, Buyer and
Sellers' Representatives shall use commercially reasonable efforts for a period
of ten (10) days after Buyer's receipt of the Earnout Dispute Notice (or such
longer period as Buyer and Sellers' Representatives shall mutually agree upon)
to resolve any disputes raised by Sellers' Representatives with respect to the
calculation of the Earnout Amount and the applicable Target Level, as determined
pursuant to the preparation of the Earnout Income Statement, and Sellers'
Representatives and Buyer shall provide information to the other party (as
reasonably requested) related to the items of disagreement set forth in the
Earnout Dispute Notice. Sellers' Representatives and their agents shall have all
reasonable rights of access to the corporate records of the Company and Buyer
for such purposes. If at the end of such ten (10) day period the Sellers'
Representatives and Buyer fail to resolve the issues outstanding with respect to
the Earnout Income Statement, the calculations of the Target Levels and the
Earnout Amount, the Sellers' Representatives and Buyer jointly shall select an
independent auditor of recognized national standing (who is not rendering, and
during the preceding two (2) year period has not rendered, services to the
Company or Buyer or any of their respective affiliates) to resolve any remaining
disagreements. If the Sellers' Representatives and Buyer are unable to jointly
select such independent auditor within five (5) days after such fifteen (15) day
period, each party shall select an independent auditor of recognized national
standing and each such selected independent auditor shall select a third
independent auditor of recognized national standing (who is not rendering, and
during the preceding two (2) year period has not rendered, services to the
Company or Buyer or any of their respective affiliates) (such selected
independent auditor whether pursuant to this or the preceding sentence, the
"Earnout Accountant").

                  (d)      If issues are submitted to the Earnout Accountant for
resolution, (i) each of the Sellers' Representatives and Buyer shall submit to
the Earnout Accountant their respective calculation of the applicable Target
Level (each a "Proposed Amount") within two (2) days after the selection of the
Earnout Accountant; (ii) the Sellers' Representatives and Buyer shall furnish or
cause to be furnished to the Earnout Accountant such work papers and other
documents and information relating to the disputed issues as the Earnout
Accountant may reasonably request and are available to that party or its agents
and shall be afforded the opportunity to present to the Earnout Accountant any
material relating to the disputed issues and to discuss the issues with the
Earnout Accountant; (iii) in determining the applicable Target Level, the
Earnout Accountant

                                       6
<PAGE>

must select either the Proposed Amount of Buyer or the Proposed Amount of
Sellers' Representatives; (iv) the selection by the Earnout Accountant of one of
the Proposed Amounts, as set forth in a notice to be delivered to both the
Sellers' Representatives and Buyer within twenty (20) days of the submission to
the Earnout Accountant of the Proposed Amounts, shall be final, binding and
conclusive on the parties and shall be used in the calculations of the
applicable Earnout Amount for the Earnout Period being disputed; and (v) the
party whose Proposed Amount is not selected by the Earnout Accountant shall bear
the fees and costs of the Earnout Accountant for such determination.

                  (e)      Within fifteen (15) days after determination of an
Earnout Amount pursuant to this Section 1.5, Buyer shall pay to each Seller such
Seller's Participating Percentage of such Earnout Amount by bank cashiers,
certified check or wire transfer (at the discretion of Seller). If only a
portion of the Earnout Amount is under dispute, Buyer shall pay to the Sellers
in accordance with the prior sentence the amount that is not being disputed. The
Sellers' rights to receive the Earnout Amount under this Agreement are
non-assignable; provided, however, that the Sellers shall be allowed to transfer
the right to a trust that is disregarded for tax purposes.

         1.6      Payment of Earnout Amounts. Within the later of (i) one
hundred twenty (120) days from the end of each Earnout Period, or (ii) if
applicable, fifteen (15) days of the decision by the designated accountant
pursuant to Section 1.5 with respect to such Earnout Period, the Buyer shall pay
to each of the Sellers in cash the amount equal to the product of (x) the
aggregate Earnout Amount payable for such Earnout Period as determined above,
times (y) such Seller's Participating Percentage.

         1.7      Corporate Governance During Earnout Period. Sellers and Buyer
agree that, following the Closing and until the earlier of October 31, 2007 or
the acceleration of the Earnout, so long as the Company is On Plan as defined in
1.7(f), the Company shall be managed in accordance with the following
provisions:

                  (a)      Sellers' Representatives shall, subject to (i) the
general guidelines set forth in that certain business plan delivered to Buyer on
the signing of this Agreement and as it may be revised pursuant to Section
1.7(g) (the "Business Plan"), (ii) Section 1.7(c) below and (iii) the Buyer's
then existing policies and procedures consistently applied to all domestic
subsidiaries of the Buyer, have authority to control, in reasonable consultation
with the Buyer, the matters covered by the Business Plan and the ordinary course
operations of the Company including, without limitation, (A) capital
expenditures, (B) the incurrence of indebtedness, (C) accepting new customers
and terminating existing customers, (D) hiring, promoting or firing design,
merchandising, sales, marketing and advertising employees of the Company below
the Vice President level, (E) the Company's designs and products, provided that
the design aesthetic, brand image and brand positioning of the Company's designs
and products remain consistent with that existing as of the Closing Date, (F)
selling, marketing or otherwise distributing Company (other than those specified
in the Strategy Plan) products to historical customers of the Company and to
other prospective customers that sell product occupying a comparable position in
the market and (G) hiring new suppliers. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Sellers' Representatives shall not, without the prior written consent of the
Buyer, (x) incur debt financing from third parties (y) enter into any Contract
that would impose any obligation or negative

                                       7
<PAGE>

covenant (e.g., a most favored nations provision or a restriction on the ability
to conduct business) on the Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries (other than the
Company).

                  (b)      The Buyer or its designee shall, subject to the
general guidelines set forth in the Business Plan, have authority to control, in
reasonable consultation with the Sellers' Representatives, the following: (i)
hiring, firing or promoting finance, production, accounting, distribution,
warehouse, operations, legal and information technology employees of the Company
below the Vice President level, and (ii) selecting legal counsel and auditors
for the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Buyer shall not take any
action that is materially inconsistent with the Business Plan or that is
primarily intended to adversely impact the ordinary course operations of the
Company. Furthermore, neither the Buyer nor the Company may take any action or
enter into any transaction that is primarily intended to adversely affect the
Earnout Amounts or Target Levels payable under this Agreement.

                  (c)      Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, the following
actions shall not be taken without the mutual consent of the Sellers'
Representatives, on the one hand, and the Buyer, on the other hand: (i) hiring,
firing or promoting employees of the Company at the Vice President or higher
level, (ii) negotiating and entering into agreements with distributors, (iii)
establishing retail stores, (iv) changing the channels of sales of the Company's
products from that existing on the Closing Date (except as otherwise provided in
the Business Plan), (v) disposing or acquiring of assets (excluding disposing
and acquiring of inventory (including close-outs with past practice) and
equipment in the ordinary course), (vi) entering into any contract relating to
the business of the Company not in the ordinary course operations of the Company
(other than as provided in the Business Plan), (vii) entering into any
transaction with any affiliate of the Company or any officer or director of the
Company or their affiliates (including family members) other than compensation
arrangements in the ordinary course operations of the Company, or (viii) placing
a security interest on any assets of the Company.

                  (d)      The Sellers' Representatives, and appropriate
designees of the Buyer, shall consult regularly (but in any event at least
quarterly) with each other regarding the strategic direction of the Company and
to mutually agree on the relevant EBITDA and Sales Target Levels to the extent
they are not already provided for in the Business Plan.

                  (e)      Provided that the Company is On Plan according to
Section 1.7(f), the Buyer will adequately fund the operations of the Company
consistent with the Business Plan.

                  (f)      For purposes of this Agreement, the Company will be
considered on plan ("On Plan") unless the Company fails to achieve 85% of the
EBITDA and the Sales Target Levels during any Earnout Period.

                  (g)      Neither the Sellers' Representatives, Company nor the
Buyer may modify the Business Plan of the Company previously delivered to the
Buyer (the "Original Business Plan") without the consent of the other; provided,
however, that if the Company's business is not performing On Plan, the Company
and Sellers' Representatives shall submit a revised Business Plan to the Buyer
within thirty (30) days of such determination. The revised Business Plan shall
be reasonably designed to serve the interests of the business of the Company in
light of business and market circumstances prevailing at that time (the "Revised
Business Plan Standard"). If the

                                       8
<PAGE>

Revised Business Plan is timely submitted by the Company and Sellers'
Representatives and is approved by the Buyer, (x) such Revised Business Plan
shall replace the prior Business Plan, (y) Sellers' Representatives shall
conduct the ordinary course operations of the Company consistent with such
Revised Business Plan and (z) the provisions of Section 1.7(f) shall apply. If
such revised Business Plan is not timely submitted by Sellers' Representative or
is not approved by the Buyer, the Buyer shall, within thirty (30) days of such
non-approval, prepare and submit to Sellers' Representatives its own revised
Business Plan that meets the Revised Business Plan Standard (the "Buyer Business
Plan"). Sellers' Representatives, on the one hand, and the Buyer, on the other,
shall then have ten (10) days to discuss and negotiate in good faith the Buyer
Business Plan, after which the Buyer Business Plan (as modified, if applicable)
shall become the Business Plan. Thereafter, Sellers and Company shall conduct
the ordinary course operations of the Company consistent with such Buyer
Business Plan and the provisions of this Section 1.7 shall apply.

                  (h)      In the event that the employment of one of the
Sellers' Representatives is terminated by the Company for Cause, as a result of
death or disability or by a Sellers' Representative for other than Good Reason,
(as such terms are defined in their respective Employment Agreements), the
remaining Sellers' Representative employed by the Company shall be the sole
Sellers' Representative. In the event that the employment of both Sellers'
Representatives is terminated by the Company for Cause, as a result of death or
disability or by them other than for Good Reason, the management of the ordinary
course operations of the Company shall be at the sole discretion of the Buyer or
its designees and the Company shall thereafter be operated by the Buyer in a
manner determined in its sole discretion. However, it is understood and agreed
that in the event that one or both of the Sellers' Representatives ceases to be
employed by the Buyer for any reason during the Earnout Period, such termination
of employment shall have no effect on the other agreements and covenants related
to the Earnout Amounts in this Agreement.

                  (i)      Buyer shall maintain, or cause to be maintained,
separate financial statements for the Company consistent with the Financial
Statements so that the parties hereto can determine whether the applicable
Target Level for the Earnout Amounts have been met.

                  (j)      The allocation of costs and revenue, for the purpose
of calculating the Company EBITDA during the Earnout Period, on cooperative
contracts involving the joint sale of products or services of both the Company
and the Buyer's or Buyer's Subsidiaries' operations that are not related to the
Company will be negotiated in advance in good faith as if the agreements were
arm's-length.

                  (k)      Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, nothing herein shall restrict the Buyer or its Subsidiaries from
competing with the Company and nothing herein shall restrict the Company from
competing with the Buyer or its Subsidiaries.

                  (l)      No Buyer corporate, management or general
administrative overhead will be allocated to the Company. Any services provided
by the Buyer to the Company will be at actual cost incurred for such services,
if applicable. The services and costs provided by the Buyer to the Company will

         1.8      Acquisitions or Sale of the Company.

                  (a)      Buyer shall not, and shall not permit any of its
Subsidiaries to, merge, consolidate, transfer or sell any of the assets of the
Company (except for sales of inventory in the ordinary course of business of the
Company and the transfer of any or all of the stock of the Company to a wholly
owned subsidiary of the Buyer) to any Subsidiary of Buyer during the Earnout
Periods without the prior written consent of the Sellers' Representatives, which
consent may not be unreasonably withheld. If Buyer takes any action after the
Closing with respect to the Company that has the effect of assigning the assets
of the Company to a Subsidiary of Buyer and such assignment directly or
indirectly results in the termination or modification of any contracts of the
Company, or the incurrence of any fees or charges, that adversely affects the
ability of the Company to reach the Target Levels, then the Target Levels shall
be adjusted accordingly to account for the adverse economic impact resulting
from such assignment of assets. Should such an assignment of assets occur,
Sellers' Representatives and Buyer will work together in good faith to agree on
the amount of the adjustments to Target Levels to appropriately reflect the
amount of the adverse economic impact.

                  (b)      This Agreement prohibits the Company from acquiring
by purchase, exchange, or otherwise, any other Person, whether or not engaged in
a business similar or related to the business of the Company.

                  (c)      In the event that substantially all of the assets or
stock of the Company are sold, transferred or otherwise disposed of by the Buyer
(other than a sale of inventory of the Company in the ordinary course of
business) (a "Sale Transaction") prior to October 31, 2007 to any Person other
than a wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Buyer, the Buyer shall, on the date of the
consummation of such Sale Transaction, deliver written notice of such Sale
Transaction to the Sellers' Representatives (such notice, the "Sale Notice"). On
the date of such Sale Transaction, the Buyer shall pay to each Seller its
Participating Percentage of any Earnout Amounts for any Earnout Period not then
completed (the "Accelerated Payment"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the
Company has not been achieving at least 75% of the Company Sales and EBITDA
Target Levels for the Earnout Period immediately prior to the Earnout Period in
which the Sale Notice is delivered, the Accelerated Payment shall be zero. (d)
On the date of a Sale Transaction, the Buyer shall pay to each of the Sellers in
cash, by bank cashiers, certified check or wire transfer (as determined by each
Seller) the amount equal to the product of (x) Accelerated Payment, times (y)
such Seller's Participating Percentage.

         1.9      Closing. The purchase and sale provided for in this Agreement
(the "Closing") will take place, unless this Agreement has been previously
terminated pursuant to Section 10.1 hereof, at the offices of Buyer's counsel at
19900 MacArthur Boulevard, Suite 1050, Irvine, California 92612 at 10:00 a.m.
(local time) on the third business day after the satisfaction or (to the extent
permitted by applicable law and this Agreement) waiver of the conditions set
forth in Articles VIII and IX (other than those conditions to be satisfied or
waived at the Closing), or at such other time and place as the parties may
agree. Subject to the provisions of Article X, failure to consummate the
purchase and sale provided for in this Agreement on the date and time and at

                                       10
<PAGE>

the place determined pursuant to this Section 1.9 will not result in the
termination of this Agreement and will not relieve any party of any obligation
under this Agreement.

         1.10     Closing Obligations. At the Closing:

                  (a)      The Company and Sellers will deliver to Buyer:

                           (i)      certificates representing the Shares, duly

         (b); and

                  (b)      Buyer will deliver to the Sellers' Representatives on

                           (i)      a bank cashier's or certified check payable
         to each Seller (or wire transfer if the Sellers' Representatives
         deliver on behalf of a Seller wire transfer instructions to the Buyer
         prior to Closing) in an amount equal to their pro rata share of the
         Cash Payment;

                           (ii)     a stock certificate for each Seller equal to
         their pro rata share of the Buyer Stock;

         Buyer; and

                           (v)      the Non-Competition Agreements, executed by
         Buyer.

                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES
                    OF THE COMPANY AND THE PRINCIPAL SELLERS

         Except as set forth in the attached Company Disclosure Letter (the
"Disclosure Letter") (which lists exceptions to the following representations
and warranties and also contains matters required to be disclosed pursuant to
this Article II, each of which corresponds to the numbered sections contained in
this Article II), the Company and each of the Principal Sellers jointly and
severally represent and warrant to Buyer as follows:

                                       11
<PAGE>

         2.1      Organization and Good Standing.

                  (a)      Section 2.1 of the Disclosure Letter contains a
complete and accurate list for each Acquired Company of its name and its
jurisdiction of organization. Each Acquired Company is duly organized, validly
existing, and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of
organization, with the requisite power and authority to conduct its business as
it is now being conducted and to own or use the properties and assets that it
purports to own or use. Each Acquired Company is duly qualified to do business
as a foreign entity and is in good standing under the laws of each state or
other jurisdiction in which either the ownership or use of the properties owned
or used by it, or the nature of the activities conducted by it, requires such
qualification, except where such failure to be in good standing would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

                  (b)      The Company has made available to Buyer copies of the
Organizational Documents of each Acquired Company, as currently in effect.

         2.2      Authority; No Conflict.

                  (a)      This Agreement constitutes the legal, valid, and
binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance
with its terms, subject, as to enforcement, to (i) applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws now or hereinafter in
effect affecting creditors' rights generally and (ii) general principles of
equity. The Company has all the necessary corporate power and authority to
execute and deliver this Agreement and to perform its obligations under this
Agreement.

                  (b)      Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement
nor the consummation or performance of any of the Contemplated Transactions
will, directly or indirectly (with or without notice or lapse of time):

                           (i)      conflict with, or result in a violation of
         (A) any provision of the Organizational Documents of the Acquired
         Companies, or (B) any resolution adopted by the board of directors or
         the stockholders of any Acquired Company;

                           (ii)     conflict with, or result in a material
         violation of, any Legal Requirement or any Order to which any Acquired
         Company may be subject;

                           (iii)    conflict with, or result in a material
         violation of any of the terms or requirements of, or give any
         Governmental Body the right to revoke, withdraw, suspend, cancel,
         terminate, or modify, any Governmental Authorization that is held by
         any Acquired Company or that otherwise relates to the business of, or
         any of the assets owned or used by, any Acquired Company;

                           (iv)     cause Buyer or any Acquired Company to
         become subject to, or to become liable for the payment of, any Tax;

                           (v)      cause any of the assets owned by any
         Acquired Company to be reassessed or revalued by any taxing authority
         or other Governmental Body;

                                       12
<PAGE>

                           (vi)     conflict with, or result in a material
         violation or breach of any provision of, or give any Person the right
         to declare a default or exercise any remedy under, or to accelerate the
         maturity or performance of, or to cancel, terminate, or modify, any
         Applicable Contract; or

                           (vii)    result in the imposition or creation of any
         Encumbrance upon or with respect to any of the assets owned or used by
         any Acquired Company.

                  (c)      No Acquired Company is or will be required to give
any notice to or obtain any Consent from any Person in connection with the
execution and delivery of this Agreement or the consummation or performance of
any of the Contemplated Transactions.

         2.3      Capitalization. The authorized equity securities of the
Company consist of 100,000,000 shares of common stock, no par value, of which
10,000,000 shares (collectively, the "Company Stock") are issued and
outstanding. Sellers will be on the Closing Date the record and beneficial
owners and holders of all of the Company Stock, free and clear of all
Encumbrances. Each of the Sellers owns that number of Shares set forth below
their respective signatures on the signature page to this Agreement. With the
exception of the Company Stock, all of the outstanding equity securities and
other securities of each Acquired Company are owned of record and beneficially
by one or more of the Acquired Companies, free and clear of all Encumbrances.
Except for restrictions on transfer under applicable state and federal
securities laws, no legend or other reference to any purported Encumbrance
appears upon any certificate representing equity securities of any Acquired
Company. All of the outstanding equity securities of each Acquired Company have
been duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid and nonassessable.
There are no Contracts relating to the issuance, sale, or transfer of any equity
securities or other securities of any Acquired Company. None of the outstanding
equity securities or other securities of any Acquired Company was issued in
violation of the Securities Act or any other Legal Requirement. No Acquired
Company owns, or has any Contract to acquire, any equity securities or other
securities of any Person (other than Acquired Companies) or any direct or
indirect equity or ownership interest in any other business.

         2.4      Financial Statements.

                  (a)      Section 2.4 of the Disclosure Letter contains (a)

equity, and cash flow for the two fiscal years then ended, together with the

with the Balance Sheet, the "Financial Statements"). Such financial statements

results of operations, changes in stockholders' equity, and cash flow of the
Acquired Companies as at the respective dates of and for the periods referred to
in such financial statements, all in accordance with Company GAAP. The financial

such accounting principles throughout the periods involved. No

financial statements of any Person other than the Acquired Companies are
required by Company GAAP to be included in the consolidated financial statements
of the Company.

                  (b)      There will be no material differences between the
Financial Statements and the Audited Financial Statements.

                  (c)      Except for transactions, arrangements and other
relationships otherwise specifically identified in the Financial Statements,
including but not limited to identification of the information set forth below,
Section 2.4 of the Disclosure Letter sets forth a true, complete and correct
list of all transactions, arrangements and other relationships between and/or

other Person, including but not limited to any structured finance, special
purpose or limited purpose entity or Person (each, an "Off-Balance Sheet

arrangements, that could require the Acquired Companies or any of their
affiliates to provide funding of any obligations under any such Off-Balance
Sheet Transaction, including but not limited to guarantees of repayments, make
whole agreements or value guarantees, and (f) any other information with respect
to each such Off-Balance Sheet Transaction that could have a Company Material
Adverse Effect.

         2.5      Books and Records. The accounting books and records, minute
books, and stock record books of the Acquired Companies, copies of which have
been delivered to Buyer, are true and complete in all material respects. The
minute books of the Acquired Companies contain materially accurate and complete
records of all meetings held of, and corporate action taken by, the
stockholders, the boards of directors, and committees of the boards of directors
of the Acquired Companies. At the Closing, all such books and records will be in
the possession of the Acquired Companies.

         2.6      Title to Properties; Encumbrances.

                  (a)      The Company does not own, and has not previously
owned, any real property. Section 2.6 of the Disclosure Letter contains a
complete and accurate list of all real estate leasehold interests owned by any
Acquired Company. All current leases or subleases of the Company are in full
force and effect, are valid and effective in accordance with their respective
terms, and there is not, under any of such leases, any existing material default
or event of default (or event which with notice or lapse of time, or both, would
constitute a default) by the Company or by the other party to such lease or
sublease. Complete and correct copies of such leases and subleases have been
delivered to Buyer.

                  (b)      The Acquired Companies own all the properties and
assets (whether real, personal, or mixed and whether tangible or intangible)
that they purport to own located in the facilities owned or operated by the
Acquired Companies or reflected as owned in the books and

                                       14
<PAGE>

records of the Acquired Companies, including all of the properties and assets
reflected in the Balance Sheet (except for assets held under capitalized leases
and personal property sold since the date of the Balance Sheet in the ordinary
course of business), and all of the properties and assets purchased or otherwise
acquired by the Acquired Companies since the date of the Balance Sheet (except
for personal property acquired and sold since the date of the Balance Sheet in
the ordinary course of business). All material properties and material assets
reflected in the Balance Sheet are free and clear of all Encumbrances.

         2.7      Condition and Sufficiency of Assets. The buildings, plants,
structures, and equipment of the Acquired Companies are structurally sound, are
in good operating condition and repair, and are adequate for the uses to which
they are being put, and none of such buildings, plants, structures, or equipment
is in need of maintenance or repairs except for ordinary, routine maintenance
and repairs that are not material in nature or cost. The building, plants,
structures, and equipment of the Acquired Companies are sufficient for the
continued conduct of the Acquired Companies' businesses immediately after the
Closing in substantially the same manner as conducted prior to the Closing.

         2.8      Accounts Receivable. All accounts receivable of the Acquired
Companies that are reflected on the Balance Sheet or on the accounting records
of the Acquired Companies as of the Closing Date (collectively, the "Accounts
Receivable") represent valid obligations arising from sales actually made or
services actually performed in the ordinary course of business. Unless paid
prior to the Closing Date, the Accounts Receivable are or will be as of the
Closing Date current and collectible net of the respective reserves shown on the
Balance Sheet or on the accounting records of the Acquired Companies as of the
Closing Date (which reserves are adequate and calculated consistent with past
practice. There is no contest, claim, or right of set-off, other than returns in
the ordinary course of business, under any Contract with any obligor of an
Accounts Receivable relating to the amount or validity of such Accounts
Receivable.

         2.9      Inventory. All inventory of the Acquired Companies, whether or
not reflected in the Balance Sheet, consists of a quality and quantity usable
and salable in the ordinary course of business, except for obsolete items and
items of below-standard quality, all of which have been written off or written
down to net realizable value in the Balance Sheet or on the accounting records
of the Acquired Companies as of the Closing Date, as the case may be. All
inventories not written off have been priced at the lower of cost or market on a
weighted average cost basis.

         2.10     No Undisclosed Liabilities. The Acquired Companies have no
liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether known or unknown and whether
absolute, accrued, contingent, or otherwise) except for: (i) liabilities or
obligations reflected or reserved against in the Balance Sheet and current
liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business since the date of the
Balance Sheet; and (ii) those liabilities not required to be reflected on the
Balance Sheet prepared in accordance with Company GAAP.

         2.11     Taxes.

                  (a)      The Acquired Companies have filed or caused to be
filed (on a timely basis since January 1, 1999) all Tax Returns that are or were
required to be filed by or with respect to any of them, either separately or as
a member of a group of corporations, pursuant to

                                       15
<PAGE>

applicable Legal Requirements. Sellers have made available to Buyer copies of
all Tax Returns relating to income or franchise taxes filed since January 1,
1999. The Acquired Companies have paid, or made provision for the payment of,
all Taxes that have or may have become due pursuant to those Tax Returns or
otherwise, or pursuant to any assessment received by Sellers or any Acquired
Company, except such Taxes, if any, as are listed in Section 2.11 of the
Disclosure Letter and are being contested in good faith and as to which adequate
reserves (determined in accordance with Company GAAP) have been provided in the
Balance Sheet.

                  (b)      Section 2.11 of the Disclosure Letter contains a
complete and accurate list of all audits of all federal and state income Tax
Returns of each Acquired Company, including a reasonably detailed description of
the nature and outcome of each audit. All deficiencies proposed as a result of
such audits have been paid, reserved against, settled, or, as described in
Section 2.11 of the Disclosure Letter, are being contested in good faith by
appropriate proceedings. Section 2.11 of the Disclosure Letter describes all
adjustments to the United States federal income Tax Returns filed by any
Acquired Company or any group of corporations including any Acquired Company for
all taxable years since January 1, 1999, and the resulting deficiencies proposed
by the IRS. No Acquired Company has given or been requested to give waivers or
extensions (or is or would be subject to a waiver or extension given by any
other Person) of any statute of limitations relating to the payment of Taxes of
any Acquired Company or for which any Acquired Company may be liable.

                  (c)      The charges, accruals, and reserves with respect to
Taxes on the respective books of each Acquired Company are adequate (determined
in accordance with Company GAAP) and are at least equal to that Acquired
Company's liability for Taxes for all fiscal periods through the Balance Sheet.
To the Knowledge of the Company and the Principal Sellers, there exists no
proposed tax assessment against any Acquired Company. No consent to the
application of Section 341(f)(2) of the IRC has been filed with respect to any
property or assets held, acquired, or to be acquired by any Acquired Company.
All Taxes that any Acquired Company is or was required by Legal Requirements to
withhold or collect have been duly withheld or collected and, to the extent
required, have been paid to the proper Governmental Body or other Person.

                  (d)      All Tax Returns filed by (or that include on a
consolidated basis) any Acquired Company are true, correct, and complete. There
is no tax sharing agreement that will require any payment by any Acquired
Company after the date of this Agreement.

                  (e)      No claim has been made during the last five years by
any Governmental Body in a jurisdiction where any Acquired Company does not file
Tax Returns that such Acquired Company is or may be subject to taxation by such
jurisdiction.

                  (f)      To the Knowledge of the Principal Sellers and the
Company, each Acquired Company has disclosed on its federal income Tax Returns
all positions taken therein that could give rise to a substantial understatement
of federal income tax within the meaning of Code Section 6662. No Acquired
Company has entered into any transaction that would be considered listable or
reportable under Section 6111 or 6112 of the Code.

                                       16
<PAGE>

         2.12     No Material Adverse Change. Since the date of the Balance
Sheet, there has not been any material adverse change in the business,
operations, properties, prospects, assets, or condition of any Acquired Company,
and no event has occurred or circumstance exists that may result in such a
material adverse change.

         2.13     Employee Benefits.

                  (a)      Section 2.13 of the Disclosure Letter contains a list
of all pension, profit sharing, stock option, employee stock purchase or other
plans providing for deferred, incentive or other compensation or fringe benefits
to employees, and all other employee benefit plans to which the Company is a
party or by which it is bound (collectively, the "Plans").

                  (b)      None of the Acquired Companies or any ERISA
Affiliate, has any actual or contingent, direct or indirect, liability in
respect of any employee benefit plan or arrangement, including any plan subject
to ERISA, other than to make contributions under or pay benefits pursuant to the
Plans.

                  (c)      All of the Plans are in material compliance with all
applicable Legal Requirements, and no "reportable event," as defined in ERISA,
has occurred or is continuing with respect to any Plan.

                  (d)      No Plan (i) is subject to Title IV of ERISA, or is
otherwise a defined benefit plan subject to Title 1 or Title IV of ERISA, or is
a multiple employer plan (within the meaning of IRC Section 413(c)) or (ii)
provides for post-retirement welfare benefits other than as may be required
under Section 4980B(f) of the Code or a "parachute payment" (within the meaning
of IRC Section 280G(b)).

                  (e)      The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
consummation of the Contemplated Transactions (i) will not result in any
prohibited transaction within the meaning of Section 406 of ERISA or IRC Section
4975 or (ii) in the payment, vesting or acceleration of any benefit under any
Plan.

         2.14     Compliance with Legal Requirements; Governmental
Authorizations.

                  (a)      Since January 1, 2000, each Acquired Company has
conducted and currently is conducting its business and operations in full
compliance with all Legal Requirements applicable to it, except where such
failure to comply would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to cause a Company Material Adverse Effect.

                  (b)      No event has occurred or circumstance exists that
(with or without notice or lapse of time) (i) may constitute or result in a
material violation by any Acquired Company of, or a failure on the part of any
Acquired Company to comply with, any Legal Requirement, or (ii) may give rise to
any obligation on the part of any Acquired Company to undertake, or to bear all
or any portion of the cost of, any remedial action of any nature.

                  (c)      No Acquired Company has received, at any time since
January 1, 2000, any notice from any Governmental Body regarding (i) any actual,
alleged, possible, or potential violation of, or failure to comply with, any
Legal Requirement, or (ii) any actual, alleged,

                                       17
<PAGE>

possible, or potential obligation on the part of any Acquired Company to
undertake, or to bear all or any portion of the cost of, any remedial action of
any nature.

                  (d)      Each of the Acquired Companies is in possession of
all authorizations, licenses, permits, certificates, approvals and clearances of
any Governmental Entity (collectively, the "Company Permits") necessary for the

existing, and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of
incorporation, with full corporate power and authority to conduct its business
as it is now being conducted and to own or use the properties and assets that it
purports to own or use. Buyer is duly qualified to do business as a foreign
corporation and is in good standing under the laws of each state or other
jurisdiction in which either the ownership or use of the properties owned or
used by it, or the nature of the activities conducted by it, requires such
qualification.

                                       28
<PAGE>

         4.2      Authority; No Conflict.

                  (a)      This Agreement constitutes the legal, valid, and
binding obligation of Buyer, enforceable against Buyer in accordance with its
terms subject, as to enforcement, to (i) applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or similar laws now or hereafter in effect affecting
creditors' rights generally and (ii) general principles of equity.. Upon the
execution and delivery by Buyer of the Employment Agreements (collectively, the

legal, valid, and binding obligations of Buyer, enforceable against Buyer in
accordance with their respective terms subject, as to enforcement, to (i)
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws
now or hereafter in effect affecting creditors' rights generally and (ii)
general principles of equity. Buyer has the absolute and unrestricted right,
power, and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and the Buyer's
Closing Documents and to perform its obligations under this Agreement and the
Buyer's Closing Documents.

                  (b)      Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement
by Buyer nor the consummation or performance of any of the Contemplated
Transactions by Buyer will give any Person the right to prevent, delay, or
otherwise interfere with any of the Contemplated Transactions pursuant to:

                           (i)      any provision of Buyer's Organizational
         Documents;

                           (ii)     any resolution adopted by the board of
         directors or the stockholders of Buyer;

                           (iii)    any Legal Requirement or Order to which
         Buyer may be subject; or

                           (iv)     any Contract to which Buyer is a party or by
         which Buyer may be bound.

Buyer is not and will not be required to obtain any Consent from any Person in
connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the consummation
or performance of any of the Contemplated Transactions.

         4.3      SEC Reports.

                  (a)      Since January 1, 2001, Buyer has timely filed all
required reports, schedules, and forms with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (collectively, and in each case including all amendments, exhibits
and schedules thereto and documents incorporated by reference therein, the "SEC
Reports"). As of its filing date (or, if amended or superseded by a filing prior
to the date of this Agreement, on the date of such filing), each SEC Report
complied as to form in all material respects with the applicable requirements of
the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act, as the case may be. As of
their respective filing dates (or, if amended or superseded by a filing prior to
the date of this Agreement, on the date of such filing), none of the SEC Reports
contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any
material fact necessary to make the statements made therein, in the light of the
circumstances in

                                       29
<PAGE>

which they were made, not misleading, except to the extent corrected by a
subsequently filed SEC Report.

                  (b)      The consolidated financial statements (including any
related notes) included in the SEC Reports (the "Buyer Financial Statements")
fairly present in all material respects the consolidated financial position,
statements of equity, cash flows and changes in stockholders' equity of Buyer
for the respective fiscal periods or as of the respective dates therein set
forth; and each of such statements (including the related notes, where
applicable) complies in all material respects with applicable accounting
requirements and with the published rules and regulations of the SEC with
respect thereto; and each of such statements (including the related notes, where
applicable) has been prepared in accordance with Buyer GAAP consistently applied
during the periods involved, except, in each case, as indicated in such
statements or in the notes thereto, and provided that unaudited interim
financial statements may not contain footnotes and may be subject to normal
year-end audit adjustments.

         4.4      No Material Adverse Change. Since October 31, 2003, except as
disclosed in the SEC Reports, there has not been any material adverse change in
the business, operations, properties, prospects, assets, or condition of Buyer,
and no event has occurred or circumstance exists that may result in such a
material adverse change.

         4.5      Issuance of Shares. All shares of Buyer Stock to be issued to
Sellers pursuant to this Agreement will, when issued pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement, be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable
and free of preemptive rights, and free and clear of all liens and encumbrances
and free of any restriction on transfer, other than restrictions on transfer
under applicable federal and state securities laws.

         4.6      Investment Intent. Buyer is acquiring the Shares for its own
account and not with a view to their distribution within the meaning of Section
2(11) of the Securities Act.

         4.7      Brokers or Finders. Other than fees payable to Citigroup
Global Markets Inc., Buyer and its officers and agents have incurred no
obligation or liability, contingent or otherwise, for brokerage or finders' fees
or agents' commissions or other similar payment in connection with this
Agreement and will indemnify and hold Sellers harmless from any such payment
alleged to be due by or through Buyer as a result of the action of Buyer or its
officers or agents.

<PAGE>

                  (b)      Each of the Sellers hereby appoints the Sellers'
Representatives as such Seller's agent, proxy and attorney-in-fact, with full
power of substitution, for all purposes set forth in this Agreement, including,

which such Seller or Sellers are permitted or required to do or exercise under
this Agreement and the other agreements, documents and certificates executed in
connection herewith. Each of the Sellers agrees that such agency and proxy are

Sellers' Representatives and shall survive the death, bankruptcy or other
incapacity of any Seller; provided that such agency and proxy shall terminate if

                  (c)      Each of the Sellers hereby agrees that any amendment
or waiver under this Agreement and any action taken on behalf of the Sellers to
enforce the rights of the Sellers under this Agreement, and any action taken
with respect to any indemnification claim pursuant to Article XI (including any
action taken to object to, defend, compromise or agree to the payment of such
claim), shall be effective if approved in writing by the Sellers'
Representatives and the holders of a majority of the Shares (including any
Shares held by the Sellers' Representatives), or, in the case of any amendment
or waiver made or given or action taken after the Closing, if so approved by
persons who were the holders of a majority of the Shares immediately prior to

conclusive on every Seller, whether or not such Seller had notice of, or
approved, such amendment or waiver.

                  (d)      The Sellers shall share, on a pro rata basis in
proportion to the number of Shares held by them immediately prior to the
Closing, the professional fees and expenses of any attorneys, accountants or
other advisors retained by the Sellers' Representatives in connection with any
action taken or not taken as the Sellers' Representatives. The Sellers'
Representatives shall be entitled to request in writing payment from each Seller
its ratable portion of amounts payable to attorneys, accountants or other
advisors, which amounts shall be paid upon such request to such individuals or
the Sellers' Representatives, as set forth in the request submitted by the
Sellers' Representatives.

                  (e)      Damon Way and Kenneth Block shall jointly serve as
the Sellers' Representatives until one resigns or is otherwise unable or
unwilling to serve. If one of the Sellers' Representatives resigns, the other
shall assume such role individually. In the event that both Sellers'
Representatives resign from such position or are otherwise unable or unwilling
to serve, the remaining Sellers shall select, by the vote of the holders of a
majority of the Shares, or, if such event occurs after the Closing, the vote of
the holders of a majority of the Shares immediately prior to Closing, a
successor representative to fill such vacancy, shall provide prompt written
notice to Buyer of such change and such substituted representative shall then be
deemed to be the Sellers' Representatives for all purposes of this Agreement.

its Subsidiaries and its and their respective representatives to, provide the
Sellers' Representatives reasonable access

Subsidiaries to the extent such access is reasonably required for Sellers'
Representatives to fulfill its obligations under this Agreement.

<PAGE>

                  (a)      any Breach of any representation or warranty made by
such Seller in this Agreement; or

                  (b)      any Breach by such Seller of any covenant or
obligation of such Seller in this Agreement.

         11.4     Indemnification and Payment of Damages by Buyer. Buyer will
indemnify and hold harmless the Company and Sellers and their respective
Representatives and affiliates, and will pay to Sellers the amount of any
Damages arising, directly or indirectly, from or in connection with (a) any
Breach of any representation or warranty made by Buyer in this Agreement or in
any certificate delivered by Buyer pursuant to this Agreement, (b) any Breach by
Buyer of any covenant or obligation of Buyer in this Agreement, (c) any claim by
any Person for brokerage or finder's fees or commissions or similar payments
based upon any agreement or understanding alleged to have been made by such
Person with Buyer (or any Person acting on its behalf) in connection with any of
the Contemplated Transactions; or (d) as set forth in Section 7.2 hereof related
to the Buyer Registration Statement.

         11.5     Time Limitations. If the Closing occurs, Sellers will have no
liability (for indemnification or otherwise) with respect to any representation
or warranty, or covenant or obligation, other than those in Sections 2.3, 2.11,
2.13, 2.19 and 3.1, unless on or before February 1, 2006 Buyer notifies Sellers
of a claim specifying the factual basis of that claim in reasonable detail to
the extent then known by Buyer; a claim with respect to Sections 2.3, 2.13, 2.19
or 3.1 may be made at any time; and a claim with respect to Section 2.11 may be
made at any time until all tax liabilities of the Company are decided by final
determination of the Internal Revenue Service, judicial decision or upon thirty
(30) days after the expiration of the statute of limitations, taking into
account any waiver or extension of such applicable statute of limitation. If the
Closing occurs, Buyer will have no liability (for indemnification or otherwise)
with respect to any representation or warranty, or covenant or obligation to be
performed and complied with prior to the Closing Date, unless on or before
February 1, 2006 Sellers notify Buyer of a claim specifying the factual basis of
that claim in reasonable detail to the extent then known by Sellers.

         11.6     Limitations on Amount--Sellers.

                  (a)      The Principal Sellers will have no liability (for
indemnification or otherwise) with respect to the matters described in clause
(a) of Section 11.2 (i) until the total of all Damages with respect to such
matters exceeds $3,000,000, and then only for the amount by which such Damages
exceed $3,000,000 or (ii) to the extent the subject matter of the claim is
covered by insurance, and such insurance proceeds have been actually received by
the Buyer Indemnified Persons (net of any costs and expenses incurred in
obtaining such insurance proceeds). If the Sellers pay the Buyer Indemnified
Persons for a claim and subsequently insurance proceeds in respect of such claim
are collected by the Buyer Indemnified Persons, then the Buyer Indemnified
Persons shall remit the insurance proceeds to the Sellers. The Buyer Indemnified
Persons shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain from any applicable
insurance company any insurance proceeds in respect of any claim for which the
Buyer Indemnified Persons seek indemnification under this Article XI..
Furthermore, any liability of the Principal Sellers hereunder (for
indemnification or otherwise) shall terminate at such time as the aggregate
amount of Damages paid to Buyer by the Principal Sellers equals $25,000,000.

                                       43
<PAGE>

However, this Section 11.6(a) will not apply to (I) any claim for Damages based
on fraud or any intentional Breach by the Company or any Principal Seller of any
covenant or obligation or (II) any claim under Sections 11.2(d) or 11.2(e), and
the Company and the Principal Sellers will be jointly and severally liable for
all Damages with respect thereto.

                  (b)      Any liability of a Non-Principal Seller hereunder
(for indemnification or otherwise) shall be limited so that the aggregate amount
of Damages paid to Buyer by such Non-Principal Seller does not exceed the
portion of the Purchase Price paid or payable to such Non-Principal Seller (with
the value of any Buyer Stock received by such Non-Principal Seller equal to
$17.46 per share).

         11.7     Limitations on Amount--Buyer. Buyer will have no liability
(for indemnification or otherwise) with respect to the matters described in
clause (a) of Section 11.4 until the total of all Damages with respect to such
matters exceeds $3,000,000, and then only for the amount by which such Damages
exceed $3,000,000. However, this Section 11.7 will not apply to any Breach of
any of Buyer's representations and warranties of which Buyer had Knowledge at
any time prior to the date on which such representation and warranty is made or
any intentional Breach by Buyer of any covenant or obligation, and Buyer will be
liable for all Damages with respect to such Breaches.

         11.8     Right of Set-Off. Upon notice to Sellers' Representatives
specifying in reasonable detail the basis for such set-off, Buyer may set off
any amount to which it may be entitled under this Article XI against amounts
otherwise payable under this Agreement, including but not limited to, the
Earnout Amounts. Neither the exercise of nor the failure to exercise such right
of set-off will constitute an election of remedies or limit Buyer in any manner
in the enforcement of any other remedies that may be available to it.

         11.9     Exclusive Remedy. After the Closing, the indemnities provided
in this Article XI shall constitute the sole and exclusive remedy of any
Indemnified Party for Damages arising out of, resulting from or incurred in
connection with the breach of any representation, warranty or agreement made by
the parties in this Agreement; provided, however; that this exclusive remedy for
Damages does not preclude a party from bringing an action for specific
performance or other equitable remedy to require a party to perform its
obligations under this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the
preceding sentence, no legal action sounding in tort, statute or strict
liability may be maintained by any party. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Section 11.7, in the event of a fraudulent or willful breach of
the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained herein by the
Company or any Seller, the Buyer Indemnified Persons shall have all remedies
available at law or in equity (including for tort) with respect thereto.

         11.10    Procedure for Indemnification--Third Party Claims.

                  (a)      Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under
Sections 11.2, 11.3 or 11.4 of notice of the commencement of any Proceeding
against it, such indemnified party will, if a claim is to be made against an
indemnifying party under such Section, give notice to the indemnifying party of
the commencement of such claim, but the failure to notify the indemnifying party
will not relieve the indemnifying party of any liability that it may have to any

                                       44
<PAGE>

indemnified party, except to the extent that the indemnifying party demonstrates
that the defense of such action is prejudiced by the indemnified party's failure
to give such notice.

                  (b)      If any Proceeding referred to in Section 11.10(a) is
brought against an indemnified party and it gives notice to the indemnifying
party of the commencement of such Proceeding, the indemnifying party will,
unless the claim involves Taxes, be entitled to participate in such Proceeding
and, to the extent that it wishes (unless (i) the indemnifying party is also a
party to such Proceeding and the indemnified party determines in good faith that
joint representation would be inappropriate, or (ii) the indemnifying party
fails to provide reasonable assurance to the indemnified party of its financial
capacity to defend such Proceeding and provide indemnification with respect to
such Proceeding), to assume the defense of such Proceeding with counsel
reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party and, after notice from the
indemnifying party to the indemnified party of its election to assume the
defense of such Proceeding, the indemnifying party will not, as long as it
diligently conducts such defense, be liable to the indemnified party under this
Article XI for any fees of other counsel or any other expenses with respect to
the defense of such Proceeding, in each case subsequently incurred by the
indemnified party in connection with the defense of such Proceeding, other than
reasonable costs of investigation. If the indemnifying party assumes the defense
of a Proceeding, (i) it will be conclusively established for purposes of this
Agreement that the claims made in that Proceeding are within the scope of and
subject to indemnification; (ii) no compromise or settlement of such claims may
be effected by the indemnifying party without the indemnified party's consent
(such consent to not be unreasonably withheld) unless (A) there is no finding or
admission of any violation of Legal Requirements or any violation of the rights
of any Person and no effect on any other claims that may be made against the
indemnified party, and (B) the sole relief provided is monetary damages that are
paid in full by the indemnifying party; and (iii) the indemnified party will
have no liability with respect to any compromise or settlement of such claims
effected without its consent. If notice is given to an indemnifying party of the
commencement of any Proceeding and the indemnifying party does not, within
thirty days after the indemnified party's notice is given, give notice to the
indemnified party of its election to assume the defense of such Proceeding, the
indemnifying party will be bound by any determination made in such Proceeding or
any compromise or settlement effected by the indemnified party. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, notice of any claim made against the Company or the Sellers,
other than those arising as result of a breach of the representations and
warranties made in Article III shall be provided to the Sellers'
Representatives, who shall have sole authority to respond to and compromise such
claim in accordance with the foregoing provisions. Likewise, the Sellers'
Representatives shall have the sole authority to seek indemnification from Buyer
pursuant to this Article XI on behalf of the Sellers.

                  (c)      Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an indemnified
party determines in good faith that there is a reasonable probability that a
Proceeding may adversely affect it or its affiliates other than as a result of
monetary damages for which it would be entitled to indemnification under this
Agreement, the indemnified party may, by notice to the indemnifying party,
assume the exclusive right to defend, compromise, or settle such Proceeding, but
the indemnifying party will not be bound by any determination of a Proceeding so
defended or any compromise or settlement effected without its consent (which may
not be unreasonably withheld).

                                       45
<PAGE>

                  (d)      Sellers hereby consent to the non-exclusive
jurisdiction of any court in which a Proceeding is brought against any
Indemnified Person for purposes of any claim that an Indemnified Person may have
under this Agreement with respect to such Proceeding or the matters alleged
therein, and agree that process may be served on Sellers with respect to such a
claim anywhere in the world.

         11.11    Procedure for Indemnification--Other Claims. A claim for
indemnification for any matter not involving a third-party claim may be asserted
by written notice to the party from whom indemnification is sought.

         11.12    Interpretation. The term "Damages" shall not include any
consequential damages, claims for lost profits or punitive damages.

         11.13    No Environmental Contribution. The Buyer Indemnified Persons
shall not be able to seek contribution from the Sellers under any requirements
of or obligations imposed by any Environmental Laws and hereby waive all
statutory rights against the Sellers under the Environmental Laws; provided,
this shall not limit in any manner the right of the Buyer Indemnified Persons to
seek and obtain indemnification pursuant to the other provisions of this
Agreement.

                                  ARTICLE XII
                               GENERAL PROVISIONS

         12.1     Expenses. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this
Agreement, each party to this Agreement will bear its respective expenses
incurred in connection with the preparation, execution, and performance of this
Agreement and the Contemplated Transactions, including all fees and expenses of
agents, representatives, counsel, and accountants. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in the event the Closing occurs, Sellers will bear the Company's
portion of such expenses. In the event of termination of this Agreement, the
obligation of each party to pay its own expenses will be subject to any rights
of such party arising from a breach of this Agreement by another party.

         12.2     Public Announcements. Any public announcement or similar
publicity with respect to this Agreement or the Contemplated Transactions will
be issued, if at all, at such time and in such manner as Buyer and Seller
mutually determine, unless applicable Legal Requirements require otherwise.
Unless consented to by Buyer in advance or required by Legal Requirements, prior
to the Closing the Company and Sellers shall, and shall cause the Acquired
Companies to, keep this Agreement strictly confidential and may not make any
disclosure of this Agreement to any Person. The Company and Buyer will consult
with each other concerning the means by which the Acquired Companies' employees,
customers, and suppliers and others having dealings with the Acquired Companies
will be informed of the Contemplated Transactions, and Buyer will have the right
to be present for any such communication.

         12.3     Confidentiality. Between the date of this Agreement and the
Closing Date, Buyer, the Company and Sellers will maintain in confidence, and
will cause the directors, officers, employees, agents, and advisors of Buyer and
the Acquired Companies to maintain in confidence, any written information
obtained in confidence from another party or an Acquired

                                       46
<PAGE>

Company in connection with this Agreement or the Contemplated Transactions,
unless (a) such information is already known to such party or to others not
bound by a duty of confidentiality or such information becomes publicly
available through no fault of such party, (b) the use of such information is
necessary or appropriate in making any filing or obtaining any consent or
approval required for the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions, or (c)
the furnishing or use of such information is required by or necessary or
appropriate in connection with legal proceedings.

         If the Contemplated Transactions are not consummated, each party will
return or destroy as much of such written information as the other party may
reasonably request.

         12.4     Notices. All notices, consents, waivers, and other
communications under this Agreement must be in writing and will be deemed to
have been duly given when (a) delivered by hand (with written confirmation of
receipt), (b) sent by telecopier (with written confirmation of receipt),
provided that a copy is mailed by registered mail, return receipt requested, or
(c) when received by the addressee, if sent by a nationally recognized overnight
delivery service (receipt requested), in each case to the appropriate addresses
and telecopier numbers set forth below (or to such other addresses and

         12.5     Dispute Resolution.

                  (a)      Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally submits, for itself and its property, to the exclusive
jurisdiction of any court sitting in the County of Orange, California, or
Federal court of the United States of America, sitting in the County of Orange,
California, and any appellate court from any thereof, in any action or
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the agreements
delivered in connection herewith or the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment relating thereto, and
each of the parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally (A) agrees not to
commence any such action or proceeding except in such courts, (B) agrees that
any claim in respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard and
determined in such Orange County court or, to the extent permitted by law, in
such Federal court sitting in Orange County, (C) waives, to the fullest extent
it may legally and effectively do so, any objection which it may now or
hereafter have to the laying of venue of any such action or proceeding in any
such Orange County, State or Federal court and (D) waives, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of
such action or proceeding in any such Orange County, State or Federal court.
Each of the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such action or
proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by
suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law. Each party to this
Agreement irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner provided for
notices in Section 12.4. Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of any
party to this Agreement to serve process in any other manner permitted by law.

                  (b)      EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY
CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE
COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF
ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY
HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE
EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE EITHER OF SUCH WAIVERS, (B) IT UNDERSTANDS
AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVERS, (C) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVERS
VOLUNTARILY, AND (D) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG
OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 12.5(b).

         12.6     Further Assurances. The parties agree (a) to furnish upon
request to each other such further information, (b) to execute and deliver to
each other such other documents, and (c) to do such other acts and things, all
as the other party may reasonably request for the purpose of carrying out the
intent of this Agreement and the documents referred to in this Agreement.

                                       48
<PAGE>

         12.7     Waiver. The rights and remedies of the parties to this
Agreement are cumulative and not alternative. Neither the failure nor any delay
by any party in exercising any right, power, or privilege under this Agreement
or the documents referred to in this Agreement will operate as a waiver of such
right, power, or privilege, and no single or partial exercise of any such right,
power, or privilege will preclude any other or further exercise of such right,
power, or privilege or the exercise of any other right, power, or privilege. To
the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, (a) no claim or right arising
out of this Agreement or the documents referred to in this Agreement can be
discharged by one party, in whole or in part, by a waiver or renunciation of the
claim or right unless in writing signed by the other party; (b) no waiver that
may be given by a party will be applicable except in the specific instance for
which it is given; and (c) no notice to or demand on one party will be deemed to
be a waiver of any obligation of such party or of the right of the party giving
such notice or demand to take further action without notice or demand as
provided in this Agreement or the documents referred to in this Agreement.

         12.8     Entire Agreement and Modification. This Agreement supersedes
all prior agreements and understandings between the parties with respect to its
subject matter (including the letter setting forth the indication of interest
between Buyer and the Company dated February 18, 2004) and constitutes (along
with the documents referred to in this Agreement) a complete and exclusive
statement of the terms of the agreement between the parties with respect to its
subject matter. This Agreement may be amended or modified in whole or in part at
any time prior to the Closing Date by an agreement in writing among Buyer, the
Company and the Sellers' Representative.

         12.9     Buyer's and Sellers' Schedules.

                  (a)      The disclosures in the Disclosure Letter must relate
only to the representations and warranties in the Section of the Agreement to
which they expressly relate and not to any other representation or warranty in
this Agreement, except to the extent that such other representation and warranty
would reasonably be expected to be pertinent to the disclosures made.

                  (b)      In the event of any inconsistency between the
statements in the body of this Agreement and those in the Buyer's or Disclosure
Letter (other than an exception expressly set forth as such in the applicable
Buyer's or Disclosure Letter with respect to a specifically identified
representation or warranty), the statements in the body of this Agreement will
control.

         12.10    Assignments, Successors, and No Third-Party Rights. No party
may assign any of its rights under this Agreement without the prior consent of
the other parties, which will not be unreasonably withheld, except that Buyer
may assign any of its rights under this Agreement to any Subsidiary of Buyer
provided that Buyer shall remain liable for all of its obligations hereunder.
Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will apply to, be binding in
all respects upon, and inure to the benefit of the successors and permitted
assigns of the parties. Nothing expressed or referred to in this Agreement will
be construed to give any Person other than the parties to this Agreement any
legal or equitable right, remedy, or claim under or with respect to this
Agreement or any provision of this Agreement. This Agreement and all of its
provisions and conditions are for the sole and exclusive benefit of the parties
to this Agreement and their successors and assigns.

                                       49
<PAGE>

         12.11    Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is held
invalid or unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction, the other
provisions of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect. Any provision
of this Agreement held invalid or unenforceable only in part or degree will
remain in full force and effect to the extent not held invalid or unenforceable.

         12.12    Time of Essence. With regard to all dates and time periods set
forth or referred to in this Agreement, time is of the essence.

         12.13    Governing Law. This Agreement and all the transactions
contemplated hereby, and all disputes between the parties under or related to
this Agreement or the facts and circumstances leading to its execution, whether
in contract, tort or otherwise, will be governed by and construed in accordance
with the laws of the State of California without regard to conflicts of laws
principles.

         12.14    Equitable Remedies. In addition to legal remedies, to the
extent allowed pursuant to this Agreement or by law, in recognition of the fact
that remedies at law may not be sufficient, the parties hereto (and their
successors) shall be entitled to equitable remedies including, without
limitation, specific performance and injunction.

         12.15    Effect of Amendment or Waiver. Each Seller acknowledges that
by operation of Sections 5.10 and 12.8, the Sellers' Representatives will have
the right and power to diminish or eliminate rights of such Sellers under this
Agreement.

         12.16    Opportunity to Consult Counsel. Each Seller acknowledges that
such Seller has had full and adequate opportunity to have this Agreement
reviewed by such Seller's independent counsel and to discuss this Agreement with
such counsel.

         12.17    Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, each of which will be deemed to be an original copy of this
Agreement and all of which, when taken together, will be deemed to constitute
one and the same agreement.
