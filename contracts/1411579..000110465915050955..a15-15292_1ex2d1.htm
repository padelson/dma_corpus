(ii) the twelve (12) month anniversary of the Closing, an additional
$5,726,666 (less the amount of all Resolved Claims and all Pending Claims)
shall be released to the Representative for further distribution to the
Sellers in accordance with their Percentage Interests; and (iii) the eighteen
(18) month anniversary of the Closing the funds remaining in the Escrow
Account (less the amount of all Pending Claims) shall be released to the

the Escrow Account subject to release at such date shall be disbursed to the
Representative and/or Buyer in accordance with the resolution of such claims.

the Escrow Amount is actually distributed to the Sellers, interest may be
imputed on such amount, as required by Code Section 483 or 1274, (iii)

this Agreement shall be treated as installment obligations for purposes of
Code Section 453, and (iv) in no event shall the aggregate payments under the
Escrow Agreement to the Sellers exceed $18,898,000. Clause (iv) of the
preceding sentence is intended to ensure that the right of Sellers to the
Escrow Amount and any interest and earnings earned thereon is not treated as a
contingent payment without a stated maximum selling price under

hereto shall take any action or filing position inconsistent with the
foregoing.

Transaction Costs, which shall be paid by the Company on the Closing Date.

Capital Surplus or Closing Working Capital Deficiency, notwithstanding that
GAAP may require additional categories of current liabilities or current
assets to be included in a GAAP presentation of Working Capital. Following the
delivery of the Final Balance Sheet to the Representative, Buyer shall afford
the Representative and its representatives the opportunity to examine the

detail under the circumstances the basis of such objections), then the Closing
Indebtedness, Closing Working Capital Surplus or Closing Working Capital
Deficiency, as applicable, and the Final Cash Surplus as set forth in such
Final Balance Sheet shall be deemed final and conclusive and shall be **"Final
Indebtedness," "Final Working Capital Surplus"** or **"Final Working Capital
Deficiency,"** and the **"Final Cash Surplus,"** respectively. If the
Representative delivers an Objection Notice within such thirty (30) day
period, then Buyer and the Sellers shall endeavor in good faith to resolve the
objections, for a period not to exceed fifteen (15) days from the date of
delivery of the Objection Notice. If at the end of the fifteen (15) day period
there are any objections that remain in dispute, then the remaining objections
in dispute shall be submitted for resolution to a nationally recognized
accounting firm to be selected jointly by the Representative and Buyer within
the following five (5) days or, if the Sellers and Buyer are unable to
mutually agree within such five (5) day period, such accounting firm shall be

**"Referee"** ). The Referee shall determine Final Indebtedness, Final Working
Capital Surplus or Final Working Capital Deficiency, as applicable, and the
Final Cash Surplus, within thirty (30) days after the objections that remain
in dispute are submitted to it. If any such objections are submitted to the
Referee for resolution, (i) each party shall furnish to the Referee a report
with respect to such partyÂ’s positions with respect to the issues in the
Objection Notice, a copy of which shall be delivered to the other party
hereto, and no ex parte conferences, oral examinations, testimony,
depositions, discovery or other form of evidence gathering or hearings shall
be conducted or allowed, provided, that, at the RefereeÂ’s request, or as
mutually agreed by the parties, Buyer and the Representative may meet with the
Referee as long as representatives of both are present; (ii) to the extent
that a value has been assigned to any objection that remains in

 



      
 

 



 

dispute, the Referee shall not assign a value to such objection that is
greater than the greatest value for such objection claimed by either party or
less than the smallest value for such objection claimed by either party; (iii)
the determination by the Referee of Final Indebtedness, Final Working Capital
Surplus or Final Working Capital Deficiency, as applicable, and Final Cash
Surplus as set forth in a written notice delivered to both parties by the
Referee, shall be made solely in accordance with the written reports (i.e.,
not on independent review) and in accordance with this Agreement and shall be
binding and conclusive on the parties absent manifest error and shall
constitute an arbitral award that is final, binding and unappealable and upon
which a judgment may be entered by a court having jurisdiction thereof; and
(iv) fifty percent (50%) of the fees and expenses of the Referee shall be paid
by Buyer and the remaining fifty percent (50%) of the fees and expenses of the
Referee shall be paid by the Representative on behalf of the Sellers.

credit to the Sellers in accordance with their respective Percentage
Interests), within ten (10) days of any final determination. To the extent the
Final Cash Surplus is less than the Estimated Cash Surplus (such deficiency,
the **"Final Cash Deficiency"** ), the Representative and the Buyer shall
within ten (10) days of such final determination, sign a joint written
instruction letter to the Escrow Agent directing Escrow Agent to pay such
Final Cash Deficiency to Buyer. For Tax purposes, any payment under this
**Section 2.05(c)** shall be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price

Adjustment Amount, such excess (the **"Final Adjustment Surplus"** ) shall be
paid by the Company to the Representative (for further credit to the Sellers
in accordance with their respective Percentage Interest), within ten (10) days
of any such final determination. To the extent that the Final Adjustment
Amount is less than the Closing Adjustment Amount (such deficiency, the
**"Final Adjustment Deficiency"** ), the Representative and Buyer shall within
ten (10) days of such final determination, sign a joint written instruction
letter to the Escrow Agent directing the Escrow Agent to pay such Final
Adjustment Deficiency to Buyer. For Tax purposes, any payment under this

shall, or shall cause the Company to, prepare and file, on a timely basis and
on a basis consistent with past practice, all Tax Returns that are required to
be filed by any of the Acquired Companies (taking account of extensions) prior
to the Closing Date and shall cause the Company to pay all Taxes with respect
thereto.

 



 

(ii) The parties hereto acknowledge that the taxable year of the Company shall
end as of 11:59 p.m. on the Closing Date for federal income Tax purposes (and
to the extent applicable, for state income Tax purposes as well). The
Representative shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be
filed all U.S. federal and state income Tax Returns for the Acquired Companies
for all periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date that are required to be
filed after the Closing Date ( **"Pre Closing Tax Returns"** ). Buyer shall,
and shall cause the Acquired Companies to, authorize and direct their

the Representative pursuant to this **Section 5.05(a)(ii)**; provided that
such Tax Returns comply with Law and are consistent with past practices. Buyer
shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed all other
Tax Returns. Any Tax Return required to be filed with respect to the Acquired
Companies relating to the period that includes (but does not end on) the
Closing Date shall be submitted (with copies of any relevant schedules, work
papers and other documentation then available) to the Representative for the
RepresentativeÂ’s approval not less than thirty (30) days prior to the due date
for the filing of such Tax Return, which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed. The Representative shall have the option of providing to
Buyer, at any time at least fifteen (15) days prior to the date such Tax
Return is due to be filed (taking into account any valid extensions), written
instructions as to how the Representative wants any, or all, of the items for
which the Sellers may be liable reflected on such Tax Return; provided that
such Tax Returns comply with Law and are

 



      
 

 



 

consistent with past practices. Buyer shall, in preparing such Tax Return,
cause the items for which the Sellers are liable hereunder to be reflected in
accordance with the RepresentativeÂ’s proper instructions in accordance with
this Agreement and, in the absence of having received such instructions, in
accordance with past practice of the Acquired Companies, if any, to the extent
permissible under applicable Laws.

 



 

(iii) For purposes of this **Section 5.05**, in the case of any Taxes that
are imposed on a periodic basis and are payable for a Tax period that includes
(but does not end on) the Closing Date, the portion of such Tax which relates
to the portion of such Tax period ending on the Closing Date shall (x) in the
case of any Taxes other than Taxes based upon or related to income, gains or
receipts, be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire Tax period
multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days in the
Tax period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the
number of days in the entire Tax period, and (y) in the case of any Tax based
upon or related to income, gains or receipts (including sales and use Taxes),
or employment or payroll Taxes, be deemed equal to the amount which would be
payable if the relevant Tax period ended on the Closing Date. Any credits
relating to a Tax period that begins before and ends after the Closing Date
shall be taken into account as though the relevant Tax period ended on the
Closing Date. All determinations necessary to give effect to the foregoing
allocations shall be made in a manner consistent with reasonable prior
practice of the Acquired Companies. The Acquired Companies will prepare or
cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed, and cause their Affiliates
to prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed, all Tax
Returns in a manner consistent with the provisions of this **Section
5.05(a)**.

payment of bonuses, any other Company Transaction Cost in respect of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be included as deductions of
the Acquired Companies in the relevant Tax Returns for the taxable period
ending as of the Closing Date.

 



 

(b) Subject only to the specific limitations of this **Section 5.05(b)**,
**Section 5.05(e)** and **Section 7.04** hereof, each Seller, severally but
not jointly in accordance with its Percentage Interest, agrees to indemnify
and hold harmless Buyer from and against, and to reimburse and pay Buyer as
incurred with respect to, any and all Losses attributable to liabilities of
the Acquired Companies for Taxes attributable to Tax periods (or portions
thereof) ending on or before the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that
(i) the Sellers shall be liable for Taxes only to the extent that such Taxes
were not included as Current Liabilities in calculating the CompanyÂ’s Working
Capital and taken into account in determining the amount of the Purchase Price
pursuant to **Article II**, (ii) the Sellers shall have no liability for any
Taxes or Losses with respect to Taxes that are attributable to any transaction
outside the ordinary course of business of the Acquired Companies entered into
by Buyer or its Affiliates or at the direction of Buyer or its Affiliates that
occurs on the Closing Date after the Closing, (iii) the Sellers shall have no
liability to Buyer for any Taxes or Losses attributable to Taxes with respect
to any Tax period or portion of a Tax period beginning after the Closing Date,

Losses attributable to Taxes shall be paid and satisfied solely from the
Escrow Account as set forth in **Section 7.04**. Within five (5) days after

deliver a joint written direction to the Escrow Agent to release to Buyer from
the Escrow Account an amount equal to the Taxes shown

 



      
 

 



 

as due and owing on such Pre Closing Tax Return. The SellersÂ’ indemnification
obligations under this **Section 5.05(b)** are referred to herein as the "Tax
Indemnity." Buyer shall have no right to any Tax Indemnity if any Losses are
the result of actions of Buyer or its Affiliates. The SellersÂ’ indemnification
obligations under this **Section 5.05** shall survive until the eighteen (18)
month anniversary of the Closing.

 



 

(c) Buyer shall inform the Representative of the commencement of any audit,
examination or proceeding ("Tax Contest") relating in whole or in part to
Taxes for which Buyer may be entitled to indemnity from the Sellers hereunder.
With respect to any Tax Contest for which the Sellers acknowledge in writing
that the Sellers are liable under **Section 5.05(c)** for all Losses relating
thereto, the Sellers shall be entitled to control, in good faith, all
proceedings taken in connection with such Tax Contest; _provided_ , _however_
, that (x) the Representative shall promptly notify Buyer in writing of its
intention to control such Tax Contest, (y) in the case of a Tax Contest
relating to Taxes of any of the Acquired Companies for a Tax period beginning
before and ending after the Closing Date, the Representative and Buyer shall
jointly control all proceedings taken in connection with any such Tax Contest,
and (z) if any Tax Contest could reasonably be expected to have an adverse
effect on Buyer or any of the Acquired Companies in any Tax period beginning
after the Closing Date, the Tax Contest shall not be settled or resolved
without BuyerÂ’s consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed. The failure of Buyer to give reasonably prompt notice of any Tax
Contest shall release the SellersÂ’ obligations only to the extent SellersÂ’
rights are actually prejudiced. Buyer and the Company shall use their
reasonable efforts to provide the Representative with such assistance as may
be reasonably requested by the Representative in connection with a Tax Contest
controlled solely or jointly by the Representative.

 



 

(d) Except as required by applicable Laws, without the prior written consent
of the Sellers (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned), none of Buyer, the Acquired Companies, or any Affiliate of Buyer
shall file any amended Tax Return with respect to any Tax period ending on or
before the Closing Date.

 



 

(e) All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration, value added
and other such Taxes and fees (including any penalties and interest) incurred
in connection with this Agreement (including any real property transfer Tax
and any other similar Tax) shall be borne and paid by Buyer when due. Buyer
shall, at its own expense, timely file any Tax Return or other document with
respect to such Taxes or fees.

 



 

 **Section 5.06** **[Reserved].**

 



 

 **Section 5.07** **Director and Officer Indemnification and Insurance.**

 



 

(a) Buyer agrees that all rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses
and exculpation by the Acquired Companies now existing in favor of each Person
who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date hereof or who becomes
prior to the Closing Date, an officer or director of any of the Acquired
Companies, as provided in the certificate of formation, bylaws or company
agreement of the applicable Acquired Company, in each case as in effect on the
date hereof, or pursuant to any other agreements in effect on the Closing Date
and disclosed in **Section 5.07(a)** of the Disclosure Schedules, shall
survive the Closing Date and shall continue in

 



      
 

 



 

full force and effect in accordance with their respective terms for a period
of six (6) years after the Closing Date.

 



 

(b) The Acquired Companies shall, and Buyer shall cause the Acquired Companies
to, obtain as of the Closing Date "tail" insurance policies with a claims
period of six (6) years from the Closing Date with at least the same coverage
and amounts, and containing terms and conditions that are not less
advantageous to the directors and officers of the Acquired Companies, in each
case with respect to claims arising out of or relating to events which
occurred on or prior to the Closing Date (including in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement).

 



 

(c) Effective as of the Closing, Buyer and the Company waive any claim
relating to and agree not to and to not permit any of their respective
Affiliates to bring any action asserting, any breach of fiduciary duty or any
breach of any other duty owed to any of the Acquired Companies against any
former director, officer, employee, partner, Seller or other representative or
Affiliate of the Company, whether such action is filed derivatively on behalf
of the Company or otherwise.

 



 

(d) The obligations of Buyer and the Company under this **Section 5.07**
shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect
any director or officer to whom this **Section 5.07** applies without the
consent of such affected director or officer (it being expressly agreed that
the directors and officers to whom this **Section 5.07** applies shall be
third-party beneficiaries of this **Section 5.07**, each of whom may enforce
the provisions of this **Section 5.07**).

 



 

(e) In the event Buyer, any Acquired Company or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving entity in such consolidation or
merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets
to any Person, then, and in either such case, proper provision shall be made
so that the successors and assigns of Buyer or the Acquired Companies, as the
case may be, shall assume all of the obligations set forth in this **Section
5.07**.

 



 

 **Section 5.08** **Confidentiality**. From and after the Closing for a
period of three (3) years, Representative and each Seller shall and shall
cause their respective Affiliates and representatives to keep confidential all
Confidential Information, except to the extent required by applicable Law and
except that the Sellers may disclose such information to their respective
employees, accountants, advisors, limited partners and other representatives
as necessary in connection with the ordinary conduct of their respective
businesses (so long as such Persons agree to or are bound by contract or duty
to keep such information confidential). The parties hereby agree that the
Confidentiality Agreement shall survive the execution and delivery hereof and
terminate automatically effective upon Closing. If this Agreement is, for any
reason, terminated prior to Closing, the Confidentiality Agreement shall
nonetheless continue in full force and effect. Buyer acknowledges and confirms
that any press release issued in accordance with **Section 5.12** shall not
violate any provision of this **Section 5.08**.

 



      
 

 



 

 **Section 5.09** **Governmental Approvals and Other Third-Party Consents.**

 



 

(a) Each party hereto shall, as promptly as possible, use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain, or cause to be obtained, all consents,
authorizations, orders and approvals from all Governmental Authorities that
may be or become necessary for the performance of its obligations pursuant to
this Agreement. Each party shall cooperate fully with the other party and its
Affiliates in promptly seeking to obtain all such consents, authorizations,
orders and approvals. The parties hereto shall not willfully take any action
that will have the effect of delaying, impairing or impeding the receipt of
any required consents, authorizations, orders and approvals. If required by
the HSR Act, each party hereto agrees to make an appropriate filing pursuant
to the HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
as promptly as practicable, which filing shall request early termination of
the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act, and to supply as promptly as
practicable to the appropriate Governmental Authority any additional
information and documentary material that may be requested pursuant to the HSR
Act. Buyer agrees that all filing fees under the HSR Act (whether imposed on
Buyer, Sellers or any other Persons pursuant to the HSR Act) shall be borne
exclusively by Buyer.

 



 

(b) Without limiting the generality of BuyerÂ’s undertaking pursuant to this
**Section 5.09**, Buyer agrees to use its best efforts and to take any and
all steps necessary to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any
antitrust, competition or trade regulation Law that may be asserted by any
Governmental Authority or any other party so as to enable the parties hereto
to close the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as
possible, including proposing, negotiating, committing to and effecting, by
consent decree, hold separate orders, or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or
disposition of any of its assets, properties or businesses or of the assets,
properties or businesses to be acquired by it pursuant to this Agreement as
are required to be divested in order to avoid the entry of, or to effect the
dissolution of, any injunction, temporary restraining order or other order in
any suit or proceeding, which would otherwise have the effect of delaying or
preventing the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer shall not be required to take
any actions that would or would be reasonably expected to result in a
Regulatory Material Adverse Effect. In addition, Buyer shall use its best
efforts to defend through litigation on the merits any claim asserted in court
by any party in order to avoid entry of, or to have vacated or terminated, any
Governmental Order (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) that would
prevent the Closing.

 



 

(c) All analyses, appearances, meetings, discussions, presentations,
memoranda, briefs, filings, arguments, and proposals made by or on behalf of
either party before any Governmental Authority or the staff or regulators of
any Governmental Authority, in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereunder (but, for the avoidance of doubt, not including any interactions
between the Acquired Companies or Buyer and Governmental Authorities in the
ordinary course of business, any disclosure which is not permitted by Law or
any disclosure containing confidential information) shall, where practical, be
disclosed to the other party hereunder or its legal counsel in advance of any
filing, submission or attendance, it being the intent that the parties will
consult and cooperate with one another, and consider in good faith the views
of one another, in connection with any such analyses, appearances, meetings,
discussions, presentations, memoranda, briefs, filings, arguments, and
proposals. Each party shall, where

 



      
 

 



 

practical, give notice to the other party with respect to any meeting,
discussion, appearance or contact with any Governmental Authority or the staff
or regulators of any Governmental Authority, with such notice being sufficient
to provide the other party with the opportunity to attend and participate in
such meeting, discussion, appearance or contact.

 



 

(d) The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to give all notices
to, and obtain all consents from, all third parties that are listed in
**Section 3.08** of the Disclosure Schedules, including, without limitation,
the Store Lender Consent, and to obtain all consents and agreements from third
parties necessary to facilitate or obtain any Governmental Approval required
to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided,
however, that neither the Company nor Sellers shall be obligated to pay any
material consideration therefor to any third party from whom consent or
approval is requested. As soon as practical after the date hereof, and in all
events prior to Closing, the Company shall use all commercially reasonable
efforts to secure the Lender Consent (as defined therein) required under that
certain First Amendment to Lease by and between Store SPE Starplex, LLC, as
Lessor, and Starplex Operating, LLC, as Lessee, in order to cause that First
Amendment to Lease to be effective in a form and upon terms reasonably
acceptable to Buyer (the " _Store Lender Consent_ ").

 



 

 **Section 5.10** **Access to Information; Cooperation; Books and Records.**

 



 

(a) From the date hereof until Closing, the Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to (i) afford Buyer and its representatives reasonable access,
during normal business hours and upon reasonable notice, to the offices,
properties, plants, other facilities, books and records of the Acquired
Companies and to those representatives of the Acquired Companies who have any
knowledge relating to any Acquired Company, (ii) furnish to Buyer and its
representatives such financial and operating data and other information
relating to the Acquired Companies as such Persons may reasonably request and
(iii) cooperate with Buyer in its investigation of the Acquired Companies.

 



 

(b) From and after the Closing Date, Buyer shall (and shall cause the Acquired
Companies to), during normal business hours and upon reasonable notice, make
available and provide the Representative, each Seller and their respective
representatives (including, without limitation, counsel and independent
auditors) with access to the facilities and properties of the Acquired
Companies and to all information, files, documents and records (written and
computer) relating to the Acquired Companies or any of their businesses or
operations for any and all periods prior to and including the Closing Date
that they may reasonably require with respect to any reasonable business
purpose (including, without limitation, any matter pursuant to **Section
5.05** and **Section 7.05**) or in connection with any claim, dispute,
action, cause of action, investigation or proceeding of any kind by or against
any Person, and shall (and shall cause the Acquired Companies) to cooperate
fully with the Representative, the Sellers and their respective
representatives (including counsel and independent auditors) in connection
with the foregoing, at the sole cost and expense of Buyer, the Company and its
Subsidiaries, as applicable, including, without limitation, by making tax,
accounting and financial personnel and other appropriate employees and
officers of the Acquired Companies available to the Representative, the
Sellers and their respective representatives (including counsel and
independent auditors), with regard to any reasonable business purpose.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Representative and the Sellers shall not
have access to any information protected by the attorney-client privilege or
other

 



      
 

 



 

applicable privilege or to personnel records of any Acquired Company relating
to individual performance or evaluation records, medical histories or other
information that in BuyerÂ’s good faith opinion is sensitive or the disclosure
of which could subject any Acquired Company to risk of liability; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Representative and the Sellers shall not be prohibited
from accessing such information pursuant to a valid court order.

 



 

(c) For a period of seven (7) years after the Closing Date or such other
longer period as required by applicable Laws, Buyer shall preserve and retain
in accordance with its document retention policies and procedures, all
corporate, accounting, legal, auditing, human resources and other books and
records of the Acquired Companies relating to the conduct of the business and
operations of the Acquired Companies prior to the Closing Date.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, during such seven-year period, Buyer may
dispose of any such books and records which are offered to, but not accepted
by, the Representative.

 



 

 **Section 5.11** **Closing Conditions**. From the date hereof until Closing,
each party hereto shall use commercially reasonable efforts to take such
actions as are necessary to expeditiously satisfy the Closing conditions for
such party set forth in **Article VI**.

 



 

 **Section 5.12** **Public Announcements**. Unless otherwise required by
applicable Law or the rules of any applicable stock exchange, no party to this
Agreement shall make any public announcements in respect of this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby or otherwise communicate with any news
media without the prior written consent of Buyer and the Representative. Buyer
and the Representative shall cooperate as to the timing and contents of a
mutually acceptable public announcement in connection with the signing of this
Agreement and the Closing. Nothing contained herein shall limit the Buyer or
its Affiliates from holding conference calls or discussions with analysts
regarding this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby after the
parties have issued a press release announcing the execution of this
Agreement.

 



 

 **Section 5.13** **Further Assurances**. Following the Closing, each of the
parties hereto shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, execute
and deliver such additional documents, instruments, conveyances and
assurances, and take such further actions as may be reasonably required to
carry out the provisions hereof and give effect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

 **Section 5.14** **Seller Releases**. Effective as of the Closing, each
Seller, on such SellerÂ’s own behalf and on behalf of such SellerÂ’s past,
present and future agents, attorneys, administrators, heirs, executors,
spouses, trustees, beneficiaries, representatives, successors and assigns
claiming by or through such Seller, hereby absolutely, unconditionally and
irrevocably RELEASES and FOREVER DISCHARGES each of the Acquired Companies,
and their respective past, present and future directors, managers, members,
shareholders, officers, employees, agents, subsidiaries, affiliates,
attorneys, representatives, successors and assigns, from the following: all
claims (including any derivative claim on behalf of any Person), actions,
causes of action, suits, arbitrations, proceedings, debts, liabilities,
obligations, sums of money, accounts, covenants, contracts, controversies,
agreements, promises, damages, fees, expenses, judgments, executions,
indemnification rights, claims and demands arising out, relating to, against
or in any way connected with any of the Acquired Companies, in respect of any
and all

 



       
 

 



 

agreements, liabilities or obligations entered into or incurred on or prior to
the Closing Date, or in respect of any action taken or event occurring or
circumstances existing on or prior to the Closing Date, whether or not
relating to claims pending on, or asserted after, the Closing Date; provided,
however, that the foregoing release does not extend to, include or restrict or
limit in any way, and each Seller hereby reserves such SellerÂ’s rights, if
any, and the right of the other Sellers, if any, (a) to pursue (or cause or
permit to be pursued by the Representative) any and all claims, actions or
rights that such Seller may now or in future have solely on account of rights
of such Seller under this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or any other
documents entered into in connection herewith or therewith, (b) to receive
payments of any unpaid accrued payroll, accrued bonuses, severance benefits,
vacation and similar benefits (including unpaid business expense
reimbursement) exiting as of the Closing Date, (c) its rights to receive the
Purchase Price including its portion of the Escrow Amount, (d) any other claim
that may arise in the future based on events or circumstances occurring in the
future, (e) its rights to be indemnified under the certificate of formation or
bylaws, or other similar governing documents, of an Acquired Company and (f)
the rights under this **Section 5.14**; provided, further, the release and
discharge provided above is given merely in each such SellerÂ’s capacity as an
equityholder of the Acquired Companies and not, in any event, as a lender or
creditor to, or as an administrative or collateral agent for any group of
lenders or creditors to, any of the Acquired Companies.

 



 

 **Section 5.15** **Non-Competition; Non-Solicitation.**

 



 

(a) As an inducement for Buyer to enter into this Agreement, each of the four
Sellers with the largest ownership interests in the Company, including Trinity
Hunt Partners III, L.P. (each, a **"Restricted Seller"** ), agrees that, until
the fifth (5th) anniversary of the Closing Date, such Restricted Seller and
his or its Affiliates shall not, directly or indirectly: (i) acquire, own,
have an equity interest in, lend money to, manage, control or participate in
the ownership, management or control of, or consult with, advise or provide
any other services for compensation to, any Person engaged, directly or
indirectly, in any Competitive Business, anywhere within a ten (10) mile
radius of any theater operated by any Acquired Company as of the Closing Date,
provided, that, the foregoing shall not prohibit (x) any Restricted Seller or
his or its Affiliates from owning a passive investment of two percent (2%) or
less of the outstanding equity of any publicly traded company and (y) Steve
Holmes from continuing to own a passive investment of up to seventeen percent
(17%) of Picture Shows Entertainment; or (ii) solicit or attempt to divert the
business of any supplier of any Acquired Company as of the Closing Date;
provided, however, that the foregoing shall not restrict the solicitation of
any such supplier to the extent such solicitation is conducted by or on behalf
of a Person that is not involved in a Competitive Business.

 



 

(b) As an inducement for Buyer to enter into this Agreement, the Sellers agree
that, until the second (2nd) anniversary of the Closing Date, none of the
Sellers nor any of their Affiliates shall, directly or indirectly: (i) solicit
for employment or hire any director, officer or employee of any Acquired
Company; or (ii) induce or encourage any director, officer or employee of any
Acquired Company to terminate his or her employment with such Acquired
Company; provided that nothing in this **Section 5.15(b)** shall prevent any
Person from placing general advertisements or solicitations that are not
targeted toward employees of the Acquired Companies.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) The Sellers acknowledge that the covenants of the Sellers set forth in
this **Section 5.15** are an essential element of this Agreement and that any
breach of any provision of this **Section 5.15** will result in irreparable
injury to Buyer. The Sellers acknowledge that in the event of such a breach,
in addition to all other remedies available at law, Buyer shall be entitled to
equitable relief, including injunctive relief, as well as such other damages
as may be appropriate. The Sellers have independently consulted with their
counsel and after such consultation agree that the covenants set forth in this
**Section 5.15** are reasonable and proper to protect the legitimate interest
of Buyer.

 



 

(d) If a court of competent jurisdiction determines that the character,
duration or geographical scope of the provisions of this **Section 5.15** are
unreasonable, it is the intention and the agreement of the parties that these
provisions shall be construed by the court in such a manner as to impose only
those restrictions on the SellersÂ’ conduct that are reasonable in light of the
circumstances and as are necessary to assure to Buyer the benefits of this
Agreement. If, in any judicial proceeding, a court shall refuse to enforce all
of the separate covenants of this **Section 5.15** because taken together
they are more extensive than necessary to assure to Buyer the intended
benefits of this Agreement, it is expressly understood and agreed by the
parties that the provisions hereof that, if eliminated, would permit the
remaining separate provisions to be enforced in such proceeding, shall be
deemed eliminated from this Agreement.

 



 

 **Section 5.16** **Facility Repairs**. Prior to Closing, the Company agrees
that it will use, and cause its Subsidiaries to use, commercially reasonable
efforts to complete all repairs listed on _Schedule III_ attached hereto (the
**"Theater Repairs"** ). As soon as reasonably practicable after the date
hereof, the Company and Buyer shall engage, at the CompanyÂ’s cost, an
independent inspection firm selected by Buyer (the **"Inspection Firm"** ) to
inspect the theaters for the repairs enumerated as Items 1-4, 7, 8, 9 and 15
listed on _Schedule III_ (the **"Major Repairs"** ) and to determine the
scope of the work needed to complete each Major Repair and the cost of such
work. Following each such inspection, the Company and Buyer will mutually
agree upon a plan of remediation and the cost for each Major Repair (the
**"Agreed Remediation Plan"** ); provided the cost of each Major Repair shall
not exceed the amount set forth in the "Total" column on _Schedule III_ for
such repair. Once the Agreed Remediation Plan is established, the Company
shall undertake the repairs of such theaters in accordance with the Agreed
Remediation Plan. In addition, the Company shall, as soon as reasonably
practical after the date hereof, undertake the repairs enumerated as Items 5,
6 and 10-14 listed on **Schedule III** (the **"Other Repairs"** ). To the
extent any Theater Repairs are not completed prior to Closing, (x) in
accordance with the Agreed Remediation Plan as certified by the Inspection
Firm for each Major Repair or (y) to the reasonable satisfaction of Buyer for
the Other Repairs (each, an "Incomplete Repair" and collectively, the
**"Incomplete Repairs"** ), the parties hereto agree that an amount equal to
(i) the maximum cost of remediation set forth in the "Total" column on
_Schedule III_ related to each Incomplete Repair that is an Other Repair, and
(ii) the lesser of the amount set forth in the Agreed Remediation Plan or the
"Total" column on _Schedule III_ related to each Incomplete Repair that is a
Major Repair (the **"Repair Amount"** ) shall be added to the Escrow Amount
and held in the Escrow Account pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement,
solely for the purpose of providing funds to complete the Incomplete Repairs.
After Closing, Buyer shall supply to the Representative customary
documentation of the expenditures made by Buyer after the Closing to complete
the Incomplete Repairs (the **"Documentation"** ). Within five (5) Business
Days after Buyer delivers the Documentation for each Incomplete Repair to the

 



      
 

 



 

Representative, Buyer and the Representative shall submit joint written
instructions to the Escrow Agent authorizing the Escrow Agent to release to
Buyer an amount equal to the lesser of (i) the actual amount spent by Buyer
after the Closing to complete the Incomplete Repair, and (ii) the maximum cost
of remediation set forth in the "Total" column on Schedule III applicable to
each such Incomplete Repair (or if the Incomplete Repair was a Major Repair
and an amount equal to the amount set forth in the Agreed Remediation Plan was
deposited in the Escrow Account, the amount set forth in the Agreed
Remediation Plan). Buyer specifically acknowledges the terms of this **Section
5.16** and agrees that (x) the condition of the theaters requiring the Theater
Repairs is not a breach of any representation or warranty of the Company or
the Sellers hereunder, (y) the condition of the theaters requiring the Theater
Repairs does not constitute, and will not be taken into account in
determining, a Material Adverse Effect and (z) the failure of the Company and
its Subsidiaries to complete all Theater Repairs is not a condition of BuyerÂ’s
obligation to consummate the Closing.

Closing Date other than those which by their terms contemplate performance
after the Closing Date, and each such surviving covenant and agreement shall
survive the Closing for the period contemplated by its terms. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, any claims asserted in good faith with reasonable specificity
and in writing by notice including the amount of such claim and the basis for
such claim hereunder from the non-breaching party to the breaching party prior
to the expiration date of the applicable survival period shall not thereafter
be barred by the expiration of such survival period and such claims shall
survive until they are finally resolved or become Dormant.

 



 

 **Section 7.02** **Indemnification By Sellers.**

 



 

(a) Subject to the other terms and conditions of this **Article VII**, each
Seller (on a several basis, and not jointly and severally with the other
Sellers, based on such SellerÂ’s Percentage Interest) shall, following the
Closing, indemnify Buyer against, and shall hold Buyer harmless from and
against, any and all Losses incurred or sustained by, or imposed upon, Buyer
based upon, arising out of, with respect to or by reason of:

 



      
 

 



 

(i) any breach of any of the representations or warranties of the Acquired
Companies contained in this Agreement;

 



 

(ii) any breach of any covenant, agreement or obligation to be performed by
the Acquired Companies pursuant to this Agreement; or

 



 

(iii) the Tax Indemnity.

 



 

(b) Subject to the other terms and conditions of this **Article VII**, each
Seller (on an individual basis, and not jointly and severally with others)
shall indemnify Buyer against, and shall hold Buyer harmless from and against,
any and all Losses incurred or sustained by, or imposed upon, Buyer based
upon, arising out of, with respect to or by reason of:

 



 

(i) any breach of the Several Representations of such Seller; or

 



 

(ii) any breach of any covenant, agreement or obligation to be performed by
such Seller pursuant to this Agreement.

 



 

 **Section 7.03** **Indemnification By Buyer**. Subject to the other terms
and conditions of this **Article VII**, Buyer shall indemnify the Sellers
against, and shall hold the Sellers harmless from and against, any and all
Losses incurred or sustained by, or imposed upon, any Seller based upon,
arising out of, with respect to or by reason of:

 



 

(a) any breach of any of the representations or warranties of Buyer contained
in this Agreement; or

 



 

(b) any breach of any covenant, agreement or obligation to be performed by
Buyer pursuant to this Agreement.

 



 

 **Section 7.04** **Certain Limitations**. Any party making a claim under
this **Article VII** is referred to as an **"Indemnified Party,"** and the
party against whom such claims are asserted under this **Article VII** is
referred to as the **"Indemnifying Party."** The indemnification provided for
in **Section 5.05(b)** and **Article VII** shall be subject to the following
limitations:

 



 

(a) The Sellers shall not be liable to an Indemnified Party for
indemnification under **Section 7.02(a)(i)** and **(ii)** until the
aggregate amount of all Losses in respect of indemnification under **Section
7.02(a)(i)** and **(ii)** exceeds 0.75% of the Base Purchase Price (the
**"Deductible"** ), in which event Sellers shall only be required to pay or be
liable for Losses in excess of the Deductible; provided that the Deductible
shall not apply to any Losses as result of a breach of the Several
Representations or the Fundamental Representations or resulting from Fraud.

 



 

(b) Subject to the other limitations imposed by this **Article VII**, all
claims against the Sellers for indemnification under this Agreement, including
any claims for the Tax Indemnity and claims under **Article VII**, shall be
paid and satisfied solely from the Escrow Account, to the extent of any funds
then remaining therein; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) Losses resulting
from the common law liability of any Seller to Buyer for fraud in the event of
a final determination by a court of competent jurisdiction that any Seller
committed fraud against Buyer ( **"Fraud"** ), and (ii) Losses resulting from
the indemnification provisions of **Section 7.02(b)**, in each case, shall

 



      
 

 



 

not be satisfied from the Escrow Account but, instead, Buyer may recover such
Losses directly from the offending Seller.

 



 

(c) Each SellerÂ’s maximum liability hereunder for any indemnification claims
for the Several Representations or for any SellerÂ’s Fraud shall not, when
aggregated with all other indemnification obligations hereunder, exceed the
portion of the Purchase Price actually received by such Seller.

 



 

(d) Payments by an Indemnifying Party pursuant to **Section 5.05(b)** or
**Article VII** in respect of any Loss shall be limited to the amount of any
liability or damage that remains after deducting therefrom any insurance
proceeds and any indemnity, contribution or other similar payment actually
received by the Indemnified Party (or an Acquired Company) in respect of any
such claim. The Indemnified Party shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to recover under other insurance policies for any Losses prior to
seeking indemnification under this Agreement. In the event any Indemnifying
Party pays any indemnification amount to an Indemnified Party, and such
Indemnified Party then receives an insurance payment, or other indemnity or
contribution payment, then such Indemnified Party shall promptly repay to such
Indemnifying Party a refund equal to the aggregate amount of such recovery but
not in excess of the amount previously paid by such Indemnifying Party to such
Indemnified Party for the indemnification claim.

 



 

(e) Each Indemnified Party shall take, and cause its Affiliates to take, all
reasonable steps to mitigate any Loss upon becoming aware of any event or
circumstance that would be reasonably expected to, or does, give rise to an
indemnification obligation hereunder; _provided_ , _however_ , that no
Indemnified Party or its Affiliates shall be required to make any material
monetary expenditure, commence or participate in any proceeding, offer or
grant any material accommodation to any Person, or take, or refrain from
taking, any action that would or would reasonably be expected to adversely
affect the business, operations, results or condition (financial or otherwise)
of such Indemnified Party or its Affiliates in any material respect in
connection with such mitigation.

 



 

(f) No Seller shall have any liability with respect to either Fraud or a
breach of any of the Several Representations by any other Seller, and Buyer
agrees not to seek recovery against a Seller with respect to either Fraud or a
breach of the Several Representations by another Seller.

 



 

(g) Notwithstanding anything contained elsewhere in this Agreement, the amount
of any Loss subject to indemnification under **Section 7.02** shall be
calculated net of any amounts to the extent, but only to the extent,
specifically reflected or reserved for in the Financial Statements or the
Final Balance Sheet and taken into account in determining the amount of the
Purchase Price pursuant to **Article II**.

 



 

(h) In no event shall any Indemnifying Party be liable to any Indemnified
Party for any punitive, incidental, consequential, special or indirect
damages, including loss of future revenue or income, loss of business
reputation or opportunity relating to the breach or alleged breach of this
Agreement, or diminution of value or any damages based on any type of multiple
(collectively, **"Excess Damages"** ); _provided_ , _however_ , this
limitation shall not be applicable to

 



      
 

 



 

indemnification claims for Excess Damages required to be paid to a third party
by an Indemnified Party as a result of a Third-Party Claim.

 



 

(i) If an Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification under more than one
clause or subclause of this Agreement with respect to Losses, then such
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to only one indemnification or recovery
for such Losses to the extent it arises out of the same set of circumstances
and events; it being understood that this **Section 7.04(j)** is solely to
preclude a duplicate recovery by an Indemnified Party (i.e., recovery in
excess of actual damages).

 



 

(j) Notwithstanding anything contained elsewhere in this Agreement, Buyer
shall not seek or be entitled to indemnification for any Losses based upon or
relating to the Theater Repairs or the Lease Amendments (including, without
limitation, any alleged breach of the representations and warranties in
**Section 3.10** solely related to either the CompanyÂ’s historical accounting
treatment of the Leases or the Lease Amendments).

 



 

 **Section 7.05** **Indemnification Procedures.**

 



 

(a) **Third-Party Claims.** If any Indemnified Party receives notice of the
assertion or commencement of any action, suit, claim or other legal proceeding
made or brought by any Person who is not a party to this Agreement or an
Affiliate of a party to this Agreement or a representative of the foregoing (a
**"Third-Party Claim"** ) against such Indemnified Party with respect to which
the Indemnifying Party is obligated to provide indemnification under this
Agreement, the Indemnified Party shall in good faith give the Indemnifying
Party prompt written notice thereof. The failure to give such prompt written
notice shall not, however, relieve the Indemnifying Party of its
indemnification obligations, except and only to the extent that the
Indemnifying Party is actually disadvantaged by such failure or delay or
forfeits rights or defenses by reason of such failure or delay. Such notice by
the Indemnified Party shall describe the Third-Party Claim in reasonable
detail, shall include copies of all material written evidence thereof and
shall indicate the estimated amount, if reasonably practicable, of the Loss
that has been or may be sustained by the Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying
Party shall have the right to participate in, or by giving written notice to
the Indemnified Party, to assume the defense of any Third-Party Claim at the
Indemnifying PartyÂ’s expense and by the Indemnifying PartyÂ’s own counsel, and
the Indemnified Party shall cooperate in good faith in such defense. In the
event that the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any Third-Party
Claim, subject to **Section 7.05(b)**, it shall have the right to take such
action as it deems necessary to avoid, dispute, defend or appeal pertaining to
any such Third-Party Claim in the name and on behalf of the Indemnified Party.
The Indemnified Party shall have the right, at its own cost and expense, to
participate in the defense of any Third-Party Claim with counsel selected by
it subject to the Indemnifying PartyÂ’s right to control the defense thereof.
If the Indemnifying Party elects not to compromise or defend such Third-Party
Claim or fails to promptly notify the Indemnified Party in writing of its
election to defend as provided in this Agreement, the Indemnified Party may,
subject to **Section 7.05(b)**, pay, compromise, defend such Third-Party
Claim and seek indemnification for any and all Losses based upon, arising from
or relating to such Third-Party Claim. The Sellers and Buyer shall cooperate
with each other in all reasonable respects in connection with the defense of
any Third-Party Claim, including making available (subject to the provisions
of **Section 5.09**) records relating to such Third-Party Claim and
furnishing, without expense (other

 



      
 

 



 

than reimbursement of actual out-of-pocket expenses) to the defending party,
management employees of the non-defending party as may be reasonably necessary
for the preparation of the defense of such Third-Party Claim.

 



 

(b) **Settlement of Third-Party Claims.** Notwithstanding any other provision
of this Agreement, the Indemnifying Party shall not agree to settle any Third-
Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), except as provided in
this **Section 7.05(b)**. If a firm offer is made to settle a Third-Party
Claim without leading to liability or the creation of a financial or other
obligation on the part of the Indemnified Party and provides, in customary
form, for the unconditional release of each Indemnified Party from all
liabilities and obligations in connection with such Third-Party Claim and the
Indemnifying Party desires to accept and agree to such offer, the Indemnifying
Party shall give written notice to that effect to the Indemnified Party. If
the Indemnified Party fails to consent to such firm offer within ten (10) days
after its receipt of such notice, the Indemnified Party may continue to
contest or defend such Third-Party Claim and in such event, the maximum
liability of the Indemnifying Party as to such Third-Party Claim shall not
exceed the amount of such settlement offer. If the Indemnified Party fails to
consent to such firm offer and also fails to assume the defense of such Third-
Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party may settle the Third-Party Claim upon the
terms set forth in such firm offer to settle such Third-Party Claim. If the
Indemnified Party has assumed the defense of a Third-Party Claim pursuant to
**Section 7.05(a)**, it shall not agree to any settlement thereof without the
written consent of the Indemnifying Party (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed).

 



 

(c) **Direct Claims.** Any claim by an Indemnified Party on account of a Loss
which does not result from a Third-Party Claim (a **"Direct Claim"** ) shall
be asserted in good faith by the Indemnified Party giving the Indemnifying
Party prompt written notice thereof. The failure to give such prompt written
notice shall not, however, relieve the Indemnifying Party of its
indemnification obligations, except and only to the extent that the
Indemnifying Party is actually disadvantaged by such failure or delay or
forfeits rights or defenses by reason of such failure or delay. Such notice by
the Indemnified Party shall describe the Direct Claim in reasonable detail,
shall include copies of all material written evidence thereof and shall
indicate the estimated amount, if reasonably practicable, of the Loss that has
been or may be sustained by the Indemnified Party.

 



 

(d) After any final judgment or decree has been rendered by any court of
competent jurisdiction, a settlement of a Third-Party Claim shall have been
consummated or Buyer and Representative have arrived at an agreement with
respect to an indemnification claim hereunder, then Buyer and Representative
shall promptly deliver a joint written direction to the Escrow Agent to
release amounts from the Escrow Account to Buyer to satisfy such
indemnification claim. A judgment or decree of a court of competent
jurisdiction shall be deemed final when the time for appeal, if any, shall
have expired and no appeal shall have been taken or when all appeals taken
have been finally determined.

 



 

 **Section 7.06** **Exclusive Remedies**. The parties acknowledge and agree
that their sole and exclusive remedy with respect to any and all monetary
claims for any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or
obligation set forth herein or otherwise relating to the subject matter of
this Agreement, shall be pursuant to the indemnification provisions set

 



      
 

 



 

forth in **Section 5.05(b)** and this **Article VII**. In furtherance of the
foregoing, each party hereby waives, to the fullest extent permitted under
Law, any and all rights, claims and causes of action for monetary damages for
any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or obligation
set forth herein or otherwise relating to the subject matter of this Agreement
it may have against the other parties hereto and their Affiliates and each of
their respective representatives arising under or based upon any Law, except
pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in **Section 5.05(b)**
and this **Article VII**. Without limiting the generality of the preceding
sentence, no legal action sounding in tort, statute or strict liability may be
maintained by any party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained
herein shall limit a partyÂ’s ability to bring a claim based upon Fraud.

 



 

 **ARTICLE VIII. 
TERMINATION**

 



 

 **Section 8.01** **Termination**. This Agreement may be terminated at any
time prior to Closing:

 



 

(a) by the mutual written consent of the Company and Buyer;

 



 

(b) by Buyer by written notice to the Company and Representative if:

 



 

(i) Buyer is not then in material breach of any provision of this Agreement
and there has been a breach, inaccuracy in or failure to perform any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made by any Seller, the
Representative or the Company pursuant to this Agreement that would give rise
to the failure of any of the conditions specified in **Article VI** and such
breach, inaccuracy or failure cannot be cured by such Seller, the
Representative or the Company by the Outside Date;

 



 

(ii) any of the conditions set forth in **Section 6.01** or **Section 6.02**
shall not have been fulfilled by the Outside Date (other than those
conditions, which, by their nature, are to be satisfied on the Closing Date),
unless such failure shall be due to the failure of Buyer to perform or comply
with any of the covenants, agreements or conditions hereof to be performed or
complied with by it prior to Closing; or

 



 

(iii) since the date of this Agreement there has been an event, occurrence or
development that has had, or that is reasonably likely to have or result in, a
Regulatory Material Adverse Effect or a Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(c) by the Company or the Representative by written notice to Buyer if:

 



 

(i) the Company, the Representative and Sellers are not then in material
breach of any provision of this Agreement and there has been a breach,
inaccuracy in or failure to perform any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement made by Buyer pursuant to this Agreement that would give rise to the
failure of any of the conditions specified in **Article VI** and such breach,
inaccuracy or failure cannot be or has not been cured by Buyer by the Outside
Date; or

 



       
 

 



 

(ii) any of the conditions set forth in **Section 6.01** or **Section 6.03**
shall not have been fulfilled by the Outside Date (other than those
conditions, which, by their nature, are to be satisfied on the Closing Date),
unless such failure shall be due to the failure of the Company, the
Representative or any Sellers to perform or comply with any of the covenants,
agreements or conditions hereof to be performed or complied with by it prior
to Closing; or

 



 

(d) by Buyer or the Company in the event that:

 



 

(i) there shall be any Law that makes consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement illegal or otherwise prohibited; or

 



 

(ii) any Governmental Authority shall have issued a Governmental Order
restraining or enjoining the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
such Governmental Order shall have become final and non-appealable.

 



 

 **Section 8.02** **Effect of Termination.**

 



 

(a) In the event of the termination of this Agreement in accordance with this
**Article VIII**, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and there shall
be no liability on the part of any party hereto, except:

 



 

(i) as set forth in **Section 5.08**, **Article IX** and this **Article
VIII**; and

 



 

(ii) that nothing herein shall (x) relieve or release any party to this
Agreement of any liability or damages (which the parties acknowledge and agree
shall not be limited to reimbursement of expenses or out-of-pocket costs, and
may include to the extent proven the benefit of the bargain lost by a party
and/or such partyÂ’s shareholders (taking into consideration relevant matters,
including other combination opportunities and the time value of money), which
shall be deemed in such event to be damages of such party) arising out of such
partyÂ’s breach of any provision of this Agreement, or (y) impair the right of
any party hereto to compel specific performance by the other party or parties,
as the case may be, of such partyÂ’s post-termination obligations under this
Agreement.

 



 

 **ARTICLE IX. 
MISCELLANEOUS**

 



 

 **Section 9.01** **Expenses**. Except as otherwise expressly provided
herein, all costs and expenses, including, without limitation, fees and
disbursements of counsel, financial advisors and accountants, incurred in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall
be paid by the party incurring such costs and expenses, whether or not the
Closing shall have occurred; _provided_ , _however_ , that (a) Buyer shall be
responsible for all filing and other similar fees payable in connection with
any filings or submissions under the HSR Act and for reimbursement of up to
$50,000 to the Representative for all fees or expenses, including but not
limited to attorneysÂ’ fees, experts or vendors, incurred by the
Representative, on behalf of the Sellers, in connection with supplying any
additional information or documentary material or otherwise complying with
requests pursuant to the HSR Act or participating in any investigation or
litigation by a Governmental Authority, and (b) any unpaid Company Transaction
Costs as of

privilege arising from this Agreement shall operate or be construed as a

remedies will not preclude the exercise of any other right or remedy available
under this Agreement, applicable Law or otherwise. Without limiting the
foregoing, the parties acknowledge that irreparable damages would occur if any
of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed, or threatened not to
be performed, in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached and that money damages or other legal remedies would not be adequate
for any such damages. It is accordingly agreed that Buyer, the Representative
(after Closing) or the Company (on behalf of Sellers before Closing) shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement
and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, it is explicitly agreed that
in the event that **Section 6.01(a)** is satisfied and **Section 6.02(e)**
remains true as of such time, the Company and Sellers (acting through the
Representative) shall be entitled to specific performance of Closing, BuyerÂ’s
obligation to cause the transactions contemplated hereby to be fully and
timely funded and the other transactions contemplated hereby. The parties
hereto further agree that no party shall be required to obtain, furnish or
post any bond or similar instrument in connection with or as a condition to
obtaining any remedy referenced in this **Section 9.11** and the parties
waive any objection to the imposition of such relief or any right it may have
to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or similar
instrument; provided, however, to the extent any such bond or similar
instrument

 



      
 

 



 

is required by applicable Law or Governmental Order, the parties expressly
agree and intend that a bond or similar instrument in the amount of $100 shall
be sufficient and reasonable.

 



 

 **Section 9.12** **Counterparts**. This Agreement may be executed in
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which
together shall be deemed to be one and the same agreement. A signed copy of
this Agreement delivered by facsimile, e-mail or other means of electronic
transmission shall be deemed to have the same legal effect as delivery of an
original signed copy of this Agreement.

 



 

 **Section 9.13** **Non-Recourse**. This Agreement may only be enforced
against, and any claim, action, suit or other legal proceeding based upon,
arising out of, or related to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or
performance of this Agreement, may only be brought against the Persons that
are expressly named as parties hereto and then only with respect to the
specific obligations set forth herein with respect to such party. No past,
present or future director, officer, employee, incorporator, manager, member,
partner, shareholder, Affiliate, agent, attorney or other representative of
any party hereto or of any Affiliate of any party hereto, or any of their
successors or permitted assigns, shall have any liability for any obligations
or liabilities of any party hereto under this Agreement or for any claim or
action based on, in respect of or by reason of the transactions contemplated
hereby.

 



 

 **Section 9.14** **Conflicts**. Each of the parties hereto acknowledges and
agrees, on its own behalf and on behalf of its representatives and Affiliates,
that the Company is the client of Andrews Kurth LLP ( **"AK LLP"** ) and that
AK LLP has jointly represented the Company and the Sellers in connection with
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. After the Closing, it
is possible that AK LLP will represent one or more of the Sellers, the
Representative and/or their respective representatives and Affiliates
(collectively, the **"Seller Group"** ) in connection with a variety of
matters, including matters adverse or potentially adverse to the interests of
Buyer and/or the Acquired Companies. Each of the parties to this Agreement
hereby agrees that AK LLP (or any successor) may serve as counsel to all or a
portion of the Seller Group, in connection with any such matter arising after
the Closing Date. Each of the parties hereto consents to such representation,
and waives any conflict of interest arising therefrom. Each of the parties
hereto acknowledges that such consent and waiver is voluntary, that it has
been carefully considered, and that the parties have consulted with counsel or
have been advised they should do so in connection herewith. Each of the
parties further agrees that all communications or privileged materials between
AK LLP, on the one hand, and the Company (or any representative of the
Company) or a Seller, on the other hand, prior to the Closing (together with
any other legally protected or privileged communications or materials
including those between members of the Seller Group), in each case solely
related to the transactions contemplated hereby (collectively, **"Privileged
Materials"** ) are the property of the Sellers (as a group) and that Buyer and
the Company cannot obtain copies of, or access to, any such Privileged
Materials without a waiver from the Representative. Each of the parties
expressly agrees that, at and after the Closing (and continuing indefinitely
thereafter), any privilege related to any of the Privileged Materials shall be
solely controlled by the Sellers acting collectively through the
Representative. Buyer further agrees that it will not and that it will not
direct any Acquired Company to seek to obtain any such Privileged Materials,
including by way of review of any electronic communications or documents or by
seeking to have the Sellers and/or the Representative waive the attorney-
client or other privilege, or by otherwise asserting

 



      
 

 



 

that Buyer or any Acquired Company has the right to waive the attorney-client
or other privilege. In the event that Buyer or any Acquired Company is
required by Governmental Order or otherwise to access or obtain a copy of such
Privileged Materials, Buyer shall immediately (and, in any event, within two
(2) Business Days) notify the Representative in writing (including by making
specific reference to this **Section 9.14**) so that the Representative can
seek a protective order and Buyer agrees to use all commercially reasonable
efforts to assist therewith.

 



 

 **Section 9.15** **Shareholders Agreements Termination**. The Company and
each of the Sellers hereby agrees, effective as of the date hereof, that (1)
the Shareholders Agreement of the Company, dated as of December 21, 2012, as
amended by the documents listed in (2) and (3) below, by and among the
Company, and each of the Starplex Shareholders and Showplex Shareholders (as
such terms are defined therein), (2) the Joinder Agreement, dated February 7,
2014, by and among the Company, Golub Capital CP Funding LLC, GCP Equity Ltd.,
Golub Capital BDC Holdings, LLC, GC Advisors LLC, as agent for RGA Operating
Company, Golub Capital PEARLS Direct Lending Program, L.P., and PEARLS VIII,
L.P. (collectively, the **"Golub Partners"** ), and (3) the Letter Agreement,
dated February 7, 2014, by and among the Company, Steve Holmes, Tod Hana,
Trinity Hunt Partners III, L.P., and the Golub Partners shall terminate and
cease to be effective without any further action by the Sellers or the
Company. In furtherance of the foregoing, the Company and the Sellers hereby
waive all rights, including all consent rights and rights of first refusal,
and other limitations on the sale of the Shares in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement that are currently contained in such shareholders
agreements. In the event that Closing shall not occur for any reason, this
**Section 9.15** shall be void and such shareholders agreements shall
continue to be in full force and effect.

 



 

 **Section 9.16** **Attorneys Â’ Fees**. The prevailing party in any dispute
between Buyer and the Sellers arising out of the interpretation, application
or enforcement of any provisions hereof shall be entitled to recover all of
its reasonable attorneysÂ’ fees and costs whether suit be filed or not,
including, without limitation, cost and attorneysÂ’ fees related to or arising
out of any trial or appellate proceedings.

 



 

 **ARTICLE X. 
THE REPRESENTATIVE**

 



 

 **Section 10.01** **Authorization of the Representative**. Each Seller, by
his, her or its execution of this Agreement, hereby appoints, authorizes and
empowers the Representative to act as the agent of the Sellers for the
purposes and with the powers and authority hereinafter set forth in this
Article X and in the Escrow Agreement, which shall include the full power and
authority:

 



 

(a) to execute, deliver and perform the Escrow Agreement (with such
modifications or changes thereto as to which the Representative, in its
reasonable discretion, shall have consented to);

 



 

(b) as the Representative of the Sellers, to enforce and protect the rights
and interests of the Sellers arising out of or under or in any manner relating
to this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement and, in connection therewith, to
(i) resolve all questions, disputes, conflicts and controversies concerning
the determination of amounts pursuant to **Article II**, matters relating to
Taxes pursuant to **Section 5.05** and indemnification claims pursuant to
**Article VII**; (ii) employ

 



      
 

 



 

such agents, consultants and professionals, to delegate authority to its

Sellers in connection with **Article VII** as the Representative, in its
reasonable discretion, deems to be in the best interest of the Sellers; (iii)
assert or institute any claim, action, proceeding or investigation pursuant to
**Article VII**; (iv) investigate, defend, contest or litigate any claim,
action, proceeding or investigation initiated by Buyer, or any other Person,
against all of the Sellers, and receive process on behalf of all of the
Sellers in any such claim, action, proceeding or investigation and compromise
or settle on such terms as the Representative shall determine to be
appropriate, give receipts, releases and discharges on behalf of all of the
Sellers with respect to any such claim, action, proceeding or investigation
pursuant to **Section 5.05(b)** or **Article VII**; (v) file any proofs,

necessary; (vi) settle or compromise any claims asserted under **Section

actions, proceedings or investigations pursuant to **Section 5.05(b)** or
**Article VII**; and (ix) pay amounts out of the Representative Holdback
Amount in connection with the foregoing, it being understood that the
Representative shall not have any obligation to take any such actions, shall
not be required to expend any of its own funds, and shall not have liability
for any failure to take such any action; _provided_ , _however_ , that no
Seller shall be liable for any amount in excess of the Representative Holdback
Amount that exceeds such SellerÂ’s Percentage Interest of any amounts for which
such Seller is obligated to pay pursuant to any action taken by the
Representative pursuant to this **Article X**;

 



 

(c) to authorize and cause to be paid out of the Escrow Amount the full amount
of any indemnification claims under **Section 5.05(b)** or **Article VII**
and also any other amounts to be paid out of the Escrow Amount pursuant to
this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement;

 



 

(d) to make, execute, acknowledge and deliver all such other agreements,
guarantees, orders, receipts, endorsements, notices, requests, instructions,
certificates, stock powers, letters and other writings including amendments,
modifications and supplements to, and waivers of the provisions of this
Agreement, and, in general, to do any and all things and to take any and all
action that the Representative, in its sole and absolute direction, may
consider necessary or proper or convenient in connection with or to carry out
the activities described in paragraph (a) above and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement.

 



 

(e) Buyer and the Company shall be entitled to rely exclusively upon the
communications of the Representative, but only as it relates to the foregoing,
as the communications of the Sellers. Neither Buyer nor the Company need be
concerned with the authority of the Representative to act on behalf of all the
Sellers hereunder or shall be held liable or accountable in any manner for any
act or omission of the Representative in such capacity.

 



 

(f) The grant of authority provided for in this **Section 10.01** is coupled
with an interest and is being granted, in part, as an inducement to the
Company and Buyer to enter into this Agreement and shall be irrevocable and
survive the death, incompetency, bankruptcy or liquidation of any Seller and
shall be binding on any successor thereto.

 



      
 

 



 

 **Section 10.02** **Compensation; Exculpation; Indemnity.**

 



 

(a) The Representative shall not be entitled to any fee, commission or other
compensation for the performance of its services hereunder, but shall be
authorized to be reimbursed from the Representative Holdback Amount for any
costs, expenses or other fees that may be paid or borne by the Representative
in acting as the Representative of the Sellers pursuant to this **Article
X**.

 



 

(b) In dealing with this Agreement and any instruments, agreements or
documents relating thereto, and in exercising or failing to exercise all or
any of the powers conferred upon the Representative hereunder or thereunder,
(i) the Representative shall not assume any, and shall incur no,
responsibility whatsoever to any Seller by reason of any error in judgment or
other act or omission performed or omitted hereunder or in connection with
this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, unless by the RepresentativeÂ’s willful
misconduct, and (ii) the Representative shall be entitled to rely on the
advice of counsel, public accountants or other independent experts experienced
in the matter at issue, and any error in judgment or other act or omission of
the Representative pursuant to such advice shall in no event subject the
Representative to liability to any Seller, unless by the RepresentativeÂ’s
willful misconduct. Except as set forth in the previous sentence,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Representative,
in its role as Representative of the Sellers, shall have no liability
whatsoever to any Acquired Company, Buyer, the Sellers or any other Person.

 



 

(c) Each Seller, severally, shall indemnify the Representative up to, but not
exceeding, an amount equal to such SellerÂ’s pro rata portion of the total
amount, as determined in accordance with such SellerÂ’s Percentage Interest and
in no event exceeding the net portion of the Purchase Price actually received
by such Seller, of all damages, liabilities, claims, obligations, costs and
expenses, including reasonable attorneysÂ’, accountantsÂ’ and other expertsÂ’
fees and the amount of any judgment against it, of any nature whatsoever,
arising out of or in connection with any claim or in connection with any
appeal thereof, relating to the acts or omissions of the Representative
hereunder or relating to the Escrow Agreement, except for such damages,
liabilities, claims, obligations, costs and expenses, including reasonable
attorneysÂ’, accountantsÂ’ and other expertsÂ’ fees and the amount of any
judgment against the Representative that arise from the RepresentativeÂ’s
willful misconduct, including the willful breach of this Agreement. The
foregoing indemnification shall not be deemed exclusive of any other right to
which the Representative may be entitled apart from the provisions hereof. In
the event of any indemnification under this **Section 10.02**, each Seller
shall promptly deliver to the Representative full payment of his, her or its
ratable share of such indemnification claim.

 



 

(d) At such time as the remaining amount of the Escrow Account is distributed
to the Representative on behalf of the Sellers pursuant to **Section
2.03(b)**, the Representative shall distribute to the Sellers in accordance
with their respective Percentage Interests the remaining amount, if any, of
the Representative Holdback Amount.

 



 

(e) All of the indemnities, immunities and powers granted to the
Representative under this Agreement shall survive the Closing and/or any
termination of this Agreement.
