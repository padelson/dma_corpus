 (b) Merger Consideration. Subject to the further provisions of this Section 1.5, each share of Company Common Stock, other than Excluded Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive: (i) for each share of Company Common Stock in respect of which an effective election (an " _Election_ ") shall have been made, one of the following: (A) $6.5233 in cash (the " _Cash Consideration_ "), subject to adjustment as provided in Sections 1.5(c) and 1.5(f) or (B) 0.6875 (the " _Exchange Ratio_ ") shares of Parent Common Stock (the " _Stock Consideration_ "), subject to adjustment as provided in Sections 1.5(d) and 1.5(f) and (ii) for each share of Company Common Stock (other than Excluded Shares) in respect of which no effective Election shall have been made prior to the Election Deadline for any reason (a " _No Election Share_ "), the Stock Consideration, as adjusted as provided in Sections 1.5(d) and 1.5(f). The consideration payable pursuant to this Section 1.5(b), together with cash payments in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 1.5(h) and amounts paid in respect of unexercised stock options under Section 1.6, is referred to herein collectively as the " _Merger Consideration_ ". 

  

 (c) Cash Election. Subject to Section 1.5(f), each record holder of Company Common Stock, other than Excluded Shares, immediately prior to the Election Deadline who either (i) makes an effective Election to receive cash (a " _Cash Election_ ") or (ii) holds any Dissenting Shares (as defined below) shall be entitled to receive for each of such holders share of Company Common Stock as to which such Cash Election is made and for each Dissenting Share the Cash Consideration in cash (without interest) or a combination of cash and shares of Parent Common Stock, solely as provided in clause (i) or (ii) below. 

  

 (i) If the Available Cash Amount equals or exceeds the Cash Election Amount, each share of Company Common Stock as to which an effective Cash Election is made and each Dissenting Share shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration (without interest). 

  

 (ii) If the Available Cash Amount is less than the Cash Election Amount, then each share of Company Common Stock as to which an effective Cash Election is made and each Dissenting Share shall be converted into the right to receive (A) an amount of cash (without interest) equal to the Cash Consideration multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the Available Cash Amount and the denominator of which shall be the Cash Election Amount (such fraction being the " _Cash Fraction_ ") and (B) a number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product of (x) the Exchange Ratio and (y) a fraction equal to one minus the Cash Fraction. 

  

 (iii) For purposes of this Section 1.5(c): 

  

 (1) " _Available Cash Amount_ " shall mean $25,000,000. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (2) " _Cash Election Amount_ " shall mean the product of (x) the sum of (i) number of Company Shares as to which an effective Cash Election is made and (ii) the number of Dissenting Shares and (y) the Cash Consideration, as adjusted for any Adjustment Event (as defined in Section 1.5(f)(iii)). 

  

 Cash Elections shall be made on a form mutually acceptable to Parent and the Company, designed for the purpose of making Elections (an " _Election Form_ "), accompanied by Certificates for the shares of Company Common Stock to which such Election Form relates, if and as provided in Section 1.5(g). 

  

 (d) Stock Election. Subject to Section 1.5(f), each record holder of shares of Company Common Stock, other than Excluded Shares, immediately prior to the Election Deadline who makes an effective Election to receive shares of Parent Common Stock (a " _Stock Election_ ") shall be entitled to receive for each of such holders shares of Company Common Stock as to which such Stock Election is made shares of Parent Common Stock or a combination of cash and shares of Parent Common Stock, solely as provided in clause (i) or (ii) below: 

  

 (i) If the Available Cash Amount equals or exceeds the Cash Election Amount, then each share of Company Common Stock as to which an effective Stock Election is made shall be converted into the right to receive (A) a number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the quotient of (w) the Aggregate Stock Amount divided by (x) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to an effective Stock Election (the " _Stock Election Shares_ ") and (B) an amount of cash (without interest) equal to the quotient of (y) the amount by which the Available Cash Amount exceeds the Cash Election Amount, divided by (z) the Stock Election Shares. 

  

 (ii) If the Available Cash Amount is less than the Cash Election Amount, each share of Company Common Stock as to which an effective Stock Election is made shall be converted into the right to a number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio. 

  

 (iii) For purposes of this Section 1.5(d) " _Aggregate Stock Amount_ " shall mean a number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to (X) the product of (A) the number of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time times (B) the Exchange Ratio minus (Y) 2,634,796 shares.

 (e) No Election. Each No Election Share shall be treated for purposes of this Section 1.5 to have made an effective Stock Election. The consideration payable with respect to such No Election Shares shall be subject to adjustment as provided in Sections 1.5(d) and 1.5(f). 

  

 (f) Further Adjustments. If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the shares of Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock outstanding shall have changed, by reason of any reclassification, subdivision, recapitalization, stock split (including reverse stock split) or stock dividend (each an " _Adjustment Event_ "), then the Exchange Ratio and/or the amount or form of any portion of the Merger Consideration that 

   ##### 

  

    

would otherwise be payable in shares of Parent Common Stock or in respect of
shares of Company Common Stock and other definitions and provisions of this
Agreement dependent thereon, shall be equitably adjusted to give effect to
such event. 

  

 (g) Election Procedure. At the time of the mailing of the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus to holders of record of shares of Company Common Stock entitled to vote at the Company Shareholders Meeting, Parent will mail, or cause to be mailed, an Election Form and a letter of transmittal to each such holder. To be effective, an Election Form must be properly completed, signed and actually received by the Exchange Agent, not later than 5:00 pm, Pacific Time, on the date (the " _Election Deadline_ ") that is the third Business Day prior to the first Closing Date scheduled by the parties in accordance with Section 1.3 and, in the case of shares that are not held in book entry form, accompanied by the Certificates representing all of the shares of Company Common Stock as to which such Election Form relates, duly endorsed in blank or otherwise in form acceptable for transfer (or accompanied by an appropriate guarantee of delivery by an eligible organization). For shares that are held in book entry form, Parent shall establish reasonable procedures for the delivery of such shares. Parent shall have the discretion, which it may delegate in whole or in part to the Exchange Agent, to determine whether Election Forms have been properly completed, signed and timely submitted or to disregard defects in Election Forms. Any such determination of Parent or the Exchange Agent shall be conclusive and binding. Neither Parent nor the Exchange Agent shall be under any obligation to notify any Person of any defect in an Election Form submitted to the Exchange Agent. If Parent or the Exchange Agent shall determine that any purported Election was not properly made, the shares of Company Common Stock subject to such improperly made Election shall be treated as No Election Shares. A record holder need not make the same election with respect to all of the shares of Company Common Stock held of record by such holder or represented by a single Certificate. Any Election Form may be revoked by the shareholder who submitted such Election Form to the Exchange Agent only by written notice received by the Exchange Agent (i) prior to the Election Deadline or (ii) after such time if (and only to the extent that) the Exchange Agent is legally required to permit revocations and only if the Effective Time shall not have occurred prior to such date. In addition, all Election Forms shall automatically be revoked, and all Certificates returned, if the Exchange Agent is notified in writing by Parent and Company that this Agreement has been terminated. 

  

 (h) No Fractional Shares. No fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued pursuant to this Agreement. In lieu of fractional shares, each shareholder who would otherwise have been entitled to a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock hereunder (after aggregating all fractional shares to be received by such shareholder), shall receive, without interest, an amount in cash (rounded to the nearest whole cent) determined by multiplying such fraction by the closing price for one share of Parent Common Stock on the Nasdaq Global Market on the last trading day immediately preceding the Effective Time (the " _Effective Time Parent Common Stock Price_ "). 

  

 (i) Merger Sub Capital Stock. Each share of capital stock of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall continue to be outstanding following, and shall be unaffected by, the Merger. 

  

 (j) Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Parent shall not be obligated to deliver any Merger Consideration to any shareholder of 

   ##### 

  

    

the Company with respect to any shares of Company Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time that are held by a shareholder who is
eligible to demand and perfect dissenters rights in accordance with Sections
302A.471 and 302A.473 of the MBCA and who has not effectively withdrawn or
lost such holders right to such appraisal (each, a " _Dissenting Share_
"). Such Dissenting Shares shall not be converted into the right to receive
the applicable Merger Consideration as provided above, unless and until such
holder fails to perfect or withdraws or otherwise loses his right to dissent
under Sections 302A.471 and 302A.473 of the MBCA, but the holder thereof
shall only be entitled to such rights as are granted by Sections 302A.471
and 302A.473 of the MBCA and, from and after the Effective Time, shall not be
entitled to vote or to exercise any other rights of a shareholder of the
Company except as provided by Sections 302A.471 and 302A.473 of the MBCA.
Each holder of Dissenting Shares who becomes entitled to payment therefor
pursuant to Sections 302A.471 and 302A.473 of the MBCA shall receive such
payment from the Surviving Corporation in accordance with Sections 302A.471
and 302A.473 of the MBCA. If, after the Effective Time, any such holder fails
to perfect or withdraws or loses his right to dissent, such holders
Dissenting Shares shall thereupon be treated as if they had been converted as
of the Effective Time into the right to receive the applicable Merger
Consideration, if any, to which such holder is entitled, without interest or
dividends thereon. The Company shall give Parent prompt written notice of any
notices of intent to demand payment received by the Company, withdrawals
of such demands, and any other instrument served pursuant to Sections
302A.471 and 302A.473 of the MBCA and received by Company. Parent shall be
entitled to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands
for appraisal under the MBCA. 

  

 (k) Treatment of Unvested Company Common Stock. If any shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time are unvested or are subject to a repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or other condition under any applicable restricted stock purchase agreement or other agreement with the Company or under which the Company has any rights other than those conditions that accelerate and/or terminate upon, immediately prior to, or otherwise in connection with the Merger in accordance with their terms as described in Part 2.3(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, then the shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange for such shares of Company Common Stock will also be unvested and subject to the same repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or other condition, and the certificates representing such shares of Parent Common Stock may accordingly be marked with appropriate legends. The Company shall take all action that may be necessary to ensure that, from and after the Effective Time, Parent is entitled to exercise any such repurchase option or other right set forth in any such restricted stock purchase agreement or other agreement. 

  

 1.6 Stock Options. 

  

 (a) Subject to Section 1.6(b), at the Effective Time, each Company Option which is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not vested, shall be converted into and become an option to purchase Parent Common Stock, and Parent shall assume each such Company Option in accordance with the terms (as in effect as of the date of this Agreement) of the stock option plan under which it was issued and the terms of the stock option agreement by which it is evidenced. Accordingly, from and after the Effective Time, (i) each Company Option assumed by Parent may be exercised solely for shares of Parent Common Stock, (ii) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to each such Company Option shall be equal to the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to 

   ##### 

  

    

such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the
Option Exchange Ratio (as defined below), rounding down to the nearest whole
share, (iii) the per share exercise price under each such Company Option
shall be adjusted by dividing the per share exercise price under such Company
Option by the Option Exchange Ratio and rounding up to the nearest cent and
(iv) any restriction on the exercise of any such Company Option shall
continue in full force and effect and the term, exercisability, vesting
schedule and other provisions of such Company Option shall otherwise remain
unchanged; _provided, however,_ that each Company Option assumed by Parent
in accordance with this Section 1.6(a) shall, in accordance with its terms,
be subject to further adjustment as appropriate to reflect any stock split,
division or subdivision of shares, stock dividend, reverse stock split,
consolidation of shares, reclassification, recapitalization or other similar
transaction subsequent to the Effective Time. Parent shall file with the SEC,
no later than 30 days after the date on which the Merger becomes effective, a
registration statement on Form S-8 relating to the shares of Parent Common
Stock issuable with respect to the Company Options assumed by Parent in
accordance with this Section 1.6(a). For purposes of this Section 1.6(a), "
_Option Exchange Ratio_ " shall mean (X) the greater of the dollar value of
the Cash Consideration and the dollar value of the Stock Consideration to be
received with respect to one share of Company Common Stock, as adjusted
pursuant to Section 1.5(c), 1.5(d) and 1.5(f), respectively, measured as of
the Effective Time; divided by (Y) the Effective Time Parent Common Stock
Price. The assumption of Company Options pursuant to this Section 1.6(a)
shall occur in a manner consistent with the requirements of Section 409A of
the Code and, in the case of any such Company Options to which Section 422 of
the Code applies, in accordance with Section 424(a) of the Code. 

  

 (b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all action that may be necessary (under the plans pursuant to which Company Options are outstanding and otherwise) to effectuate the provisions of this Section 1.6 and to ensure that, from and after the Effective Time, holders of Company Options have no rights with respect thereto other than those specifically provided in this Section 1.6. 

  

 1.7 Closing of the Companys Transfer Books. At the Effective Time: (a) all shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and all holders of certificates representing shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights as shareholders of the Company; and (b) the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed with respect to all shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. No further transfer of any such shares of Company Common Stock shall be made on such stock transfer books after the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, a valid certificate previously representing any shares of Company Common Stock (a " _Certificate_ ") is presented to the Exchange Agent (as defined in Section 1.8) or to the Surviving Corporation or Parent, such Company Stock Certificate shall be canceled and shall be exchanged as provided in Section 1.8. 

  

 1.8 Exchange of Certificates. 

  

 (a) Prior to the time of the mailing of the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus to holders of record of shares of Company Common Stock entitled to vote at the Company Shareholders Meeting, Parent shall select a reputable bank or trust company to act as exchange agent in the Merger (the " _Exchange Agent_ "). As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, 

   ##### 

  

    

Parent shall deposit with the Exchange Agent (i) certificates representing the
shares of Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to this Section 1, and (ii)
$25,000,000 to pay the aggregate cash consideration and (iii) cash sufficient
to make payments in lieu of fractional shares in accordance with Section
1.5(d). The shares of Parent Common Stock and cash amounts so deposited with
the Exchange Agent, together with any dividends or distributions received by
the Exchange Agent with respect to such shares, are referred to collectively
as the " _Exchange Fund_." 

  

 (b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent will mail to the record holders of Certificates (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form and containing such provisions as Parent may reasonably specify (including a provision confirming that delivery of Company Stock Certificates shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of such Certificates to the Exchange Agent), and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Company Stock Certificates in exchange for certificates representing Parent Common Stock and/or the Cash Consideration, as applicable. Upon surrender of a Certificate to the Exchange Agent for exchange, together with a duly executed letter of transmittal and such other documents as may be reasonably required by the Exchange Agent or Parent, (1) the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a certificate representing the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of Section 1.5 and the aggregate amount of Cash Consideration that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provision of Section 1.5 (and cash in lieu of any fractional share of Parent Common Stock), and (2) the Certificate so surrendered shall be canceled. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 1.8(b), each Certificate shall be deemed, from and after the Effective Time, to represent only the right to receive shares of Parent Common Stock and/or Cash Consideration (and cash in lieu of any fractional share of Parent Common Stock) as contemplated by Section 1.5. If any Company Stock Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition to the issuance of any certificate representing Parent Common Stock, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate to provide an appropriate affidavit and to deliver a bond (in such sum as Parent may reasonably direct) as indemnity against any claim that may be made against the Exchange Agent, Parent or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Certificate. 

  

 (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no shares of Parent Common Stock (or certificates therefor) shall be issued in exchange for any Certificate to any Person who may be an "affiliate" (as that term is used in Rule 145 under the Securities Act) of the Company until such Person shall have delivered to Parent and the Company a duly executed Affiliate Agreement as contemplated by Section 5.10. 

  

 (d) No dividends or other distributions declared or made with respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock that such holder has the right to receive in the Merger until such holder surrenders such Company Stock Certificate in accordance with this Section 1.8 (at which time such holder shall be entitled, subject to the effect of applicable escheat or similar laws, to receive all such dividends and distributions, without interest). 

   ##### 

  

  

 (e) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to holders of Certificates as of the date 180 days after the date on which the Merger becomes effective shall be delivered to Parent upon demand, and any holders of Certificates who have not theretofore surrendered their Certificates in accordance with this Section 1.7 shall thereafter look only to Parent for satisfaction of their claims for Parent Common Stock, Cash Consideration, cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock and any dividends or distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock. 

  

 (f) Each of the Exchange Agent, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder or former holder of Company Common Stock such amounts as may be required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign tax law or under any other applicable Legal Requirement. To the extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid. 

  

 (g) Neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any holder or former holder of Company Common Stock or to any other Person with respect to any shares of Parent Common Stock (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto), or for any cash amounts, delivered to any public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property law, escheat law or similar Legal Requirement. 

  

 1.9 Tax Consequences. For federal income tax purposes, the Merger is intended to constitute a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "). The parties to this Agreement hereby adopt this Agreement as a " _plan of reorganization_ " within the meaning of Sections 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a) of the United States Treasury Regulations. 

  

 1.10 Further Action. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further action is determined by Parent to be necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title and possession of and to all rights and property of Merger Sub and the Company, the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall be fully authorized (in the name of Merger Sub, in the name of the Company and otherwise) to take such action.

Nothing in this Section 5.5 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall be construed to create a right in any employee to employment with Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any other Subsidiary of Parent and the employment of each Continuing Employee shall be "at will" employment. Except as set forth in Section 5.6(c), no current or former employee, consultant or director of any of the Acquired Corporations, and no Continuing Employee, shall be deemed to be a third party beneficiary of this Agreement. 

  

 (b) Unless otherwise directed in writing by Parent prior to the Effective Time, the Company agrees to take (or cause to be taken) all actions necessary or appropriate to terminate, effective immediately prior to the Effective Time, any employee benefit plan sponsored by any of the Acquired Corporations (or in which any of the Acquired Corporations participate) that contains a cash or deferred arrangement intended to qualify under Section 401(k) of the Code (the _"Acquired Corporations  __401(k)_ _Plan"_ ). If the Acquired Corporations 401(k) Plan is so terminated and Parent does not provide for a direct, trustee-to-trustee transfer of assets and 

   ##### 

  

    

liabilities from the Acquired Corporations 401(k) Plan to an employee
pension benefit plan sponsored by Parent that contains a cash or deferred
arrangement intended to qualify under Section 401(k) of the Code (a _"Parent_
_401(k)_ _Plan"_ ), then as soon as administratively practicable following
the Effective Time, Parent shall advise the Continuing Employees of
their right to (i) elect to receive a distribution of their individual
account balances from the Acquired Corporations 401(k) Plan and (ii) to the
extent permitted by Legal Requirements, as soon as practicable following the
Effective Time (or, if later, the receipt of a favorable determination letter
from the IRS in connection with the termination of the Acquired Corporations
401(k) Plan), roll over such distributions to a Parent 401(k) Plan in a
direct rollover or rollover contribution, which, in the case of a Continuing
Employee who rolls over his or her entire account balance, shall include, to
the extent permitted under both the Acquired Corporations 401(k) Plan and
Parent 401(k) Plan, any outstanding loan notes evidencing participant loans
from the Acquired Corporations 401(k) Plan. Prior to terminating the
Acquired Corporations 401(k) Plan, the Company shall take any steps
necessary, including amending the Acquired Corporations 401(k) Plan and any
related 401(k) loan policies, to ensure that such rollover of participant
accounts and loan balances is permitted under the terms of the Acquired
Corporations 401(k) Plan and any related 401(k) loan policies.

 (b) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, purchase a "tail" prepaid policy on the current insurance policy of the Company for a period of six years from the Effective Time and to maintain such "tail" policy in full force and effect and to honor its respective obligations thereunder. Such "tail" policy shall provide coverage no less favorable in all material respects to that maintained by or on behalf of the Acquired Corporations on the date hereof (which policy is set forth on Part 2.19 of the Company Disclosure Schedule (the " _Current Policy_ ") and having coverage and containing terms and conditions which in the aggregate are not less advantageous to the persons currently covered by such Current Policy as insureds with respect to claims arising from any actual or alleged wrongful act or omission occurring prior to the Effective Time (including, without limitation, any acts or omissions relating to the approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the Merger) for which a claim has not been made against any director or officer of any of the Acquired Corporations prior to the Effective Time; provided, that Parent shall have not such obligation with respect to Side A coverage for the benefit of Joel Kocher as such coverage relates to certain litigation matters listed in Part 2.21(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event will Parent be obligated to pay more than 150% of the Current Premium in the aggregate for any "tail" policy, it being understood that if the premium for such insurance coverage exceeds such amount, Parent 

   ##### 

  

    

shall be obligated to obtain a "tail" policy with the greatest coverage
available for a cost equal to such amount. 

  

 (c) This Section 5.6 is intended for the irrevocable benefit of, and to grant third party rights to, the Indemnified Parties, and the provisions of this Section 5.6 shall survive the consummation of the Merger as set forth herein and shall be binding on all successors and assigns of Parent, the Company and the Surviving Corporation. Each of the Indemnified Parties (and their respective heirs and representatives) shall be entitled to enforce the covenants contained in this Section 5.6. The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this Section 5.6 shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect the rights of any Indemnified Party under this Section 5.6 without the consent of such affected Indemnified Party. Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to perform all of the obligations of the Surviving Corporation under this Section 5.6.
