actually received by the Exchange Agent, not later than 5:00 pm, Pacific Time, on the date (the
&#147;<B><I>Election Deadline</I></B>&#148;) that is the third Business Day prior to the first Closing Date scheduled by
the parties in accordance with Section&nbsp;1.3 and, in the case of shares that are not held in book
entry form, accompanied by the Certificates representing all of the shares of Company Common Stock
as to which such Election Form relates, duly endorsed in blank or otherwise in form acceptable for
transfer (or accompanied by an appropriate guarantee of delivery by an eligible organization). For
shares that are held in book entry form, Parent shall establish reasonable procedures for the
delivery of such shares. Parent shall have the discretion, which it may delegate in whole or in
part to the Exchange Agent, to determine whether Election Forms have been properly completed,
signed and timely submitted or to disregard defects in Election Forms. Any such determination of
Parent or the Exchange Agent shall be conclusive and binding. Neither Parent nor the Exchange
Agent shall be under any obligation to notify any Person of any defect in an Election Form
submitted to the Exchange Agent. If Parent or the Exchange Agent shall determine that any
purported Election was not properly made, the shares of Company Common Stock subject to such
improperly made Election shall be treated as No Election Shares. A record holder need not make the
same election with respect to all of the shares of Company Common Stock held of record by such
holder or represented by a single Certificate. Any Election Form may be revoked by the shareholder
who submitted such Election Form to the Exchange Agent only by written notice received by the
Exchange Agent (i)&nbsp;prior to the Election Deadline or (ii)&nbsp;after such time if (and only to the
extent that) the Exchange Agent is legally required to permit revocations and only if the Effective
Time shall not have occurred prior to such date. In addition, all Election Forms shall

writing by Parent and Company that this Agreement has been terminated.
