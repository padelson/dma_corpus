 | 18| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) At least five (5) Business Days before the scheduled Closing
Date, Buyer shall prepare and deliver to the Sellers' Representative a
statement (the "Cash Payment Adjustment Statement") setting forth Buyer's
calculation of the aggregate adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant to
2.05(a) (the "Adjustment Amount"). Such calculation shall be prepared by
Buyer and, to the extent the Triggering Divestiture relates to the businesses,
assets, properties or product lines of (x) the Company or any Company
Subsidiary, shall be calculated consistently with the accounting principles,
policies, practices and classifications used to calculate net sales in the
2016 Audited Financial Statements of the Company or (y) the Buyer or
any subsidiary of Buyer, shall be calculated consistently with the accounting
principles, policies, practices and classifications used to calculate net
sales in the 2016 audited financial statements of the Buyer. During the five
(5) Business Day period before the scheduled Closing Date, Buyer and its
Representatives shall be available to the Sellers' Representative and its
Representatives for any questions or comments on the Adjustment Amount. The
amount of the cash portion of the Purchase Price payable at Closing shall be
decreased by the Adjustment Amount. Following the Closing, the Sellers'
Representative and the Buyer shall resolve any dispute regarding the
calculation of the Adjustment Amount as follows.

  



  

(i) Examination. During the sixty (60) days following the Closing
Date (the "Review Period") the Sellers' Representative shall have the right
to review the Cash Payment Adjustment Statement. During the Review Period, the
Sellers' Representative and Sellers' Accountants shall have full access to
the books and records of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries,
the personnel of, and work papers prepared by, Buyer and/or Buyer's
Accountants to the extent that they relate to the calculation of the
Adjustment Amount as the Sellers' Representative may reasonably request for
the purpose of reviewing the Cash Payment Adjustment Statement and whether
the Adjustment Amount was prepared in accordance with 2.05(b); _provided,
that_ such access shall be in a manner that does not unreasonably interfere
with the normal business operations of Buyer or its subsidiaries or the
Company or any Company Subsidiaries.

  



  

(ii) Objection. On or before the last day of the Review Period, the
Sellers' Representative may object to the calculation of the
Adjustment Amount by delivering to Buyer a written statement setting forth
the Sellers' Representative's objections in reasonable detail, indicating
each disputed item or amount and the basis for the Sellers' Representative's
assertion that such was not prepared in accordance with 2.05(b) (the
"Statement of Objections"). If the Sellers' Representative fails to deliver
the Statement of Objections before the expiration of the Review Period, the
Cash Payment Adjustment Statement shall be deemed to have been accepted by
the Sellers' Representative, and the Adjustment Amount shall be deemed to be
the Final Adjustment Amount. If the Sellers' Representative delivers the
Statement of Objections before the expiration of the Review Period, Buyer and
the Sellers' Representative shall negotiate in good faith to resolve such
objections within thirty (30) days after the delivery of the Statement of
Objections (the "Resolution Period"), and, if the same are so resolved within
the Resolution Period, the Adjustment Amount and the Cash Payment Adjustment
Statement with such changes as may have been previously agreed in writing by
Buyer and the Sellers' Representative, shall be final and binding.

  



    

 | 19| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(iii) Resolution of Disputes. If the Sellers' Representative and Buyer
fail to reach an agreement with respect to all of the matters set forth in
the Statement of Objections before expiration of the Resolution Period, then
any amounts remaining in dispute (the "Disputed Amounts") shall be submitted
for resolution to the office of an impartial nationally recognized firm of
independent certified public accountants (other than Sellers' Accountants,
Buyer's Accountants or any other accounting firm that has been engaged by any
party to this Agreement or any Affiliate of such party to perform services in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement), appointed
by mutual agreement of Buyer and the Sellers' Representative (the "Independent
Accountant") who, acting as experts and not arbitrators, shall resolve the
Disputed Amounts only and make any adjustments to the Adjustment Amount and,
as the case may be, the Cash Payment Adjustment Statement. The parties hereto
agree that all adjustments shall be made without regard to materiality. The
Independent Accountant shall only decide the specific items under dispute by
the parties and their decision for each Disputed Amount must be within the
range of values assigned to each such item in the Cash Payment
Adjustment Statement and the Statement of Objections, respectively.

  



  

(iv) Fees of the Independent Accountant. The fees and disbursements of
the Independent Accountant shall be borne by the Party (i.e., the Sellers'
Representative, on the one hand, or the Buyer, on the other hand) that
assigned amounts to items in dispute that were, on a net basis, furthest in
amount from the amount finally determined by the Independent Accountant (or
equally in the event the Parties' assigned amounts were, on a net basis, each
within 15% of the amount finally determined by the Independent Accountant).

  



  

(v) Determination by Independent Accountant. The Independent
Accountant shall make a determination as soon as practicable within thirty
(30) days (or such other time as the parties hereto shall agree in writing)
after their engagement, and their resolution of the Disputed Amounts and
their adjustments to the Cash Payment Adjustment Statement and/or the
Adjustment Amount shall be conclusive and binding upon the parties hereto,
and the Adjustment Amount shall be deemed to be the Final Adjustment Amount.
In making its determination, the Independent Accountant, in its sole
discretion, will determine: (i) the nature and extent of the participation by
Buyer, the Sellers' Representative, the Sellers and their respective
Representatives in connection with the resolution of any
disagreement submitted to the Independent Accountant; (ii) the nature and
extent of the information that may be submitted to the Independent Accountant
for consideration in connection with such resolution and (iii) the personnel
of the Independent Accountant who will review such information and resolve
such disagreement.

  



    

 | 20| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(vi) Payments of Final Adjustment Amount. Within ten (10) Business
Days after the determination of the Final Adjustment Amount:

  



  

(i) if the result of (1) the Final Adjustment Amount __minus__ (2)
the Adjustment Amount is a negative number, then the cash portion of the
Purchase Price will be adjusted downward by the amount of such shortfall, and
the Sellers' Representative shall pay the amount of such difference to Buyer;
and

  



  

(ii) if the result of (1) the Final Adjustment Amount __minus__ (2)
the Adjustment Amount is a positive number then the cash portion of the
Purchase Price will be adjusted upward by the amount of such excess, and the
Buyer shall pay the amount of such difference to the Paying Agent for the
benefit of the Sellers, the Optionholders and the SAR Holders.

  



  

(c) Adjustments for Tax Purposes. Any payments made pursuant to 2.05
shall be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price by the parties for
Tax purposes, unless otherwise required by Law.

  



  

2.06 Post-Closing Payments. Unless the context of any Transaction
Document expressly requires otherwise, any payment to be made by Buyer or the
Escrow Agent, as the case may be, after the Closing Date, to or on behalf of
any of the Sellers, Optionholders or SAR Holders pursuant to: (a) 2.05 or
ARTICLE IX of this Agreement or (b) the Escrow Agreement, will be made to the
Paying Agent for further distribution to the Sellers, Optionholders, SAR
Holders and the Company proportionately (in accordance with the proportion of
the Purchase Price allocated to such Seller, Optionholder and SAR Holder
pursuant to the Allocation Certificate and to the Company to cover its payroll
tax and benefit plan obligations with respect to such amounts). In addition,
any such payment to be made to the Paying Agent will be paid by wire transfer
of immediately available funds to the Paying Agent on behalf of such
Seller, Optionholder, SAR Holder and the Company in accordance with the
applicable Wire Transfer Instructions.

  



  

2.07 Withholding Tax. Buyer, the Escrow Agent and the Company shall
be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Purchase Price and other
amounts payable under this Agreement all Taxes, if any, that Buyer, the
Escrow Agent and the Company may be required to deduct and withhold under any
provision of Tax Law. All such withheld amounts shall be treated as delivered
to the Sellers hereunder. Without limiting the foregoing: (a) any payment
otherwise to be made by the Buyer to the Sellers' Representative on behalf of
any Optionholder pursuant to 2.03(a)(i) of this Agreement (each, an
"Optionholder Payment") who is an employee or former employee of the Company
or a Company Subsidiary shall be instead paid to the Company or Company
Subsidiary, as applicable, that as of the Closing makes (or had made)
payments of wages to such Optionholder on behalf of such Optionholder; (b)
any payment otherwise to be made by the Buyer to the Sellers'
Representative on behalf of any SAR Holder pursuant to 2.03(a)(i) of this
Agreement (each, a "SAR Holder Payment") who is an employee or former
employee of the Company or a Company Subsidiary shall be instead paid to the
Company or Company Subsidiary, as applicable, that as of the Closing makes
(or had made) payments of wages to such SAR Holder on behalf of such SAR
Holder; and (c) the Company or applicable Company Subsidiary shall pay to
such Optionholder or SAR Holder the amount of such Optionholder Payment or
SAR Holder Payment on the Closing Date funded from the Purchase Price;
_provided_ , _however_ , that (x) the amount of such Optionholder Payment and
SAR Holder Payment shall be reduced by the amount of applicable payroll
withholding Taxes for such Optionholder's or SAR Holder's income and
employment Taxes with respect to such Optionholder Payment or SAR
Holder Payment and (y) the Company or Company Subsidiary shall remit any such
Taxes to the appropriate Governmental Authority. Prior to making any
deduction or withholding from the Purchase Price or other amounts payable
under this Agreement (other than an Optionholder Payment or SAR Holder
Payment), the applicable withholding agent shall provide three (3) days' prior
written notice to the Sellers' Representative of the amounts subject to
deduction or withholding and a reasonable opportunity to provide forms or
other evidence that would mitigate, reduce or eliminate such deduction or
withholding. Buyer, the Escrow Agent and the Company agree to cooperate with
the Sellers' Representative and the Sellers in mitigating, reducing or
eliminating any such deduction or withholding.

2.08 Paying Agent. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall designate
a bank or trust company reasonably satisfactory to Buyer (the
"Paying Agent"), to act as agent for the parties for purposes of, among other
things, distributing to the Sellers, the Optionholders and SARs Holders the
consideration and other amounts to which they are entitled pursuant to this
Agreement. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall enter into a paying agent
agreement, in customary form on terms reasonably acceptable to Buyer, the
Sellers' Representative and the Company (the "Paying Agent Agreement").

3.06 Securities Matters.

  



  

(a) Such Seller acknowledges that the shares comprising the Stock
Consideration are not registered under the Securities Act or any state or
foreign securities Laws on the grounds that the issuance thereof to such
Seller in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is
exempt from otherwise applicable registration requirements, and that the
reliance of Buyer on such exemptions is predicated in part on the
acknowledgements, representations and warranties set forth in this 3.06.

and intelligent decision with respect to the execution, delivery and
performance of the Transaction Documents. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, such Seller acknowledges that Buyer and its Affiliates make no
representation or warranty with respect to any projections, estimates or
budgets delivered to or made available to such Seller of future revenues,
future results of operations (or any component thereof), future cash flows or
future financial condition (or any component thereof) of Buyer and its
subsidiaries or the future business and operations of Buyer and its
subsidiaries or any other information or documents delivered or made available
to such Seller or its Representatives with respect to Buyer and its
subsidiaries or any of the foregoing business, assets, liabilities or
operations, except as expressly set forth in this Agreement.

sophisticated party and has made its own investigation, review and analysis
regarding the Buyer and the transactions contemplated hereby (including its
receipt of Stock Consideration), together with the Representatives that they
have engaged for such purpose. Such Seller is not relying, and has not relied,
upon any statement, representation or warranty, oral or written, express or
implied, made by the Buyer or its Affiliates or Representatives, except as
expressly set forth in ARTICLE V. Neither the Buyer nor any of its Affiliates
or Representatives is making, directly or indirectly, any representation or
warranty with respect to any estimates, projections or forecasts involving the
Buyer. Such Seller acknowledges and agrees that there are inherent
uncertainties in attempting to make such estimates, projections and forecasts
and that it takes full responsibility for making its own evaluation of the
adequacy and accuracy of any such estimates, projections or
forecasts (including the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying any
such estimates, projections or forecasts). Nothing in this 3.07 is intended
to, or shall be deemed to, modify or limit any of the representations or
warranties of the Buyer set forth in ARTICLE V.

  



  

3.08 No Other Representations or Warranties. Except for the
representations and warranties made by the Company in Article IV and the
Sellers in this Article III, none of the Sellers nor any other Person makes
any express or implied representation or warranty with respect to Sellers,
the Company, the Company Subsidiaries, or their respective businesses,
operations, assets, liabilities, conditions (financial or otherwise) or
prospects, and each Seller hereby disclaims any such other representations or
warranties.

Company or obligating the Company to issue or the Company or any Seller to
transfer or sell any Equity Interests or securities convertible into or

There are no outstanding obligations of the Company, any Seller or any other
Person to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any Equity Interests of the
Company. Other than as set forth on 4.02(a) of the Sellers' Disclosure Letter,
the Company does not have outstanding or authorized any share appreciation,
phantom share, profit participation or similar rights. There are no
voting trusts, shareholder agreements, proxies or other agreements or

proper establishment of the Company Subsidiary, to carry on the businesses now
conducted by it, to own, operate or lease the properties and assets now

qualified to do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which
the properties owned or leased by it or the operation of its business as
currently conducted makes such licensing or qualification necessary, except
where the failure to be so licensed or qualified would not, individually or in
the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect. The articles of incorporation
and other organizational documents relating to the Company Subsidiaries are
valid and have been duly approved, to the extent necessary, by the applicable
Governmental Authority. The Equity Interests of each Company Subsidiary have
been duly authorized, are valid and are fully paid and non-assessable.

premium increase with respect to, or alteration of coverage under, any of
such Insurance Policies or that any issuer of any Insurance Policy has filed

under, or has otherwise failed to comply with, in any material respect, any
provision contained in any such Insurance Policy.

notice, order, or other communication from any Governmental Authority or any
other Person of any alleged, actual, or potential material violation of or
material failure to comply by the Company, any Company Subsidiary with any

suspension, termination, or modification of any material Permit. All such
Permits have been obtained by the Company or the Company Subsidiaries, as
applicable, and are in full force and effect without any material default or
material violation thereunder by any party thereto.

  



  

(b) None of the Sellers, the Company, or any Company Subsidiary,
nor, to Sellers' Knowledge, any owner, member, partner, director, officer,
manager, employee, independent contractor, consultant or agent of any of them

statute or regulation relating to antitrust or competition. For the purpose
of this section, a "non-U.S. government official" means any employee

regional or local department, agency, enterprise owned or controlled by a
non-U.S. government, any official of a non-U.S. political party, any official

Response, Removal or Remedial Action.

paid time off, welfare, fringe-benefit and other similar agreement, plan,
policy, program, Contract or arrangement (and any amendments thereto), in
each case whether or not reduced to writing and whether funded or unfunded,
including each "employee benefit plan" within the meaning of Section 3(3) of
ERISA, whether or not tax-qualified and whether or not subject to ERISA, which
is or has been maintained, sponsored, contributed to, or required to be
contributed to by the Company or any Company Subsidiary for the benefit of any
current or former employee, manager, member, officer, director, retiree,
independent contractor or consultant of the Company or any Company Subsidiary
or any spouse or dependent of such individual, or under which the Company or
any Company Subsidiary or any of their ERISA Affiliates has or may have any
Liability, or with respect to which Buyer or any of its Affiliates would,
following the Closing, reasonably be expected to have any Liability,
contingent or otherwise (each a "Benefit Plan"). 4.19(a)(ii) of the Sellers'
Disclosure Letter identifies each Benefit Plan that is a Non-U.S. Benefit Plan
(as defined below) but is not an Excluded Non-U.S. Benefit Plan (as also
defined below).

  



  

(b) With respect to each U.S. Benefit Plan, the Company has
delivered to Buyer true and complete copies of each of the following: (i)
where the U.S. Benefit Plan has been reduced to writing, the plan document
together with all amendments; (ii) where the U.S. Benefit Plan has not been
reduced to writing, a written summary of all material plan terms; (iii) where
applicable, copies of any trust agreements or other funding arrangements,
custodial agreements, insurance policies and Contracts, administration and
service provider agreements and similar agreements, and investment management

(c) Each U.S. Benefit Plan and related trust (other than any
multiemployer plan within the meaning of Section 3(37) of ERISA (each a
"Multiemployer Plan")) has been established, administered and maintained in
accordance with its terms and in material compliance with all applicable Laws
(including ERISA, the Code and any applicable local Laws). Each U.S. Benefit
Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code (a
"Qualified U.S. Benefit Plan") is so qualified and has received a
favorable and current determination letter from the IRS, or with respect to a
prototype plan, can rely on an opinion letter from the IRS to the prototype
plan sponsor, to the effect that such Qualified U.S. Benefit Plan is so
qualified and that the plan and the trust related thereto are exempt from
federal income taxes under Sections 401(a) and 501(a), respectively, of the
Code, and nothing has occurred that could reasonably be expected to adversely
affect the qualified status of any Qualified U.S. Benefit Plan. To
the Company's knowledge, nothing has occurred with respect to any U.S.
Benefit Plan that has subjected or could reasonably be expected to subject
the Company, any Company Subsidiary or any of their ERISA Affiliates or, with
respect to any period on or after the Closing Date, Buyer or any of its
Affiliates, to: (i) a material penalty under Section 502 of ERISA or (ii)
material Taxes, penalties, or Liability for a "prohibited transaction" under
Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code. All required benefits,
contributions and premiums relating to each U.S. Benefit Plan, including any
required contributions to Multiemployer Plans, have been timely paid in
accordance with the terms of such U.S. Benefit Plan and all applicable Laws
and accounting principles, and all benefits accrued under any unfunded U.S.
Benefit Plan have been paid, accrued or otherwise adequately reserved to the
extent required by, and in accordance with, GAAP.

  



    

 | 42| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(d) There remain no unsatisfied Liabilities to participants, the
IRS, the United States Department of Labor, the Pension Benefit
Guaranty Corporation, any Governmental Authority or to any other Person as a
result of the termination of any U.S. Benefit Plan ever maintained by the
Company, any Company Subsidiary or any of their ERISA Affiliates, and no U.S.
Benefit Plan maintained by the Company, any Company Subsidiary or any of
their ERISA Affiliates, which is subject to the minimum funding requirements
of Part 3 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA or subject to Sections 412 and
430 of the Code, is in "at-risk status" as defined under Section 430(i)(4) of
the Code, has failed to satisfy the "minimum funding standard" as provided in
Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code or to make any "minimum
required contribution" as defined in Section 430 of the Code or Section 303
or ERISA, and there has been no waived funding deficiency within the meaning
of Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code.

  



  

(e) Except as otherwise disclosed on 4.19(e) of the Sellers'
Disclosure Letter, neither the Company, any Company Subsidiary, nor any of
their ERISA Affiliates is bound by any collective bargaining agreement or any
Contract to maintain, with respect to any employee of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary, any U.S. Benefit Plan.

  



  

(f) Except as otherwise disclosed on 4.19(f) of the Sellers'
Disclosure Letter no Multiemployer Plan to which the Company, any Company
Subsidiary or any of their ERISA Affiliates is obligated to contribute is in
"reorganization," as defined in Section 4241(a) of ERISA, or is in
"endangered status" or "critical status," as those terms are defined in
Section 432 of the Code and Section 305 of ERISA, or is within a "funding
improvement period" or a "rehabilitation period," as those terms are defined
in Section 432 of the Code and Section 305 of ERISA or has failed to satisfy
the minimum funding standard as provided in Section 412 of the Code and
Section 304 of ERISA. Neither the Company, any Company Subsidiary, nor any of
their ERISA Affiliates is liable for, or anticipated to become liable for, any
excise tax under Section 4971 of the Code or has any Liability with respect
to a withdrawal from any Multiemployer Plan or will withdraw from any
Multiemployer Plan on or before the Closing Date. With respect to any
Multiemployer Plans to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary
contributes or is obligated to contribute, withdrawal Liability in the event
of a current complete withdrawal from all such Multiemployer Plans does not
exceed $2,000,000.

(g) The actuarial present value of "benefit liabilities" (as defined
in Section 4001(a)(16) of ERISA) (both vested and nonvested) of each U.S.
Benefit Plan of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, which is subject to
Title IV of ERISA, is less than or equal to the market value of the assets
held in the trust under such U.S. Benefit Plan as of the most recent actuarial
valuation. The preceding determination has been made in accordance with the
actuarial assumptions used by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation to
determine the level of funding required on an ongoing basis. Since the date of
such most recent actuarial valuation, there has been no material adverse
change in the funding status of any such U.S. Benefit Plan as reflected in the
actuarial report for such valuation. For the purposes of this subsection,
unfunded Liabilities and projected costs have been determined by the Company,
the Company Subsidiaries and their actuaries using actuarial methods and
assumptions that are, singly and in the aggregate, reasonable taking into
account circumstances known to them on the date this representation is being
made and, except as adjusted to satisfy the requirements that such
assumptions be reasonable, consistent with prior practice.

  



  

(h) Neither the Company, any Company Subsidiary nor any of their
ERISA Affiliates has: (i) failed to pay premiums to the Pension Benefit
Guaranty Corporation; (ii) withdrawn from any U.S. Benefit Plan or (iii)
engaged in any transaction which would give rise to Liability under Section
4069 or Section 4212(c) of ERISA.

  



  

(i) With respect to each U.S. Benefit Plan: (i) no such plan is a
"multiple employer plan" within the meaning of Section 413(c) of the Code or
a "multiple employer welfare arrangement" (as defined in Section 3(40) of
ERISA); (ii) no Action has been initiated by the Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation to terminate any such plan or to appoint a trustee for any such
plan and (iii) no "reportable event," as defined in Section 4043 of ERISA,
for which notice has not been waived, has occurred with respect to any such
plan.

  



  

(j) Each U.S. Benefit Plan that is not subject to Title IV or ERISA
may be amended, terminated or otherwise discontinued after the Closing in
accordance with its terms, without material Liabilities to Buyer, the Company,
any Company Subsidiary or any of their Affiliates. Neither the Company nor
any Company Subsidiary has a commitment or obligation or has made any
representations to any employee, officer, director, manager, member,
independent contractor or consultant to adopt, amend, modify or terminate any
U.S. Benefit Plan or any collective bargaining agreement in connection with
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
otherwise.

  



  

(k) Other than as required under Section 601 et. seq. of ERISA or
other Law, no U.S. Benefit Plan provides post-termination or retiree
welfare benefits to any individual for any reason, and neither the Company,
any Company Subsidiary nor any of their ERISA Affiliates has any Liability to
provide post-termination or retiree welfare benefits to any individual or ever
represented, promised or contracted to any individual that such individual
would be provided with post-termination or retiree welfare benefits.

  



  

(l) There is no pending or, to Sellers' Knowledge, threatened Action
relating to a U.S. Benefit Plan (other than routine claims for benefits), and
no U.S. Benefit Plan has within the past three (3) years been the subject of
an examination or audit by a Governmental Authority or the subject of a
pending application or filing under or is a participant in, an amnesty,
voluntary compliance, self-correction or similar program sponsored by any
Governmental Authority.

---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(m) With respect to any insurance policy (or ancillary agreement
with respect to such insurance policy) or premium payment obligation
related to any U.S. Benefit Plan, neither the Company, any Company
Subsidiary, any of their ERISA Affiliates, nor the Buyer shall be subject to
a retroactive rate adjustment, loss sharing arrangement or other actual or
contingent Liability.

  



  

(n) The Company, each Company Subsidiary and each of their ERISA
Affiliates have materially complied with: (i) the notice and
continuation coverage requirements of Section 4980B of the Code and the
regulations thereunder with respect to each U.S. Benefit Plan that is a group
health plan within the meaning of Section 5000(b)(1) of the Code and (ii) the
shared responsibility requirements of Section 4980H of the Code. Each U.S.
Benefit Plan is in compliance in all material respects with the applicable
provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of
1996, as amended, and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010,
as amended, and the regulations issued thereunder.

  



  

(o) There has been no undisclosed amendments to, announcements by
the Company or any Company Subsidiary relating to, or change in
employee participation or coverage under, any U.S. Benefit Plan or collective
bargaining agreement that would increase the annual expense of maintaining
such plan above the level of the expense incurred for the most recently
completed fiscal year with respect to any director, member, manager, officer,
employee, independent contractor or consultant, as applicable.

  



  

(p) Each U.S. Benefit Plan that is subject to Section 409A of the
Code has been administered in material compliance with its terms and
the operational and documentary requirements of Section 409A of the Code and
all applicable regulatory guidance (including notices, rulings and proposed
and final regulations) thereunder. Neither the Company nor any Company
Subsidiary has any obligation to gross up, indemnify or otherwise reimburse
any individual for any excise taxes, interest or penalties incurred pursuant
to Section 409A of the Code.

  



  

(q) Except as set forth on 4.19(q) of the Sellers' Disclosure
Letter, neither the execution of this Agreement nor any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement will (either alone or upon the occurrence of
any additional or subsequent events): (i) entitle any current or former
director, member, manager, officer, employee, independent contractor or
consultant of the Company or any Company Subsidiary to severance pay or any
other payment; (ii) accelerate the time of payment, funding or vesting, or
increase the amount of compensation due to any such individual; (iii) limit
or restrict the right of the Company or any Company Subsidiary to merge,
amend or terminate any U.S. Benefit Plan; (iv) increase the amount payable
under or result in any other material obligation pursuant to any U.S. Benefit
Plan; (v) result in "excess parachute payments" within the meaning of Section
280G(b) of the Code or (vi) require a "gross-up" or other payment to any
"disqualified individual" within the meaning of Section 280G(c) of the Code.

each Benefit Plan maintained primarily for the benefit of current or former

and correct copies of the executed commitment letter, dated as of the
date hereof between the Buyer, Bank of America, N.A., Merrill Lynch, Pierce,
Fenner and Smith Incorporated, Deutsche Bank AG New York Branch and Deutsche
Bank Securities Inc. (the "Debt Financing Commitment"), pursuant to which,
upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein (subject to
certain "flex" provisions in certain fee letters, which provisions are not
material to the Company), Bank of America, N.A., Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner
and Smith Incorporated, Deutsche Bank AG New York Branch and Deutsche Bank
Securities Inc. have agreed to lend the amounts set forth therein (the
"Stated Debt Financing") for the purpose of funding the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. The Debt Financing Commitment has not been
amended or modified prior to the date of this Agreement, and, as of the date
hereof, the commitment contained in the Debt Financing Commitment has not
been withdrawn, terminated or rescinded. As of the date hereof, there are no
other agreements, side letters or arrangements to which the Buyer is a party
relating to the Debt Financing Commitment that would reasonably be
expected to adversely affect in any material respect the availability of the
Stated Debt Financing. As of the date hereof, the Debt Financing Commitment
is in full force and effect and constitutes the legal, valid and binding
obligations of Buyer and, to the Knowledge of the Buyer, the other parties
thereto. There are no conditions precedent related to the funding of the full
amount of the Stated Debt Financing (including any of the aforesaid "flex"
provisions), other than as expressly set forth in the Debt
Financing Commitment. As of the date hereof, no event has occurred which
would result in any breach or violation of or constitute a default (or an
event which with notice or lapse of time or both would become a default) by
the Buyer under the Debt Financing Commitment, and the Buyer does not have
any reason to believe that any of the conditions to the Stated Debt Financing
will not be satisfied or that the Stated Debt Financing (and/or other debt
arrangements, which may be in the form of bank facilities, bond issuances or
otherwise (including the Stated Debt Financing, the "Debt Financing")) will
not be available to the Buyer on the Closing Date in an amount sufficient to
pay the amounts required under this Agreement assuming compliance by Sellers
with their obligations hereunder. The Buyer has fully paid all commitment
fees or other fees required to be paid on or prior to the date hereof
pursuant to the Debt Financing Commitment. At the Closing, the Buyer will have
sufficient cash, available lines of credit or other sources of immediately
available funds to pay the Cash Payment and all anticipated related fees and
expenses and other anticipated amounts payable under this Agreement.

5.08 Buyer's Investigation and Reliance.

  



  

The Buyer is a sophisticated purchaser and has made its own investigation,
review and analysis regarding the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, the
Sellers and the transactions contemplated hereby, together with the
Representatives that they have engaged for such purpose. The Buyer is not
relying, and has not relied, upon any statement, representation or warranty,
oral or written, express or implied, made by the Company or its Affiliates or
Representatives, except as expressly set forth in this Agreement or the
Sellers' Disclosure Letter. Neither the Sellers nor the Company (nor any of
their Affiliates or Representatives) is making, directly or indirectly, any
representation or warranty with respect to any estimates, projections or
forecasts involving the Company and Company Subsidiaries, including as
contained in any information memorandum. The Buyer acknowledges and agrees
that there are inherent uncertainties in attempting to make such estimates,
projections and forecasts and that it takes full responsibility for making its
own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of any such estimates,
projections or forecasts (including the reasonableness of the assumptions
underlying any such estimates, projections or forecasts). Nothing in this
5.08 is intended to, or shall be deemed to, modify or limit any of the
representations or warranties of the Sellers set forth in Articles III or IV.

received during the last three (3) years, any written notice, order, or other
communication from any Governmental Authority or any other Person of any
alleged, actual, or potential material violation of or material failure to
comply by the Buyer or any real property owned, leased, subleased or occupied
by the Buyer with any applicable material Law or Permit. To the Knowledge of
the Buyer, there are no facts or circumstances that could reasonably be
expected (with or without the passage of time) to result in any such notice or
in the revocation, suspension, termination, or modification of any material
Permit. All such Permits have been obtained by the Buyer or a subsidiary of
Buyer, and are in full force and effect without any material default or
material violation thereunder by any party thereto.

non-U.S. government official as incentive for the official to complete some

payment or (vi) received any unlawful discounts or rebates in violation of any
statute or regulation relating to antitrust or competition. For the purpose
of this section, a "non-U.S. government official" means any employee or
officer of a government of a non-U.S. country, including any federal, regional
or local department, agency, enterprise owned or controlled by a non-U.S.
government, any official of a non-U.S. political party, any official or
employee of a public international organization, any person acting in an
official capacity for, or on behalf of, such entities, and any candidate for
non-U.S. political office.

  



  

(d) During the last three (3) years, neither the Buyer, nor, to
Buyer's Knowledge, any owner, member, partner, director, officer,

Sellers' Representative or any of their respective Affiliates in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the taking of any
action contemplated by this Agreement, (iv) obtaining (and cooperating with

instruments necessary to fully carry out the purposes of this Agreement.

  



  

(b) The parties hereto shall each keep each other apprised of the
status of matters relating to the completion of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and work cooperatively in connection with
obtaining all required consents, authorizations, Orders or approvals of, or
any exemptions by, any Governmental Authority undertaken pursuant to the
provisions of this 6.05. The parties hereto shall consult with each other
with respect to the obtaining of all permits, consents, approvals and
authorizations of all third parties and Governmental Authorities necessary or

shall cause their respective counsel to reasonably collaborate with each other
to prepare any written materials that will be jointly submitted to any third
person or any Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions

written submission to any Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding the
foregoing (and subject to 6.08, the Mutual Confidentiality Agreement dated
December 16, 2015, as amended, between Buyer and the Company (the
"Confidentiality Agreement") and the Joint Defense Agreement dated June 16,
2016 and executed by the respective counsel of Buyer and the Company on
behalf of Buyer, the Company and Affiliates of the Company and Company
Subsidiaries), Buyer, Gulf Houghton and the Company may, as each reasonably
deems advisable and necessary, designate any competitively sensitive material
provided to the other under this 6.05(b) as "Outside Counsel Only Material."
Such materials and the information contained therein shall be given only to
the outside counsel of the recipient on the basis that such outside
counsel agrees not to disclose such information to employees, officers or
directors of the recipient unless express permission is obtained in advance
from the source of the materials (Buyer, Gulf Houghton or the Company, as the
case may be) or its legal counsel. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this 6.05, materials provided pursuant to this 6.05 may be
redacted (i) to remove references concerning the valuation of the Company,
(ii) as necessary to comply with contractual arrangements and (iii) as
necessary to address reasonable privilege concerns.

(c) Buyer and the Sellers' Representative shall use reasonable best
efforts to make or file with the appropriate Governmental Authority all
filings, forms, registrations and notifications required (whether by Law or
in order to satisfy the conditions set forth in 8.01(a)) to be filed to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under any
applicable Antitrust Law, and subsequent to such filings and subject to the
terms and conditions of 6.05(b), Buyer and the Sellers' Representative will

extent reasonably available). Buyer and the Sellers' Representative shall
file their notification and report forms under the HSR Act within fifteen (15)
Business Days after the date of this Agreement or when advisable. Subject to
6.05(b) and the last sentence of this 6.05(c), in the event that the parties
receive a request for information or documentary material pursuant to any
Antitrust Law, including the HSR Act (any such request pursuant to the HSR
Act, a "Second Request"), the parties will use their respective
reasonable best efforts to submit an appropriate response to, and to certify
compliance as soon as reasonably practicable with, any such request for
information or documentary material, and counsel for both parties will closely
cooperate during the entirety of any review process pursuant to any Antitrust
Law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer may, if Buyer in good faith believes

service with the Buyer, the Company or any of their respective subsidiaries,
in each case, to the extent such service would have been recognized by the
Company or the Company Subsidiaries under analogous Benefit Plans prior to the

6.26 Shareholder Approval of Parachute Payments.

  



  

(a) Following the signing of this Agreement, the Company shall use
its best efforts to obtain executed and effective "waivers," in a form
reasonably acceptable to Buyer, from any individuals who are "disqualified
individuals" (as defined in Section 280G(c) of the Code) of the Company and
who would reasonably be expected to receive in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (either alone or in
conjunction with any other event) any "parachute payment" (within the meaning
of Section 280G of the Code) that is subject to the imposition of an excise
Tax under Section 4999 of the Code or that would not be deductible by reason
of Section 280G of the Code of an amount of such parachute payments sufficient
to reduce such individual's aggregate parachute payments to an amount that is
less than three (3) times such individual's "base amount" (within the meaning
of Section 280G of the Code and the regulations thereunder) (the "280G
Waivers").

  



  

(b) Following the delivery by the Company to Buyer of each of the
executed 280G Waivers (if the Company was able to obtain such waivers)
described in 6.26(a) and following the disclosure of any information from
Buyer required pursuant to but prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall
submit to its shareholders for approval, in a manner that complies with the
approval requirements of Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and the
regulations thereunder and is reasonably satisfactory to Buyer, any payments
and/or benefits that separately or in the aggregate, could reasonably be
expected to be deemed to constitute "parachute payments" (within the meaning
of Section 280G of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder) for
which an executed 280G Waiver was obtained or for which no waiver is
necessary, such that upon obtaining such approval of the Company shareholders
such payments and benefits would not be deemed to be "parachute payments"
under Section 280G of the Code. In addition, the Company shall deliver to
Buyer evidence reasonably satisfactory to Buyer that either (i) a vote of the
Company shareholders was solicited in conformance with the requirements of
Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder,
and the requisite approval of the shareholders was obtained with respect to
any payments and/or benefits that were subject to the vote of the Company
shareholders (the "280G Approval") or (ii) the 280G Approval was not obtained
and as a consequence, that such "parachute payments" shall not be made or
provided pursuant to the 280G Waivers.

  



  

(c) To the extent not already provided, Buyer as reasonably
requested by the Company shall promptly provide the Company and its
counsel, in writing, with all relevant terms of any employment contracts or
other arrangements that Buyer intends to enter into with the "disqualified
individuals" (as defined in Section 280G(c) of the Code) of the Company on or
around the Closing Date that include any such terms that could reasonably be
expected to result in payments and other terms (including, but not
limited to, rights to severance or signing bonuses) that need to be approved
(or disclosed) to ensure the disclosure to the Company shareholders and the
approval described in 6.26(b) is valid.

  



  

6.27 Further Assurances. Following the Closing, each of the parties
hereto shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, execute and
deliver such additional documents, instruments, conveyances and assurances and
take such further actions as may be reasonably required to carry out the
provisions hereof and give effect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

when due. The Buyer shall, 50% at the Buyer's expense and 50% at the Sellers'

harmless from and against any Loss attributable to any breach or violation
of, or failure to fully perform, any covenant, agreement, undertaking or
obligation in ARTICLE VII. Sellers shall reimburse Buyer for any Taxes of the
Company and any Company Subsidiary that are the responsibility of Sellers
pursuant to this 7.01 within ten (10) Business Days after payment of such
Taxes by Buyer, the Company or the Company Subsidiary. Buyer shall not, and
shall not cause the Company or a Company Subsidiary to, amend any Tax Return
of the Company or a Company Subsidiary filed before the date of this Agreement
without the consent of the Sellers' Representative (which shall not be

Company Subsidiary, Buyer or any of Buyer's Affiliates which involves the

pursuant to this ARTICLE VII (a "Tax Claim");  _provided, that_ failure to
comply with this provision shall not affect Buyer's right to indemnification
hereunder except and only to the extent that Sellers forfeit material rights
or defenses by reason of such failure. The Sellers' Representative may, at
the Sellers' own expense, participate in and assume the defense of any Tax
Claim; provided, however, that the Sellers' Representative acknowledges in
writing the Sellers' responsibility to indemnify and hold harmless the Buyer
Indemnitees with respect to all Taxes at issue in such Tax Claim. If
the Sellers' Representative assumes such defense, the
Sellers' Representative shall control all proceedings taken in connection
with such Tax Claim (including selection of counsel) and may, in its
reasonable discretion, pursue or forego any and all administrative appeals,
proceedings, hearings and conferences with any Taxing authority with respect
thereto, and may, in its reasonable discretion, either pay the Tax claimed and
sue for refund where applicable law permits such refund suits or contest the
tax claim in any permissible manner; _provided, however_ , that (i) Buyer
shall have the right to participate in any such Tax Claim and the Sellers'
Representative shall provide Buyer with copies of all written communications
relating to the Tax Claim, (ii) the Sellers' Representative shall keep Buyer
informed regarding the progress of such Tax Claim and consult with Buyer with
respect to any issue that could have an adverse effect on Buyer, the Company
or any Company Subsidiary and (iii) the Sellers' Representative shall not
settle or otherwise resolve any Tax Claim (or any issue raised in any Tax
Claim) without the prior written consent of Buyer (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed).

Representative and Buyer shall provide each other with such cooperation and
information as either of them reasonably may request of the other in filing

or other proceeding in respect of Taxes of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary. Such cooperation and information shall include providing copies of
relevant Tax Returns or portions thereof, together with accompanying
schedules, related work papers and documents relating to rulings or other
determinations by tax authorities. Each of the Sellers and Buyer shall retain
all Tax Returns, schedules and work papers, records and other documents in its
possession relating to Tax matters of the Company and the Company

extensions for the respective Tax periods.

contained in 4.21 (Taxes), 4.07(s), 4.19(p) or 4.19(q) to the extent those
provisions relate to Taxes) with respect to any individual occurrence
unless and until the aggregate amount of Losses suffered by the Buyer
Indemnitee arising from such occurrence or series of related
occurrences exceeds or may reasonably be expected to exceed $400,000. The
Sellers, Optionholders and SAR Holders shall not be liable to the Buyer
Indemnitees for indemnification under 9.02(a) (other than in respect of Losses
that arise from any inaccuracy in or breach of any Fundamental Representation
or the representations and warranties contained in 4.21 (Taxes),
4.07(s), 4.19(p) or 4.19(q) to the extent those provisions relate to Taxes)
until the aggregate amount of all Losses in respect of indemnification under
9.02(a) exceeds $5,000,000 (the "Deductible Amount"), in which event the
Sellers, Optionholders and SAR Holders shall be required to pay or be liable
for all such Losses in excess of the Deductible Amount, subject to the terms
of this ARTICLE IX.

  



  

(b) No Seller Indemnitee shall make an indemnity claim under 9.03(a)
(other than in respect of Losses that arise from any inaccuracy in or breach
of any Fundamental Representation) with respect to any individual occurrence
unless and until the aggregate amount of Losses suffered by the Seller
Indemnitee arising from such occurrence or series of related occurrences
exceeds or may be reasonably expected to exceed $400,000. Buyer shall not be
liable to the Seller Indemnitees for indemnification under 9.03(a)
(other than in respect of Losses that arise from any inaccuracy in or breach
of any Fundamental Representation) until the aggregate amount of all Losses
in respect of indemnification under 9.03(a) exceeds the Deductible Amount, in
which event Buyer shall be required to pay or be liable for all such Losses
in excess of the Deductible Amount.

  



  

(c) Subject to 9.04(d), the aggregate amount of all Losses for which
the Sellers, Optionholders and SAR Holders shall be liable pursuant to
9.02(a) shall not exceed an amount equal to the Indemnification Escrow Amount
(the "Cap") and the aggregate amount of all Losses for which Buyer shall be
liable pursuant to 9.03(a) shall not exceed the Cap.

  



  

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the limitations set forth in
9.04(c) shall not apply to Losses that arise from any inaccuracy in or
breach of any Fundamental Representation; _provided_ , _that_ , the aggregate
amount of all Losses for which (i) the Sellers, Optionholders and SAR Holders
shall be liable pursuant to this Agreement shall not exceed an amount equal to
the Purchase Price, (ii) the Optionholders and SAR Holders shall be liable
pursuant to this Agreement shall not exceed an amount equal to the Cap
and (iii) the Buyer shall be liable pursuant to this Agreement shall not
exceed the Purchase Price.

---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(e) For purposes of this ARTICLE IX, if it is determined that an
Indemnified Party is entitled to recover Losses arising out of any inaccuracy
in or breach of any representation or warranty set forth herein, all
qualifications as to materiality, Material Adverse Effect, Buyer Material
Adverse Effect or other similar qualification shall be disregarded for the
purpose of the calculation of Losses that resulted from any such breach of
such representation or warranty.

  



  

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary elsewhere in this
Agreement, no party shall, in any event, be liable to any other Person for (i)
any consequential, incidental or indirect Losses, except to the extent such
Losses are either reasonably foreseeable or payable by a Buyer Indemnitee to
a Person other than a Buyer Indemnitee or by a Seller Indemnitee to a Person
other than a Seller Indemnitee or (ii) special or punitive Losses, except to
the extent that such Losses are payable by a Buyer Indemnitee to a Person
other than a Buyer Indemnitee or by a Seller Indemnitee to a Person other
than a Seller Indemnitee.

  



  

(g) The Buyer Indemnitees shall not be entitled to indemnification
for any Losses to the extent a Liability with respect to such Loss
was specifically reserved against and reflected on the Financial Statements,
unless such liability exceeds the amount of such reserve, which shall be the
Sellers', Optionholders' and SAR Holders' responsibility, subject to the terms
of this Agreement.

  



  

(h) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, except (i) in the case of fraud or (ii) with respect to any
Fundamental Representation, each Seller's, Optionholder's and SAR Holder's
maximum aggregate indemnification liability pursuant to 9.02(a) shall be such
Seller's, Optionholder's and SAR Holder's share of the Indemnification
Escrow Amount; provided that the foregoing remains subject to 9.04(d). The
sole and exclusive recourse for any amount finally determined to be owed in
respect of any indemnity obligations pursuant to 9.02(a) (except (i) in the
case of fraud or (ii) with respect to any Fundamental Representation) shall
be the Indemnification Escrow Amount.

  



  

(i) The Seller Indemnitees shall not make any claim for contribution
from the Company or any Company Subsidiary or any of their
respective officers, directors, members, managers or employees with respect
to any indemnity claims arising under or in connection with this Agreement to
the extent that any Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification hereunder
for such claim. The Seller Indemnitees hereby waive any such right of
contribution from the Company, any Company Subsidiary and any of their
respective officers, directors, members, managers or employees they have or
may have in the future. The Seller Indemnitees further agree not to make,
directly or indirectly, and hereby waive, any claim for indemnification
against the Company or any Company Subsidiary by reason of the fact that the
Seller Indemnitees or any of their Affiliates or Representatives was a member,
manager, officer, director, employee or agent of the Company or a Company
Subsidiary (whether such claim is for Losses or otherwise and whether such
claim is pursuant to any Law, organizational document, Contract or otherwise)
with respect to any Action brought by a Buyer Indemnitee against any Seller,
Optionholder or SAR Holder or any Affiliate or Representative thereof (whether
such claim is pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise).

(j) The Sellers, Optionholders and SAR Holders shall have no
obligation to indemnify any Buyer Indemnitee with respect to any breach
of the representations in Section 4.18 to the extent (i) arising out of any
sampling of soil, groundwater, soil vapor or other environmental media at the
Real Property by Buyer, except as required under Environmental Laws or by any
Governmental Authority; (ii) arising out of the intentional encouragement by
Buyer of any Action by any Governmental Authority or any other Person;
(iii) arising out of any change of use of the Real Property after the Closing
Date; (iv) arising out of any Response, Removal or Remedial Action that is
not conducted to eliminate or control any risk from the presence or Release of
Hazardous Substances consistent with the least stringent applicable
remediation standard acceptable to the relevant Governmental Authority; (v)
arising out of the management of any building component that contains or is
covered with any Hazardous Substance in compliance with Environmental Laws;
(vi) Losses are incurred to replace, repair, improve, or upgrade any
building, structure, plant, or equipment, unless such activity is required or
is undertaken as a necessary part of any Response, Removal, or Remedial
Action; or (vii) arising out of any change in Environmental Law after the
Closing Date. In connection with any site remediation, the "least stringent
applicable remediation standard" shall include the use of reasonable deed
restrictions and engineering controls to limit exposure to contaminants that
are allowed to remain in place, to the extent such restrictions or controls
would not interfere with site operations and are acceptable to the relevant
Governmental Entity. It is understood that sampling or other testing of soil,
groundwater, soil vapor or other environmental media at the Real Property may
be required under Environmental Law or by any Governmental Authority in
connection with a capital improvement, repair, routine maintenance or
operating activities.

  



  

9.05 Indemnification Procedures. The party making a claim under this
ARTICLE IX is referred to as the "Indemnified Party", and the party against
whom such claims are asserted under this ARTICLE IX is referred to as the
"Indemnifying Party".

  



    

 | 87| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(a) _Third Party Claims_. If any Indemnified Party receives notice
of the assertion or commencement of any Action made or brought by any Person
who is not a party to this Agreement or an Affiliate of a party to this
Agreement or a Representative of the foregoing (a "Third Party Claim")
against such Indemnified Party with respect to which the Indemnifying Party is
obligated to provide indemnification under this Agreement, the Indemnified
Party shall give the Indemnifying Party prompt written notice thereof, but in
any event not later than twenty (20) days after receipt of such notice of such
Third Party Claim. The failure to give such prompt written notice shall not,
however, relieve the Indemnifying Party of its indemnification obligations,
except and only to the extent that, as a result of such failure, the
Indemnifying Party forfeits material rights or defenses, was deprived of its
right to recover any material payment under its applicable insurance coverage,
or was otherwise materially prejudiced, in each case, by reason of such
failure. Such notice by the Indemnified Party shall describe the Third Party
Claim in reasonable detail, shall include copies of all material written
evidence thereof and shall indicate the estimated amount, if reasonably
calculable, of the Loss that has been or may be sustained by the Indemnified
Party. The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to participate in, or by
giving written notice to the Indemnified Party, to assume the defense of any
Third Party Claim at the Indemnifying Party's expense and by the Indemnifying
Party's own counsel (reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party), and the
Indemnified Party shall cooperate in good faith in such defense; _provided,
that_ if the Indemnifying Party is any Seller, Optionholder or SAR Holder
such Indemnifying Party shall not have the right to defend or direct the
defense of any such Third Party Claim that (x) is asserted directly by or on
behalf of a Person that is a supplier or customer of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary, or (y) seeks relief other than solely the payment of
money damages against the Indemnified Party. In the event that the
Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any Third Party Claim, subject to
9.05(b), it shall have the right to take such action as it deems necessary to
avoid, dispute, defend, appeal or make counterclaims pertaining to any such
Third Party Claim in the name and on behalf of the Indemnified Party. If the
Indemnifying Party elects not to compromise or defend such Third Party Claim,
fails to promptly notify the Indemnified Party in writing of its election to
defend as provided in this Agreement, or fails to diligently prosecute the
defense of such Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party may, subject to
9.05(b), pay, compromise, defend such Third Party Claim and seek
indemnification for any and all Losses based upon, arising from or relating to
such Third Party Claim. The Indemnified Party shall have the right to
participate in the defense of any Third Party Claim with counsel selected by
it subject to the Indemnifying Party's right, subject to 9.05(b), to control
the defense thereof. The fees and disbursements of such counsel shall be at
the expense of the Indemnified Party. The Sellers' Representative and Buyer
shall cooperate with each other in all reasonable respects in connection with
the defense of any Third Party Claim, including making available (subject to
6.08) records relating to such Third Party Claim and furnishing, without
expense (other than reimbursement of actual out-of-pocket expenses) to the
defending party, management employees of the non-defending party as may be
reasonably necessary for the preparation of the defense of such Third Party
Claim.

  



  

(b) _Settlement of Third Party Claims_. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, the Indemnifying Party shall not enter into
settlement of any Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Party, except as provided in this 9.05(b). If a firm offer is
made to settle a Third Party Claim without leading to Liability or the
creation of a financial or other obligation on the part of the Indemnified
Party and provides, in customary form, for the unconditional release of each
Indemnified Party from all Liabilities and obligations in connection with
such Third Party Claim and the Indemnifying Party desires to accept and
agree to such offer, the Indemnifying Party shall give written notice to that
effect to the Indemnified Party. If the Indemnified Party fails to consent to
such firm offer within ten (10) days after its receipt of such notice, the
Indemnified Party may continue to contest or defend such Third Party Claim
and in such event, the maximum Liability of the Indemnifying Party as to such
Third Party Claim shall not exceed the amount of such settlement offer. If
the Indemnified Party fails to consent to such firm offer and also fails to
assume defense of such Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party may settle
the Third Party Claim upon the terms set forth in such firm offer to settle
such Third Party Claim. If the Indemnified Party has assumed the defense
pursuant to 9.05(a), it shall not agree to any settlement without the written
consent of the Indemnifying Party (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed).

  



    

 | 88| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(c) _Direct Claims_. Any Action by an Indemnified Party on account
of a Loss which does not result from a Third Party Claim (a "Direct Claim")
shall be asserted by the Indemnified Party giving the Indemnifying Party
written notice thereof. The failure to give such written notice shall not,
however, relieve the Indemnifying Party of its indemnification obligations,
except and only to the extent that, as a result of such failure, the
Indemnifying Party forfeits material rights or defenses, was deprived of
its right to recover any material payment under its applicable insurance
coverage, or was otherwise materially prejudiced, in each case, by reason of
such failure. Such notice by the Indemnified Party shall describe the Direct
Claim in reasonable detail, shall include copies of all material written
evidence thereof and shall indicate the estimated amount, if reasonably
calculable, of the Loss that has been or may be sustained by the Indemnified
Party. The Indemnifying Party shall have thirty (30) days after its
receipt of such notice to respond in writing to such Direct Claim. The
Indemnified Party shall allow the Indemnifying Party and its
Representatives to investigate the matter or circumstance alleged to give
rise to the Direct Claim, and whether and to what extent any amount
is payable in respect of the Direct Claim and the Indemnified Party shall
assist the Indemnifying Party's investigation by giving such information and
assistance (including access to the Company's or Company Subsidiary's, as
applicable, premises and personnel and the right to examine and copy any
accounts, documents or records) as the Indemnifying Party or any of its
Representatives may reasonably request. If the Indemnifying Party does not so
respond within such thirty (30) day period, the Indemnifying Party shall be
deemed to have rejected such claim, in which case the Indemnified Party shall
be free to pursue such remedies as may be available to the Indemnified Party
on the terms and subject to the provisions of this Agreement.

  



  

(d) _Tax Claims_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, the control of any claim, assertion, event or proceeding
in respect of Taxes of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries (including,
but not limited to, any such claim in respect of a breach of the
representations and warranties in 4.21 (Taxes) hereof or any breach or
violation of or failure to fully perform any covenant, agreement, undertaking
or obligation in ARTICLE VII) shall be governed exclusively by ARTICLE VII
hereof.

  



  

9.06 Payments. Once a Loss is agreed to by the Indemnifying Party or
finally adjudicated to be payable pursuant to this ARTICLE IX:

  



  

(a) the Indemnifying Party shall satisfy its obligations within ten
(10) Business Days of such agreement or final, non-appealable adjudication by
wire transfer of immediately available funds in accordance with the Escrow
Agreement, if applicable; and

  



  

(b) if such Loss is payable from the Indemnification Escrow Funds,
Buyer and the Sellers' Representative shall deliver to the Escrow Agent a
Joint Written Instruction instructing the Escrow Agent that the payment in
respect of such Loss shall be comprised of cash and Stock Consideration in
the same proportion as the value of the cash and Stock Consideration
comprising the Indemnification Escrow Funds immediately prior to such payment
(with the value of a share of such Stock Consideration being equal to, for
this purpose, the volume-weighted trading average of a share of Buyer Common
Stock (regardless of whether such Stock Consideration consists of Buyer
Common Stock or preferred stock) for the ten (10) trading days prior to the
date on which such Loss is to be paid).

  



  

9.07 Tax Treatment of Indemnification Payments. All indemnification
payments made under this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement shall be treated
by the parties as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes, unless
otherwise required by Law.

  



    

 | 89| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

9.08 Exclusive Remedies. Subject to 11.11, the parties acknowledge
and agree that their exclusive remedy with respect to any and all claims
(other than claims arising from fraud on the part of a party hereto in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) for any
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or obligation set
forth herein or otherwise relating to the subject matter of this Agreement,
shall be pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in ARTICLE
VII and this ARTICLE IX. In furtherance of the foregoing, each party hereby
waives any and all rights, claims and causes of action in connection with any
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or obligation set
forth herein or otherwise relating to the subject matter of this Agreement it
may have against the other parties hereto and their Affiliates and each
of their respective Representatives arising under or based upon any Law
(including any Environmental Law), except pursuant to the indemnification
provisions set forth in ARTICLE VII and this ARTICLE IX. Nothing in this 9.08
shall limit any Person's right to seek and obtain any equitable relief to
which any Person shall be entitled or to seek any remedy on account of any
party's fraud. The Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall
reasonably cooperate with each other with respect to resolving any claim or
liability with respect to which Party is obligated to indemnify the other
Party hereunder. In furtherance of the foregoing, the Indemnified Parties
shall take, and shall cause each of their respective Affiliates to take, all
commercially reasonable steps to mitigate any Losses upon becoming aware of
any event that would reasonably be expected to, or does, give rise to Losses.

  



  

9.09 Indemnification Escrow Period. Buyer and the Sellers'
Representative shall deliver a Joint Written Instruction to the Escrow Agent
on the date that is twelve (12) months after the Closing Date and on the date
that is eighteen (18) months after the Closing Date, in each case, in
accordance with the Escrow Agreement.

  



  

9.10 Insurance Proceeds. The amount of Losses recoverable by an
Indemnified Party pursuant to this Article IX with respect to an
indemnity claim shall be reduced by the amount of insurance proceeds or other
amounts actually recovered by such Indemnified Party with respect to the
Losses to which such indemnity claim relates, net of any expenses related to
the receipt of such payment, including retrospective premium adjustments, if
any, occasioned by such Losses; and (b) any Tax Benefit actually realized by
the Indemnified Party in the taxable period in which the Losses occurred or
in the taxable period immediately thereafter. For purposes of this Agreement,
a "Tax Benefit" means the actual reduction of Tax liabilities (calculated on
the basis of the actual reduction in cash payments for Taxes) from an
increase in deductions, losses or tax credits or decrease in the income, gain
or recapture of tax credits that the Indemnified Party or any subsidiary or
other affiliated entity thereof actually reported or took into account (other
than by way of any increase in basis). Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary, if the Tax Return for the taxable period in which the Losses
occurred has yet to be filed at the time that an indemnity payment is to be
made, the amount of the Loss recoverable by an Indemnified Party pursuant to
this Article IX with respect to an indemnity claim shall not be reduced by
the amount of any Tax Benefit; and, instead, the Indemnified Party shall pay
to the Indemnifying Party the amount of such Tax Benefit within five (5)
Business Days after the filing of the Tax Return for the taxable period in
which the Tax Benefit is actually realized.

complied with by it before the Closing;

11.03 Interpretation.  For purposes of this Agreement: (a) the words
"include," "includes" and "including" shall be deemed to be followed by the
words "without limitation"; (b) the word "or" is not exclusive; (c) the words
"herein," "hereof," "hereby," "hereto" and "hereunder" refer to this
Agreement as a whole and (d) when calculating the period of time before which,

misconduct or gross negligence. The obligations of the Sellers, Optionholders
and SAR Holders under this Section shall be borne by the Sellers pro rata in
accordance with the proportion of the Purchase Price allocated to each such
party in accordance with the Allocation Certificate.

incorporated in India ("Gulf India"), is executing this Agreement solely for
purposes of _Section 1(c)_.

WHEREAS, The Company and its subsidiaries are engaged in the business of
manufacturing, distributing and/or selling one or more of the following
formulated chemical specialty product lines: fire resistant hydraulic fluids,
semi-synthetic and specialty metalworking fluids, cleaning fluids, cold-
rolling oils, hot-rolling oils, and specialty industrial greases (such

Effective Date, the "Company Business").

  



  

WHEREAS, Buyer and its subsidiaries are engaged in the business of

specialty product lines or chemical management services ("CMS"), (i) rolling

steel and by manufacturers of aluminum in the hot rolling of aluminum); (ii)
corrosion preventives (used by steel and metalworking customers generally to
protect metal during manufacture, storage, and shipment); (iii) metal
finishing compounds (used to prepare metal surfaces for special treatments
such as, but not limited to, galvanizing and tin plating and to prepare metal
for further processing); (iv) machining and grinding compounds (typically used
by customers in cutting, shaping, and grinding metal parts which require
special treatment to enable them to tolerate the manufacturing process,

with the Company Business, the "Combined Business").

  



    



 



    



  

WHEREAS, Buyer, Gulf Houghton and other shareholders of the Company are
parties to a Share Purchase Agreement dated as of April __, 2017, under
which Buyer is acquiring the Shares (the "Purchase Agreement"). Capitalized
terms used herein but not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings
given to such terms in the Purchase Agreement.

  



  

WHEREAS, Sellers, together with the Company, have been substantially involved
in and with the Company's operations and management and possess trade secrets
and other confidential information relating to the Company Business and the
Company's clients, customers, vendors, suppliers and operations.

  



  

WHEREAS, it is integral to Buyer's acquisition of the Company Business and a
condition precedent to the closing of the transactions contemplated by the
Purchase Agreement that the Sellers enter into this Agreement with Buyer to
provide for the protection of the Combined Business's customer and vendor
relationships, trade secrets, confidential information and other business
operations. Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, Gulf Houghton shall receive
cash consideration and shares of Buyer's capital stock in exchange for the
Shares owned by Gulf Houghton and as inducement for Gulf Houghton and the
other Sellers to enter into this Agreement.

  



  

NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this
Agreement and in the Purchase Agreement, the parties, intending to be legally
bound, agree as follows:

  



  

1. _Confidentiality; Non-competition; Non-solicitation_.

  



  

(a) From and after the date hereof, each Seller shall, and shall
cause its Affiliates to, hold, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause its or their respective Representatives to hold, in confidence any and
all information, whether written or oral, concerning Buyer, the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries, except to the extent that such Seller can show that
such information: (i) is generally available to and known by the public
through no fault of any Seller or any of their respective Affiliates or
Representatives or (ii) is lawfully acquired by such Seller, any of its
Affiliates or their respective Representatives from and after the date
hereof from sources that are not prohibited from disclosing such information
by a legal, contractual or fiduciary obligation. If any Seller or any of its
Affiliates or their respective Representatives are compelled to disclose any
information by judicial or administrative process or by other requirements of
Law, such Seller shall promptly notify Buyer in writing and shall disclose
only that portion of such information that such Seller is advised by its
counsel is legally required to be disclosed, _provided that_ such
Seller shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain an appropriate protective
order or other reasonable assurance that confidential treatment will be
accorded such information.

  



    

 | 2| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) Each Seller agrees that for a period commencing on the Effective
Date and ending two years after the Closing Date (the "Non-Compete Period"),
it shall not, other than solely through its direct or indirect ownership of
Buyer's capital stock or any other interests in Buyer, directly, or
indirectly, including through or on behalf of a subsidiary, anywhere in the
world, excluding India: ( _i_ ) own, manage, operate or control any business
which competes with any Combined Business or ( _ii_ ) be or become a
shareholder, partner, member or owner of any Person who is engaged in any
Combined Business; _provided_ , _however_  that nothing in this Agreement
shall:

  



   | (i)| prohibit or restrict any Seller, directly or indirectly, from
owning, as a passive investor, not more than five (5%) percent collectively
and in the aggregate of any class of outstanding publicly traded securities
of any Person so engaged;  
---|---|--- 
  



   | (ii)| prohibit or restrict any Seller, directly or indirectly, from
engaging in such Seller's business as conducted on the Effective Date and
reasonable extensions thereof, which may include routine, day-to-day
transactions with any entity, and  
---|---|--- 
  



   | (iii)| apply to or restrict any business of which a Seller
acquires control after the Effective Date provided that the acquired business
did not receive more than $25,000,000 of its aggregate net sales (as measured
during the 12 full calendar months prior to such acquisition) from product
lines included within the definition of Company Business.  
---|---|--- 
  



  

Each Seller agrees that this covenant is reasonable with respect to its
duration, geographical area and scope. For purposes of this Agreement, the
term "control" (including the terms "controlled by" and "under common control
with") means the possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to direct
or cause the direction of the management and policies of a Person, whether
through the ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise.

  



  

(c) Gulf Oil and Gulf India each agree during the Non-Compete Period
not to acquire, directly or indirectly, control of any businesses
involved in, or otherwise competing with, the business of the Combined
Business from any entity on _Schedule 1_ hereto.

  



  

(d) Each Seller agrees that for a period commencing on the Effective
Date and ending three years after the Closing Date (the "Non-

Neither the waiver by a party of a breach of or a default under any of the provisions of this Agreement, nor the failure by any party, on one or more occasions, to enforce any of the provisions of this Agreement or to exercise any right or privilege hereunder, shall be construed as a waiver of any other breach or default of a similar nature, or as a waiver of any of such provisions, rights or privileges hereunder.

8. _Severability_. If any term or provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other term or provision of this Agreement or invalidate or render unenforceable such term or provision in any other jurisdiction. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible.

  



  

9. _Counterparts; Effectiveness; Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original and both of which shall together constitute one and the same instrument. This Agreement shall become effective when each party shall have received a counterpart hereof signed by the other party.

ARTICLE 3. _Participation rightS_

  



  

3.1. _General_. During the Governance Restricted Period, on the
terms and subject to the conditions specified in this _ARTICLE 3_ , in
the event the Company proposes to offer or sell any New Securities, the
Company shall first make an offering of such New Securities to the Direct
Shareholder in accordance with the following provisions of this _ARTICLE 3_ ;
provided however that the filing of a Form S-3 registration statement
pursuant to the Act shall not in and of itself constitute a proposal by the
Company to offer or sell any New Securities for the purposes of this _ARTICLE
3_ unless and until such time as the Company specifically proposes to offer
and sell any New Securities pursuant to such registration statement. The
Company shall have the right to terminate or withdraw any offering or sale of
New Securities by the Company prior to the closing of such offering or sale,
whether or not the Direct Shareholder has elected to exercise its right
pursuant to this _ARTICLE 3_ to purchase any New Securities in such offering
or sale.

  



  

3.2. _Notice of Offering_. In the event the Company proposes to
offer or sell any New Securities, the Company shall deliver a written
notice (the " _Offer Notice_ ") to the Direct Shareholder stating (a) its
bona fide intention to offer such New Securities, (b) the number of such New
Securities to be offered, (c) the price and terms upon which it proposes to
offer such New Securities and (d) the date on which the offering is scheduled
to close.

  



    

 | 6| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

3.3. _Notification of Exercise_. By written notification received
by the Company within 30 days after delivery of the Offer Notice, the
Direct Shareholder may elect to purchase, at the price and on the terms
specified in the Offer Notice, up to that portion of such New Securities
which equals the Percentage Ownership of the Direct Shareholder on the date of
the Offer Notice (assuming the conversion and exercise of all rights,
options, warrants and similar securities to subscribe for, purchase or
otherwise acquire Common Stock). In the event that New Securities are sold at
different prices in the offering, the Direct Shareholder shall pay, per share,
the weighted average of the prices in the offering.

  



  

3.4. _Unsubscribed Securities_. The Company may sell any New
Securities not subscribed for by the Direct Shareholder in accordance with
_Sections 3.2_ and _3.3_ to any Person or Persons at a price not less, and
upon other terms not more favorable to the offeree, than those specified in
the Offer Notice. To the extent such New Securities are not sold within 90
days of the delivery of the Offer Notice, such New Securities shall not be
offered to any Person or Persons unless first reoffered to the Direct
Shareholder in accordance with this _ARTICLE 3_.

  



  

3.5. _Requirements of Principal Trading Market_. Notwithstanding
any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if, by reason of the
listing or other requirements of the Principal Trading Market, the issuance by
the Company of any New Securities pursuant to this _ARTICLE 3_ requires
approval of the Company's shareholders, then the Company's obligation to issue
and sell such New Securities to the Direct Shareholder shall be subject to
receipt of such shareholder approval, which the Company shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain as soon as possible after the date
on which the Direct Shareholder shall otherwise become entitled to purchase
such additional New Securities from the Company pursuant to this _ARTICLE 3_ ,
provided that this approval and issuance of New Securities to the Direct
Shareholder may occur subsequent to the issuance of New Securities to
other purchasers.

  



  

ARTICLE 4. _REGISTRATION RIGHTS_

  



  

4.1. _Duration of Registration Rights_. As to any particular
Registrable Securities, a Holder's rights to have the Company register such
Registrable Securities provided in this _ARTICLE 4_ shall terminate (i) when
such securities have been registered under the Act and sold or otherwise
disposed of in accordance with the intended method of distribution by the
seller or sellers thereof set forth in the Registration Statement covering
such Registrable Securities, (ii) when such securities have been
transferred in compliance with Rule 144 under the Act or (iii) on the date as
of which such securities have become eligible for sale pursuant to Rule 144
without volume or manner-of-sale restrictions and without the requirement for
the Company to be in compliance with the current public information
requirement under Rule 144(c)(1), as set forth in a written opinion of counsel
to such effect, addressed, delivered and reasonably acceptable to the
applicable transfer agent and the Holder(s) of such Registrable
Securities, and, based upon such opinion, the legend referred to in _Section
5.5(a)_ hereof, to the extent that such legend refers to registration under
the Act, shall have been removed.

  



    

 | 7| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

4.2. _Demand Registration Covenant_.

  



  

(a) If the Holders of at least a majority of the Registrable
Securities then outstanding request in writing (a " _Demand Registration
Request_ ") that the Company register under the Act at least 8% of the
Registrable Securities then held by all Holders (or a lesser percent if the
anticipated aggregate offering price, net of any underwriting discounts and
selling commissions, would exceed $50 million), the Company shall use
reasonable efforts to cause the offering and sale to be registered pursuant to
the Act and as provided in this _ARTICLE 4_  (a " _Demand Registration_ ").
In connection therewith the Company shall prepare and as soon as practicable
after receipt of such request file with the Commission a registration
statement under the Act covering all Registrable Securities which the Holders
request to be registered (any such form, a " _Registration Statement_ "),
which shall, if the Company is then qualified to do so, be on Form S-3. Each
Demand Registration Request shall specify the amount of Registrable
Securities intended to be offered and sold, shall express such Holder's
present intent to offer such Registrable Securities for distribution, shall
describe the nature or method of the proposed offer and sale, and shall
contain the undertaking of the Holders to comply with all applicable
requirements of this _ARTICLE 4_.

  



  

(b) The Company shall use its reasonable efforts to qualify and
remain qualified to register the offer and sale of securities under the Act
pursuant to a Registration Statement on Form S-3 (or any successor form). The
Company shall use its reasonable efforts to cause any Registration Statement
related to a Demand Registration to be declared effective by the Commission
as soon as practicable after receipt of the corresponding Demand Registration
Request. If so requested by any such Holder or Holders of Registrable
Securities, the Company shall take such steps as are required to register
such Registrable Securities for sale on a delayed or continuous basis under
Rule 415 under the Securities Act or any successor rule thereto (a " _Shelf
Registration_ ") pursuant to a Registration Statement on Form S-3 or the then
appropriate form for such an offering (a " _Shelf Registration Statement_ ").

  



  

(c) The Company shall not include in any Demand Registration or any
shelf takedown from a Shelf Registration Statement any securities which are
not Registrable Securities without the prior written consent of the Holders
of a majority of the Registrable Securities initially requesting such Demand
Registration or shelf takedown, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed. If the Holders initiating the Demand
Registration Request intend to distribute the Registrable Securities covered
by their request by means of an underwriting, they shall so advise the
Company as part of their Demand Registration Request and the Company shall
include such information in the Registration Statement (an " _Underwritten
Offering_ "). The underwriters shall be one or more Investment Banking Firms
selected by the Holders proposing to distribute their securities in such
Demand Registration, provided that such Investment Banking Firms are
reasonably satisfactory to the Company. The Holders proposing to distribute
their securities through such underwriting shall, together with the Company,
enter into an underwriting agreement in customary form with the Investment
Banking Firm or Investment Banking Firms selected for such underwriting. If,
in the written opinion of the Investment Banking Firms, marketing factors
require a limitation of the number of shares to be underwritten, and if the
total amount of securities that the Holders request pursuant to _Section 4.2_
to be included in such offering exceeds the amount of securities that the
Investment Banking Firms reasonably believe compatible with the success of
the offering, the Company shall only be required to include in the offering
the amount of Registrable Securities that the Investment Banking Firms
believe will not jeopardize the success of the offering, and the Registrable
Securities that are included in such offering shall be allocated pro rata
among the respective Holders on the basis of the number of
Registrable Securities owned by each such Holder; provided, however that the
Company shall include in such Demand Registration, in order of priority: (i)
first, the Registrable Securities that the Holders propose to sell, and (ii)
second, the shares of Common Stock proposed to be included therein by any
other Persons (including shares of Common Stock to be sold for the account of
the Company or other holders of Common Stock) allocated among such Persons in
such manner as they may agree.

  

     



   

 | 8| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(d) The Company shall not be obligated to effect, or to take any
action to effect, during any six (6) month period more than one Demand
Registration that has become effective pursuant to this _Section 4.2_ ;
provided that the Company shall not be obligated to effect, or to take any
action to effect, any Underwritten Offering pursuant to this _Section 4.2_ (i)
after the Company has effected two Underwritten Offerings pursuant to
_Section 4.2(c)_ or (ii) more than once during any twelve (12) month period
(provided that the Registration Statement applicable to such Underwritten
Offering became effective). In addition, the Company shall not be obligated
to effect, or take any action to effect, any Demand Registration from the
Closing Date until the date that is six months after the Closing Date.

  



  

4.3. _Piggyback Registration Covenant_ . If the Company shall
propose registration under the Act of a public offering of Common
Stock (other than pursuant to a registration statement contemplated by
section 6.23 of the Purchase Agreement), the Company shall give prompt
written notice of such fact or proposed registration to the Holders and shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the registration of such number
of shares of Common Stock then owned by the Holders as the Holders request,
within 20 days after receipt by the Holders of such notice from the Company,
to be included, upon the same terms (including the method of distribution) of
any such offering; _provided_ , _however_ , that: (a) the Company shall not be
required to give notice or include such Common Stock in any such registration
if the proposed registration is primarily (i) a registration of a stock option
or compensation plan or of securities issued or issuable pursuant to any such
plan, or (ii) a registration of securities proposed to be issued by the
Company in exchange for securities or assets of, or in connection with the
Company's merger, acquisition or consolidation with, another entity; and (b)
the Company may, in its sole discretion and without the consent of the
Holders, withdraw such Registration Statement and abandon the proposed
offering, provided, however, that the Company promptly gives the Shareholders
written notice of such action.

  



  

4.4. _Company 's Obligations in Connection with Registrations_. In
connection with any registration of Registrable Securities undertaken by the
Company under _ARTICLE 4_ , the Company shall, as expeditiously as reasonable
possible:

  



  

(a) in the case of a registration of Registrable Securities effected
by the Company pursuant to _Section 4.2_ , prepare and file with the SEC a
Registration Statement with respect to such Registrable Securities and use
its reasonable efforts to cause such Registration Statement to become
effective and, upon the request of the Holders, use reasonable efforts to
keep such Registration Statement effective for a period of up to 120 days or,
if earlier, until the distribution contemplated in the Registration Statement
has been completed; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that (i) such 120 day period
shall be extended for a period of time equal to the period a Holder refrains,
at the request of an underwriter of Common Stock (or other securities) of the
Company, from selling any securities included in such registration and (ii)
in the case of any Shelf Registration, such 120 day period shall at the
request of the Holders be extended for up to 365 days (or, if earlier, until
the date as of which the Registrable Securities may be sold pursuant to Rule
144 under the Act without limitation or restriction under any of the
requirements of Rule 144, including volume or manner-of-sale restrictions and
the requirement for the Company to be in compliance with the current public
information requirement under Rule 144(c)(1), as set forth in a
written opinion of counsel to such effect, addressed, delivered and
reasonably acceptable to the applicable transfer agent, the Company and the
Holder(s) of such Registrable Securities), if necessary, to keep the
Registration Statement effective until all such Registrable Securities are
sold;

  



    

 | 9| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) furnish to the Holders or their underwriters such copies of any
prospectus (including any preliminary prospectus) in conformity with the
requirements of the Act and such other documents as the Holders may
reasonably request, in order to facilitate and effect the offering and sale of
the Registrable Securities;

  



  

(c) use commercially reasonable efforts to qualify the securities
offered under applicable blue sky or other state securities laws of such
jurisdictions reasonably requested by the Holders to enable the Holders to
offer and sell the Registrable Securities; _provided_ , _however_ , that
Company shall not be obligated to qualify as a foreign corporation to do
business under the laws of any jurisdiction in which it is not then
qualified;

  



  

(d) in the event of any Underwritten Offering, subject to _Section
4.2(d)_ , enter into and perform its obligations under an underwriting
agreement, in usual and customary form, with the underwriter(s) of such
offering;

  



  

(e) instruct the transfer agent(s) and the registrar(s) of the
Company's securities to release any stop transfer orders with respect to the
Registrable Securities being sold;

  



  

(f) promptly prepare and file with the Commission such amendments and
prospectus supplements, including post-effective amendments, to the applicable
Registration Statement as the Company determines may be necessary or
appropriate, and use commercially reasonable efforts to have such post-
effective amendments declared effective as promptly as practicable; cause the
related prospectus to be supplemented by any prospectus supplement, and as so
supplemented, to be filed with the Commission; and notify the Holders of any
securities included in such registration statement and the underwriters
thereof, if any, promptly when a prospectus, any prospectus supplement or
post-effective amendment must be filed or has been filed and, with respect to
any post-effective amendment, when the same has become effective, and make the
same available to such Holders and their underwriters;

  



  

(g) furnish to each Holder and the underwriter thereof, if any, a
signed counterpart, addressed to each Holder and underwriter, of (i) an
opinion or opinions of counsel to the Company and (ii) a comfort letter or
comfort letters from the Company's independent public accountants, each in
customary form and covering such matters of the type customarily covered by
opinions or comfort letters, as the case may be, as the Holders or such
underwriters may reasonably request; and

  



    

 | 10| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(h) use commercially reasonable efforts to cause all such Registrable
Securities to be listed in the Principal Trading Market, and on each
securities exchange on which similar securities issued by the Company are
then listed.

  



  

4.5. _Conditions to Obligations of Company Under Registration
Covenants_. The Company's obligations to register the Registrable
Securities owned by the Holders under _ARTICLE 4_ are subject to the
following conditions:

  



  

(a) The Company shall be entitled to postpone for up to 90 days the
filing of any Registration Statement under _Section 4.2_ , if at the time it
receives the request for registration the Board determines, in its sole
discretion, that such registration and offering would (i) require premature
disclosure of material information that the Company has a bona fide business
purpose for preserving as confidential, (ii) render the Company unable to
comply with requirements under the Act or the Exchange Act or (iii) materially
interfere with any significant financing, acquisition, corporate
reorganization, Company-initiated registration or other transaction involving
the Company or any of its Affiliates; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Company may not invoke this right more than once in any twelve (12)
month period; and _provided_ _further_ that the Company shall not register
any securities for its own account or that of any other stockholder during
while such postponement is in effect. The Company shall promptly give the
Holders written notice of such determination.

  



  

(b) The Company may require that the number of shares of Registrable
Securities offered for sale by a Holder pursuant to a request for registration
under _Section 4.3_  be decreased or excluded entirely if, in the opinion of
Company's Investment Banking Firm, marketing factors require a limitation of
the number of shares to be underwritten and the total amount of securities
that the Holders request pursuant to _Section 4.3_  to be included in such
offering exceeds the amount of securities that such Investment Banking Firm
reasonably believes compatible with the success of such offering. If the
Company shall require such a reduction, each Holder shall have the right to
withdraw from the offering. For purposes of _Section 4.2(d)_ , a registration
shall not be counted as "effected" if, as a result of the foregoing, more
than fifty percent (50%) of the total number of Registrable Securities that
Holders have requested to be included in such Registration Statement are
actually excluded.

  



  

(c) If a Holder requests registration pursuant to _Section 4.2_ , the
Company will, subject to _Section 4.2(d)_ , enter into an underwriting
agreement containing terms customarily included in underwriting agreements
with an issuer for a secondary distribution.

  



  

(d) Each Holder that holds Registrable Securities included in the
Registration Statement shall use commercially reasonable efforts to not sell
in excess of 10% of the then outstanding Common Stock to one Person or Group.

  



  

(e) Each Holder whose Registrable Securities are being registered,
and each underwriter designated by such Holder, will furnish to the Company
such information and materials as the Company may reasonably request and as
shall be required in connection with the action to be taken by the Company. To
the extent possible the Holders shall provide the Company with any
information and materials required to obtain acceleration of the effective
date of the Registration Statement.

  



    

 | 11| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(f) Each Holder that holds Registrable Securities included in the
Registration Statement shall not (until further written notice) effect sales
thereof after receipt of written notice from the Company to suspend sales, to
permit the Company to correct or update a Registration Statement or
prospectus; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the obligations of the Company
with respect to maintaining any Registration Statement current and
effective shall be extended by a period of days equal to the period such
suspension is in effect.

  



  

(g) At the end of the period during which the Company is obligated to
keep any Registration Statement current and effective (and any extensions
thereof required by the preceding paragraph), and upon receipt of notice from
the Company of its intention to remove from registration the securities
covered by such Registration Statement that remain unsold, Holders of
Registrable Securities included in the Registration Statement
shall discontinue sales of such Registrable Securities pursuant to such
Registration Statement, and each such Holder shall notify the Company of the
number of shares registered belonging to such Holder that remain unsold
promptly following receipt of such notice from the Company.

  



  

(h) In connection with any sale of Registrable Securities registered
pursuant to _ARTICLE 4_ that is effected by means of an Underwritten Offering,
the Holders shall, if required by the underwriters, enter into customary
agreements with the underwriters in connection with any such offering
pursuant to which each Holder shall agree not to (i) offer, pledge, sell,
contract to sell, sell any option or contract to purchase, purchase any
option or contract to sell, grant any option, right or warrant for the sale
of, or otherwise dispose of or transfer any Equity Securities, whether now
owned or hereafter acquired by such Holder or with respect to which such
Holder has or hereafter acquires the power of disposition (collectively, the
" _Lock-Up Securities_ ") or (ii) enter into any swap or any other
agreement or any transaction that transfers, in whole or in part, directly or
indirectly, the economic consequence of ownership of the Lock-Up Securities,
whether any such swap or transaction is to be settled by delivery of Equity
Securities or other securities, in cash or otherwise (in each case, other
than those Registrable Securities included in such registration pursuant to
this _ARTICLE 4_  and subject to other customary exceptions) without the
prior written consent of the Company (and any underwriters of such
offering), for a period designated by the Company in writing to the Holder,
which period shall not begin more than 10 days prior to the effectiveness of
the Registration Statement pursuant to which such offering shall be made and
shall not last more than 90 days after the effective date of such
registration statement.

  



  

4.6. _Suspension of Registration_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth in this Agreement, each Shareholder that intends to
sell or distribute Registrable Securities registered under a Registration
Statement pursuant to _Section 4.2_ or _4.3_ shall, at least two Business
Days prior to such sale or distribution, provide written notice thereof to the
Company (a " _Sale Notice_ ") and such Holder shall not sell or distribute
such Registrable Securities unless it has timely provided such Sale Notice
and until the expiration of such two-Business Day period. If, in response to a
Sale Notice, the Company provides to such Holder a certificate signed by an
executive officer of the Company stating that, in the good faith judgment of
the Company, such sale or distribution would require disclosure of non-public
material information not otherwise required to be disclosed under Law and the
Company has a bona fide business purpose for preserving the confidentiality of
such information (the " _Restriction_ "), then the Company may, by written
notice thereof to such Holder (a " _Suspension Notice_ "), suspend use of
such Registration Statement by such Holder until the expiration of the
Restriction (a " _Suspension_ "). Upon receipt of a Suspension Notice, such
Holder shall suspend all sales and distributions of Registrable Securities and
suspend use of the applicable prospectus and any issuer free writing
prospectuses in connection with all such sales and distributions. The
Company shall promptly notify such Holder upon the termination of a
Suspension.

  



    

 | 12| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

4.7. _Expenses_.

  



  

(a) All expenses (other than Selling Expenses) incurred in connection
with registrations, filings, qualifications and distributions of Registrable
Securities pursuant to this  _ARTICLE 4_ including (i) all registration,
filing and qualification fees, (ii) underwriting expenses (other than
discounts or selling commissions); (iii) printers' and accounting fees and
disbursements and (v) fees and disbursements of counsel for the Company,
shall be borne and paid by the Company. As used herein, " _Selling Expenses_ "
shall mean all underwriting discounts, selling commissions and stock transfer
taxes attributable to the Holders' sale of Registrable Securities pursuant to
this Agreement and all fees and disbursements of counsel for any Holder.

  



  

(b) Selling Expenses relating to the offer and sale of Registrable
Securities registered under the Act pursuant to this Agreement , including
without limitation fees and disbursements of counsel to the selling Holders,
shall be borne by the Holders, pro rata in proportion to the number of
Registrable Securities included in such registration for each such Holder;
provided, however, that if any individual Holder retains separate counsel, it
shall be responsible for 100% of the fees and disbursements of that separate
counsel.

  



  

4.8. _Indemnification_.

  



  

(a) In the case of each registration effected by the Company pursuant
to _Section 4.2_ or _4.3_ , to the extent permitted by law, the Company (in
such capacity, an " _indemnifying party_ ") agrees to indemnify and hold
harmless each Holder, its officers and directors, stockholders, legal
counsel, accountants, and each underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of
the Act for such Holder, against any and all losses, claims, damages, costs,
expenses, liabilities or actions to which they or any of them may become
subject under the Act or any other statute or common law, including any
amount paid in settlement of any litigation, commenced or threatened, if
such settlement is effected with the written consent of the Company, and to
reimburse them for any legal or other expenses incurred by them in connection
with investigating any claims and defending any actions, insofar as any such
losses, claims, damages, liabilities or actions arise out of or are based
upon (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact
contained in the Registration Statement relating to the sale of such
securities, or any post-effective amendment thereto, or the omission
or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, (ii) any
untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in
any preliminary prospectus, if used prior to the effective date of such
Registration Statement, or contained in the final prospectus or any free-
writing prospectus (as amended or supplemented if the Company shall have
filed with the Commission any amendment thereof or supplement thereto)
if used within the period during which Company is required to keep the
Registration Statement to which such prospectus relates current under
_Section 4.4_ (including any extensions of such period as provided in _Section
4.5_ ), or the omission or alleged omission to state therein (if so used) a
material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the indemnification agreement contained in this  _Section
4.8(a)_ shall not (x) apply to such losses, claims, damages, costs, expenses,
liabilities or actions arising out of, or based upon, any such untrue
statement or alleged untrue statement, or any such omission or alleged
omission, if such statement or omission was made in reliance upon and in
conformity with information furnished to the Company by such Holder or
underwriter for use in connection with preparation of the Registration
Statement, any preliminary prospectus, final prospectus contained in the
Registration Statement, any free-writing prospectus, or any amendment or
supplement thereto, or (y) inure to the benefit of any underwriter or any
Person controlling such underwriter, if such underwriter failed to send or
give a copy of the final prospectus to the Person asserting the claim at or
prior to the written confirmation of the sale of such securities to such
Person and if the untrue statement or omission concerned had been corrected
in such final prospectus.

---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) In the case of each registration effected by Company pursuant to
_Section 4.2_ or _4.3_ above, each Holder and each underwriter of the
securities to be registered (each such party and such underwriters being
referred to severally, in such capacity, as an " _indemnifying party_
") shall agree in the same manner and to the same extent as set forth in
_Section 4.8(a)_ to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each Person (if
any) who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act, the
directors of the Company and those officers of the Company who shall have
signed any such Registration Statement, with respect to any untrue statement
or alleged untrue statement in, or omission or alleged omission from, such
Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment thereto or any
preliminary prospectus or final prospectus or any free-writing prospectus (as
amended or supplemented, if amended or supplemented) contained in such
Registration Statement, if such statement or omission was made in reliance
upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company
by such indemnifying party for use in connection with the preparation of
such Registration Statement or any preliminary prospectus or final prospectus
contained in such Registration Statement, any free-writing prospectus, or any
such amendment or supplement thereto; _provided_ , however, that the
obligation to indemnify shall be several, not joint and several, for each
Holder and shall not exceed an amount equal to the net proceeds (after
underwriting fees, commissions or discounts) actually received by such Holder
from the sale of Registrable Securities pursuant to such Registration
Statement.

  



  

(c) Each indemnified party will, promptly after receipt of written
notice of the commencement of an action against such indemnified party in
respect of which indemnity may be sought under this _Section 4.8_ , notify
the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof. In case any
such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall so
notify an indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying
party will be entitled to participate therein, with the approval of any
indemnified parties, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, and
to the extent it may wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly
notified, to assume the defense thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory
to such indemnified party, and after notice from the indemnifying party to
such indemnified party of its election to so assume the defense thereof, the
indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party under this
_Section 4.8_ for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such
indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof other than
reasonable costs of investigation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an
indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel (reasonably
satisfactory to the indemnifying party) to participate in the defense
thereof, but the costs, fees and expenses of such counsel shall be the sole
expense of such indemnified party unless the named parties to such action or
proceedings include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and
the indemnifying party or such indemnified party shall have been advised by
counsel that there are one or more legal defenses available to it which are
different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party (in
which case, if the indemnified party notifies the indemnifying party in
writing that it elects to employ separate counsel at the reasonable expense of
the indemnifying party, the indemnifying party shall not have the right to
assume the defense of such action or proceeding on behalf of the indemnified
party, as the case may be, it being understood, however, that the
indemnifying party shall not, in connection with any such action or proceeding
or separate or substantially similar or related action or proceeding in the
same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations
or circumstances, be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of more than
one separate counsel at any time for the indemnifying party and all
indemnified parties). If the indemnifying party withholds consent to a
settlement or proposed settlement by the indemnified party, it shall
acknowledge to the indemnified party its indemnification obligations
hereunder. The indemnity agreements in this  _Section 4.8_ shall be in
addition to any liabilities which the indemnifying parties may have pursuant
to law.

  



    

 | 14| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(d) If the indemnification provided for in this _Section 4.8_ from
an indemnifying party is unavailable to an indemnified party hereunder in
respect to any losses, claims, damages, costs, expenses, liabilities or
actions referred to herein, then the indemnifying party, in lieu of
indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or
payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses,
claims, damages, costs, expenses, liabilities or actions in such proportion
as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party and
indemnified party in connection with the statements or omissions which result
in such losses, claims, damages, costs, expenses, liabilities or actions, as
well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of
such indemnifying party and indemnified party shall be determined by
reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue
statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a
material fact relates to information supplied by such indemnifying party or
indemnified party and that party's relative intent, knowledge, access to
information supplied by such indemnifying party or indemnified party and
opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The amount paid
or payable by a party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, costs,
expenses, liabilities and actions referred to above shall be deemed to
include any legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such party
in connection with investigating or defending any action, suit, proceeding or
claim.

  



  

4.9. _Delay of Registration_. No Shareholder shall have any
right to obtain or seek an injunction restraining or otherwise delaying
any registration pursuant to this Agreement as the result of any controversy
that might arise with respect to the interpretation or implementation of this
_ARTICLE 4_.

  



  

4.10. _Preservation of Rights_. The Company shall not (a) grant any
registration rights to third parties which are more favorable than
or inconsistent with the rights granted hereunder, or (b) enter into any
agreement, take any action, or permit any change to occur, with respect to
its securities that violates or subordinates the rights expressly granted to
the Holders in this Agreement.

ARTICLE 5. _CERTAIN AGREEMENTS OF SHAREHOLDERS AND COMPANY_

  



  

5.1. _Negative Covenant regarding Hostile Activity_. During the
Governance Restricted Period, each Shareholder shall not, without the
prior written consent of the Board and then only to the extent written
consent has been obtained: directly or indirectly, solicit proxies, become a
"participant" in a "solicitation" (as such terms are defined under Regulation
14A under the Exchange Act), publicly support, knowingly facilitate,
initiate, vote in favor of or sell or tender into any Change in Control or
Change in Control Proposal that has not been approved by a majority of the
Board or by Independent Director Approval; provided, however, that nothing in
this Agreement is intended to restrict the rights or actions of the
Shareholder Designees in their capacity as directors of the Company,
including their participation in discussions with other members of the Board,
any committee thereof, or Company management, or their decisions to vote as
directors in favor of or against a Change in Control Proposal or any
other Company action.

  



  

5.2. _Voting Agreement_. During the Governance Restricted Period,
each Shareholder shall cause each share of Shareholder Common Stock owned by
such Shareholder to be voted in accordance with the recommendation of the
Board set forth in each proxy statement of the Company with regard to persons
nominated to serve as members of the Board in such proxy statement and for the
election of no other Person; provided, however, that the Shareholders shall
not be required to vote in favor of any Board nominees if the seating of such
nominees would preclude the election or appointment of the Shareholder
Designees as contemplated in _Article 6_.

  



  

5.3. _Independent Director Approval_. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary set forth in this Agreement, each Shareholder may publicly
support, vote in favor of, approve and tender into any transaction to the
extent such transaction has received Independent Director Approval.

  



  

5.4. _Acquisitions, Transfers and Votes in Contravention of
Agreement_. Without limiting any remedies that the Company may be entitled to:

  



  

(a) any Equity Securities acquired or transferred by a Shareholder in
contravention of this Agreement may not be voted on any matter on which
shareholders of the Company are entitled to vote, any attempt to vote such
Equity Securities shall be a breach of this Agreement and the Company shall
not be required to count any such votes, if cast, in determining the result
of shareholder voting on any matter; and

  



  

(b) the Company shall not be required to count, in determining the
result of shareholder voting on any matter, any vote of an Equity Security
Beneficially Owned by a Shareholder in contravention of this Agreement.

  



  

5.5. _Placement of Legends and Entry of Stop Transfer Orders_.

  



  

(a) The Shareholders agree:

  



    

 | 16| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(i) that each book entry position evidencing the shares of
Shareholder Common Stock shall bear the following legend:

  



  

"THE SHARES REPRESENTED HEREBY HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES
ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, OR ANY APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAW AND ARE
SUBJECT TO THE RESTRICTIONS ON DISPOSITION SET FORTH IN AND TO THE OTHER
PROVISIONS OF A SHAREHOLDER AGREEMENT, DATED [●], 2017, BETWEEN QUAKER
CHEMICAL CORPORATION AND THE OTHER SIGNATORIES THERETO. COPIES OF SUCH
AGREEMENT ARE ON FILE AT THE OFFICE OF QUAKER CHEMICAL CORPORATION.";

  



  

and such additional legends designed to ensure compliance with federal and
state laws as counsel for the Company may reasonably request; and

  



  

(ii) to the entry of stop transfer orders with the transfer agents of
any shares of Shareholder Common Stock against the transfer of any shares of
Shareholder Common Stock, except in compliance with this Agreement.

  



  

(b) The Company agrees that it will, upon receipt of an opinion from
counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Company and the applicable Shareholder
that it is appropriate to do, instruct the transfer agents of any shares of
Shareholder Common Stock to remove legends provided for in _Section 5.5(a)_
 and withdraw the stop transfer orders provided for in _Section 5.5(b)_ with
respect to such shares of Shareholder Common Stock, (i) to the extent shares
of Shareholder Common Stock are sold or otherwise disposed of in accordance
with this Agreement and (ii) upon termination of this Agreement.

  



  

5.6. _Rule 144 Compliance._ With a view to making available to the
Shareholders the benefits of Rule 144 under the Act (" _Rule 144_ ") and any
other rule or regulation of the Commission that may at any time permit a
shareholder to sell securities of the Company to the public without
registration, the Company shall during the term of this Agreement:

  



  

(a) make and keep public information available, as those terms are
understood and defined in Rule 144;

  



  

(b) use commercially reasonable efforts to file with the Commission
all reports and other documents required of the Company under the Act and the
Exchange Act; and

  



  

(c) furnish to the Direct Shareholder and any other Shareholder or
any of their respective Affiliates who hold Registrable Securities (so long as
the Direct Shareholder or such Shareholder or Affiliate owns Registrable
Securities), promptly upon written request, a written statement by the
Company as to its compliance with the reporting requirements of Rule 144 and
of the Act and the Exchange Act.

  



    

 | 17| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

5.7. _Transactions Approved by Independent Directors_.
Notwithstanding any restrictions contained herein, or in any other agreement
between the Company and any Shareholder, any Shareholder may sell into any
transaction that has received Independent Director Approval.

  



  

ARTICLE 6. _BOARD OF DIRECTORS_

  



  

6.1. _Appointment of Directors_. The parties acknowledge that the
Board has appointed the [three]2 individuals designated by the
Direct Shareholder under the Purchase Agreement (who meet the qualifications
identified in _Section 6.3(a)_ ) to fill the Board Vacancies, with each to
serve on a different class of the Board, and that at least one of such
Shareholder Designees has been appointed to the Board's audit committee,
compensation/management development committee, executive committee, and
governance committee.

  



  

6.2. _Vacancies_. In the event of the death, resignation,
retirement, disqualification or removal from office of any Shareholder
Designee for any reason, the Shareholders shall have the right, subject to
_Section 6.3_ , to designate a replacement for such Shareholder Designee who
satisfies the requirements of _Sections 6.3(a)(i)-(iii)_ to fill such vacancy,
and the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the Board, subject
to the directors' fiduciary duties, to approve and appoint such replacement.

  



  

6.3. _Board and Committee Representation_.

  



  

(a) Subject to _Section 6.3(d)_ , the Shareholders shall have the
right to nominate a number of individuals for election to the Board at the
annual meetings of the Company's shareholders so as to provide the
Shareholders with that percentage representation on the Board (based on the
size of the Board at the relevant time of determination) as set forth below,
provided that each such nominee is then (i) qualified to serve as a member of
the Board pursuant to the Company's corporate governance policies, the
requirements of the Principal Trading Market and applicable Law, in each
case, as in effect at the applicable time and (ii) willing to serve as a
member of the Board and to comply with the Company's corporate governance
policies, the requirements of the Principal Trading Market and applicable Law
(including, without limitation, by filing any necessary or advisable reports
with, or providing information to, the Commission).  Subject to the foregoing
but notwithstanding the immediately following sentence, any such nominee may
be an Affiliate of a Shareholder (other than an officer or employee of a
Shareholder or an Affiliate of a Shareholder). In addition, any such person
shall not be eligible for nomination for election if he or she shall have
been determined, by a majority of the Independent Directors, to be an
employee, officer, director or Affiliate of, or a consultant, representative,
independent contractor or agent for, directly or indirectly, a Person that is
a competitor of the Company. Each Shareholder Designee shall serve on a
different class of the Board. For purposes of this _Section 6.3_ , the
Shareholders shall have the right to nominate: three individuals for
election to the Board for so long as their aggregate Percentage Ownership as
of the record date for such meeting exceeds 19%; two individuals for so long
as such percentage exceeds 14%, and one individual for so long as such
percentage exceeds 10%; provided that if the Company and the Sellers'
Representative (as defined in the Purchase Agreement) mutually agree pursuant
to the Purchase Agreement to set the size of the Board at nine directors,
then the parties shall mutually agree on different Percentage
Ownership percentages than those set forth in this sentence. For the
avoidance of doubt, subject to the Shareholders' rights pursuant to _Section
6.3(a)_ , the Company may set the size of the Board.

  



  

  



  

2 NTD: Conforming changes to be made if number of directors changes pursuant
to the mutual agreement of Buyer and the Sellers' Representative.

    

 | 18| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to cause each
member of the Board to, subject to their fiduciary duties, recommend, in each
proxy statement of the Company that sets forth nominees for election to the
Board, that the shareholders of the Company vote in favor of the election to
the Board of any individuals designated for nomination by the Shareholders
pursuant to this _Article 6_. If a designated individual nominated by the
Shareholders is not elected to the Board by the shareholders of the Company,
the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the Board, subject to
the directors' fiduciary duties, to appoint a replacement designated by the
Shareholders to serve instead of such individual.

  



  

(c) For so long as any Shareholder Designee is on the Board a
Shareholder Designee shall have the right to be a member of each committee of
the Board on which he or she is qualified to serve as a member of the
committee pursuant to the requirements of the Principal Trading Market,
applicable Law and the Company's corporate governance policies, in each case,
as in effect at the applicable time.

  



  

(d) In the event that, at any time, the number of Shareholder
Designees exceeds the number of individuals that the Shareholders are entitled
to nominate for election to the Board pursuant to _Section 6.3(a)_ , the
Shareholders shall cause all Shareholder Designees in excess of such number to
immediately resign from the Board (and all committees thereof) so that the
number of Shareholder Designees does not exceed the number of
individuals that the Shareholders are entitled to nominate for election to
the Board pursuant to _Section 6.3(a)_. In the event that, at any time, the
Percentage Ownership of the Shareholders is less than 10%, the Shareholders
shall cause all Shareholder Designees to immediately resign from the Board
(and from all committees thereof) and the Shareholders shall have no right to
nominate under this Agreement any representative for election to the Board
(and the Company shall have no obligation with respect to any representative
of the Shareholders being nominated to the Board). The Company acknowledges
that a Shareholder Designee is eligible to be elected as lead independent
director by the Independent Directors, provided that he or she satisfies the
applicable requirements of such position of Law, and of the Principal Trading
Market.

  



  

6.4. _Removal_. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to
impair the rights that the shareholders of the Company may have to remove any
member of the Board with or without cause.

  



  

ARTICLE 7. _No prior ownership_

  



  

7.1. _No Prior Ownership_. The Shareholders jointly and severally
represent and warrant to the Company that, as of the date hereof, the only
Equity Securities or other securities (including convertible securities) of
the Company owned or Beneficially Owned by any Shareholder is the Shareholder
Common Stock.

ARTICLE 8. _TERMINATION_

  



  

8.1. _Termination_. This Agreement shall terminate and be of no
further force and effect upon the written agreement of the Company and the
Shareholders;  _provided_ that, each covenant and restriction shall terminate
on the termination date specified within such covenant or restriction, if
any; _provided_ _further_ , that such termination shall not release any party
of any liability for any breach of this Agreement occurring prior to such
termination.

  



  

ARTICLE 9. _MISCELLANEOUS_

  



  

9.1. _Specific Enforcement_. The parties agree that irreparable
damage would occur if any provision of this Agreement were not performed
in accordance with the terms hereof and that the parties shall be entitled to
seek specific performance of the terms hereof, in addition to any other
remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. The parties further
agree that no party hereto shall be required to obtain, furnish or post any
bond or similar instrument in connection with or as a condition to obtaining
any remedy referred to in this _Section 9.1_ , and each party hereto
irrevocably waives any right it may have to require the obtaining,
furnishing or posting of any such bond or similar instrument.

  



  

9.2. _Severability_. If any term or provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, such invalidity,
illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other term or provision
of this Agreement or invalidate or render unenforceable such term or
provision in any other jurisdiction. Upon such determination that any term or
other provision is invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the parties hereto
shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the
original intent of the parties as closely as possible in a mutually
acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby be
consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible.

  



  

9.3. _Assignment; Successors_. This Agreement shall be binding upon
and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns. None of the parties may assign
its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of the
other parties, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed;
provided, however, that if a Shareholder transfers any shares of the Company
to an Affiliate pursuant to _Section 2.2(c)_ or _Section 2.3(a)_ , and such
Affiliate agrees in writing to be bound by all of the obligations of such
transferring Shareholder hereunder, then no such consent shall be required
and the rights of the Shareholder under this Agreement in respect of the
transferred shares shall be assigned to the Affiliate transferee. No
assignment shall relieve the assigning party of any of its obligations
hereunder.

  



  

9.4. _Amendments_. This Agreement may only be amended, modified or
supplemented (and any right hereunder extended or waived) by the parties
hereto by an agreement in writing signed by all parties.
