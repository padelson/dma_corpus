as otherwise provided in this Agreement, any right or action that may be taken at the election of the Sellers, Optionholders or

hereby irrevocably appoint the Sellers&rsquo; Representative as the agent and attorney-in-fact of each of the Sellers, Optionholders
or SAR Holders for the purposes of acting in the name and stead of such Seller, Optionholder or SAR Holder in: (a) receiving, holding
and distributing the consideration and paying any associated costs and expenses of the transactions hereunder required to be paid
by such Seller, Optionholder or SAR Holder; (b) giving and receiving all notices permitted or required by this Agreement and acting
on the Sellers, Optionholders or SAR Holders behalf hereunder for all purposes specified herein; (c) delivering the certificates
or instruments of transfer for the Shares endorsed or executed by the Sellers to the Buyer at Closing and any and all assignments
relating thereto; (d) agreeing with the Buyer as to any amendments to or waivers of this Agreement which the Sellers&rsquo; Representative,
acting in good faith, may deem necessary or advisable, including the extension of time in which to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and the waiver of any closing conditions (subject to <B>11.09</B>); (e) employing legal counsel

orders, receipts, notices, requests, instructions, certificates, letters, and other writings, and in general doing all things and
taking all actions which the Sellers&rsquo; Representative, in its sole discretion, may consider necessary or proper in connection
with or to carry out the terms of this Agreement, as fully as if such Sellers, Optionholders or SAR Holders were personally present
and acting. This power of attorney and all authority conferred hereby is granted and conferred subject to the interests of the
other Parties to this Agreement, and in consideration of those interests and for the purpose of completing the transactions contemplated
hereby, this power of attorney and all authority conferred hereby shall be irrevocable and shall not be terminated by the Sellers,

or other event had not occurred, regardless of whether the Buyer or the Sellers&rsquo; Representative, or any of them, shall have
received notice of such death, incompetence, incapacity, or other event. The Sellers&rsquo; Representative will be promptly reimbursed
by the Sellers, Optionholders and SAR Holders for all reasonable expenses, disbursements and advances incurred by the Sellers&rsquo;
Representative in such capacity upon demand. The Sellers, Optionholders and SAR Holders severally and not jointly, agree to indemnify
and hold harmless the Sellers&rsquo; Representatives for and from any loss, liability, expense, charge, damages, claims or other
obligations it may incur as a result of its duties hereunder or any of its actions or inactions as such, except as may result from
the Sellers&rsquo; Representative&rsquo;s actions that would constitute fraud, willful misconduct or gross negligence. The obligations
of the Sellers, Optionholders and SAR Holders under this Section shall be borne by the Sellers pro rata in accordance with the
proportion of the Purchase Price allocated to each such party in accordance with the Allocation Certificate.</P>
