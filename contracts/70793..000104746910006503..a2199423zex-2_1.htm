AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER 

  

 AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (hereinafter called this " _Agreement_ "), dated as of July 15, 2010, among NBTY, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "), Alphabet Holding Company, Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _Parent_ "), and Alphabet Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ ," with the Company and Merger Sub sometimes being hereinafter collectively referred to as the " _Constituent Corporations_ "). 

  

    
RECITALS 

  

 WHEREAS, the respective boards of directors of each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company have approved the merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ ") upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and have approved and declared advisable this Agreement; 

  

 WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and as a condition to the willingness of the Company to enter into this Agreement, Carlyle Partners V, L.P. (the " _Guarantor_ ") is entering into a guarantee with the Company (the " _Guarantee_ ") pursuant to which the Guarantor is guaranteeing certain obligations of Parent and Merger Sub in connection with this Agreement as specified therein; and 

  

 WHEREAS, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub desire to make certain representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with this Agreement. 

   

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, the parties hereto agree as follows: 

  

    
ARTICLE I 

The Merger; Closing; Effective Time 

  

 1.1. _ The Merger._ Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company in accordance with the provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the " _DGCL_ ") and the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall thereupon cease. The Company shall be the surviving corporation in the Merger (sometimes hereinafter referred to as the " _Surviving Corporation_ "), and the separate corporate existence of the Company, with all its rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises, shall continue unaffected by the Merger, except as set forth in Article II. The Merger shall have the effects specified in the DGCL. 

  

 1.2. _ Closing._ Unless otherwise mutually agreed in writing between the Company and Parent, the closing for the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place at the offices of Sullivan and Cromwell LLP, 125 Broad Street, New York, New York, at 9:00 a.m. (Eastern Time) on the later of (x) the second (2nd) business day following the day on which the last to be satisfied or waived of the conditions set forth in Article VII (other than those conditions that by      

their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
fulfillment or waiver of those conditions) shall be satisfied or waived in
accordance with this Agreement and (y) the final day of the Marketing Period
or such earlier date as may be specified by Parent on no less than two (2)
business days\' prior notice to the Company. The date on which the Closing
actually occurs is referred to as the " _Closing Date_ ". For purposes of
this Agreement, the term " _business day_ " shall mean any day ending
at 11:59 p.m. (Eastern Time) other than a Saturday or Sunday or a day on
which banks are required or authorized to close in the City of New York.

  

 1.3. _ Effective Time._ As soon as practicable following the Closing, the Company and Parent will cause a certificate of merger (the " _Delaware Certificate of Merger_ ") to be executed, acknowledged and filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware as provided in Section 251 of the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective at the time when the Delaware Certificate of Merger has been duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such later time as may be agreed by the parties in writing and specified in the Delaware Certificate of Merger (the " _Effective Time_ "). 

  

    
ARTICLE II 

Certificate of Incorporation and 
Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation 

  

 2.1. _ The Certificate of Incorporation._ The certificate of incorporation of the Company shall be amended as a result of the Merger so as to read in its entirety as set forth in _Exhibit A_ hereto and, as so amended, shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation (the " _Charter_ "), until duly amended as provided therein or by applicable Law (subject to Section 6.11(e)). 

   

 2.2. _ The Bylaws._ The parties hereto shall take all actions necessary so that the bylaws of the Company in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation (the " _Bylaws_ "), until thereafter amended as provided therein or by applicable Law (subject to Section 6.11(e)). 

  

    
ARTICLE III 

Officers and Directors 
of the Surviving Corporation 

   

 3.1. _ Directors._ The parties hereto shall take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary so that the board of directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, from and after the Effective Time, be the directors of the Surviving Corporation until their successors have been duly elected or appointed and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the Charter and the Bylaws. 

  

 3.2. _ Officers._ The officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, from and after the Effective Time, be the officers of the Surviving Corporation until 

        

their successors shall have been duly elected or appointed and qualified or
until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the
Charter and the Bylaws.

  

    
ARTICLE IV 

Effect of the Merger on Capital Stock; 
Exchange of Certificates 

  

 4.1. _ Effect on Capital Stock._ At the Effective Time, as a result of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any capital stock of the Company or the sole stockholder of Merger Sub: 

   

 (a) _ Merger Consideration._ Each share of the common stock, par value $0.008 per share, of the Company (a " _Share_ " or, collectively, the " _Shares_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than (i) issued and outstanding Shares owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any other direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent and Shares owned by the Company or any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company, and in each case not held on behalf of third parties, and (ii) Shares that are owned by stockholders (" _Dissenting Stockholders_ ") who have perfected and not withdrawn a demand for, or lost their right to, appraisal pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to such Shares (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ," and together with the Shares referred to in the immediately preceding clause (i), the " _Excluded Shares_ ")) shall be converted into the right to receive $55.00 per Share in cash (the " _Per Share Merger Consideration_ "), without interest. At the Effective Time, all of the Shares shall cease to be outstanding, shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each certificate (a " _Certificate_ ") formerly representing any of the Shares (other than Excluded Shares) shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration for each such Share, without interest, in accordance with this Section 4.1 and Section 4.2 hereof. 

  

 (b) _ Cancellation of Excluded Shares._ Each Excluded Share, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, shall cease to be outstanding, shall be cancelled without payment of any consideration therefor and shall cease to exist, subject to the right of the Record Holder of any Dissenting Shares to receive the payment for such Dissenting Shares pursuant to Section 4.2(g). As used in this Article IV, the term " _Record Holder_ " means, with respect to any Shares, a Person who was, immediately prior to the Effective Time, the holder of record of such Shares. 

  

 (c) _ Merger Sub._ At the Effective Time, each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 4.2. _ Exchange of Certificates._ 

   

 (a) _ Paying Agent._ At the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with a paying agent selected by Parent with the Company\'s prior approval (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) (the " _Paying Agent_ "), for the benefit of the 

        

Record Holders of Shares (other than Excluded Shares), a cash amount in
immediately available funds necessary for the Paying Agent to make payments
under Section 4.1(a) (such cash amount being hereinafter referred to as the "
_Exchange Fund_ "). If a Dissenting Stockholder effectively withdraws its
demand for, or loses its rights to, appraisal pursuant to Section 262 of the
DGCL with respect to any Dissenting Shares, (i) such Shares shall cease to be
Excluded Shares and (ii) Parent shall make available or cause to be made
available to the Paying Agent additional funds in an amount equal to the
product of (x) the number of Dissenting Shares for which the Dissenting
Stockholder has withdrawn its demand for, or lost its rights to, appraisal
pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL and (y) the Per Share Merger
Consideration. The Paying Agent shall invest the Exchange Fund as directed by
Parent; _provided_  that such investments shall be in obligations of or
guaranteed by the United States of America, in commercial paper obligations
rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody\'s Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and
Poor\'s Corporation, respectively, or in money market funds having a rating in
the highest investment category granted by a recognized credit rating agency
at the time of investment. Any interest and other income resulting from such
investment shall become a part of the Exchange Fund, and any amounts in
excess of the aggregate amounts payable under Section 4.1(a) shall be returned
to the Surviving Corporation in accordance with Section 4.2(e). To the extent
that there are any losses with respect to any such investments, or the
Exchange Fund diminishes for any reason below the level required for the
Paying Agent to make prompt cash payment under Section 4.1(a), Parent shall,
or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, promptly replace or restore the
cash in the Exchange Fund so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all
times maintained at a level sufficient for the Paying Agent to make such
payments under Section 4.1(a).

  

 (b) _ Exchange Procedures._ Promptly (and in any event within two (2) business days) after the Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each Record Holder of Shares (other than Excluded Shares) (i) a letter of transmittal specifying that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section 4.2(f)) to the Paying Agent, such letter of transmittal to be in customary form and to have such other provisions as Parent and the Company may reasonably agree, and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section 4.2(f)) in exchange for the amount to which such Record Holder is entitled as a result of the Merger pursuant to Section 4.1(a). If any Excluded Shares cease to be Excluded Shares pursuant to Section 4.2(a), the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent promptly (and in any event within two (2) business days) after the date on which such Excluded Shares cease to be Excluded Shares to mail to the Record Holder of such Shares the letter of transmittal and instructions referred to in the immediately preceding sentence, with respect to such Shares. Upon delivery of such letter of transmittal by any Record Holder of Shares (other than Excluded Shares), duly completed and duly executed in accordance with its instructions, and the surrender to the Paying Agent of a Certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented such Shares (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section 4.2(f)), the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a cash amount by check or wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by such holder (less any required Tax withholdings as provided in Section 4.2(h)) equal to the product of (x) the number of Shares represented by such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as provided in 

        

Section 4.2(f)) and (y) the Per Share Merger Consideration, and the
Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be
paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of the Certificates.
In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is not registered in
the transfer records of the Company, a check for any cash to be delivered
upon compliance with the procedures described above may be issued to the
transferee if the applicable letter of transmittal is accompanied by all
documents reasonably required by the Surviving Corporation to evidence and
effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes
have been paid or are not applicable.

   

 (c) _ Special Payment Procedures for DTC._ Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Company shall cooperate to establish procedures with the Paying Agent and the Depository Trust Company (" _DTC_ ") to ensure that (i) if the Closing occurs at or prior to 11:30 a.m. (Eastern time) on the Closing Date, the Paying Agent will transmit to DTC or its nominee on the Closing Date an amount in cash in immediately available funds equal to the product of (x) number of Shares held of record by DTC or such nominee immediately prior to the Effective Time and (y) the Per Share Merger Consideration (such amount, the " _DTC Payment_ "), and (ii) if the Closing occurs after 11:30 a.m. (Eastern time) on the Closing Date, the Paying Agent will transmit to DTC or its nominee on the first (1st) business day after the Closing Date an amount in cash in immediately available funds equal to the DTC Payment. 

  

 (d) _ Transfers._ From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of the Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any Certificate is presented to the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent for transfer, it shall be cancelled and, subject to compliance with the procedures set forth in Section 4.2(b), exchanged for the cash amount to which the holder thereof is entitled pursuant to this Article IV (less any required Tax withholdings as provided in Section 4.2(h)) to be paid by check or wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by such holder. 

  

 (e) _ Termination of Exchange Fund._ Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains unclaimed by the Record Holders of the Shares for 180 days after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation. Any Record Holder of Shares (other than Excluded Shares) who has not theretofore complied with this Article IV shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of the amount to which such Record Holder is entitled as a result of the Merger pursuant to Section 4.1(a) (less any required Tax withholdings as provided in Section 4.2(h)), without any interest thereon, upon (i) due surrender of its Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section 4.2(f)) and (ii) if requested by the Surviving Corporation, delivery of a letter of transmittal in customary form that is provided promptly to such Record Holder by the Surviving Corporation, in each case, to the Surviving Corporation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Surviving Corporation, Parent, the Paying Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any Person for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws. For the purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Person_ " shall mean any individual, corporation (including not-for-profit), general or 

        

limited partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, estate, trust,
association, organization, Governmental Entity or other entity of any kind or
nature.

   

 (f) _ Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates._ In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in customary amount and upon such terms as may be required by Parent as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue a check in the amount (less any required Tax withholdings as provided in Section 4.2(h)) equal to the product of (i) the number of Shares represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate and (ii) the Per Share Merger Consideration. 

   

 (g) _ Dissenting Shares._ No Person who has perfected a demand for appraisal rights pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to any Dissenting Shares shall be entitled to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration with respect to such Dissenting Shares unless and until such Person shall have effectively withdrawn its demand for, or lost its right to, appraisal under the DGCL with respect to such Dissenting Shares. Unless and until a Dissenting Stockholder shall have effectively withdrawn its demand for, or lost its right to, appraisal under the DGCL with respect to Dissenting Shares, each Dissenting Stockholder shall be entitled to receive only the payment provided by Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to such Dissenting Shares. The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any written demands for appraisal, attempted withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments served pursuant to applicable Laws that are received by the Company relating to stockholders\' rights of appraisal. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or offer to settle or settle any such demands. 

  

 (h) _ Withholding Rights._ Each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable in respect of the Shares cancelled in the Merger such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), or any other applicable state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, such withheld amounts (i) shall be remitted by the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent, as applicable, to the applicable Governmental Entity, and (ii) shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Record Holder of Shares in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent, as the case may be. 

   

 4.3. _ Treatment of Outstanding Options and Restricted Stock Units Under Stock Plans._ 

  

 (a) _ Options._ At the Effective Time, each outstanding and unexercised option to purchase Shares (a " _Company Option_ ") issued under the Stock Plans (as defined in Section 5.1(b)) or otherwise, vested or unvested, shall be cancelled and shall only entitle the 

        

holder thereof to receive, as soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time (but in any event no later than three (3) business days after
the Effective Time), an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the total
number of Shares subject to such Company Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time _times_ (ii) the excess, if any, of the Per Share Merger
Consideration _over_ the exercise price per Share under such Company Option,
less applicable Taxes required to be withheld with respect to such payment.

  

 (b) _ Restricted Stock Units._ At the Effective Time, each outstanding Restricted Stock Unit issued under the Stock Plans (an " _RSU_ ") or otherwise, shall be cancelled and shall only entitle the holder thereof to receive, as soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (but in any event no later than three (3) business days after the Effective Time), an amount in cash, for each RSU, equal to the Per Share Merger Consideration, less applicable Taxes required to be withheld with respect to such payment. 

   

 (c) _ Corporate Actions._ At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the Board of Directors of the Company and the Compensation and Stock Option Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company, as applicable, shall adopt resolutions and will take such other appropriate actions to implement the provisions of Sections 4.3(a) and 4.3(b) and to terminate the Stock Plans at the Effective Time. 

  

 4.4. _ Adjustments to Prevent Dilution._ In the event that the Company changes the number of Shares or securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for Shares issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a result of a reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split), stock dividend or distribution, recapitalization, merger, issuer tender or exchange offer, or other similar transaction, the Per Share Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted to reflect such change and as so adjusted shall, from and after the date of such event, be the Per Share Merger Consideration. 

  

    
ARTICLE V 

Representations and Warranties 

   

 5.1. _ Representations and Warranties of the Company._ Except as set forth in (i) the Company Reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") prior to the date hereof (excluding any risk factor disclosures set forth under the heading "Risk Factors" and any disclosure of risks included in any "forward-looking statements" disclaimer or any other forward-looking statements of risk that do not contain a reasonable level of detail about the specific risks of which the statements warn (the " _Excluded Disclosure_ "); _provided_ that nothing in the Company Reports shall be deemed to modify or qualify the representation set forth in Section 5.1(b)) or (ii) the corresponding sections or subsections of the disclosure letter delivered to Parent by the Company prior to or simultaneously with entering into this Agreement (the " _Company Disclosure Letter_ ") (it being agreed that disclosure of any item in any section or subsection of the Company Disclosure Letter shall be deemed disclosure with respect to any other section or subsection to which the relevance of such item is reasonably apparent), the Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub that: 

        

 (a) _ Organization, Good Standing and Qualification._ Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is a legal entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing (with respect to jurisdictions that recognize the concept of good standing) under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its organization and has all requisite corporate or similar power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and assets and to carry on its business as presently conducted and is qualified to do business and is in good standing (with respect to jurisdictions that recognize the concept of good standing) as a foreign corporation or other legal entity in each jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing or operation of its assets or properties or the conduct of its business requires such qualification, except where any such failure to be so organized, validly existing, qualified, in good standing or to have such power or authority, is not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

Subsidiaries and their respective businesses and operations. Parent and
Merger Sub hereby acknowledge that there are uncertainties inherent in
attempting to make such estimates, projections, forecasts and other forward-
looking statements, as well as in such business plans, with which Parent and
Merger Sub are familiar, that Parent and Merger Sub are taking full
responsibility for making their own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy
of all estimates, projections, forecasts and other forward-looking
information, as well as such business plans, so furnished to them (including
the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such estimates, projections,
forecasts, forward-looking information or business plans), and that Parent and
Merger Sub will have no claim against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
or any of their respective stockholders, directors, officers, employees,
affiliates, advisors, agents or representatives, or any other Person, with
respect thereto. Accordingly, Parent and Merger Sub hereby acknowledge that
none of the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor any of their respective
stockholders, directors, officers, employees, affiliates, advisors, agents or
representatives, nor any other Person, has made or is making any
representation or warranty with respect to such estimates, projections,
forecasts, forward-looking statements or business plans (including the
reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such estimates, projections,

 (b) _ No Solicitation or Negotiation._ Except as expressly permitted by this Section 6.2 and except as may relate to any Person, group of Persons or group that includes any Person or group of Persons from whom the Company has received during the Go-Shop Period a written Acquisition Proposal that the Board of Directors of the Company or any committee thereof believes in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor) could reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal (any such Person or group of Persons, an " _Excluded Party_ "), the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective officers and directors shall, and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to instruct and cause its and its Subsidiaries\' other Representatives to, (i) at 12:00 a.m. on the 35th calendar day after the date of this Agreement (the " _No-Shop Period Start Date_ ") immediately cease any discussions or negotiations with any Persons that may be ongoing with respect to an Acquisition Proposal and (ii) from the No-Shop Period Start Date until the earlier of the Effective Time and the termination of this Agreement in accordance with Article VIII, not (A) initiate, solicit or knowingly encourage any inquiries or the making of any proposal or offer that constitutes an Acquisition Proposal, (B) engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or provide any non-public information or data concerning the Company or its Subsidiaries to any Person relating to, any Acquisition Proposal, (C) enter into any agreement or agreement in principle with respect to any Acquisition Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement referred to in Section 6.2(a) or Section 6.2(c)), or (D) otherwise knowingly facilitate any effort or attempt to make an Acquisition Proposal.

following the No-Shop Period Start Date and prior to the time, but not after,

Acquisition Proposal from any Person that did not result from a material
breach of Section 6.2(b), the Company and its Representatives may contact such
Person to clarify the terms and conditions thereof and, subject to
compliance with this Section 6.2, (i) the Company and its Representatives may
provide non-public information and data concerning the Company and its
Subsidiaries in response to a request therefor by such Person if the Company
receives from such Person an executed confidentiality agreement on customary
terms not materially more favorable to such Person than those contained
in the Confidentiality Agreement (it being understood that such
confidentiality agreement need not prohibit the making or amendment of an
Acquisition Proposal); _provided_ that the Company shall promptly (and in
any event within 24 hours thereafter) make available to Parent and Merger Sub
any material non-public information concerning the Company or its
Subsidiaries that the Company made available to any Person given such access

or negotiations with such Person and (iii) after having complied with Section
6.2(e), the Board of Directors of the Company or any committee thereof may
authorize, adopt, approve, recommend, or otherwise declare advisable or
propose to authorize, adopt, approve, recommend or declare advisable
(publicly or otherwise) such an Acquisition Proposal, if and only to the
extent that, (x) prior to taking any action described in clause (i) or (ii)
above, the Board of Directors of the Company or any committee thereof
determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel)
that failure to take such action could be inconsistent with the directors\'
fiduciary duties under applicable Law; (y) in each such case referred to in
clause (i) or (ii) above, the Board of Directors of the Company or
any committee thereof has determined in good faith (after consultation with
its financial advisor) that such Acquisition Proposal either constitutes a
Superior Proposal or could reasonably be expected to result in a Superior
Proposal; and (z) in the case referred to in clause (iii) above, the Board of
Directors of the Company or any committee thereof determines in good faith
(after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor)
that such Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal. For the avoidance of
doubt, notwithstanding the occurrence of the No-Shop Period Start Date, the
Company may continue to engage in the activities described in Section 6.2(a)
with respect to any Excluded Parties, including with respect to any amended
proposal submitted by any Excluded Parties following the No-Shop Period Start
Date, and the restrictions in Section 6.2(b) shall not apply with respect
thereto.

   

 (d) _ Definitions._ For purposes of this Agreement: 

  

  

 (i) " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means (i) any proposal or offer with respect to a merger, consolidation, business combination or similar transaction involving the Company and/or any of its Subsidiaries or (ii) any acquisition by any Person or group of Persons resulting in, or proposal or offer to acquire by tender offer, share exchange or in any manner which if consummated would result in, any Person or group of Persons becoming the beneficial owner of, directly or indirectly, in one or a series of related transactions, more than 20% of the total voting power or of any class of equity securities of the Company, or more than 20% of the consolidated total assets (including, equity 

  

      

  

securities of its Subsidiaries) of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as
a whole, in each case other than the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

  

 (ii) " _Superior Proposal_ " means an Acquisition Proposal (with the percentages set forth in the definition of such term changed from 20% to 50%), that the Board of Directors of the Company or any committee thereof has determined in its good faith judgment (i) is reasonably likely to be consummated in accordance with its terms, taking into account all legal, financial and regulatory aspects of the proposal (including the financing thereof) and the Person making the proposal, and (ii) if consummated, would result in a transaction more favorable to the Company\'s stockholders from a financial point of view than the transaction contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

 (iii) " _Excluded Party Superior Proposal_ " means any Superior Proposal made by an Excluded Party. 

  

  

 (e) _ No Change in Recommendation or Alternative Acquisition Agreement._ Except as set forth in this Section 6.2(e), Section 6.2(f), Section 8.3(a) or Section 8.3(c), the Board of Directors of the Company and each committee thereof shall not: 

  

  

 (i) withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify (or publicly propose or resolve to withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify), in a manner adverse to Parent, the Company Recommendation with respect to the Merger or approve or recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend, or resolve to approve or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal (it being understood that the Board of Directors may take no position with respect to an Acquisition Proposal until the close of business as of the tenth (10th) business day after the commencement of such Acquisition Proposal pursuant to Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act without such action being considered an adverse modification); or 

  

 (ii) except as expressly permitted by Section 8.3(a), cause or permit the Company to enter into any letter of intent, acquisition agreement, merger agreement or similar definitive agreement (other than a confidentiality agreement referred to in Section 6.2(a) or Section 6.2(c)) (an " _Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ ") relating to any Acquisition Proposal. 

  

  

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, prior
to the time, but not after, the Company Requisite Vote is obtained, the Board
of Directors of the Company and any committee thereof may withhold, withdraw,
qualify or modify the Company Recommendation or approve, recommend or
otherwise declare advisable any Acquisition Proposal that the Board of
Directors of the Company or any committee thereof believes in good faith is a
Superior Proposal (including any Excluded Party Superior Proposal) made after
the date hereof, if the Board of Directors of the Company or any committee
thereof determines in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel,
that failure to do so could be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations
under applicable Law (a " _Change of Recommendation_ ") and may also take
action pursuant to Section 8.3(a) or Section 8.3(c); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the Company shall not effect a Change of Recommendation in connection
with a Superior Proposal or take any action pursuant to

        

Section 8.3(a) with respect to a Superior Proposal unless: (x) the Company
notifies Parent in writing, at least seventy-two (72) hours in advance, that
it intends to effect a Change of Recommendation in connection with a Superior
Proposal or to take action pursuant to Section 8.3(a) with respect to a
Superior Proposal, which notice shall specify the identity of the party who
made such Superior Proposal and all of the material terms and conditions of
such Superior Proposal and attach the most current version of such agreement;
(y) after providing such notice and prior to making such Change of
Recommendation in connection with a Superior Proposal or taking any action
pursuant to Section 8.3(a) with respect to a Superior Proposal, the Company
shall negotiate in good faith with Parent during such seventy-two (72) hour
period (to the extent that Parent desires to negotiate) to make such revisions
to the terms of this Agreement as would permit the Board of Directors of the
Company not to effect a Change of a Recommendation in connection with a
Superior Proposal or to take such action pursuant to Section 8.3(a) in
response to a Superior Proposal; and (z) the Board of Directors of the Company
shall have considered in good faith any changes to this Agreement, the
Financing Commitments and the Guarantee offered in writing by Parent in a
manner that would form a binding contract if accepted by the Company and shall
have determined in good faith that the Superior Proposal would continue to
constitute a Superior Proposal if such changes offered in writing by Parent
were to be given effect; _provided that_ , for the avoidance of doubt, the
Company shall not effect a Change of Recommendation in connection with a
Superior Proposal or take any action pursuant to Section 8.3(a) with respect
to a Superior Proposal prior to the time that is seventy-two (72) hours after
it has provided the written notice required by clause (x) above;
_provided further_ that in the event that the Acquisition Proposal is
thereafter modified by the party making such Acquisition Proposal, the Company
shall provide written notice of such modified Acquisition Proposal and shall
again comply with this Section 6.2(e), except that the deadline for such new
written notice shall be reduced to twenty-four (24) hours (rather than the
seventy-two (72) hours otherwise contemplated by this Section 6.2(e)) and the
time the Company shall be permitted to effect a Change of Recommendation in
connection with a Superior Proposal or to take action pursuant to Section
8.3(a) with respect to a Superior Proposal shall be reduced to the time that
is twenty-four (24) hours after it has provided such written notice (rather
than the time that is seventy-two (72) hours otherwise contemplated by this
Section 6.2(e)).

  

 (f) _ Certain Permitted Disclosure._ Nothing contained in this Section 6.2 shall be deemed to prohibit the Company or the Board of Directors of the Company or any committee thereof from (i) complying with its disclosure obligations under U.S. federal or state Law with regard to an Acquisition Proposal, including taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar communication to stockholders), or (ii) making any "stop-look-and-listen" communication to the stockholders of the Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar communications to the stockholders of the Company). 

   

 (g) _ Notice._ Within three (3) business days following the No-Shop Period Start Date, the Company shall notify Parent of the number of Excluded Parties and provide Parent with a written summary of the material terms and conditions of any Acquisition Proposal received from any Excluded Party (which material terms and conditions shall include the identity of the Person or group of Persons making the Acquisition Proposal). From and after the No- 

        

Shop Period Start Date, the Company agrees that it will promptly (and, in any
event, within 48 hours) notify Parent if (i) any proposals or offers with
respect to an Acquisition Proposal are received by it or any of its
Representatives indicating, in connection with such notice, the identity of
the Person making the proposal or offer and the material terms and conditions
of any proposals or offers (including, if applicable, copies of any proposals
or offers constituting Acquisition Proposals, including proposed agreements)
and (ii) any non-public information is requested from, or any discussions or
negotiations are sought to be initiated with, it or any of its Representatives
indicating, in connection with such notice, the identity of the Person
seeking such information or discussions or negotiations, and in each case,
thereafter shall keep Parent reasonably informed of the status of any such
discussions or negotiations. In the event that any such party modifies its
Acquisition Proposal in any material respect, the Company shall notify Parent
within 48 hours after receipt of such modified Acquisition Proposal of the
fact that such Acquisition Proposal has been modified and the terms of such
modification (including, if applicable, copies of any written documentation
reflecting such modification). The Company agrees that it and its
Subsidiaries will not enter any confidentiality agreement subsequent to the
date hereof which prohibits the Company from providing to Parent such material
terms and conditions and other information.

  

 6.3. _ Proxy Filings; Information Supplied._ The Company shall prepare and file with the SEC, as promptly as practicable after the date hereof, a proxy statement in preliminary form relating to the Stockholders Meeting (such proxy statement, including any amendment or supplement thereto, the " _Proxy Statement_ "). The Company agrees that at the date of mailing to stockholders of the Company and at the time of the Stockholders Meeting, (i) the Proxy Statement will comply in all material respects with the applicable provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder and (ii) none of the information supplied by it or any of its Subsidiaries for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement will contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Parent and Merger Sub agree that none of the information supplied by either of them or any of their Affiliates for inclusion in the Proxy Statement will contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary stated above, prior to filing or mailing the Proxy Statement (or, in each case, any amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC with respect thereto, the Company shall provide Parent an opportunity to review and comment on such document or response and shall consider in good faith any comments reasonably proposed by Parent.

Company has provided a written notice to Parent and Merger Sub pursuant to
Section 6.2(e) that it intends to make a Change of Recommendation in
connection with a Superior Proposal or take action pursuant to Section 8.3(a)
with respect to a Superior Proposal and the deadline contemplated by Section

reasonable lawful action to solicit such adoption of this Agreement.

 (b) _ Cooperation._ Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, the Company and Parent shall cooperate with each other and use (and shall cause their respective Affiliates to use) their respective reasonable best efforts to take or cause to be taken all actions, and do or cause to be done all things, reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its part under this Agreement and applicable Laws to consummate and make effective the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement as soon as practicable, including preparing and filing as promptly as practicable all documentation to effect all necessary notices, reports and other filings and to obtain as promptly as practicable all consents, registrations, approvals, permits and authorizations necessary or advisable to be obtained from any third party and/or any Governmental Entity in order to consummate the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including under the HSR Act, the ECMR and any other applicable Antitrust Law. In furtherance of and not in limitation of the foregoing, (i) Parent and the Company each shall file the initial pre-merger notifications with respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated herein required under the HSR Act (which filing, including the exhibits thereto, need not be shared or otherwise disclosed to the other party except to outside counsel of each party) no later than fifteen (15) business days after the date of this Agreement and (ii) Parent shall file a pre-merger notification under the ECMR (which filing, including the exhibits thereto, need not be shared or otherwise disclosed to the other party except

early termination of the waiting period with respect to the Merger under the
HSR Act, the ECMR and any other applicable Antitrust Law. Parent will not
withdraw its initial filing under the HSR Act, the ECMR or any other Antitrust
Law, as the case may be, and refile it unless the Company has consented in
advance to such withdrawal and refiling. Subject to applicable Laws relating
to the exchange of information, Parent and the Company shall have the right
to review in advance, and to the extent practicable each will consult with the
other on and consider in good faith the views of the other in connection with,
all of the information relating to Parent or the Company, as the case may be,
and any of their respective Affiliates, that appears in any filing made with,
or written materials submitted to, any third party and/or any Governmental
Entity in connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. In exercising the foregoing rights, each of the Company and
Parent shall act reasonably and as promptly as practicable. Nothing in this
Agreement shall require the Company or its Subsidiaries to take or agree to
take any action with respect to its business or operations unless
the effectiveness of such agreement or action is conditioned upon Closing.
For purposes of this Agreement, " _Antitrust Law_ " means the Sherman Act,

Neither the Company nor Parent shall permit any of its Affiliates, officers or any other Representatives to participate in any meeting with any Governmental Entity in respect of any filings, investigation or other inquiry with respect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby unless it consults with the other party in advance and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity, gives the other party the opportunity to attend and participate thereat. 

   

 (e) _ Antitrust Matters._ Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, without limiting the generality of the other undertakings pursuant to this

this Section 6.5(e) set forth below) and Parent (in all cases set forth below)
agree to take or cause to be taken the following actions:

  

  

 (i) to provide promptly to each and every federal, state, local or foreign court or Governmental Entity with jurisdiction over enforcement of any applicable Antitrust Law (a " _Governmental Antitrust Entity_ ") such non-privileged information and documents as requested by any such Governmental Antitrust Entity or that are necessary, proper or advisable to permit consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; 

  

 (ii) to use its reasonable best efforts to avoid the entry or enactment of any permanent, preliminary or temporary injunction or other order, decree, decision, determination, judgment, investigation or Law that would delay, restrain, prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the proffer and agreement by Parent of its willingness to sell or otherwise dispose of, or hold separate pending such disposition, and promptly to effect the sale, disposal and holding separate of, such assets, categories of assets or businesses or other segments of the Company or Parent or either\'s respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates (and the entry into agreements with, and submission to orders of, the relevant Governmental Antitrust Entity giving effect thereto) if such action is reasonably necessary to avoid, prevent, eliminate or remove the actual or threatened (x) commencement of any investigation or proceeding in any forum or (y) issuance or enactment of any order, decree, decision, determination, judgment or Law that would delay, restrain, prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby by any Governmental Antitrust Entity; and 

  

 (iii) in the event that any permanent, preliminary or temporary injunction, decision, order, judgment, determination, decree or Law is entered, issued or enacted, or becomes reasonably foreseeable to be entered, issued or enacted, in any proceeding, review or inquiry of any kind that would make consummation of the Merger in accordance with the terms of this Agreement unlawful or that would delay, restrain, prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit consummation of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, to use its reasonable best efforts to take any and all steps (including the appeal thereof, the posting of a bond or the taking of the steps contemplated by clause (ii) of this Section 6.5(e)) necessary to resist, vacate, modify, reverse, suspend, prevent, eliminate, avoid or remove such actual, anticipated or threatened injunction, decision, order, judgment, determination, decree or enactment so as to permit such consummation on a schedule as close as possible to that contemplated by this Agreement.

 (a) Parent agrees that, during the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on December 31, 2011, the employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries will be provided with (i) base salary or base hourly wage which are no less than the base salary or base hourly wage provided by the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) employee benefits, including cash-based bonus opportunities, that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to those provided by the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time and (iii) severance benefits that are no less favorable than those set forth in Section 6.9(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter ; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event 

        

shall Parent or any of its Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation)
be required to take into account any equity compensation or bonus performance
targets when determining whether employee benefits are substantially
comparable.

  

 (b) Parent shall cause any employee benefit plans which the employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries are entitled to participate in to take into account for purposes of eligibility, vesting and benefit accrual thereunder (other than any benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension plans), service by employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries as if such service were with Parent, to the same extent such service was credited under a comparable plan of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (except to the extent it would result in a duplication of benefits). 

  

 (c) Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and any successor thereto to honor the Company\'s and its Subsidiaries\' obligations under the agreements identified in Section 6.9(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter in accordance with their terms. 

  

 (d) If the Effective Time occurs prior to September 30, 2010, immediately prior to the Effective Time and only to the extent it will not cause an impermissible acceleration event under Section 409A of the Code or result in non-deductible payments under Section 280G of the Code, the Company will pay (i) each participant in the Company Executive Bonus Plan and (ii) each participant who has historically been eligible to receive a discretionary bonus in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practices who remains employed through the Effective Time for the year in which the Effective Time occurs, an annual bonus in an amount determined in a manner that is substantially consistent with past practice and equal to the product of (x) the annual bonus earned by participants for the year in which the Effective Time occurs (assuming a full year of performance) as reasonably determined by the Company, not to exceed $15 million in the aggregate, and (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days elapsed in the plan year from the commencement of the plan year until the date on which the Effective Time occurs and the denominator of which is 365. If the Effective Time occurs after September 30, 2010, the Company shall be permitted, prior to the Effective Time, to pay annual bonuses for 2010 in an amount equal to the annual bonus earned by participants for the 2010 calendar year, in a manner that is substantially consistent with past practice and which shall not exceed $15 million in the aggregate. 

  

 (e) Parent hereby acknowledges that a "change in control" or "change of control" within the meaning of the Benefit Plans identified in Section 6.9(e) of the Company Disclosure Letter will occur upon the Effective Time. 

  

 (f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained herein shall (i) be treated as an amendment of any Benefit Plan, (ii) give any employee or former employee or any other individual associated therewith or any employee benefit plan or trustee thereof or any other third party any right to enforce the provisions of this Section 6.9 or (iii) obligate Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates to (A) maintain any particular benefit plan or (B) retain the employment of any particular employee. 

        

 6.10. _ Expenses._ The Surviving Corporation shall pay all charges and expenses, including those of the Paying Agent, in connection with the transactions contemplated in Article IV. Except as otherwise provided in Section 8.5, whether or not the Merger is consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the financing thereof (collectively, the " _Expenses_ ") shall be paid by the party incurring such expense except, subject to the terms of this Agreement, (a) for Parent\'s reimbursement obligations pursuant to Section 6.14(b), (b) for Parent\'s indemnification obligations pursuant to Section 6.14(b), (c) for Parent\'s reimbursement obligations pursuant to Section 6.19, and (d) for Parent\'s indemnification and payment obligations pursuant to Section 6.19. 

  

 6.11. _ Indemnification; Directors\' and Officers\' Insurance._ 

  

 (a) From and after the Effective Time, each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation agrees that it will indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law (and Parent shall also advance expenses as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law), each present and former director and officer of the Company and its Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") against any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys\' fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or related to such Indemnified Parties\' service as a director or officer of the Company or its Subsidiaries or services performed by such persons at the request of the Company or its Subsidiaries at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, including, for the avoidance of doubt, in connection with (i) the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) actions to enforce this provision or any other indemnification or advancement right of any Indemnified Party. 

  

 (b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall and, if the Company is unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective Time to obtain and fully pay the premium for "tail" insurance policies for the extension of (i) the directors\' and officers\' liability coverage of the Company\'s existing directors\' and officers\' insurance policies, and (ii) the Company\'s existing fiduciary liability insurance policies, in each case for a claims reporting or discovery period of at least six years from and after the Effective Time from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Company\'s insurance carrier as of the date hereof with respect to directors\' and officers\' liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance (collectively, " _D andO Insurance_") with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are at least as favorable to the insureds as the Company\'s existing policies with respect to any matter claimed against a director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by reason of him or her serving in such capacity that existed or occurred at or prior to the Effective Time (including in connection with this Agreement or the transactions or actions contemplated hereby); _provided_ that the cost of the annual premium amount for such "tail" insurance policies does not exceed an amount equal to 300% of the annual premiums currently paid by the Company for such insurance. If the Company or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, for any reason fail to obtain such insurance policies as of the Effective Time, the 

        

Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to, continue to maintain in effect for a period of at least six years from and
after the Effective Time the DandO Insurance in place as of the date hereof
with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are at least
as favorable to the insureds as provided in the Company\'s existing policies
as of the date hereof, or the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to, use reasonable best efforts to purchase
comparable DandO Insurance for such six-year period with terms, conditions,
retentions and limits of liability that are at least as favorable to the
insureds as provided in the Company\'s existing policies as of the date
hereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall Parent or the
Surviving Corporation be required to expend for such policies pursuant to
this sentence an annual premium amount in excess of 300% of the annual
premiums currently paid by the Company for such insurance; and _provided_ ,
_further_ , that if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such
amount, the Surviving Corporation shall obtain a policy with the greatest
coverage available for a cost not exceeding such amount.

  

 (c) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) shall consolidate with or merge into any other corporation or entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) shall transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any individual, corporation or other entity, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall assume all of the obligations set forth in this Section 6.11. 

  

 (d) The provisions of this Section 6.11 are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties, who are third party beneficiaries of this Section 6.11. 

  

 (e) The rights of the Indemnified Parties under this Section 6.11 shall be in addition to any rights such Indemnified Parties may have under the certificate of incorporation, bylaws or comparable governing documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or under any applicable Contracts or Laws. All rights to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time and rights to advancement of expenses relating thereto now existing in favor of any Indemnified Party as provided in the certificate of incorporation, bylaws or comparable governing documents of the Company and its Subsidiaries or any indemnification agreement between such Indemnified Party and the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall survive the Merger and shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely affect any right thereunder of any such Indemnified Party. 

  

 6.12. _ Takeover Statutes._ If any Takeover Statute is or may become applicable to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Company and its Board of Directors shall grant such approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that such transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of such statute or regulation on such transactions. 

        

 6.13. _ Parent Vote._ 

  

 (a) Parent shall vote (or consent with respect to) or cause to be voted (or a consent to be given with respect to) any Shares beneficially owned by it or any of its Subsidiaries or with respect to which it or any of its Subsidiaries has the power (by agreement, proxy or otherwise) to cause to be voted (or to provide a consent), in favor of the adoption of this Agreement at any meeting of stockholders of the Company at which this Agreement shall be submitted for adoption and at all adjournments or postponements thereof (or, if applicable, by any action of stockholders of the Company by consent in lieu of a meeting). 

  

 (b) Immediately following the execution of this Agreement, Parent shall execute and deliver, in accordance with Section 228 of the DGCL and in its capacity as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub, a written consent adopting the Agreement. 

  

 6.14. _ Financing._ 

  

 (a) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange and obtain the Debt Financing on the terms and conditions described in the Debt Financing Commitments and shall not permit any amendment or modification to be made to, or any waiver of any provision or remedy under the Financing Commitments if such amendment, modification or waiver would (x) reduce the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing (including by changing the amount of fees to be paid or original issue discount of the Debt Financing unless the Equity Financing is increased by a corresponding amount), or (y) impose new or additional conditions, or otherwise amend, modify or expand any conditions, to the receipt of the Debt Financing in a manner that would reasonably be expected to (I) delay or prevent the Closing Date, (II) make the funding of the Debt Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the Debt Financing) less likely to occur or (III) adversely impact the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to enforce its rights against the other parties to the Debt Financing Commitments or the definitive agreements with respect thereto, the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or the likelihood of consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. Subject to the limitations set forth in Section 5.2(e), Parent and Merger Sub may replace or amend the Debt Financing Commitments to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities that have not executed the Debt Financing Commitments as of the date hereof, if the addition of such additional parties, individually or in the aggregate, would not prevent, delay or impair the availability of the financing under the Debt Financing Commitments or the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. For purposes of this Section 6.14, references to "Financing" shall include the financing contemplated by the Financing Commitments as permitted to be amended or modified by this Section 6.14(a) and references to "Financing Commitments" or "Debt Financing Commitments" shall include such documents as permitted to be amended or modified by this Section 6.14(a). Without limiting the foregoing, Parent and Merger Sub shall use their reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in effect the Debt Financing Commitments until the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are consummated, (ii) satisfy all conditions and covenants applicable to Parent and Merger Sub in the Debt Financing Commitments (including by consummating the financing 

        

pursuant to the terms of the Equity Financing Commitments) at or prior to
Closing and otherwise comply with its obligations thereunder, (iii) enter into
definitive agreements with respect thereto on the terms and conditions
(including the flex provisions) contemplated by the Debt Financing
Commitments, (iv) consummate the Financing at or prior to the Closing, (v)
enforce its rights under the Debt Financing Commitments and (vi) cause the
lenders and other Persons providing Financing to fund on the Closing Date the
Financing contemplated to be funded on the Closing Date by the Debt Financing
Commitments (or such lesser amount as may be required to consummate the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated hereby). Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, Parent and Merger Sub shall give the Company
prompt notice: (A) of any breach or default (or any event or circumstance
that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would reasonably be
expected to give rise to any breach or default) by any party to any Financing
Commitment or definitive document related to the Financing of which Parent or
its Affiliates becomes aware; (B) of the receipt of any written notice or
other written communication from any Person with respect to any: (x) actual or
potential breach, default, termination or repudiation by any party to any
Financing Commitment or any definitive document related to the Financing or
any provisions of the Financing Commitment or any definitive document related
to the Financing or (y) material dispute or disagreement between or among any
parties to any Financing Commitment or any definitive document related to the
Financing (but excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any ordinary course
negotiations with respect to the terms of the Financing or any definitive
agreement with respect thereto); and (C) if for any reason Parent or Merger
Sub believes in good faith that it will not be able to obtain all or any
portion of the Financing on the terms, in the manner or from the sources
contemplated by the Financing Commitment or the definitive documents related
to the Financing; _provided_ , that in no event will Parent or Merger Sub be
under any obligation to disclose any information that is subject to attorney-
client or similar privilege if Parent and Merger Sub shall have used their
reasonable best efforts to disclose such information in a way that would not
waive such privilege. As soon as reasonably practicable, but in any event
within five (5) business days after the date the Company delivers Parent or
Merger Sub a written request, Parent and Merger Sub shall provide any
information reasonably requested by the Company relating to any circumstance
referred to in clause (A), (B) or (C) of the immediately preceding sentence.
If any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and
conditions (including the flex provisions) contemplated in the Debt Financing
Commitments, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to arrange and
obtain alternative financing from alternative sources on terms and conditions
that are no less favorable, in the aggregate, to Parent (taking into account
the flex provisions set forth in the Debt Financing Commitments) than those
set forth in the Debt Financing Commitment, in an amount sufficient to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as
practicable following the occurrence of such event but no later than the
earlier of the last business day of the Marketing Period. For purposes of this
Agreement, " _Marketing Period_ " shall mean the first period of 20
consecutive calendar days after the date of this Agreement throughout which
(A) Parent shall have the Essential Marketing Information and (B) the
conditions set forth in Section 7.1 shall have been satisfied (other than
those conditions that by their nature can only be satisfied at the Closing)
and nothing has occurred and no condition exists that would cause any of the
conditions set forth in Section 7.2 to fail to be satisfied assuming the
Closing were to be scheduled for any time during such twenty (20) consecutive
calendar day period; _provided_ , _however_ , without the consent of Parent,
in no event shall the Marketing Period commence prior

        

to September 7, 2010; _provided_ , _further_ , that if such 20 consecutive
day period has not ended prior to November 25, 2010 then it will not commence
until November 29, 2010; and _provided_ , _further_ , that if the Marketing
Period has not ended on or prior to December 23, 2010, the Marketing Period
shall not be deemed to have commenced until January 4, 2011 for any purpose
hereunder; and _provided_ , _further_ , that (i) such 20 consecutive day
period will be reduced to 18 consecutive days if such 18 consecutive day
period begins on or after November 29, 2010 and is completed on or before
December 23, 2010 and (ii) the Marketing Period shall not be deemed to have
commenced if, prior to the completion of the Marketing Period,
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP shall have withdrawn its audit opinion with
respect to any financial statements contained in the Company Reports (or if
the Essential Marketing Information includes the Company\'s audited financial
statements as of, and for the 12 month period ending September 30, 2010 with
respect to the audited financial statements dated as of such date); _provided_
that the Marketing Period shall end on any earlier date that is the date on
which the Debt Financing otherwise is obtained. For purposes of this
Agreement, " _Essential Marketing Information_ " shall mean, as of any date,
(i) such financial statements, financial data and other pertinent information
regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries of the type required by SEC
Regulation S-X and SEC Regulation S-K under the Securities Act (including pro
forma financial information, provided that it is understood that assumptions
underlying the pro forma adjustments to be made are the responsibility of the
Parent) for registered offerings of non-convertible debt securities, to the
extent the same is of the type and form customarily included in private
placements under Rule 144A under the Securities Act to consummate the
offering of secured or unsecured senior notes and/or senior subordinated
notes, made on any date during the relevant period and specified in writing
by Parent to the Company not later than twenty (20) days after the date hereof
(provided that in no circumstance shall the Company be required to provide
subsidiary financial statements or any other information of the type required
by Rule 3-09, Rule 3-10 or Rule 3-16 of Regulation S-X, Compensation
Disclosure and Analysis required by Regulation S-K Item 402(b) or other
information customarily excluded from a Rule 144A offering memorandum),
and (ii) such other information and data as are otherwise necessary in order
to receive customary "comfort" letters with respect to the financial
statements and data referred to in clause (i) of this definition (including
"negative assurance" comfort) from the independent auditors of the Company and
its Subsidiaries on any date during the relevant period; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that if the Company shall in good faith reasonably believe it has
delivered the Essential Marketing Information, it may deliver to Parent a
written notice to that effect (stating when it believes it completed such
delivery), in which case the Marketing Period shall be deemed to have
commenced on the date specified in that notice unless Parent in good faith
reasonably believes the Company has not completed delivery of the Essential
Marketing Information and, within three (3) business days of the delivery of
such notice by the Company, delivers a written notice to the Company to that
effect (stating with specificity which Essential Marketing Information
that Parent reasonably believes the Company has not delivered). Parent shall
keep the Company informed on a reasonably current basis in reasonable detail
of the status of its efforts to arrange the Debt Financing and concurrently

Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to pay any commitment or other similar fee or to make any other payment (other than reasonable out-of-pocket costs) or incur any other liability or provide or 

        

agree to provide any indemnity in connection with the Tender Offer,
compliance with this Section 6.19 or any of the foregoing that is effective
prior to the Effective Time. Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the
Company, its Subsidiaries and the Representatives of the Company from and
against any and all liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses,
interest, awards, judgments and penalties suffered or incurred by them in
connection with the Tender Offer and in compliance with this Section 6.19
(including any action taken in accordance with this Section 6.19(a)) and any
information utilized in connection therewith (other than historical
information relating to the Company or its Subsidiaries). Parent shall,
promptly upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company for all
documented and reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred by the Company or its
Subsidiaries in connection with this Section 6.19(a), including in connection
with the review of the Offer Documents. At the request of Parent, in
connection with the Tender Offer and the related consent solicitation, the
Company shall enter into one or more dealer manager agreements on customary
terms with such Persons as shall be determined by Parent (which agreements
shall be assumed by Parent in the event this Agreement is terminated).

  

 (b) If Parent does not elect before the commencement of the Marketing Period to direct the Company to conduct and complete the Tender Offer as contemplated by Section 6.19(a) or the conditions to the Tender Offer are not satisfied (or, with the prior written consent of Parent, waived at Closing), the Company shall comply with Section 3.01 of the Indenture at the Effective Time or use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the agreement of the trustee under the Indenture to waive compliance with Section 3.01 of the Indenture in connection with the Discharge. If requested by the Parent in writing, the Company shall (A) simultaneously with the Effective Time issue a notice of optional redemption for all of the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the 2015 Notes pursuant to the redemption provisions of the Indenture, and (B) simultaneously with the Effective Time, take any other actions reasonably requested by the Parent to facilitate the satisfaction and discharge of the 2015 Notes pursuant to the satisfaction and discharge provisions of the Indenture and the other provisions of the Indenture; provided that prior to or simultaneously with the Company\'s being required to take any of the actions described in clauses (A) and (B) above, the Parent shall have, or shall have caused to be, deposited with the trustee under the Indenture in a timely manner sufficient funds to effect such redemption and satisfaction and discharge. The redemption and satisfaction and discharge of the 2015 Notes pursuant to the preceding sentence are referred to collectively as the " _Discharge_ " of the 2015 Notes. Subject to the foregoing three (3) sentences, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause their respective Representatives to, provide all cooperation reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the Discharge of the 2015 Notes identified to the Company by Parent in writing at any time.

 9.4. _ Counterparts._ This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each such counterpart being deemed to be an original instrument, and all such counterparts shall together constitute one and the same agreement. 

  

 _9.5. GOVERNING LAW AND VENUE; WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL; SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE_. 

  

 (a) THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE DEEMED TO BE MADE IN AND IN ALL RESPECTS SHALL BE INTERPRETED, CONSTRUED AND GOVERNED BY AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAW OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE WITHOUT REGARD TO THE CONFLICTS OF LAW PRINCIPLES THEREOF. The parties hereby irrevocably submit to the personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, or to the extent such Court does not have subject matter jurisdiction, the Superior Court of the State of Delaware (the " _Chosen Courts_ ") solely in respect of the interpretation and enforcement of the provisions of this Agreement and of the documents referred to in this Agreement, and in respect of the transactions contemplated hereby, and hereby waive, and agree not to assert, as a defense in any action, suit or proceeding for the interpretation or enforcement hereof or of any such document, that it is not subject thereto or that such action, suit or proceeding may not be brought or is not maintainable in the Chosen Courts or that the Chosen Courts are an inconvenient forum or that the venue thereof may not be appropriate, or that this Agreement or any such document may not be enforced in or by such Chosen Courts, and the parties hereto irrevocably agree that all claims relating to such action, suit or proceeding shall be heard and determined in the Chosen Courts. The parties hereby consent to and grant any such Chosen Court jurisdiction over the person of such parties and, to the extent permitted by Law, over the subject matter of such dispute and agree that mailing of process or other papers in connection with any such action, suit or proceeding in the manner provided in Section 9.6 or in such other manner as may be permitted by law shall be valid, effective and sufficient service thereof. 

        

 (b) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (i) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF SUCH ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (ii) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (iii) EACH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (iv) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 9.5. 

  

 (c) The parties agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that the parties hereto do not perform the provisions of this Agreement (including failing to take such actions as are required of it hereunder in order to consummate this Agreement) in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions. The parties acknowledge and agree that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at Law or in equity. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is explicitly agreed that the Company shall be entitled to seek specific performance of Parent\'s obligation to cause the Equity Financing to be funded to fund the Merger only in the event that (i) all conditions in Sections 7.1 and 7.2 have been satisfied (or, with respect to certificates to be delivered at the Closing, are capable of being satisfied) at the time when the Closing would have occurred but for the failure of the Equity Financing to be funded, (ii) the Debt Financing (or, if alternative financing is being used in accordance with Section 6.14, pursuant to the commitments with respect thereto) has been funded or will be funded at the Closing if the Equity Financing is funded at the Closing, and (iii) the Company has irrevocably confirmed that if specific performance is granted and the Equity Financing and Debt Financing are funded, then the Closing pursuant to Article II will occur. Each of the parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief on the basis that (x) the other party has an adequate remedy at law or (y) an award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity. Any party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in connection with any such order or injunction. 

  

 (d) Each of the parties hereto agrees that it will not bring or support any action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim of any kind or description, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against the Financing 

        

Sources in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including but not limited to any dispute
arising out of or relating in any way to the Debt Financing Commitments or
the performance thereof, in any forum other than the Supreme Court of the
State of New York, County of New York, or, if under applicable law exclusive
jurisdiction is vested in the Federal courts, the United States District
Court for the Southern District of New York (and appellate courts thereof).

warranties both written and oral, among the parties, with respect to the
subject matter hereof. EACH PARTY HERETO AGREES THAT, EXCEPT FOR THE
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT OR IN
THE GUARANTEE, NEITHER PARENT AND MERGER SUB NOR THE COMPANY MAKES ANY OTHER

TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, NOTWITHSTANDING THE DELIVERY OR DISCLOSURE
TO THE OTHER OR THE OTHER\'S REPRESENTATIVES OF ANY DOCUMENTATION OR OTHER
INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO ANY ONE OR MORE OF THE FOREGOING.

  

 9.8. _ No Third Party Beneficiaries._ Except (i) as provided in Section 6.11 (Indemnification; Directors\' and Officers\' Insurance) (ii) with respect to the indemnification and reimbursement obligations of Parent pursuant to Section 6.14(b) (Financing), (iii) only with respect to stockholders and only after the Effective Time, for the provisions set forth in Article IV, and (iv) as provided in Section 8.5, each of the Persons whose liability is limited in accordance with Section 8.5 to the extent provided therein, including, without limitation the Financing Sources who shall be express third party beneficiaries of, and shall be entitled to rely on, Sections 8.5(d)(i) and (d)(iii), 9.1, 9.5(b) and (d) and this Section 9.8. Parent and the Company hereby agree that their respective representations, warranties and covenants set forth herein are solely for the benefit of the other party hereto, in accordance with and subject to the terms of this Agreement, and this Agreement is not intended to, and does not, confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder, including the right to rely upon the representations and warranties set forth herein. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Sections 8.5(d)(i) and (d)(iii), 9.1, 9.5(b) and (d) and this Section 9.8 (and any provision of this Agreement to the extent a modification, waiver or termination of such provision would modify the substance of Sections 8.5(d)(i) and (d)(iii), 9.1, 9.5(b) and (d) and this Section 9.8) may not be modified, waived or terminated in a manner that impacts or is adverse in any respect to the Financing Sources without the prior written consent of the Financing Sources. The parties hereto further agree that the rights of third party beneficiaries under Section 6.11 shall not arise unless and until the Effective Time occurs. The representations and warranties in this Agreement are the product of negotiations among the parties hereto and are for the sole benefit of the parties hereto. Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are subject to waiver by the parties hereto in accordance with Section 9.3 without notice or liability to any other Person. In some instances, the representations and warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation among the parties hereto of risks associated with particular matters regardless of the knowledge of any of the parties hereto. Consequently, Persons other than the parties hereto may not rely upon the representations and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any other date. 

        

 9.9. _ Obligations of Parent and of the Company._ Whenever this Agreement requires a Subsidiary of Parent to take any action, such requirement shall be deemed to include an undertaking on the part of Parent to cause such Subsidiary to take such action. Whenever this Agreement requires a Subsidiary of the Company to take any action, such requirement shall be deemed to include an undertaking on the part of the Company to cause such Subsidiary to take such action and, after the Effective Time, on the part of the Surviving Corporation to cause such Subsidiary to take such action. 

  

 9.10. _ Transfer Taxes._ Except as expressly provided in Section 4.2(b), all transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other such Taxes and fees (including penalties and interest) incurred in connection with the Merger shall be paid by Parent and Merger Sub when due. 

   

 9.11. _ Definitions._ Each of the terms set forth in _Annex A_ is defined in the Section of this Agreement set forth opposite such term. 

  

 9.12. _ Severability._ The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof. If any provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof to any Person or any circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable and equitable provision shall be substituted therefor in order to carry out, so far as may be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid or unenforceable provision and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances shall not be affected by such invalidity or unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity or unenforceability affect the validity or enforceability of such provision, or the application thereof, in any other jurisdiction. 

  

 9.13. _ Interpretation; Construction._ (a) The table of contents and headings herein are for convenience of reference only, do not constitute part of this Agreement and shall not be deemed to limit or otherwise affect any of the provisions hereof. Where a reference in this Agreement is made to a Section or Exhibit, such reference shall be to a Section of or Exhibit to this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation." All pronouns and all variations thereof shall be deemed to refer to the masculine, feminine or neuter, singular or plural, as the identity of the Person may require. Where a reference in this Agreement is made to any agreement (including this Agreement), contract, statute or regulation, such references are to, except as context may otherwise require, the agreement, contract, statute or regulation as amended, modified, supplemented, restated or replaced from time to time (in the case of an agreement or contract, to the extent permitted by the terms thereof); and to any section of any statute or regulation including any successor to the section and, in the case of any statute, any rules or regulations promulgated thereunder. All references to "dollars" or "$" in this Agreement are to United States dollars. 

  

 (b) The parties have participated jointly in negotiating and drafting this Agreement. In the event that an ambiguity or a question of intent or interpretation arises, this 

        

Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the parties, and no
presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party
by virtue of the authorship of any provision of this Agreement.

  

 (c) Each party hereto has or may have set forth information in its respective Disclosure Letter in a section thereof that corresponds to the section of this Agreement to which it relates. The fact that any item of information is disclosed in a Disclosure Letter to this Agreement shall not be construed to mean that such information is required to be disclosed by this Agreement. 

  

 9.14. _ Assignment._ This Agreement shall not be assignable by operation of law or otherwise; _provided_ , _however_ , that prior to the mailing of the Proxy Statement to the Company\'s stockholders, Parent may designate, by written notice to the Company, another wholly owned direct or indirect Subsidiary to be a Constituent Corporation in lieu of Merger Sub, in which event all references herein to Merger Sub shall be deemed references to such other Subsidiary, except that all representations and warranties made herein with respect to Merger Sub as of the date of this Agreement shall be deemed representations and warranties made with respect to such other Subsidiary as of the date of such designation; _provided_ that any such designation shall not impede or delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or otherwise materially impede the rights of the stockholders of the Company under this Agreement. Any purported assignment in violation of this Agreement is void. 

        

 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, this Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the duly authorized officers of the parties hereto as of the date first written above.
