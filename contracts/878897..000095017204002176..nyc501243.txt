Company and Merger Subsidiary shall execute and file articles of merger with
the Department of Financial Institutions of the State of Wisconsin and make
all other filings or recordings required by the WBCL to be made in connection
with the Merger. The Merger shall become effective at such time as the
articles of merger are duly filed with the Department of Financial
Institutions of the State of Wisconsin or, if agreed to by the Company and
Parent, at such later time as is specified in the articles of merger (the
"Effective Time").

         (b) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, at
the Effective Time, Merger Subsidiary shall be merged with and into the
Company in accordance with the requirements of the WBCL, whereupon the
separate existence of Merger Subsidiary shall cease. The Company shall be the
surviving corporation in the Merger (the "Surviving Corporation").

         (c) The Merger will have the effects set forth in the WBCL, including
the effects set forth in Section 180.1106 of the WBCL. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, from and after the Effective

         (d) The closing of the transactions contemplated hereby (the

satisfaction or waiver of such conditions, unless this Agreement has been
heretofore terminated pursuant to its terms or another time or date is agreed
to in writing by the parties hereto (the actual time and date of the Closing
being referred to herein as the "Closing Date").

         Section 2.2 Conversion of Shares.

         (a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of the holder thereof:

                  (i) each share of common stock, no par value per share, of
         the Company, together with the associated Company Right
         (collectively, the "Company Common Stock"), outstanding immediately
         prior to the Effective Time shall, except as otherwise provided in
         Section 2.2(a)(ii), be converted into the right to receive an amount
         in cash equal to $32.75 (the "Merger Consideration");

                  (ii) each share of Company Common Stock, held by the Company
         as treasury stock immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
         canceled, and no payment shall be made with respect thereto; and

                  (iii) each share of common stock, no par value per share, of
         Merger Subsidiary ("Merger Subsidiary Common Stock") outstanding
         immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and
         become one share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation with
         the same rights, powers and privileges as the share so converted, and
         the shares so converted shall constitute the only outstanding shares
         of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

         (b) From and after the Effective Time, all shares of Company Common
Stock converted in accordance with Section 2.2(a)(i), and all shares of
Company Common Stock canceled pursuant to Section 2.2(a)(ii) shall no longer
be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease
to exist, and each holder of a certificate representing any shares of Company
Common Stock (a "Certificate") shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration to which such
holder is entitled. From and after the Effective Time, all certificates
representing Merger Subsidiary Common Stock shall be deemed for all purposes
to represent only the number of shares of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation into which they were converted in accordance with Section
2.2(a)(iii).

         Section 2.3 Surrender and Payment.

         (a) Not less than ten (10) Business Days prior to the Effective Time,
Parent shall appoint a paying agent reasonably satisfactory to the Company
(the "Paying Agent") for the purpose of exchanging Certificates for the Merger
Consideration. On the same Business Day as the Effective Time, Parent shall
deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, cash sufficient to make the cash payments
pursuant to Section 2.2(a)(i). On the Business Day immediately following the
Effective Time, Parent will send, or cause the Paying Agent to send, to each
holder of record of shares of Company Common Stock as of the Effective Time, a
letter of transmittal for use in such exchange (which shall specify that the
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon
proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent), which letter shall
be in such form as the Company and Parent may reasonably agree to use in
effecting delivery of shares of Company Common Stock to the Paying Agent.

         (b) Each holder of shares of Company Common Stock that have been
converted into a right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in this
Article II will be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration in respect of
the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificate only upon
surrender to the Paying Agent of such Certificate, together with a properly
completed and duly executed letter of transmittal. Until so surrendered, each
such Certificate shall, after the Effective Time, represent for all purposes
only the right to receive such Merger Consideration. No interest will be paid
or accrued on the Merger Consideration.

         (c) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a
Person other than the Person in whose name the applicable surrendered
Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition to the payment of such
Merger Consideration that (i) the surrendered Certificate shall be properly
endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and (ii) the Person
requesting such payment of the Merger Consideration shall (A) pay to the
Paying Agent any transfer or other Taxes required as a result of such payment
to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or (B)
establish to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent that such Tax either has
been paid or is not payable.

         (d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration
of transfers of shares of capital stock of the Company on the stock records
of, or relating to, the Company. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates
are presented to the Paying Agent, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, they
shall be canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration provided for, and
in accordance with the procedures and subject to the limitations set forth, in
this Article II.

         (e) Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to invest any portion of the
Merger Consideration deposited with the Paying Agent in a money market fund
registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, the principal of which is
invested solely in obligations issued or guaranteed by the United States
Government and repurchase agreements in respect of such obligations. Any
interest and other income resulting from such investment shall be the property
of, and shall be paid to, Parent. Any losses resulting from such investment
shall not in any way diminish Parent's and Merger Subsidiary's obligation to
pay the full amount of the Merger Consideration.

         (f) Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the
Paying Agent pursuant to Section 2.3(a) that remains unclaimed by the holders
of shares of Company Common Stock one (1) year after the Effective Time shall
be returned to Parent and any such holder who has not exchanged such holder's
shares of Company Common Stock for the Merger Consideration in accordance with
this Section 2.3 prior to that time shall thereafter look only to Parent for
delivery of the Merger Consideration in respect of such holder's shares
without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent,
the Surviving Corporation, the Company, the Paying Agent or their respective
Representatives shall be liable to any Person for any Merger Consideration
delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Laws. If any Certificate shall not have been surrendered
immediately prior to such date on which any Merger Consideration would
otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Authority, any
such Merger Consideration shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims
or interests of any Person previously entitled thereto.

         Section 2.4 Stock Options and Other Equity Awards.

         (a) All stock options (the "Company Options") outstanding, whether or
not exercisable and vested, immediately prior to the Effective Time under the
Company's Equity Incentive Plan, amended and restated February 18, 2004, and
the Company's 1995 Director Stock Option Plan, amended as of November 29, 2001
(collectively, the "Company Stock Option Plans"), held by an option holder
shall, effective as of the Effective Time, be cancelled, subject to the
Company's receipt of any necessary waiver, consent or release from the holder
thereof to effectuate such cancellation, in exchange for a single lump sum
cash payment to the holder thereof from the Company to be made on the Closing
Date in an amount equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Company
Common Stock subject to such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective
Time and (ii) the difference, if any, of the Merger Consideration less the per
share exercise price of such Company Option.

         (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Company
Stock Option Plans and Deferred Compensation Plans, immediately prior to the
Effective Time, each outstanding award, whether or not vested (other than the
Company Options which are addressed in Section 2.4(a) and Section 2.4(d))
under the Company Stock Option Plans and the Company Deferred Compensation
Plans that is denominated in Company Common Stock or Company Common Stock
units (including restricted stock, deferred stock and deferred stock units)
shall be cancelled for a payment to the holder thereof to be made on the
Closing Date in an amount equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to such award and (ii) the Merger Consideration.

         (c) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company will use its reasonable
best efforts to obtain all necessary waivers, consents or releases from
holders of Company Options in order to give effect to the transactions
contemplated by this Section 2.4.

         (d) If the Company does not obtain any necessary waiver, consent or
release from a Company Option holder, then, by virtue of the Merger, each
Company Option held by such holder shall be converted, effective as of the
Effective Time, into an option to purchase shares of common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of Parent ("Parent Common Stock") upon the same terms and
conditions as were in effect immediately prior to the Merger, except that the
number of shares subject to such option shall be multiplied by the Option
Exchange Ratio and the option price per share of such option shall be divided
by the Option Exchange Ratio.

         Section 2.5 Adjustments. If, at any time during the period between
the date hereof and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares
of Company Common Stock shall occur by reason of any reclassification,
recapitalization, stock split or combination, exchange or readjustment of
shares, or any similar transaction, or any stock dividend thereon with a
record date during such period, the Merger Consideration shall be
appropriately adjusted to provide the holders of shares of Company Common
Stock or Company Options the same economic effect as contemplated hereby prior
to such event.

         Section 2.6 Withholding Rights. Each of the Company, the Surviving
Corporation, Parent and Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from the consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this
Article II such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect
to the making of such payment under any provision of federal, state, local or
foreign Tax Law, including any withholding from any payment that is treated as
wages or compensation for the performance of services. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made.

         Section 2.7 Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been
lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming the Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
reasonably required by Parent or the Surviving Corporation, the posting by
that Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent or the Surviving
Corporation may direct or the delivery of an agreement of indemnification in
form reasonably satisfactory to Parent, as indemnity against any claim that
may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent
shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the
Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the shares of Company Common
Stock represented by such Certificate as contemplated by this Article II.

rises to the level of a Material Adverse Effect on the Company or is otherwise
material for purposes of this Agreement or the Company Disclosure Letter, the
Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent as follows:

         Section 4.1 Organization and Qualification; Charter Documents.

the Company and its Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed to do business,
and is in good standing (with respect to jurisdictions that recognize such

organization of each Subsidiary, as of the date hereof.

         (b) The Company has made available to Parent prior to the execution

enforcement may be subject to (i) applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or other similar Laws, now or hereafter in effect,
affecting creditors' rights generally and (ii) general principles of equity

and held, unanimously has resolved to, and has taken all action necessary to
render the Company Rights Agreement inapplicable to this Agreement, the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated hereby.

or other similar anti-takeover statute or regulation (including the provisions
of Sections 180.1130 to 180.1134 and Sections 180.1140 to 180.1144 of the
WBCL, inclusive) applies or purports to apply to the Company with respect to
this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby.

of any class or series of Company capital stock necessary to approve and adopt
this Agreement, approve the Merger and consummate the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby.

         Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, to the

Effect on the Company or (B) prevent or materially delay the consummation of
any of the transactions contemplated hereby.

         other clause of this Section 6.1(b);

         foregoing.

         (c) Nothing contained herein shall give to Parent or Merger
Subsidiary, directly or indirectly, rights to control or direct the Company's
operations prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions hereof,
complete control and supervision of its operations.

         Section 6.2 Preparation of Proxy Statement; Shareholder Meeting.

         (a) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date hereof,
the Company shall with the timely cooperation and assistance of Parent prepare
and file with the SEC the proxy statement relating to the matters to be
submitted to the Company shareholders at the Company Shareholder Meeting (such
proxy statement and any amendments or supplements thereto, the "Proxy
Statement"). The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to have the
Proxy Statement cleared by the SEC. The Company shall, as promptly as
practicable after receipt thereof, provide Parent copies of any written
comments, and advise Parent of any oral comments or communications regarding
the Proxy Statement received from the SEC. The Company and Parent shall
cooperate and provide the other with a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment on any amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement prior to filing
the same with the SEC, and such parties will promptly provide each other with
copies of such filings made with the SEC.

         (b) The Company will use its reasonable best efforts to cause the
Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Company's shareholders as promptly as
reasonably practicable after being cleared by the SEC.

         (c) If at any time prior to the Effective Time, any information
relating to the Company or Parent, or any of their respective affiliates,
officers or directors, should be discovered by the Company or Parent, as the
case may be, that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the
Proxy Statement so that such document would not include any misstatement of a
material fact or omit any material fact necessary to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not
misleading, the party that discovers such information shall promptly notify
the other party and, to the extent required by Law, the Company and Parent
shall cooperate to cause an appropriate amendment or supplement describing
such information promptly to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to the
shareholders of the Company.

         (d) Subject to Section 6.2(e), the Company shall, in accordance with
applicable Law and the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the Company,
(i) duly take all lawful action to call and give notice of, and use its
reasonable best efforts to convene and hold, a meeting of its shareholders as
soon as reasonably practicable after the date hereof (the "Company Shareholder
Meeting") for the purpose of obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval with
respect to the transactions contemplated hereby and (ii) use its reasonable
best efforts to solicit the approval of this Agreement. In furtherance of the
foregoing, except as set forth in Section 6.5(b), the Board of Directors of
the Company shall recommend approval of this Agreement by the shareholders of
the Company as set forth in Section 4.2(b) (the "Company Recommendation").

         (e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, in the
event that the Company effects a Company Change of Recommendation in
compliance with Section 6.5(b), the Company shall not be obligated, pursuant
to Section 6.2(d) or any other provision of this Agreement, to give notice of,
convene or hold the Company Shareholder Meeting, or solicit from its
shareholders proxies in favor of the adoption and approval of this Agreement
and the Merger.

         Section 6.3 Access to Information; Confidentiality.

         (a) Subject to compliance with applicable Law and Section 6.3(b), the
Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, give Parent and its
Representatives reasonable access to the offices, facilities, personnel,
properties, books and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries (including
giving permission to the Company's auditors to share its work papers) during
normal business hours, furnish to Parent and its Representatives such
financial and operating data and all other information as such Persons may
reasonably request and shall instruct its Representatives to cooperate with
Parent in its investigation of the business of the Company; provided, however,
that no investigation of the Company's business shall affect any
representation or warranty made by the Company hereunder. Each party will use
its reasonable best efforts to minimize any disruption to the businesses of
the Company and its Subsidiaries that may result from requests for access,
data and information hereunder.

         (b) All information provided or obtained in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby will be held by Parent in accordance with the
Confidentiality Agreement, dated August 6, 2004, between Parent and the
Company (the "Confidentiality Agreement"). In the event of a conflict or
inconsistency between the terms hereof and the Confidentiality Agreement, the
terms hereof will govern. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not
be required to provide any information that it reasonably believes it may not
provide to Parent by reason of contractual or legal restrictions, including
applicable Laws, or which it believes is competitively sensitive information.
In addition, the Company may designate any competitively sensitive information
provided to Parent under this Agreement as "outside counsel only" and such
information shall be given only to the outside counsel of Parent and may not
be shared with Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
Representatives (other than such outside counsel).

         Section 6.4 No Solicitation; Unsolicited Proposals.

         (a) After the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time or earlier
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1, the Company shall not,
and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, and shall not authorize or permit its
Representatives on its behalf to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit,
initiate, knowingly facilitate or encourage any inquiries or the making,
announcement or submission of any proposal that constitutes, or may reasonably
be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal (including the granting of any
waiver under Sections 180.1140 to 180.1144 of the WBCL), (ii) other than
informing Persons of the existence of the provisions contained in this Section
6.4, participate or engage in any substantive discussions or any negotiations
with, or disclose or provide any non-public information or data relating to
the Company or its Subsidiaries or afford access to the properties, books or
records or employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries to, any Third Party
making, or in furtherance of, an Acquisition Proposal or an indication of
interest that could lead to an Acquisition Proposal or (iii) enter into any
agreement in principle, letter of intent, memorandum of understanding or other
agreement (other than a confidentiality agreement) with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to,
and shall cause its Representatives on its behalf to, immediately cease and
terminate any existing discussions or negotiations with any Third Party
conducted heretofore by the Company, its Subsidiaries or the Company's
Representatives with respect to any Acquisition Proposal and shall request
that all such Third Parties who executed on or after June 1, 2004 a
confidentiality agreement in connection with the consideration of a possible
Acquisition Proposal to return to the Company, or destroy, all confidential
information heretofore furnished to such Third Party by or on behalf of the
Company in accordance with the terms of such confidentiality agreement,
including the rights of such Third Parties to retain confidential information
in accordance with the terms of such confidentiality agreements.

         (b) Notwithstanding the restrictions set forth in Section 6.4(a), if,
at any time prior to the Company Shareholder Approval, (i) the Company
receives an unsolicited bona fide proposal from a Third Party relating to an
Acquisition Proposal and (ii) the Board of Directors of the Company concludes
in good faith (after receiving advice of its financial advisors and outside
counsel) that (A) such Acquisition Proposal is, or would reasonably be
expected to lead to, a Superior Proposal and (B) the failure to do so would
reasonably be expected to result in a breach by the Board of Directors of the
Company of its fiduciary duties to the Company's shareholders under applicable
Law, the Company may, after giving three (3) Business Days prior written
notice to Parent of the identity of such Third Party and the material terms
and conditions of its Acquisition Proposal and the Company's intention to
furnish non-public information or data or access, and after the Company enters
into an executed confidentiality agreement (provided that in the event that
such confidentiality agreement contains any "standstill" provisions or
restrictions on disclosure of information less favorable to the Company than
such provisions or restrictions in the Confidentiality Agreement, then the
Company and Parent shall enter into an amendment to such Confidentiality
Agreement to provide for a substantially comparable "standstill" and
equivalent restrictions on disclosure), (x) provide non-public information or
data relating to the Company or its Subsidiaries (provided that the Company
furnishes such non-public information to Parent concurrently with providing
such non-public information or data to a Third Party (to the extent that such
non-public information has not been previously furnished to Parent)), or
afford access to the properties, book or records or employees of the Company
or its Subsidiaries to the Third Party making such Acquisition Proposal and
its Representatives and (y) participate in discussions or negotiations
regarding such proposal.

         (c) After the date hereof, the Company shall as soon as practicable
(and in any event within two (2) Business Days after becoming knowledgeable
thereof) notify Parent orally and in writing of any Acquisition Proposal or of
any request for information or inquiry that could lead to an Acquisition
Proposal, the material terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal,
request or inquiry, and the identity of the Person making such Acquisition
Proposal, request or inquiry. The Company shall inform Parent on a prompt
basis of the status and content of any discussions or negotiations regarding,
or relating to, any Acquisition Proposal and any material modification
thereto.

         (d) Nothing contained herein shall prohibit or impede the Company
from taking and disclosing to its shareholders a position as required by Rule
14d-9, Rule 14e-2 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the
Exchange Act or from making any other required disclosure to the Company's
shareholders if, in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors of the
Company, after receiving advice of outside counsel, failure so to disclose
would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the fulfillment of its
fiduciary duties to the Company's shareholders under applicable Law.

         (e) For purposes of this Agreement:

                  (i) "Acquisition Proposal" means any inquiry, offer,
         proposal or indication of interest, as the case may be, by any Third
         Party that relates to (1) a transaction or series of transactions
         (including any merger, consolidation, recapitalization, liquidation
         or other direct or indirect business combination) involving the
         Company or the issuance or acquisition of shares of capital stock or
         other equity securities of the Company representing 15% or more (by
         voting power) of the outstanding capital stock of the Company, (2)
         any tender or exchange offer that if consummated would result in any
         Person, together with all affiliates thereof, Beneficially Owning
         shares of capital stock or other equity securities of the Company
         representing 15% or more (by voting power) of the outstanding capital
         stock of the Company or (3) the acquisition, purchase or disposition
         of the business or consolidated assets of the Company (including
         capital stock or assets of any Subsidiary) outside the ordinary
         course of business; and

                  (ii) "Superior Proposal" means any bona fide Acquisition
         Proposal, on its most recently amended or modified terms which the
         Board of Directors of the Company determines in its good faith
         judgment (after receiving the advice of its outside counsel and
         financial advisors) after taking into account, among other things,
         the terms and conditions of the Acquisition Proposal and this
         Agreement (as may be proposed to be amended by Parent), including
         price, form of consideration, closing conditions, the ability to
         fully finance the transaction and such other aspects of the
         Acquisition Proposal as the Board of Directors of the Company in good
         faith deems relevant (A) would, if consummated, result in a
         transaction that is more favorable, from a financial point of view,
         to the Company's shareholders than the transactions contemplated
         hereby and (B) is reasonably likely to be completed.

         Section 6.5 Company Board of Directors' Recommendation.

         (a) Subject to Section 6.5(b), neither the Board of Directors of the
Company nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw, qualify, modify or amend
or propose to withdraw, qualify, modify or amend in any manner adverse to
Parent or Merger Subsidiary, the Company Recommendation (it being understood
that taking a neutral position or no position with respect to an Acquisition
Proposal shall be considered an adverse modification of the Company
Recommendation), (ii) approve any letter of intent, agreement in principle,
acquisition agreement or similar agreement (other than a confidentiality
agreement) relating to any Acquisition Proposal or (iii) approve or recommend
or propose to approve or recommend any Acquisition Proposal (each of the
foregoing being referred to as a "Company Change in Recommendation").

         (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 6.5(a), if, prior to
the Company Shareholder Meeting, (i) the Board of Directors of the Company
determines in good faith, after receiving advice of outside counsel, that it
would reasonably be expected to be required for the purpose of fulfilling its
fiduciary duties to the Company's shareholders under applicable Law, (ii) the
Company provides to Parent a notice in writing of the determination described
in clause (i), and (iii) at least four (4) Business Days have elapsed from
receipt by Parent of the notice referred to in clause (ii) above, and taking
into account any revised proposal made by Parent since receipt by it of the
notice referred to in clause (ii) above, the Board of Directors of the Company
maintains its determination described in clause (i) above, the Board of
Directors of the Company may (A) withdraw or modify its approval or
recommendation of the Merger and this Agreement and/or (B) upon termination of
this Agreement in accordance with Section 8.1(e), approve and enter into an
agreement relating to an Acquisition Proposal that constitutes a Superior
Proposal. In the event the Board of Directors of the Company shall undertake a
Company Change of Recommendation, Parent, upon its written request, shall be
released from all "standstill" provisions and restrictions on use of
confidential information (but not disclosure to third parties of information
except for disclosure to Parent's Representatives and financing sources,
credit rating agencies and Governmental Authorities which shall be permitted;
provided that any such Representatives and financing sources shall be bound by
an obligation of confidentiality and nondisclosure with respect to such
information for the benefit of the Company; and provided further that Parent
shall be responsible to the Company for any breach of such obligation of
confidentiality to the Company) under the Confidentiality Agreement to the
extent reasonably necessary to permit Parent to make an Acquisition Proposal.
In the event Parent is released from its "standstill" provisions and
restrictions on use of information, the Company shall be permitted to release
any other Person subject to similar provisions and restrictions to the same
extent Parent is so released.

         Section 6.6 Regulatory Filings; Reasonable Best Efforts.

         (a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein,
each of the parties shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to
be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and
cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate and make effective, as promptly as practicable, but in
no event later than the End Date, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby in accordance with the terms hereof, including (i) the
obtaining of all necessary approvals under any applicable Health Care Laws
required in connection with this Agreement, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) the obtaining of all necessary actions
or nonactions, waivers, consents, approvals and authorizations from
Governmental Authorities and the making of all necessary registrations and
filings (including filings with Governmental Authorities) and the taking of
all steps as may be necessary to obtain an approval or waiver from, or to
avoid an action or proceeding by, any Governmental Authority, (iii) the
obtaining of all necessary waivers, consents, approvals and authorizations
from Third Parties and (iv) the execution and delivery of any additional
instruments necessary to consummate the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby in accordance with the terms hereof and to fully carry out
the purposes of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Section 6.6(a) (except for the proviso in this sentence),
neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to (A) sell,
divest, hold separate, otherwise dispose of or license any of their or of the
Company's or any of its Subsidiaries' respective businesses, product lines or
assets, (B) conduct their or the Company's or any of its Subsidiaries'
respective businesses in a specified manner or (C) agree to take any of the
actions set forth in clause (A) or (B), or agree to take any other action or
agree to any limitation that, in the case of clause (A), (B) or (C), would
have a (I) Material Adverse Effect (reading out the "would reasonably be
likely to be" language of such defined term) on either the Company or Parent
(it being agreed that in the case of measuring the effect on Parent in this
clause (I), "Material Adverse Effect" shall be the level of, and shall be
measured as to, what would have a "Material Adverse Effect" on the Company and
not the level or measure of what would have a "Material Adverse Effect" on
Parent), or (II) material adverse effect on the benefits, taken as a whole,
Parent reasonably expected to derive from the transactions contemplated
hereby, including the Merger (such Material Adverse Effect on either the
Company or Parent or such material adverse effect on such benefits, a
"Regulatory Material Adverse Effect"); provided, however, that Parent
understands and agrees that it will, and will cause its Subsidiaries to, take
or commit to take any of the foregoing actions so long as, or to the extent,
any such action would not have such a Regulatory Material Adverse Effect, in
each case as a condition to obtaining any and all approvals from any
Governmental Authority for any reason in order to consummate and make
effective, as promptly as practicable, but in no event later than the End
Date, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, including
taking any and all actions (so long as, or to the extent, any such actions
would not have a Regulatory Material Adverse Effect) necessary in order to
ensure that (x) no requirement for non-action, a waiver, consent, approval or
authorization of the United States Federal Trade Commission ("FTC"), the
Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice ("Antitrust
Division"), any authority enforcing applicable Health Care Laws, any State
Attorney General or any other Governmental Authority, (y) no decree, judgment,
injunction, temporary restraining order or any other order in any suit or
proceeding and (z) no other matter relating to any antitrust or competition
Law or relating to any Health Care Law or other Laws, would preclude
consummation of the Merger by the End Date. The Company shall agree if, but
solely if, requested by Parent in writing to divest, hold separate or
otherwise take or commit to take any action with respect to the businesses,
services or assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in furtherance of
this Section 6.6(a); provided, however, that any such action may be
conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger and other transactions
contemplated hereby. In addition, upon the terms and subject to the conditions
herein provided and subject to the fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors
of the Company and its other obligations under applicable Law, none of the
parties hereto shall knowingly take or cause to be taken any action that would
reasonably be expected to materially delay or prevent the satisfaction by the
End Date of the conditions set forth in Sections 7.2(e) and 7.3(c). Each of
Parent and the Company undertakes and agrees to file as soon as practicable a
Notification and Report Form under the HSR Act with the FTC and the Antitrust
Division and to make as soon as practicable such filings and apply as soon as
practicable for such approvals and consents as are required under the Health
Care Laws.

         (b) Each of Parent and the Company shall (i) respond as promptly as
practicable to all inquiries and requests received from the FTC, the Antitrust
Division, any State Attorney General or other Governmental Authority in
connection with antitrust matters or Health Care Laws and (ii) not extend any
waiting period under the HSR Act or enter into any agreement with the FTC, the
Antitrust Division, any State Attorney General or other Governmental Authority
not to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, except with the prior
written consent of the other parties hereto.

         (c) In connection with and without limiting the foregoing, if any
anti-takeover or similar statute or regulation is or may become applicable to
the transactions contemplated hereby, each of the parties and its Board of
Directors shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to grant or
secure any required approvals or consents and take all such actions as are
reasonable and legally permissible so that the transactions contemplated
hereby may be consummated as promptly as practicable upon and subject to the
terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the
effects (including any resulting delays) of any such statute or regulation on
the transactions contemplated hereby.

         (d) In addition, each party shall, subject to applicable Law (i)
promptly notify the other party of any written communication to that party
from the FTC, the Antitrust Division, any State Attorney General or any other
Governmental Authority, including insurance, health or other regulatory
authorities, and, permit the other party to review in advance any proposed
communication to any of the foregoing, (ii) consult with the other party prior
to participating in any meeting or substantive discussion with any
Governmental Authority in respect of any filings, investigation or inquiry
concerning this Agreement or the Merger and provide the other party the
opportunity to attend and participate thereat and (iii) furnish the other
party with copies of all correspondence, filings, and written communications
(or a reasonably detailed summary of any oral communications) between them and
their respective representatives on the one hand, and any Governmental
Authority, including insurance, health or other regulatory authorities, or
members of their respective staffs on the other hand, with respect hereto and
the Merger.

         Section 6.7 Employee Benefits.

         (a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, from
and after the Effective Time, Parent shall honor or cause the Surviving
Corporation to honor, in accordance with their terms (without giving effect to
any amendments thereto after the Effective Time except if consented to by the
effected party), all benefits and obligations under the employment and
severance agreements listed in Section 6.7(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter
and the Company's Change of Control Severance Benefit Plan, as amended and
restated November 29, 2001 (such agreements and plan, collectively, the
"Severance Agreements"). Parent, Merger Subsidiary and the Company agree that
the consummation of the Merger shall constitute a "change in control" or
"change of control" or similar transaction for purposes of the Severance
Agreements.

         (b) During the one year period following the Effective Time, Parent
shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, provide to the employees
of the Company and its Subsidiaries who are employed at the Effective Time and
who remain employed with the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary of Parent
("Company Employees") for so long as the Company Employee remains so employed,
compensation and employee benefits that, with respect to each employee, are
substantially as favorable in the aggregate to the compensation and benefits
provided to such employee under the Company Employee Plans immediately prior
to the Effective Time or pursuant to employee benefit plans maintained from
time to time after the Effective Time by Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent
for similarly-situated employees of Parent or such Subsidiary. Nothing in this
Section 6.7(b) is intended to constitute any commitment or obligation to any
Company Employees or to create any ongoing obligation to employ any Company
Employees or provide any specific benefits to any Company Employees.

         (c) Parent shall provide each Company Employee who incurs a
termination of employment during the one-year period following the Effective
Time with severance payments and severance benefits that are no less favorable
than the severance payments and severance benefits to which such employee
would have been entitled with respect to such termination under the severance
policies of the Company as set forth in Section 6.7(c) of the Company
Disclosure Letter; provided that nothing in this Section 6.7(c) shall modify
or limit the provisions of the Severance Agreements.

         (d) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or
Parent's or the Surviving Corporation's Subsidiaries, as applicable, to, give
Company Employees full credit for such Company Employees' service with the
Company and its Subsidiaries for purposes of eligibility, vesting, and
determination of the level of benefits (including, for purposes of vacation
and severance), but not for purposes of benefit accruals, under any benefit
plans made generally available to employees or officers or any class or level
of employees or officers maintained by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
any of their respective Subsidiaries in which a Company Employee participates
to the same extent recognized by the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time; provided, however, that such service shall not be recognized
to the extent that such recognition would result in a duplication of benefits
with respect to the same period of service.

         (e) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or
Parent's or the Surviving Corporation's Subsidiaries, as applicable, to, (i)
waive any preexisting condition limitations otherwise applicable to Company
Employees and their eligible dependents under any plan of Parent or any
Subsidiary of Parent that provides health benefits in which Company Employees
may be eligible to participate following the Closing to the extent such
conditions are covered under the analogous Company Employee Plan in which such
Company Employees participated immediately prior to the Effective Time, other
than any limitations that were in effect with respect to such employees as of
the Effective Time under the analogous Company Employee Plan, (ii) honor any
deductible, co-payment and out-of-pocket maximums incurred by the Company
Employees and their eligible dependents under the health plans in which they
participated immediately prior to the Effective Time during the portion of the
calendar year prior to the Effective Time in satisfying any deductibles,
co-payments or out-of-pocket maximums under health plans of Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries in which they
are eligible to participate after the Effective Time in the same plan year in
which such deductibles, co-payments or out-of-pocket maximums were incurred
and (iii) waive any waiting period limitation or evidence of insurability
requirement that would otherwise be applicable to a Company Employee and his
or her eligible dependents on or after the Effective Time, in each case to the
extent such Company Employee or eligible dependent had satisfied any similar
limitation or requirement under an analogous Company Employee Plan prior to
the Effective Time.

         (f) (i) In the event that the Closing occurs prior to December 31,
2004, the Company shall pay to each Company Employee who is a participant in
respect of the 2004 calendar year (each, a "Bonus Eligible Employee") under
the Company's 2004 Compensation Management Program, the Company's Executive
Annual Incentive Plan, and/or the Company's Executive Management 2004 Interim
Performance Award Plan (such program and plans, collectively, the "Company
Bonus Plans") immediately prior to the Effective Time a pro rata portion of
such Bonus Eligible Employee's full 2004 bonus that he would have been paid in
respect of 2004 under the Company Bonus Plans, calculated by multiplying each
Bonus Eligible Employee's Bonus Amount (as defined below) by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the number of days that have elapsed in 2004 through and
including the Closing Date and the denominator of which is 365. "Bonus Amount"
shall be calculated by measuring the bonus that would have been paid under the
applicable Company Bonus Plan had the actual performance for calendar year
2004 been equal to the actual performance for the period from January 1, 2004
through the last day of the month immediately prior to the month in which the
Closing occurs, and extrapolating such actual performance through the end of
the calendar year 2004. For example, assuming that the Effective Time occurs
in November of 2004, each Bonus Eligible Employee's Bonus Amount would be
calculated by (A) measuring actual performance for the period from January 1,
2004 through October 31, 2004 (assume such actual performance amount equals
100, the "Actual Performance Amount"), (B) dividing the Actual Performance
Amount by the number of fully completed months in the year prior to the
Effective Time (10 in this example), with such quotient being referred to as
the "Monthly Average Actual Performance Amount," and (C) multiplying the
Monthly Average Actual Performance Amount by the total number of months in the
year (12); which in this example would result in an extrapolated performance
of 120 for calendar year 2004. The Bonus Amount would then equal the amount
that the Bonus Eligible Employee would have received for 2004 under the
applicable Company Bonus Plan had the Company's actual performance for 2004
equaled 120. The foregoing example is included for the sole purpose of setting
forth the methodology for calculating the Bonus Amount in the event that the
Closing occurs prior to December 31, 2004.

                  (ii) In the event that the Closing occurs on or after
         December 31, 2004, the Company shall pay each Bonus Eligible Employee
         the full bonus that he would have been paid in respect of 2004 under
         the applicable Company Bonus Plan based on actual performance through
         December 31, 2004 on the date such bonus is ordinarily paid by the
         Company under such Company Bonus Plan or, if earlier, immediately
         prior to the Effective Time.

                  (iii) In the event that the Closing occurs prior to January
         1, 2005, a Bonus Eligible Employee who is in the employ of Parent or
         any of its Subsidiaries on December 31, 2004 shall be paid a
         supplemental bonus in an amount equal to the Bonus Amount multiplied
         by a fraction where the numerator is 365 less the number of days
         elapsed in 2004 prior to the Closing Date and the denominator is 365.

                  (iv) For purposes of calculating severance benefits under
         the Severance Agreements, all references to the annual bonus earned
         or received in the year prior to termination shall be calculated
         using the Bonus Amount.

         Section 6.8 Public Announcements. The initial press release with
respect to the Merger shall be a joint press release, to be agreed upon by
Parent and the Company. Thereafter, Parent and Merger Subsidiary, on the one
hand, and the Company, on the other hand, shall, to the extent feasible,
consult with each other before issuing, and provide each other reasonable
opportunity to review and comment upon, any press release or other public
statements with respect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby and shall not issue any such press release or make any such public
statement prior to such consultation, except as may be required by applicable
Law, court process or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with
any national securities exchange or automated inter-dealer quotation system.

         Section 6.9 Further Assurances. At and after the Effective Time, the
officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be authorized to
execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company or Merger
Subsidiary, as the case may be, any deeds, bills of sale, assignments,
assurances or other documents, or instruments, and to take any other actions
and do any other things, in the name and on behalf of the Company or Merger
Subsidiary, reasonably necessary to vest, perfect or confirm of record or
otherwise in the Surviving Corporation any and all right, title and interest
in, to and under any of the rights, properties or assets of the Company
acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in
connection with, the Merger and to otherwise accomplish the purpose and intent
of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

         Section 6.10 Notification of Certain Matters.

         (a) The Company shall notify Parent, and Parent or Merger Subsidiary
shall notify the Company, of (a) any change or effect that has had, or would
reasonably be likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company, Parent or Merger Subsidiary, as applicable, (b)
any representation or warranty made by it contained herein becoming untrue or
inaccurate in any material respect and (c) the failure by it to comply with or
satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied
by it under this Agreement, in each case within three (3) Business Days of an
executive officer of such Person becoming aware of the occurrence of such
development. The parties' obligations under this Section 6.10 and the
disclosure of any matter in accordance with the provisions of this Section
6.10 shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to
the party receiving such disclosure and shall not be deemed to cure any breach
or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty made herein.

         (b) The Company shall give prompt written notice to Parent, and
Parent or Merger Subsidiary shall give prompt notice to the Company, of any
notice or other communication received after the date hereof from any Person
alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby.

         Section 6.11 Indemnification; D&O Insurance.

         (a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to indemnify, defend and hold harmless each person who
is now, or has been at any time prior to the date hereof or who becomes prior
to the Effective Time, a director or officer of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (the "Indemnified Parties") from and against all losses, claims,
damages, costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees and expenses),
liabilities, judgments and, subject to the proviso of this sentence,
settlement amounts that are paid or incurred in connection with any pending,
threatened or completed claim, action, suit, formal or informal proceeding,
formal or informal investigation or formal or informal inquiry (whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative and whether asserted or claimed
prior to, at or after the Effective Time) that is (i) based on, or arises out
of, the fact that such Indemnified Party is or was a director or officer of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (ii) based on, or arising out of, or
pertaining hereto or the transactions contemplated hereby, in each case under
clause (i) or clause (ii) above, to the fullest extent a corporation is
permitted under applicable Law to indemnify its own directors or officers, as
the case may be; provided, however, that after the Effective Time the
Surviving Corporation may elect to provide officers of the Company and its
Subsidiaries with the same indemnification as Parent provides to officers of
its Subsidiaries with respect to any fact, matter, event or circumstance
arising after the Effective Time relating to the matters covered by clause (i)
above, such same indemnification to be provided with respect to such fact,
matter, event or circumstance in lieu of the indemnification set forth in this
Section 6.11; provided, further, that notwithstanding the foregoing proviso,
all Indemnified Parties shall continue to be indemnified following the
Effective Time under the terms set forth in this Section 6.11 with respect to
the matters covered by clause (ii) above. Without limiting the foregoing, in
the event that any such claim, action, suit, proceeding, investigation or
inquiry is brought against any Indemnified Party (whether prior to or after
the Effective Time), (A) the Surviving Corporation shall have the right to
assume the defense thereof with legal counsel of Parent's choosing and neither
Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to such Indemnified Party
for any legal expenses of other counsel or any expenses subsequently incurred
by such Indemnified Party in connection with the defense thereof; provided,
however, that such Indemnified Party may employ counsel of its own choosing,
and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay such Indemnified Party
for reasonable legal expenses of such counsel, if under applicable standards
of professional conduct the counsel selected by Parent may be reasonably
determined by counsel consulted by such Indemnified Party, to have a conflict
representing the Surviving Corporation and the Indemnified Party in the
conduct of the defense of an action, and (B) the Surviving Corporation shall
not be liable for any settlement of any claim effected without its written
consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned). Any Indemnified Party wishing to obtain indemnification under
this Section 6.11(a), upon learning of any claim, action, suit, proceeding,
investigation or inquiry, shall promptly notify Parent thereof; provided,
however, the failure of any Indemnified Party to give such notice shall not
waive any rights of the Indemnified Party under this Section 6.11 except to
the extent that the rights of the Surviving Corporation or Parent are actually
materially prejudiced thereby). In the event the Surviving Corporation does
not assume the defense of an action in accordance with this Section 6.11(a),
(w) the Indemnified Parties as a group seeking indemnification with respect to
the same or a substantially related matter may retain only one law firm with
respect to such matter except to the extent that under applicable standards of
professional conduct, such counsel would have a conflict representing such
Indemnified Party and any other Indemnified Party or Indemnified Parties, (x)
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay all expenses of the
disposition of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding, investigation or
inquiry to each Indemnified Party to the full extent permitted by applicable
Law promptly after statements therefor are received and otherwise advance to
such Indemnified Party upon request reimbursement of documented expenses
reasonably incurred, in either case to the extent not prohibited by the WBCL;
provided, however, that the person to whom expenses are advanced provides an
undertaking if required by applicable Law to repay such advance if it is
ultimately determined that such person is not entitled to indemnification, (y)
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay all reasonable fees and
expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified Parties and all costs and
expenses of the Indemnified Parties in connection with seeking and obtaining
indemnification from the Surviving Corporation, from time to time, in each
case within three (3) Business Days of the receipt by Parent of a statement
from such counsel for the Indemnified Parties and (z) Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to use reasonable best efforts to assist in the defense
of any such matter. In the event of any dispute as to whether an Indemnified
Party's conduct complies with the standards set forth under applicable Law and
as applicable, the Company Organizational Documents and the Company Subsidiary
Organizational Documents, a determination shall be made by independent counsel
reasonably acceptable to the Surviving Corporation and the Indemnified Party.
Without limiting the foregoing, to the extent that any Indemnified Party is,
by reason of the fact that such Indemnified Party is or was a director or
officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, a witness in any claim,
action, suit, proceeding, investigation or inquiry to which such Indemnified
Party is not a party, such Indemnified Party shall be indemnified and held
harmless against all costs and expenses in connection therewith.

         (b) The Surviving Corporation shall not enter into any settlement of
any claim in which the Surviving Corporation is jointly liable with an
Indemnified Party (or would be if joined in such claim) unless such settlement
provides for a full and final release of all claims asserted against such
Indemnified Party.

         (c) Except to the extent required by Applicable Law, neither Parent
nor the Surviving Corporation shall take any action so as to amend, modify,
limit or repeal the provisions for indemnification of Indemnified Parties
contained in the certificates or articles of incorporation or bylaws (or other
comparable organizational documents) of the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries (which as of the Effective Time shall be no less favorable to
such individuals than those maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries on
the date hereof) in such a manner as would adversely affect the rights of any
Indemnified Party to be indemnified by such corporations in respect of their
serving in such capacities prior to the Effective Time. The Surviving
Corporation shall honor all of its indemnification obligations existing as of
the Effective Time.

         (d) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent
shall cause to be maintained in effect the current policies of directors' and
officers' liability insurance maintained by the Company (provided that Parent
may substitute therefor "tail" or other policies with reputable and
financially sound carriers of at least the same coverage and amounts
containing terms and conditions that are no less advantageous in the
aggregate) with respect to claims arising from or related to facts or events
that occurred at or before the Effective Time; provided, however, that Parent
shall not be obligated to make annual premium payments for such insurance to
the extent such premiums exceed 300% of the annual premiums paid as of the
date hereof by the Company for such insurance (such 300% amount, the "Maximum
Premium"). If such insurance coverage can only be obtained at an annual
premium in excess of the Maximum Premium, Parent shall obtain and maintain one
or more policies with the greatest coverage available for an annual premium
equal to the Maximum Premium.

         (e) The provisions of this Section are intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and each party
entitled to insurance coverage under Section 6.11(d), respectively, and his or
her heirs and legal representatives, and shall be in addition to, and shall
not impair, any other rights an Indemnified Party may have under the Company
Organizational Documents or the Company Subsidiary Organizational Documents,
as applicable, or the comparable organization documents of the Surviving
Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries, under applicable Law or otherwise.
Parent shall ensure that the Surviving Corporation complies with all of its
obligations under this Section 6.11.

         (f) In the event that Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of
their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into
any other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity
of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each
such case, Parent shall cause proper provisions to be made so that the
successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may
be, assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.11. The obligations of
Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this Section 6.11 shall not be
terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any indemnitee
to whom this Section 6.11 applies without the express written consent of such
affected indemnitee (it being expressly agreed that the indemnitees to whom
this Section 6.11 applies shall be Third Party beneficiaries of this Section
6.11).

         Section 6.12 Undertakings of Parent. Parent shall perform, or cause
to be performed, when due, all obligations of Merger Subsidiary under this
Agreement.

         Section 6.13 FIRPTA Matters. At the Closing, (a) the Company shall
deliver to Parent a statement (in such form as may be reasonably requested by
counsel to Parent) conforming to the requirements of Section 1.897 -
2(h)(1)(i) of the United States Treasury Regulations, and (b) the Company
shall deliver to the IRS the notification required under Section 1.897 -
2(h)(2) of the United States Treasury Regulations.

                                 ARTICLE VII

                           CONDITIONS TO THE MERGER

         Section 7.1 Conditions to Each Party's Obligation to Effect the
Merger. The respective obligation of the Company, Parent and Merger Subsidiary
to effect the Merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver on or prior to
the Closing Date of the following conditions:

         (a) Company Shareholder Approval. The Company Shareholder Approval
shall have been obtained.

         (b) Antitrust. The waiting period (and any extension thereof)
applicable to the Merger under the HSR Act or any other applicable
competition, merger control, antitrust or similar Law shall have been
terminated or shall have expired.

         (c) No Injunctions or Restraints. No temporary restraining order,
preliminary or permanent injunction or other judgment, order or decree issued
by any court of competent jurisdiction or other statute, Law, rule, legal
restraint or prohibition (collectively, "Restraints") shall be in effect
preventing the consummation of the Merger; provided, however, that prior to
asserting this condition, each of the parties shall have used its reasonable
best efforts to prevent the entry of any such injunction or other order and to
appeal as promptly as possible any such injunction or other order that may be
entered.

         Section 7.2 Conditions to Obligations of Parent and Merger
Subsidiary. The obligations of Parent and Merger Subsidiary to effect the
Merger are further subject to the satisfaction or waiver on or prior to the
Closing Date of the following conditions:

         (a) Representations and Warranties. The representations and
warranties of the Company contained herein (except solely with respect to the
second sentence of Section 4.6 which is addressed below) shall be true and
correct as of the date hereof and as of the Closing Date as though made on the
Closing Date (without regard to materiality or Material Adverse Effect
qualifiers contained therein), except (i) to the extent such representations
and warranties expressly speak as of an earlier date, in which case as of such
earlier date and (ii) where the failure of the representations and warranties
to be true and correct individually or in the aggregate, has not had a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company. The representation and warranty of the
Company contained in the second sentence of Section 4.6 shall be true and
correct as of the date hereof and as of the Closing Date as though made on the
Closing Date. Parent shall have received a certificate signed on behalf of the
Company by the chief executive officer or chief financial officer of the

Effective Time. Parent shall have received a certificate signed on behalf of
the Company by the chief executive officer or chief financial officer of the
Company on its behalf to such effect.

         (c) No Litigation. There shall not be pending any suit, action or
proceeding by any Governmental Authority (i) challenging the acquisition by
Parent or Merger Subsidiary of any shares of Company Common Stock, seeking to
restrain or prohibit the consummation of the Merger or the transactions
contemplated hereby, seeking to place material limitations on the ownership of
shares of Company Common Stock (or shares of capital stock of the Surviving
Corporation) by Parent or Merger Subsidiary, (ii) seeking to prohibit or limit
the ownership or operation by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or by
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries of any portion of any business or of any
assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries or Parent and its Subsidiaries,
(iii) seeking to obtain from the Company, Parent or Merger Subsidiary any
damages, which in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) above would have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on either the
Company or Parent.

         (d) Restraint. No Restraint that would result, directly or
indirectly, in any of the effects referred to in Section 7.2(c) shall be in
effect.

         (e) Regulatory Matters. The authorizations, consents, orders, permits
or approvals of, or declarations or filings with, and all expirations of
waiting periods imposed by, any Governmental Authority (other than the
expiration of the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act that is
addressed in Section 7.1(b)) that are set forth in Section 4.3(b) of the
Company Disclosure Letter and Section 5.3(b) of the Parent Disclosure Letter
(all of the foregoing, "Governmental Consents") and which are necessary for
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby shall have been
filed, have occurred or have been obtained (all such Governmental Consents
being referred to as the "Company Requisite Regulatory Approvals") and all
such Company Requisite Regulatory Approvals shall be in full force and effect
without any conditions, restrictions or requirements, which (if implemented),
would have, individually or in the aggregate, a Regulatory Material Adverse
Effect.

         Section 7.3 Conditions to Obligation of the Company. The obligation
of the Company to effect the Merger is further subject to the satisfaction or
waiver on or prior to the Closing Date of the following conditions:

         (a) Representations and Warranties. The representations and
warranties of each of Parent and Merger Subsidiary contained herein shall be
true and correct as of the date hereof and as of the Closing Date as though
made on the Closing Date (without regard to materiality or Material Adverse
Effect qualifiers contained therein), except (i) to the extent such
representations and warranties expressly speak as of an earlier date, in which
case as of such earlier date and (ii) where the failure of the representations
and warranties to be true and correct individually or in the aggregate, has
not had a Material Adverse Effect on the Company; provided, however, that the
truth and correctness of Section 5.11 shall not be subject to any materiality
or Material Adverse Effect qualifier. The Company shall have received a
certificate signed on behalf of each of Parent and Merger Subsidiary by the
chief executive officer or chief financial officer of Parent and Merger
Subsidiary on their behalf to such effect.

         (b) Performance of Obligations of Parent and Merger Subsidiary.
Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall have each performed in all material
respects all covenants, agreements and obligations required to be performed by
it under this Agreement at or prior to the Effective Time. The Company shall
have received a certificate signed on behalf of each of Parent and Merger
Subsidiary by the chief executive officer or chief financial officer of Parent
and Merger Subsidiary on their behalf to such effect.

         (c) Regulatory Matters. The Governmental Consents which are necessary
for the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby shall have been
filed, have occurred or have been obtained (all such Governmental Consents
being referred to as the "Parent Requisite Regulatory Approvals") and all such
Parent Requisite Regulatory Approvals shall be in full force and effect.

         Section 7.4 Frustration of Closing Conditions. None of the Company,
Parent or Merger Subsidiary may rely, either as a basis for not consummating
the Merger or terminating this Agreement and abandoning the Merger, on the
failure of any condition set forth in Sections 7.1, 7.2 or 7.3, as the case
may be, to be satisfied if such failure was caused by such party's breach of
any provision of this Agreement or failure to use its reasonable best efforts
to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, as
required by and subject to Section 6.6.

                                 ARTICLE VIII

                           TERMINATION AND EXPENSES

         Section 8.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated and the
Merger may be abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time (except as
provided below, notwithstanding any approval of this Agreement by the
shareholders of the Company):

         (a) by mutual written consent of the Company and Parent;

         (b) by either the Company or Parent,

                  (i) if the Merger has not been consummated as of March 31,
         2005 (the "End Date"); provided, however, that if (x) the Merger has
         not been consummated by such date by reason of non-satisfaction of
         any of the conditions set forth in Section 7.1(b), 7.2(e) or 7.3(c),
         or the failure to obtain clearance of the Proxy Statement from the
         SEC by February 28, 2005, then such date shall automatically be
         extended to June 30, 2005 (which shall then be the "End Date");
         provided, further, that at the End Date, the right to terminate this
         Agreement under this Section 8.1(b)(i) shall not be available to any
         party whose action or failure to fulfill in any material respect any
         obligation under this Agreement has caused or resulted in the failure
         of the Merger to be consummated on or before the End Date; or

                  (ii) if the Company Shareholder Approval shall not have been
         obtained by reason of the failure to obtain the required vote at the
         Company Shareholder Meeting or any adjournment thereof;

         (c) by either the Company or Parent, if there shall be any Law that
makes consummation of the Merger illegal or otherwise prohibited or if any
Restraint enjoining Parent, Merger Subsidiary or the Company from consummating
the Merger is entered and such Restraint shall become final and nonappealable;
provided, however, that the right to terminate this Agreement under this
Section 8.1(c) is not available to a party that has not fulfilled its
obligations under Section 6.6;

         (d) by Parent, if the Board of Directors of the Company or any
committee thereof, shall have made a Company Change in Recommendation, whether
or not permitted by the terms hereof;

         (e) by the Company if, prior to receipt of the Company Shareholder
Approval, the Company receives a Superior Proposal, resolves to accept such
Superior Proposal, and shall have given Parent four (4) Business Days' prior
written notice of its intention to terminate pursuant to that provision; or

         (f) by either Parent or the Company, if there shall have been a
breach by the other of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or
obligations contained herein, which breach would result in the failure to
satisfy one or more of the conditions set forth in Section 7.2(a) (in the case
of a breach by the Company), or Section 7.3(a) (in the case of a breach by
Parent), and in any such case such breach shall be incapable of being cured
or, if capable of being cured, shall not have been cured within thirty (30)
calendar days after written notice thereof shall have been received by the
party alleged to be in breach.

The party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to clause (b), (c),
(d), (e) or (f) of this Section 8.1 shall give written notice of such
termination to the other party in accordance with Section 9.4, specifying the
provision hereof pursuant to which such termination is effected.

         Section 8.2 Effect of Termination. If this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to Section 8.1, this Agreement shall become void and of no effect
with no liability or further obligation on the part of any party hereto,
except (i) as set forth in Section 8.3, (ii) that this Section 8.2, Section
6.3(b), Article IX and the agreements contained in the Confidentiality
Agreement (to the extent set forth therein), shall survive the termination
hereof and (iii) that no such termination shall relieve any party of any
liability or damages resulting from any willful breach by that party of its
covenants under this Agreement to be performed on or prior to the Closing Date
or, in the case of Parent, for a breach of Section 5.11.

         Section 8.3 Fees and Expenses.

         (a) (i) Other than as specifically provided in this Section 8.3 or as
required by Health Care Laws, the Company shall pay all filing, printing,
mailing and related fees and expenses of Parent (but excluding legal,
accounting, consulting, advisory and other professional fees and expenses),
whether or not the Merger is consummated, related to: (A) Forms A, Forms E and
similar insurance regulatory filings; (B) HSR Act filings; and (C) the Proxy
Statement; provided, however, that in no event shall the Company be required
to pay in excess of $650,000 in the aggregate in respect of all such fees and
expenses (it being understood that in the event that such fees and expenses
exceed $650,000, such excess shall be paid by the party incurring such fees
and expenses), and (ii) if this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the
Company pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(ii) and prior to the time of termination of
this Agreement an Acquisition Proposal shall have been disclosed, announced,
commenced, submitted or made, then (without limiting the obligation of the
Company to pay any Termination Fee, the Company shall make a nonrefundable
cash payment to Parent at the time specified in Section 8.1(b)(ii) for the
reasonably documented direct fees and expenses it has incurred in negotiating
and performing this Agreement in an aggregate amount not to exceed $4,000,000
(any such amount actually paid to Parent shall be referred to as the "Paid
Expenses").

         (b) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.1(d) or
Section 8.1(e), Parent would suffer direct and substantial damages, which
damages cannot be determined with reasonable certainty and, in order to
compensate Parent for such damages the Company shall pay to Parent the amount
of $17,475,000 by wire transfer in immediately available funds to an account
designated in writing by Parent as liquidated damages (the "Termination Fee");
provided, however, that the amount of the Termination Fee that may become
payable to Parent shall be reduced by the amount of any Paid Expenses. The
Termination Fee payable pursuant to this Section 8.3(b) shall be due and
payable by the Company no later than two (2) Business Days after such
termination.

         (c) If (i) after the date hereof, any Person publicly announces an
Acquisition Proposal that has not been withdrawn, (ii) this Agreement is
terminated by either the Company or Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(ii) and
at such time of termination Parent is not in breach of any of its
representations, warranties and covenants contained herein and (iii) within
nine (9) months after the date of this Agreement the Company enters into a
definitive agreement to consummate, or consummates, the transactions
contemplated by such Acquisition Proposal, then, if such Acquisition Proposal
is consummated, the Company shall pay to Parent the Termination Fee within two
(2) Business Days after the date of consummation of such Acquisition Proposal.
Solely for the purposes of this Section 8.3(c), the term "Acquisition
Proposal" shall have the meaning assigned to such term in Section 6.4(e)(i),
except that all references to "15%" shall be changed to "50%."

         (d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, absent a willful
breach of the provisions hereof by the Company, (i) Section 8.3(b) shall be
the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent and Merger Subsidiary for a
termination of this Agreement under Section 8.1(d) or Section 8.1(e), and (ii)
Section 8.3(c) shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent and Merger
Subsidiary for a termination of this Agreement under Section 8.1(b)(ii).

                                  ARTICLE IX

                                 MISCELLANEOUS

         Section 9.1 Non-Survival of Representations and Warranties and
Agreements. The representations, warranties and agreements herein and in any
certificate delivered in connection herewith, including any rights arising out
of any breach of such representations, warranties and agreements, shall
terminate at the Effective Time, except for those agreements contained herein
(including Section 6.11) that by their terms apply or are to be performed in
whole or in part after the Effective Time and the provisions in this Article
IX.

         Section 9.2 Representations and Warranties. Each of Parent and Merger
Subsidiary acknowledges and agrees that neither the Company nor any of its
Representatives has made any representation or warranty to Parent or Merger
Subsidiary, except as specifically set forth in Article IV of this Agreement.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, no such Person has made any
representation or warranty to Parent or Merger Subsidiary with respect to: (a)
any information or materials made available by or on behalf of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, JPMorgan or IntraLinks, Inc., or any Representative
of any of them, in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; or (b) any financial or operational projection or forecast relating
to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

         Section 9.3 Amendments; No Waivers.

         (a) Any provision hereof (including the Company Disclosure Letter,
the Parent Disclosure Letter) may be amended or waived prior to the Effective
Time at any time prior to or after the receipt of the Company Shareholder
Approval, if, and only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and signed,
in the case of an amendment, by the Company, Parent and Merger Subsidiary, or
in the case of a waiver, by the party against whom the waiver is to be
effective; provided, however, that after the receipt of Company Shareholder
Approval, if any such amendment or waiver shall by Law or in accordance with
the rules and regulations of the applicable national securities exchange
require further approval of the shareholders of the Company, the effectiveness
of such amendment or waiver shall be subject to the approval of the
shareholders of the Company.

         (b) No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power
or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single
or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or
the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. Subject to Section
8.3(d), the rights and remedies herein provided shall be cumulative and not
exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by Law.

         Section 9.4 Notices. All notices, requests and other communications

or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement
without the consent of the other parties hereto, except that Merger Subsidiary

THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY
AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING UNDER THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

         Section 9.9 Counterparts; Effectiveness. This Agreement may be
executed in one or more counterparts, each of which together shall be deemed
an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same
instrument.

         Section 9.10 Entire Agreement. This Agreement (including the Company
Disclosure Letter, the Parent Disclosure Letter) and the Confidentiality
Agreement constitute the entire agreement among the parties with respect to
the subject matter of this Agreement and supersede and cancel all prior
agreements, negotiations, correspondence, undertakings, understandings and
communications of the parties, oral and written, with respect to the subject
matter hereof and thereof.

         Section 9.11 Third Party Beneficiaries. Except as expressly provided
herein, this Agreement is for the sole benefit of the parties and their
permitted successors and assigns and nothing herein expressed or implied will
give or be construed to give any Person, other than the parties and such
permitted successors and assigns, any legal or equitable rights hereunder;
provided, however, that the parties hereto specifically acknowledge and agree
that the provisions of Section 6.11 hereof are intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, all current or former directors or officers
of the Company and its Subsidiaries (in all of their capacities) affected
thereby. All references herein to the enforceability of agreements with Third
Parties, the existence or non-existence of Third-Party rights, the absence of
breaches or defaults by Third Parties, or similar matters or statements, are
intended only to allocate rights and risks among the parties hereto and were
not intended to be admissions against interests, give rise to any inference or
proof of accuracy, be admissible against any party hereto by any Person who is
not a party hereto, or give rise to any claim or benefit to any Person who is
not a party hereto.

         Section 9.12 Severability. If any term, provision, covenant or
restriction hereof is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other
authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms,
provisions, covenants and restrictions hereof shall remain in full force and
effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated so long as the
economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not
affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such a
determination, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this
Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as
possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated
hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent
possible.

         Section 9.13 Specific Performance. The parties hereby acknowledge and
agree that the failure of any party to perform its agreements and covenants
hereunder, including its failure to take all actions as are necessary on its
part to the consummation of the Merger, will cause irreparable injury to the
other parties, for which damages, even if available, will not be an adequate
remedy. Accordingly, each party hereby consents to the issuance of injunctive
relief by any court of competent jurisdiction to compel performance of such
party's obligations and to the granting by any court of the remedy of specific
performance of its obligations hereunder, without bond or other security being
required, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at law or in equity.

         Section 9.14 Construction.

         (a) The article and section headings contained herein are solely for
the purpose of reference, are not part of the agreement of the parties and

interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly
by the parties and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or
disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provisions of this
Agreement.

         (c) Any reference to any federal, state, local or non-United States
