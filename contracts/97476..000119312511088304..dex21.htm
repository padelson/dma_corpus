EFFECTS OF THE MERGER

Section 3.01 _Conversion of Securities_. At and as of the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub,
the Company or the Company Stockholders (other than any requisite approval of
the principal terms of the Merger by the Company Stockholders in accordance
with the DGCL):

(a) Each Company Share held in treasury and each Company Share that is
owned, directly or indirectly, by Parent or Merger Sub immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist, without any
conversion thereof and no payment or distribution shall be made with respect
thereto.

 

(b) Each Company Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than Dissenting Shares and Company Shares to be
cancelled in accordance with Section 3.01(a)), shall be converted and
exchanged automatically into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to
the Merger Consideration, payable to the holder thereof, without interest, in
accordance with Section 3.03. At the Effective Time, all such Company Shares
that have been converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall
cease to exist, and each holder of any

 



\- 14 -   such Company Share immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to
have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, without interest. The Company Shares that are to be so
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration are referred to

(c) Each outstanding share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of

shares of common stock, par value $1.00 per share, of Parent (" _Parent
Common Shares_ "). The number of Parent Common Shares subject to each
Converted Option shall be equal to the product of (A) the number of Company
Shares subject to such Company Stock Option multiplied by (B) the Exchange
Ratio (as defined below), rounded down to the nearest whole share. The
exercise price per share of each Converted Option shall equal the quotient of

shall be rounded up to the nearest whole cent. Each Converted Option shall
otherwise have substantially the same terms and conditions
(including continuing vesting terms, if any) as the corresponding Company
Stock Option. The Company Stock Options so converted will not vest or become
exercisable as a consequence of the Merger except to the extent expressly so

discretionary action to cause such Company Stock Options to vest and become
exercisable. For purposes of this Section 3.02, " _Exchange Ratio_ " shall

Plan, Executive Officer Stock Option Plan , 2005 Executive Officer Equity
Plan, Director Stock Option Plan or 2007 Employees Equity Plan that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Change-of-Control associated with the
Merger (each a " _Terminated Option_ "), whether or not then vested and
exercisable, shall vest and become fully exercisable and shall be cancelled
upon such Change-of-Control, and in exchange therefor, Parent or the Company
shall pay to each former holder of any such Terminated Option, as soon as
practicable following the Effective Time, an amount in cash (without interest,
and less any amount withheld pursuant to Section 3.05) equal to the product
of (A) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price
per

 



\- 15 -   Company Share payable under such Terminated Option multiplied by (B) the
number of Company Shares subject to such Terminated Option.

 

(b) _Company RSUs_.

(i) Each Company RSU granted under the Companys 2009 Incentive Award Plan
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will cease to represent a
right to acquire Company Shares and will be converted as of the Effective
Time into restricted stock units (each a " _Converted RSU_ ") covering a
number of validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable Parent Common Shares
equal to the product of (A) the number of Company Shares subject to such
Company RSU multiplied by (B) the Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest
whole share. Each Converted RSU shall otherwise have substantially the same
terms and conditions (including continuing vesting terms, if any) as the
corresponding Company RSU. The Company RSUs so converted will not vest as a
consequence of the Merger except to the extent expressly so provided in the
applicable Company Equity Plan or restricted stock unit agreement and neither
the Company Board nor any committee thereof will take any discretionary
action to cause such Company RSUs to vest.

(ii) Each Company RSU granted under the Companys 2007 Employees Equity Plan
or Restricted Stock Plan that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (or, in the case of the 2007 Employees Equity Plan, the
occurrence of the Change-of-Control associated with the Merger), whether or
not then vested, shall vest and become nonforfeitable and shall be cancelled
at the Effective Time (or, in the case of the 2007 Employees Equity Plan, on
the occurrence of such Change-of-Control), and, in exchange therefor, Parent
or the Company shall pay to each former holder of any such cancelled Company
RSU, as soon as practicable following the Effective Time, an amount in cash
(without interest, and less any amount withheld pursuant to Section
3.05) equal to the product of (A) the Merger Consideration multiplied by (B)
the number of Company Shares subject to such cancelled Company RSU. For the
avoidance of doubt, in no event shall a holder of a cancelled Company RSU be
entitled to payment with respect to such Company RSU under both this Section
3.02(b)(ii) and Section 3.01(b).

(c) _Company PSUs_.

(i) Each Company PSU granted under the Companys 2009 Incentive Award Plan
that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will cease to
represent a right to acquire Company Shares and will be converted as of the
Effective Time into performance share units (each a " _Converted PSU_ ")
covering a number of validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable Parent
Common Shares equal to the product of (A) the number of Company Shares that
would be issuable under such Company PSU, measuring, for such purposes,
achievement of the applicable performance conditions as of the Closing Date,
multiplied by (B) the Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole share.
Each Converted PSU shall otherwise have substantially the same terms and
conditions as the corresponding Company PSU, _provided_ that (1) the Parent
Common Shares issuable under such Converted PSU shall be issued to the holder
of such Converted PSU on the original target date applicable to such Company
PSU and (2) no further performance conditions shall apply to such Converted
PSU. 

 



\- 16 -  (ii) Each Company PSU granted under the Companys 2005 Executive Officer
Equity Plan that is outstanding immediately prior to the occurrence of the
Change-of-Control associated with the Merger, if any, whether or not then
vested, shall vest and become nonforfeitable and shall be cancelled on the
occurrence of the Change-of-Control, and, in exchange therefor, Parent or the
Company shall pay to each former holder of any such cancelled Company PSU, as
soon as practicable following the Effective Time, an amount in cash (without
interest, and less any amount withheld pursuant to Section 3.05) equal to the
product of (A) the Merger Consideration multiplied by (B) the number of
Company Shares that would be issuable under such Company PSU, measuring, for
such purposes, achievement of the applicable performance conditions as of the
Closing Date. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall a holder of a
cancelled Company PSU be entitled to payment with respect to such Company PSU
under both this Section 3.02(c)(ii) and Section 3.01(b). 

(d) _Company Restricted Stock_. Each share of Company Restricted Stock granted
under the Company Equity Plans that is outstanding immediately prior to the
occurrence of the Change-of-Control associated with the Merger, whether or not
then vested, shall vest and become nonforfeitable and shall be cancelled at
the occurrence of such Change-of-Control, and, in exchange therefor, Parent
or the Company shall pay to each former holder of any such cancelled Company
Restricted Stock, as soon as practicable following the Effective Time, an
amount in cash (without interest, and less any amount withheld pursuant to
Section 3.05) equal to the product of (A) the Merger Consideration and (B) the
number of shares of Company Restricted Stock held pursuant to the applicable
award. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall a holder of
Company Restricted Stock be entitled to payment with respect to the cancelled
Company Restricted Stock under both this Section 3.02(d) and Section 3.01(b).

(e) _Company Actions_. The Company shall take such actions as are necessary to
approve and effectuate the foregoing provisions of this Section 3.02,
including (i) making any determinations or adopting resolutions of the
Company Board or the applicable committee thereof or any administrator of a
Company Equity Plan as may be necessary and (ii) satisfying any requirement to
notify the holder of compensatory equity awards as may be required under the
Company Equity Plans.

(f) _Parent Actions_. Following the Effective Time, Parent shall take
all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance such number of Parent
Common Shares as may be issuable in respect of all assumed Company
compensatory equity awards in accordance with this Section 3.02. With respect
to the Company Stock Options assumed pursuant to Section 3.02(a), Company
RSUs assumed pursuant to Section 3.02(b) and Company PSUs assumed pursuant to
Section 3.02(c), Parent shall, if necessary, file with the SEC a registration
statement on Form S-8 (or any successor form) relating to the shares of
Parent Common Shares issuable pursuant to the exercise of such assumed Company
Stock Options and vesting of the Company RSUs and Company PSUs, in each case
as promptly as practicable following the Closing.

(g) _Change-of-Control_. For purposes of this Section 3.02, the term "Change-
of-Control" shall have the meaning attributed to such term or any comparable
term in the applicable Company Equity Plan, as referenced in this Section
3.02.

 



\- 17 -  (h) _Code Section 409A_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, all actions under this Section 3.02 shall be completed in a
manner that complies with Section 409A of the Code, and, if applicable,
Section 424(a) of the Code. By way of example, the conversion of options
under Section 3.02(a)(i) shall be made in a manner that will not subject a
Converted Option to Tax under Section 409A of the Code or cause any such
Converted Option that was intended to be an incentive stock option (within the
meaning of Section 422 of the Code) to fail to be an incentive stock option.

Section 3.03 _Payment of Merger Consideration; Surrender of Company Shares;
Stock Transfer Books_.

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent or Merger Sub shall appoint as paying
agent a bank or trust company reasonably satisfactory to the Company (the "
_Paying Agent_ ") to facilitate the receipt by the Company Stockholders of the
Merger Consideration in connection with the Merger. Prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall deposit or cause the Surviving Corporation to
deposit with the Paying Agent, for the benefit of the holders of Merger
Shares, cash in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration
required to be paid in accordance with this Agreement (such cash being
hereinafter referred to as the " _Surviving Corporation Fund_ "). The
Surviving Corporation Fund shall not be used for any other purpose.

 

(b) The Surviving Corporation Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent as
directed by Parent. No gain or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable
to the holders of Merger Shares following completion of the Merger pursuant to
this Article III and Parent shall take all actions necessary to ensure that
the Surviving Corporation Fund includes at all times cash sufficient
to satisfy Parents obligation under this Article III. Any and all interest
and other income earned on the Surviving Corporation Fund shall promptly be
paid to Parent or an Affiliate of Parent as directed by Parent.

 

(c) As promptly as practicable (and in any event within five (5) Business
Days) after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall
cause the Paying Agent to mail to each Person who was, as of immediately prior
to the Effective Time, a holder of record of the Merger Shares (i) a letter of
transmittal (which shall be in customary form approved by the Company and
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
the certificates representing the Merger Shares (the " _Company Share
Certificates_ ") or uncertificated Merger Shares represented by book entry ("
_Uncertificated Shares_ ") shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the
Company Share Certificates or transfer of the Uncertificated Shares to the
Paying Agent) and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of the
Company Share Certificates or transfer of the Uncertificated Shares in
exchange for the Merger Consideration.

(d) Upon (i) surrender to the Paying Agent of Company Share Certificates for
cancellation, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and
validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other
documents as may be reasonably required pursuant to such instructions or (ii)
compliance with the reasonable procedures established by the Paying Agent for
delivery of Uncertificated Shares, the holder of such Company Share
Certificates or Uncertificated Shares shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor, in cash, the aggregate Merger Consideration in respect
thereof, and the Company Share Certificates or Uncertificated Shares so
surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest 

 



\- 18 -   shall be paid or will accrue on any cash payable to holders of Company Share
Certificates or Uncertificated Shares pursuant to the provisions of this
Article III.

 

(e) In the event of a transfer of ownership of Merger Shares that is not
registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment of the Merger
Consideration in respect of the applicable Merger Shares may be made to a
Person other than the Person in whose name the Company Share Certificates so
surrendered or the Uncertificated Shares so transferred is registered if such
Company Share Certificates shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in
proper form for transfer or such Uncertificated Shares shall be properly
transferred and the Person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or
other Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration in
respect thereof or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the Surviving
Corporation that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until
surrendered or transferred, as the case may be, as contemplated by this
Section 3.03, each Company Share Certificate or Uncertificated Share shall be
deemed at all times after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration.

 

(f) If any Company Share Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming such Company Share Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and,
if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a
bond, in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Company Share Certificate, the Paying Agent shall pay in respect of Merger
Shares to which such lost, stolen or destroyed Company Share Certificate
relates the Merger Consideration to which the holder thereof is entitled.

(g) At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be
closed and there shall be no further registration of transfers of Merger
Shares thereafter on the records of the Company. From and after the Effective
Time, the holders of Company Share Certificates or Uncertificated Shares shall
cease to have any rights with respect to such shares, except as otherwise
provided in this Agreement, the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation or by applicable Law.

(h) Any portion of the Surviving Corporation Fund that remains undistributed
to the holders of Merger Shares for six (6) months after the Effective Time
shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation, upon demand, and any holders
of Merger Shares who have not theretofore complied with this Article III shall
thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for, and the Surviving
Corporation shall remain liable for, payment of their claim for the Merger
Consideration (and Parent shall take all actions necessary to ensure that the
Surviving Corporation has or has access to sufficient funds to make such
payments). Any portion of the Surviving Corporation Fund remaining
unclaimed by holders of Merger Shares as of a date which is immediately prior
to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of
any Governmental Authority shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
become the property of the Surviving Corporation free and clear of any claims
or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. None of Parent, the
Paying Agent or the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any holder of
Merger Shares for any such shares (or dividends or distributions with respect
thereto) or cash delivered to a public official pursuant to any abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law.

 



\- 19 -  Section 3.04 _Dissenting Shares_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Company Shares
that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are
held by any Company Stockholder who shall have neither voted in favor of the
Merger nor consented thereto in writing and who shall have demanded properly
in writing appraisal for such Company Shares in accordance with Section 262
of the DGCL (collectively, the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in Section
3.01(b), but rather, the holders of Dissenting Shares shall be entitled only
to payment of the appraised value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with
the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL (and, at the Effective Time, such
Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
cancelled and shall cease to exist, and such holders shall cease to have any
right with respect thereto, except the right to receive the appraised value of
such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the
DGCL);  _provided, however_ , that if any such holder shall fail to perfect
or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under the
provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL, then the right of such holder to be
paid the appraised value of such holders Dissenting Shares shall cease and
such Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to have been converted as of the
Effective Time into, and to have become exchangeable solely for, the right to
receive the Merger Consideration, without interest, as provided in Section
3.01(b).

(b) The Company shall notify Parent as promptly as reasonably practicable of
any demands received by the Company for appraisal of any Company Shares,
withdrawals thereof and any other instruments delivered to the Company
pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL, and Parent shall have the right to
participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands.
Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the prior written
consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle or
offer to settle, any such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing. Any
portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Paying Agent
pursuant to Section 3.03(a) to pay for Dissenting Shares shall be returned to
Parent upon demand; _provided_ , that Parent shall remain liable to pay, or
cause the Surviving Corporation to pay, the Merger Consideration with respect
to any Company Shares covered by the proviso to Section 3.04(a).

 

Section 3.05 _Withholding Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, the Company, the Surviving Corporation, Parent, Merger Sub
and the Paying Agent, as applicable, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from the Merger Consideration and any other payment otherwise payable pursuant
to this Agreement to any holder of Company Shares, Company Stock Options,
Company Restricted Stock, Company RSUs, or Company PSUs, as applicable, such
amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of
such payment under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax
Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld or paid over to or deposited
with the relevant Governmental Authority, including any Tax authority, such
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the holder of the Company Shares, Company Stock Options, Company
Restricted Stock, Company RSUs, or Company PSUs, as applicable, in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made by the Company, the Surviving
Corporation, Parent, Merger Sub or the Paying Agent, as applicable.

 



\- 20 -  Section 3.06 _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. In the event that the
Company changes (or establishes a record date for changing) the number of
Company Shares issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a result
of a stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, subdivision,
reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or similar transaction with
respect to the outstanding Company Shares, at any time during the period from
the date hereof to the Effective Time, the Merger Consideration shall be
equitably adjusted to reflect such transaction; _provided, however_ , that
nothing in this Section 3.06 shall be construed as permitting the Company to
take any action or enter into any transaction otherwise prohibited by this
Agreement.

 

ARTICLE IV

Except (i) as set forth in the Company Disclosure Schedule or (ii) as
disclosed in the reports, schedules, forms, statements and other documents

each case, on or after May 30, 2010, and prior to the date hereof (but, in
each case, excluding any risk factor disclosures contained under the heading
"Risk Factors," any disclosure of risks included in any "forward-looking
statements" disclaimer or any other statements that are predictive or forward-
looking in nature), but only to the extent such reports, schedules, forms,
statements or other documents are publicly available on the SECs Electronic
Data Gathering Analysis and Retrieval System and such disclosure is reasonably
apparent from a reading of such reports, schedules, forms, statements or other
documents that such disclosure relates to such Section of Article IV below),
the Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as
follows:

Section 4.01 _Organization and Qualification_.

(a) The Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the Laws of the State of Delaware and has the requisite
corporate power and authority to own, operate and lease its properties and
assets and carry on its business as now conducted.

(b) The Company is duly qualified or licensed to do business as a foreign
corporation and is, to the extent applicable, in good standing under the Laws
of any other jurisdiction in which the character of the properties owned,
leased or operated by it therein or in which the conduct or nature of its
business makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except where the
failure to be so qualified, licensed or in good standing has not had and
would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

Section 4.02  _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws_.

(a) The Company has provided or made available to Parent copies of
the Company Certificate and Company Bylaws, and the copies of such documents
are complete and correct and contain all amendments and supplements thereto as

Subsidiary is a corporation, partnership, limited liability company, trust or
other organization that is duly incorporated or organized, validly existing
and, to the extent applicable, in good standing under the Laws of the
jurisdiction of its incorporation or organization, except where the failure
to be duly incorporated, validly existing or in good standing has not been and
would not reasonably be expected to be, individually or in the aggregate,
material to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. Each
of the Company Subsidiaries has the requisite corporate, limited partnership,
limited liability company or similar power and authority to own, lease and
operate its properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now
being conducted, except where the failure to have such requisite power has not
been and would not reasonably be expected to be, individually or in the
aggregate, material to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries. Each of the
Company Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed to do business and is in
good standing in each jurisdiction where the character of the properties
owned, leased or operated by it or the conduct or nature of its business makes
such qualification or licensing necessary, except for jurisdictions in which

would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

(b) The Company is, directly or indirectly, the record and beneficial owner of
all of the outstanding shares of capital stock or other equity interests of
each of the Company Subsidiaries. All of such shares and other equity
interests so owned by the Company are validly issued, fully paid and

character relating to the issuance, transfer, sales, delivery, voting or
redemption (including any rights of conversion or exchange under any
outstanding security or other instrument) for any of the capital stock or
other equity interests of, or other ownership interests in, any Company
Subsidiary. There are no agreements requiring the Company or any Company
Subsidiary to make contributions to the capital of, or lend or advance

Million Dollars ($5,000,000) or Ten Million Dollars ($10,000,000) in the
aggregate.

 

(c) No Company Subsidiary has (i) a minimum cash capitalization or other cash

Agreement and all other agreements and documents contemplated hereby to which

requisite corporate action on behalf of the Company, including by the Company
Board. No other corporate proceedings on the part of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary are necessary to authorize this Agreement or to consummate
the Transactions, except, in the case of the Merger, for the affirmative vote
of holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding Company Shares for
adoption of this Agreement (the " _Company Stockholder Approval_ ") and the
filing of the Certificate of Merger pursuant to the DGCL. This Agreement has
been duly and validly executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming the
due authorization, execution and delivery by each of Parent and Merger Sub,
constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable

applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent
transfer and similar Laws of general applicability relating to or affecting
creditors rights or by rules of law and equity governing specific
performance, injunctive relief and other equitable remedies (the " _Bankruptcy

Section 4.06 _No Conflict; Required Filings and Consents_.

 

(a) The execution and delivery by the Company of this Agreement and all other
agreements and documents contemplated hereby to which it is a party and the
consummation by the Company of the Transactions do not and will not, and the
compliance by the Company with its obligations hereunder and thereunder will
not, (i) result in a violation or breach of or conflict with the
Company Certificate or Company Bylaws, (ii) subject to obtaining

 



\- 24 -   or making consents, approvals, orders, authorizations, registrations,
declarations, filings and other actions described in Section 4.06(b), conflict

or asset of the Company or any Company Subsidiary is bound, (iii) result in
any violation or breach of or conflict with any provisions of, or constitute
(with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) a default (or give rise to

triggering of any payments pursuant to, any of the terms, conditions or
provisions of any Company Material Contract or (iv) result in the creation of
a Lien, except for Permitted Liens, on any property or asset of the Company
or any Company Subsidiary, except, with respect to clauses (iii) and (iv),
for such violations, breaches, conflicts, defaults, rights of purchase,
terminations, amendments, accelerations, cancellations, losses of benefits,
payments or Liens that would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

(b) No consent, approval, Order or authorization of, or registration,
qualification, designation or filing with or notification to, any Governmental
Authority is required on the part of the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries in connection with the execution, delivery and performance of

consents, approvals, Orders, authorizations, registrations, qualifications,
designations, filings or notifications to, by or from any Governmental
Authority that, if not obtained, made or given, would not, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect. 

Section 4.07 _Compliance with Laws; Permits_.

 

(a) The Company and the Company Subsidiaries are, and since January 1, 2008
have been, in compliance with all Laws applicable to them, any of their
properties or other assets or any of their businesses or operations, except
where any such failure to be in compliance has not been and would not
reasonably be expected to be, individually or in the aggregate, material to
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. To the Knowledge
of the Company, no investigation or review by any Governmental Authority with
respect to the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries is pending or
threatened that, in each case, is or would reasonably be expected to be,
individually or in the aggregate, material to the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

(b) The Company and each of the Company Subsidiaries hold all licenses,
franchises, permits, certificates, consents, orders, approvals and
authorizations from Governmental Authorities, or required by Governmental
Authorities to be obtained, in each case, that are necessary for the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries to own, lease or operate their properties and
assets and to carry on their businesses as currently conducted
(collectively, " _Permits_ ") and each of the Permits is in full force and
effect, except for such Permits that the

 



\- 25 -   failure to hold or be in full force and effect has not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect. Since January 1, 2008, neither the Company nor any
of the Company Subsidiaries has received written notice to the effect that a
Governmental Authority was considering the amendment, termination, revocation
or cancellation of any Permit, except as has not had and would not reasonably
be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material
Adverse Effect. Each of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries is, and since
January 1, 2008 has been, in compliance with the terms of its Permits, except
where noncompliance with such Permit has not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse

with the Transactions, the Company shall provide Parent and its counsel with
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on each such filing in advance,
and the Company shall in good faith consider including in such filings all
comments reasonably proposed by Parent. All documents that the Company files
with the SEC in connection with the Merger or the other Transactions,
including the Proxy Statement, will comply as to form and substance in all
material respects with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the
rules and regulations thereunder.

 

(b) The Company shall notify Parent promptly of the receipt of any oral or

to review the preliminary Proxy Statement) and of any request by the SEC or
its staff for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement or any other

has sent to the Company Stockholders or otherwise made available to the

Company Stockholders Meeting unless otherwise approved in writing by Parent.

 

(e) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company agrees that,
unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance with Section 9.01, (i) its
obligation to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold the Company

Parent and Merger Sub and their respective Representatives reasonable
access during normal working hours upon reasonable advance notice to the

facilities, books and records of the Company and each Company Subsidiary and
shall furnish Parent and Merger Sub with such financial, operating and other
data and information as Parent or Merger Sub, through their Representatives,
may reasonably request, as long as these actions are in compliance with all
applicable Laws; _provided_ , _however_ , that, with the sole and limited
exception of the performance of any environmental site assessment ( _e.g._ ,

or Merger Sub, none of Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective
Representatives shall conduct any environmental sampling or surface or
subsurface assessment or investigation; _provided, further_ , that the Company
may restrict or otherwise prohibit access to any documents or information to
the extent that (i) any applicable Law requires the Company to restrict or
otherwise prohibit access to such documents or information, (ii) access by
Parent or its Representatives to such documents or information would give rise
to a material risk (based on the advice of the Companys outside counsel and
after giving due consideration of the existence of any common interest, joint
defense or similar agreement between the parties) of waiving any attorney-
client privilege, work product doctrine or other applicable privilege
applicable to such documents or information or (iii) access to a Contract to
which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party or otherwise bound
would violate or cause a default under, or give another party to such
Contract the right to terminate or accelerate the rights under, such Contract;
_provided further, however_ , that in the event that the Company does not
provide access or information in reliance on the preceding proviso, the
Company shall promptly notify Parent and use its commercially reasonable

(including through its Representatives) in a way that would not violate the
applicable Law or Contract or waive any such a privilege. Any investigation
conducted pursuant to the access contemplated by this Section 7.02 shall be
conducted in a manner that does not unreasonably interfere with the conduct of
the business of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries or damage or destroy
any property or assets of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries. Any
access to the properties and documents of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries afforded pursuant to this Section 7.02 shall be provided pursuant
to, and subject to, the Companys reasonable, generally applicable security
measures.

otherwise shall affect any representation, warranty, covenant or other
agreement in this Agreement of any party or any condition to the obligations
of the parties.

establish a mechanism acceptable to both parties by which Parent will be
permitted, prior to the Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement
and subject to applicable Law, to communicate directly with the Company
employees regarding integration and employee related matters. Any such
communication will be coordinated and planned with the Company and the
Companys cooperation shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed.

Representatives. From the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the

or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate, cause or knowingly facilitate or
encourage (including by way of furnishing information) the submission of any
inquiries, proposals or offers or any other efforts or attempts that
constitute or may reasonably be expected to lead to any Company Acquisition

Board Recommendation or the approval or declaration of advisability by the
Company Board of this Agreement and the Transactions (including the Merger) or

lead to a Superior Proposal and (iv) after consultation with its outside

Proposal in accordance with Section 7.03(b) and shall in no event begin
providing such information or engaging in such discussions or negotiations
prior to providing such notice. The Company shall not, and shall cause the

 



\- 55 -   Company Subsidiaries and the Companys Representatives not to, enter into
any Contract with any Person subsequent to the date of this Agreement that
would restrict the Companys ability to provide such information relating to
the Company or any Company Subsidiary to Parent, and neither the Company nor
any of the Company Subsidiaries is currently party to any Contract that
prohibits the Company from providing the information relating to the Company
or any Company Subsidiary described in this Section 7.03(c) to Parent. The
Company (x) shall not, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries not to,
terminate, waive, amend or modify any provision of, or grant permission or
request under, any standstill or confidentiality agreement to which it or any
of the Company Subsidiaries is or becomes a party and (y) shall, and shall
cause the Company Subsidiaries to, use commercially reasonable efforts
to enforce the provisions of any such agreement, unless, in each case in
clauses (x) and (y), the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with its outside counsel, that failure to take such action would
constitute a breach by the Company Board of its fiduciary duties to the
Company Stockholders under applicable Law.

(d) Notwithstanding anything in Section 7.03(a) to the contrary, if (i) the
Company receives from a third party that is not in violation of such third
partys contractual obligations to the Company a written, bona fide Company
Acquisition Proposal, (ii) a breach by the Company of this Section 7.03 has
not contributed to the making of such Company Acquisition Proposal and (iii)
the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its
financial advisors and outside counsel, that such Company Acquisition
Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal after giving effect to all of the
adjustments to the terms of this Agreement which may be offered by Parent
including pursuant to clause (III) below, the Company Board may at any time
prior to the Company Stockholder Approval, if it determines in good faith,
after consultation with its outside counsel, that failure to take such action
would constitute a breach by the Company Board of its fiduciary duties to the
Company Stockholders under applicable Law, (x) effect an Adverse
Recommendation Change and/or (y) terminate this Agreement to enter into a
definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal; _provided,
however_ , that the Company shall not terminate this Agreement pursuant to
the foregoing clause (y), and any purported termination pursuant to the
foregoing clause (y) shall be void and of no force or effect, unless in
advance of or concurrently with such termination the Company (A) pays, or
causes to be paid, the Termination Fee to Parent in immediately available
funds and (B) concurrently with such termination enters into the Alternative
Acquisition Agreement; _provided, further, however_ , that the Company Board
may not effect an Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to the foregoing
clause (x) or terminate this Agreement pursuant to the foregoing clause (y)
unless (I) the Company shall not have breached this Section 7.03 in a manner
that contributed to the making of such Superior Proposal, (II) the Company
shall have provided to Parent at least five (5) Business Days prior written
notice of its intention to take such action with respect to such
Superior Proposal, which notice shall specify the material terms and
conditions of any such Superior Proposal (including the identity of the party
making such Superior Proposal), and shall have contemporaneously provided to
Parent a copy of any proposed definitive agreement(s) with respect to such
Superior Proposal (the " _Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ "), (III) prior
to effecting such Adverse Recommendation Change or terminating this Agreement
to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to such
Superior Proposal, the Company shall, and shall cause its financial advisors
and outside counsel to, during the five (5) Business Day notice period,
negotiate with Parent in good faith (to the extent Parent desires to
negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this
Agreement so that such Company

 



\- 56 -   Acquisition Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal and (IV)
following any negotiation described in the immediately preceding clause (III),
such Company Acquisition Proposal (taking into account any changes to the
terms of this Agreement agreed to or proposed by Parent as a result of the
negotiations required by clause (III) in a binding written offer) continues to
constitute a Superior Proposal. In the event of any material revisions to the
terms of a Company Acquisition Proposal after the start of the five (5)
Business Day notice period, the Company shall be required to deliver a new
written notice to Parent and to comply with the requirements of this Section
7.03(d) with respect to such new written notice, and the five (5) Business Day
notice period shall be deemed to have re-commenced on the date of such new
notice.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything in Section 7.03(a) to the contrary, if (i) a
material development or change in circumstances in the business, results of
operations or financial condition of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
(other than and not related to an Acquisition Proposal) that was neither known
to nor reasonably foreseeable by the Company Board (assuming, for such
purpose, reasonable consultation with the executive officers of the Company)
as of the date of this Agreement occurs or arises after the date of this
Agreement (such development or change, an " _Intervening Event_ "), (ii)
the Intervening Event did not result or arise from a breach of any provision
of this Agreement, and (iii) the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with its outside counsel, that, in light of the existence of such
Intervening Event, the failure to make an Adverse Recommendation Change would
constitute a breach by the Company Board of its fiduciary duties to the
Company Stockholders under applicable Law, the Company Board may, at any time
prior to the Company Stockholder Approval, effect an Adverse Recommendation
Change, _provided_ that that the Company Board shall not make an Adverse
Recommendation Change in light of the existence of such Intervening Event
unless (A) the Company has provided to Parent at least five (5) Business Days
prior written notice of its intention to take such action with respect to such
Intervening Event, which notice shall specify, in reasonable detail, the facts
underlying the Company Boards determination that an Intervening Event has
occurred and the rationale and basis for such Adverse Recommendation Change,
(B) the Company shall, and shall cause its financial advisors and outside
counsel to, during such five (5) Business Day notice period, negotiate with
Parent in good faith (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) to make such
adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so as to obviate the
need for an Adverse Recommendation Change as a result of the
Intervening Event and (C) following any negotiation described in the
immediately preceding clause (B), the Company Board determines in good faith,
after consultation with its outside counsel, that the failure to make such
Adverse Recommendation Change in light of such Intervening Event (taking into
account any changes to the terms of this Agreement agreed or proposed by
Parent as a result of the negotiations required by the immediately preceding
clause (B)) would constitute a breach of its fiduciary duties to the Company
Stockholders under applicable Law. In the event of any material change in the
circumstances of such Intervening Event or the occurrence of another
Intervening Event, the Company shall be required to deliver a new written
notice to Parent and to comply with the requirements of this Section 7.03(e)
with respect to such new written notice.

(f) The Company agrees that any breaches of the restrictions set forth in
this Section 7.03 by any of the Companys Representatives shall be deemed to
be a breach of this Agreement (including this Section 7.03) by the Company.

 



\- 57 -  (g) Nothing contained in this Section 7.03 shall prohibit the Company Board
from taking and disclosing to the Company Stockholders a position
contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A
promulgated under the Exchange Act; _provided, however_ , that any disclosure
other than (i) a "stop, look and listen" or similar communication of the type
contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act, (ii) an express
rejection of any applicable Company Acquisition Proposal or (iii) an express
reaffirmation of the Company Board Recommendation together with a factual
description of events or actions leading up to such disclosure that have been
taken by the Company and that are permitted under Section 7.03 or actions
taken or notices delivered to Parent by the Company that are required by
Section 7.03, shall, in each case, be deemed to be an Adverse Recommendation
Change (including for purposes of Section 9.01(f)).

(h) The Company shall not take any action to exempt any Person (other than
Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Affiliates) from the provisions of
"control share acquisitions" contained in any Anti-Takeover Law or otherwise
cause such restrictions not to apply, in each case unless such actions are
taken simultaneously with a termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section
9.01(h).

 

Section 7.04 _Employee Matters_.

(a) After the Effective Time, at Parents sole discretion, the employees of
the Company and any Company Subsidiary (the " _Company Employees_ ") will
become employees of Parent or a Subsidiary of Parent.

(b) Effective as of the Effective Time and for a period ending on the first
anniversary of the Closing Date, Parent shall provide, or cause the Surviving
Corporation to provide, to Company Employees (provided such Company Employees
remain employed by Parent or the Surviving Corporation), compensation and
employee benefits that are substantially comparable, in the aggregate, to
those provided to Company Employees, in the aggregate, immediately prior to
the Effective Time, excluding for purposes of this comparison any equity-based
compensation; _provided_ that the base salary or regular hourly wages,
whichever is applicable, and target variable cash opportunities for any
Company Employee shall not be less than the base salary or regular hourly wage
and target variable cash opportunity provided to such Company Employee by
the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time. In the event a Company
Employees employment with Parent or the Surviving Corporation is terminated
within twelve (12) months following the Closing Date, Parent shall provide, or
cause the Surviving Corporation to provide, to such Company Employee
severance and termination benefits pursuant to (i) the Companys severance
plan or arrangement in effect as of the date hereof for the resident country
of such Company Employee (for U.S. Company Employees, specifically the
Company Severance Benefit Plan, effective as of February 1, 2009), or (ii)
Parents severance plan or arrangement in effect on the date of termination
for the resident country of such Company Employee, whichever plan or
arrangement provides the Company Employee with the highest amount of severance
and termination benefits.

(c) Effective as of the Effective Time and thereafter, Parent shall provide,
or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide, that, for purposes of
eligibility for participation and vesting under the Parent Plans, but not,
except as provided below, for purposes of

 



\- 58 -   determining the level of benefit entitlement, each Company Employee shall be
credited with his or her years of service with the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries and their respective predecessors before the Effective Time, to
the same extent as such Company Employee was entitled, before the Effective
Time, to credit for such service under any similar Plans in which such Company
Employee participated or was eligible to participate immediately prior to the
Effective Time; _provided, however_ , that the foregoing shall not apply to
the extent that its application would result in a duplication of benefits with
respect to the same period of service. The Company Employees shall be
credited with prior service for purposes of determining the level of benefit
entitlement under Parents severance and vacation plans, as well as the
retirement and other service related provisions under Parents
equity compensation plans.

(d) Effective as of the Effective Time and thereafter, Parent shall, and shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to, (i) waive all pre-existing condition
exclusions, eligibility waiting periods, actively-at-work requirements and
evidence of insurability requirements of such Parent Plan, to the extent
permitted under the Parent Plans, for such Company Employee and his or her
covered dependents, unless such conditions would not have been waived under a
similar Plan in which such Company Employee participated immediately prior to
the Effective Time and (ii) credit each Company Employee with any and all
deductible payments, out-of-pocket, co-payments and other eligible expenses
paid or incurred by such employee and his or her covered dependents under the
Plans prior to the Closing Date during the year in which the Closing
occurs, to the extent permitted under each Parent Plan, for purposes of
determining the extent to which any such Company Employee has satisfied all
deductible and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such employee
and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such
amounts had been paid in accordance with such Parent Plan.

(e) At Parents request, the Company shall take all actions reasonably
necessary to amend or terminate the Company Retirement and Savings Program
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 

(f) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, (i) the then-current Offering
Period(s) and Purchase Period(s) (as defined in the Employee Stock Purchase
Plan) under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan shall terminate, (ii) shares
shall be purchased pursuant to the terms of the Employee Stock Purchase Plan,
and (iii) the Company shall take all actions reasonably necessary to
terminate the Employee Stock Purchase Plan. Parent will not continue or assume
the Employee Stock Purchase Plan.

 

(g) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in this Section 7.04
shall (i) be treated as an amendment of any particular Plan, (ii) give any
third party any right to enforce the provisions of this Section 7.04 or (iii)
require Parent or any of its Affiliates to (A) maintain any particular Plan or
(B) retain the employment of any particular employee.

Section 7.05 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
Board, or an appropriate committee of non-employee directors thereof, shall
adopt a resolution consistent with the interpretive guidance of the SEC so
that the disposition by any officer or director of the Company who is a
covered person of the Company for purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange Act
(" _Section 16_ ") of Company Shares or Company Stock Options (or Company
Shares acquired upon the vesting of any Company Stock Options, Company RSUs or
Company PSUs) pursuant 

 



\- 59 -   to this Agreement shall be an exempt transaction for purposes of Section 16
and all rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.

 

Section 7.06 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance of the
Surviving Corporation_.

 

(a) To the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to honor all of the Companys obligations to indemnify
and hold harmless each person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the
date hereof or who becomes prior to the Effective Time an officer or director
of the Company or any Company Subsidiary (each an " _Indemnified Party_ ") as
provided in the Company Certificate or Company Bylaws, in each case, as in
effect on the date of this Agreement, or pursuant to any other agreements in
effect on the date hereof, accurate and complete copies of which have been
provided or made available to Parent and are listed in Schedule 7.06(a) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, including provisions relating to the advancement
of expenses incurred in the defense of any action or suit or as
permitted under applicable Law. Parents obligation under this Section
7.06(a) shall survive the Merger and shall remain in full force and effect for
a period of not less than six (6) years after the Effective Time unless
otherwise required by Law. During such period, Parent shall guarantee the
obligations of the Surviving Corporation with respect to any and all amounts
payable under this Section 7.06.

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall purchase a fully-paid,
noncancellable "tail" officers and directors liability insurance policy,
which by its terms shall survive the Merger and shall provide each
Indemnified Party with coverage for not less than six (6) years following the
Effective Time on terms and conditions no less favorable than the terms of the
directors and officers liability insurance policy currently maintained by
the Company (a correct and complete copy of which has been provided or made
available to Parent) (the " _D andO Insurance_") in respect of actions or
omissions of such officers and directors prior to the Effective Time in their
capacities as such; _provided, however_ , that in no event shall Parent or the
Surviving Corporation be required to expend more than two hundred fifty
percent (250%) of the current annual premium paid by the Company for such
policy (the " _Maximum Amount_ "); _provided, further, however_ , that if the
amount of the annual premiums necessary to procure such insurance coverage
exceeds the Maximum Amount, Parent shall spend up to the Maximum Amount to
purchase such lesser coverage as may be obtained with such Maximum Amount.

(c) The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this
Section 7.06 shall survive the consummation of the Merger and shall not be
terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Indemnified
Party to whom this Section 7.06 applies without the consent of such affected
Indemnified Party (it being expressly agreed that the Indemnified Parties to
whom this Section 7.06 applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this
Section 7.06, each of whom may enforce the provisions of this Section 7.06).

(d) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper

 



\- 60 -   provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set
forth in this Section 7.06. 

Section 7.07 _Further Action; Efforts_.

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain any consents, approvals or waivers of third
parties with respect to any Company Material Contracts to which the Company
or any of the Company Subsidiaries is a party as may be necessary or
appropriate for the consummation of the Transactions or required by the terms
of any Contract as a result of the execution, performance or consummation of
the Transactions. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
prior to the Effective Time, each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
other actions and do, or cause to be done, all other things necessary, proper
or advisable under applicable Law to consummate the Transactions, including,
(i) making all appropriate filings and submissions (and filings and
submissions considered by Parent to be advisable) under the HSR Act and with
any other Governmental Authority pursuant to any other applicable Antitrust
Laws or otherwise as determined by Parent, as promptly as practicable, but in
no event later than ten (10) Business Days after the date hereof with respect
to filing under the HSR Act, and shall make as promptly as practicable any
other appropriate submissions under other applicable Antitrust Laws, (ii)
obtaining as promptly as practicable the termination of any waiting period
under the HSR Act and any applicable foreign Antitrust Laws, (iii) cooperating
and consulting with each other in (A) determining which filings are required
to be made prior to the Effective Time with, and which material
consents, approvals, permits, notices or authorizations are required to be
obtained prior to the Effective Time from, Governmental Authorities in
connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and related
agreements and consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby and (B) timely making all such filings and timely seeking all such
consents, approvals, permits, notices or authorizations.

(b) In connection with the efforts referenced in Section 7.07(a) and subject
to applicable Law, each of the Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Merger
Sub, on the other hand, together with their respective counsel will (i)
cooperate in all respects with each other in connection with any filing or
submission and in connection with any investigation or other inquiry,
including any proceeding initiated by a private party, (ii) keep the other
party reasonably informed of any communication received by such party from, or
given by such party to, the Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ "), the
Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (the " _DOJ_ ") or any other
U.S. or foreign Governmental Authority and of any communication received or
given in connection with any proceeding by a private party, in each case
regarding the Transactions and (iii) permit the other party to review any
communication given by it to, and consult with each other in advance of any
meeting or conference with, the FTC, the DOJ or any other Governmental
Authority or, in connection with any proceeding by a private party, with any
other Person, and to the extent permitted by the FTC, the DOJ or such other
applicable Governmental Authority or other Person, give the other party the
opportunity to attend and participate in such meetings and conferences.
Neither Parent, Merger Sub nor the Company shall commit to or agree with any
Governmental Authority to stay, toll or extend any applicable waiting period
under the HSR Act or applicable Antitrust Laws, without the prior written
consent of the other. The Company, Parent, and Merger Sub may, as each deems
advisable and

 



\- 61 -   necessary, reasonably designate any competitively sensitive material
provided to the other under this Section 7.07 as "Outside Counsel Only
Material." Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 7.07,
materials provided to the other party or its counsel may be redacted to remove
references concerning the valuation of the Company and its Subsidiaries.

 

(c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
contained in Section 7.07(a) and Section 7.07(b), if any objections are
asserted with respect to the Transactions under any Antitrust Law or if any
suit is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) by the FTC, the DOJ or any
other applicable Governmental Authority or any private party challenging any
of the Transactions as violative of any Antitrust Law or which would otherwise
prevent, materially impede or materially delay the consummation of the
Transactions, each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to resolve any such objections or suits so as
to permit consummation of the Transactions, including in order to resolve such
objections or suits which, in any case if not resolved, could reasonably be
expected to prevent, materially impede or materially delay the consummation
of the Transactions.

(d) In the event that any administrative or judicial action or proceeding is
instituted (or threatened to be instituted) by a Governmental Authority or
private party challenging the Merger or any other Transaction, each of Parent,
Merger Sub and the Company shall cooperate in all respects with each other
and use its respective commercially reasonable efforts to contest and resist
any such action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or
overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary,
preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or
restricts consummation of the Transactions. Parent shall be entitled to direct
the antitrust defense of the Merger or any other Transactions, or negotiations
with, any Governmental Authority or other Person relating to the Merger or
regulatory filings under applicable Antitrust Law, subject to the provisions
of Sections 7.07(a), (b), (c) and (e). The Company shall not make any offer,
acceptance or counter-offer to or otherwise engage in negotiations or
discussions with any Governmental Authority with respect to any proposed
settlement, consent decree, commitment or remedy, or, in the event of
litigation, discovery, admissibility of evidence, timing or scheduling, except
as specifically requested by or agreed with Parent. The Company shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to provide full and effective support of
Parent in all material respects in all such negotiations and discussions to
the extent requested by Parent.

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement,
(i) nothing in this Section 7.07 shall limit a partys right to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.01 and (ii) nothing in this Agreement
shall obligate Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates to
agree to (and none of the Company or any Company Subsidiary shall, without
the prior written consent of Parent) (A) sell, hold separate or otherwise
dispose of all or a portion of its respective business, assets or properties,
or conduct its business in a specified manner, (B) pay any amounts (other
than the payment of filing fees and expenses and fees of counsel), or grant
any counterparty to any Contract any material accommodation, (C) limit in any
manner whatsoever the ability of such entities to conduct, own, operate or
control any of their respective businesses, assets or properties or of the
businesses, properties or assets of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
or (D) waive any of the conditions set forth in Article VIII of this
Agreement.

 



\- 62 -  Section 7.08 _Public Announcements_. The parties hereto agree that no
public release or announcement concerning the Transactions shall be issued by
a party without the prior consent of the other parties (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), except as such release
or announcement may be required by applicable Law or rules or regulations of
any securities exchange, in which case the party required to make the release
or announcement shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to allow the
other parties reasonable time to comment on such release or announcement in
advance of such issuance. The parties have agreed upon the form of a joint
press release announcing the Transactions and the execution of this Agreement.

 

Section 7.09 _Anti-Takeover Laws_. If any Anti-Takeover Law is or may become
applicable to any Transaction contemplated by this Agreement, (a) the parties
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to take such actions as are
reasonably necessary so that the Transactions contemplated hereunder may be
consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and
(b) the Company Board shall take all actions necessary to render such statutes
inapplicable to any Transaction contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 7.10 _Securityholder Litigation_. Except with respect to any Action
contemplated by Section 3.04, the Company shall give Parent the opportunity to
participate in, subject to a customary joint defense agreement, but not
control, the defense or settlement of any securityholder litigation against
the Company and/or its directors relating to the Transactions, and no such
settlement shall be agreed to without Parents prior written consent (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

Section 7.11  _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company shall give
prompt notice to Parent and Merger Sub and Parent and Merger Sub shall give
prompt notice to the Company of (a) any written notice or other communication
received from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is required
in connection with the Transactions, (b) any notice from any Governmental
Authority in connection with the Transactions, (c) any Actions or claims
commenced or, to such partys knowledge, threatened against, relating to or
involving or otherwise affecting such party or any of its Subsidiaries that
relate to the Transactions, (d) the discovery of any fact or circumstance, or
the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event, that would cause any
representation or warranty made by such party contained in this Agreement to
be, with respect to the Company, untrue or inaccurate such that the condition
set forth in Section 8.02 would not be satisfied, and with respect to Parent
and Merger Sub, untrue or inaccurate in any material respect, and (e) any
material failure of such party to comply with or satisfy any covenant or
agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder;
_provided, however_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this
Section 7.11 shall not (i) cure any breach of, or non-compliance with, any
other provision of this Agreement or (ii) limit the remedies available to the
party receiving such notice; and _provided_ , _further_ , that a failure to
comply with this Section 7.11 prior to the Closing Date in and of itself will
not constitute the failure of the condition to Closing to be satisfied unless
(i) such failure materially prejudices another partys ability to exercise
its rights or remedies hereunder prior to the Closing or (ii) the underlying
event would independently result in the failure of the applicable condition to
Closing to be satisfied.

Section 7.12 _Company SEC Reports_. From the date of this Agreement to the
Effective Time, the Company shall timely file with the SEC all Company SEC
Reports required to be filed

 



\- 63 -   by it under the Exchange Act or the Securities Act. As of its filing date,
or if amended after the date of this Agreement, as of the date of the last
such amendment, each such Company SEC Report shall fully comply with the
applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the Securities Act, as the
case may be. As of its filing date or, if amended after the date of this
Agreement, as of the date of the last such amendment, each such Company SEC
Report filed pursuant to the Exchange Act shall not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Each
Company SEC Report that is a registration statement, as amended or
supplemented, if applicable, filed after the date of this Agreement pursuant
to the Securities Act, as of the date such registration statement or
amendment became effective after to the date of this Agreement, shall not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make
the statements made in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading.

at and as of the Closing (without regard to any qualifications therein as to
materiality or material adverse effect), as though made at and as of such time
(or, if made as of a specific date, at and as of such date), except for such
failures to be true and correct as would not reasonably be expected to have a
Parent Material Adverse Effect.

(b) Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall have performed in all material
respects all obligations and agreements contained in this Agreement to be
performed or complied with by it prior to or on the Closing Date.

(c) At any time after the date of this Agreement, there shall not have

TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER

Section 9.01 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated and the
Transactions may be abandoned, whether before or after obtaining the Company
Stockholder Approval, as follows (the date of any such termination, the "
_Termination Date_ "):

 

(a) by mutual written consent of Parent and the Company at any time prior to
the Effective Time;

 

(b) by either Parent or the Company, if the Effective Time shall not have
occurred on or before January 4, 2012 (the " _Outside Date_ "); _provided,
however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section
9.01(b) shall not be available to a party whose failure to fulfill any
obligation under this Agreement caused the failure of the Effective Time to
occur on or before such date; _provided, further_ , that if on the Outside
Date, the condition to Closing set forth in Section 8.01(b) or Section 8.01(c)
(but for purposes of Section 8.01(c) only if such restraint or prohibition is
attributable to an Antitrust Law) shall not have been fulfilled, but all other
conditions to Closing shall be or shall be capable of being fulfilled, then
the Outside Date shall automatically be extended for three (3) months;

(c) by either Parent or the Company, if any Governmental Authority shall have
(i) enacted, issued, promulgated or enforced any Law that makes consummation
of the Merger illegal or otherwise prohibited or (ii) enacted, issued,
promulgated, enforced or entered any Order which has the effect of making the
consummation of the Merger illegal or otherwise prohibiting consummation of
the Merger, and such Law or Order shall have become final and nonappealable;

(d) by Parent, if prior to the Effective Time (i) there shall have occurred
any effects, events, occurrences, developments, state of facts or changes
that, individually or in the aggregate, have had or would reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect or (ii) there shall have
been a breach or inaccuracy of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement on the part of the Company contained in this Agreement, which
Company Material Adverse Effect, breach or inaccuracy contemplated by the
foregoing clauses (i) or (ii) would (A) give rise to the failure of a
condition set forth in Section 8.02(a), (b) or (c) and (B) is incapable of
being cured or has not been cured fifteen (15) Business Days after the
Company receives notice of such Company Material Adverse Effect, breach or
inaccuracy from Parent; _provided, however_ , that neither Parent nor Merger
Sub is then in material breach of any representation, warranty or covenant
under this Agreement;

(e) by either Parent or the Company, if the Company Stockholder Meeting
(including any adjournment or postponement thereof) has concluded, the Company
Stockholders have voted, and the Company Stockholder Approval was not
obtained; _provided, however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 9.01(e) shall not be available to the Company if it
has not materially complied with its obligations under Sections 7.01 and 7.03;

 



\- 66 -  (f) by Parent, if (i) an Adverse Recommendation Change shall have
occurred, (ii) the Company Board or any committee thereof (A) shall not have
rejected any Company Acquisition Proposal within seven (7) days of the making
public thereof (including, for these purposes, by taking no position with
respect to the acceptance by the Company Stockholders of a tender offer or
exchange offer, which shall constitute a failure to reject such Company
Acquisition Proposal) or (B) shall have failed, pursuant to Rule 14e-2
promulgated under the Exchange Act or otherwise, to publicly reconfirm the
Company Board Recommendation within four (4) days after receipt of a written
request from Parent that it do so if such request is made following the making
by any Person of a Company Acquisition Proposal or (iii) the Company shall
have violated or breached in any material respect any of its obligations under
Section 7.03;

 

(g) by the Company prior to the Effective Time, if there shall have been a
breach or inaccuracy of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
on the part of Parent or Merger Sub contained in this Agreement, which breach
or inaccuracy (i) would reasonably be expected to prevent Parent or Merger Sub
from consummating the Merger in accordance with the terms hereof and (ii) is
incapable of being cured or has not been cured fifteen (15) Business Days
after Parent receives notice of such breach or inaccuracy from the Company;
_provided, however_ , that the Company is not then in material breach of
any representation, warranty or covenant under this Agreement; or

(h) by the Company in accordance with Section 7.03(d). 

Section 9.02 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 9.01, this Agreement shall forthwith become
void, and there shall be no liability under this Agreement on the part of any
party hereto except that the provisions of Section 7.02(b), this Section 9.02,
Section 9.03 and Article X shall survive any such termination; _provided,
however_ , that nothing herein shall relieve any party hereto from liability
for any intentional breach of any of its representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement or fraud prior to such
termination.

Section 9.03 _Fees and Expenses_.

 

(a) Except as otherwise set forth in this Section 9.03, all expenses incurred
in connection with this Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such
expenses, whether or not the Merger is consummated.

(b) In the event this Agreement shall be terminated: 

(i) by (A) the Company pursuant to Section 9.01(h) or (B) Parent pursuant to
Section 9.01(f), the Company shall pay to Parent the Termination Fee; or

(ii) (A) by Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 9.01(b) or by Parent
pursuant to Section 9.01(d) or Section 9.01(e), (B) at or prior to the date of
termination, a Company Acquisition Proposal shall have been made known to the
Company or shall have been made directly to the Company
Stockholders generally or any Person shall have publicly announced an
intention to make a Company Acquisition Proposal (whether or not conditional
or withdrawn) and (C) concurrently with such termination or within twelve (12)
months following such termination, the Company enters into an Alternative
Acquisition Agreement to consummate

 



\- 67 -   or consummates a transaction contemplated by any Company Acquisition
Proposal, then the Company shall pay, or cause to be paid, to Parent the
Termination Fee upon the earlier to occur of the Companys entering into the
Alternative Acquisition Agreement or the consummation of such Company
Acquisition Proposal. For purposes of this Section 9.03(b)(ii), " _Company
Acquisition Proposal_ " shall have the meaning assigned thereto in Section
1.01 except that references in the definition to "fifteen percent (15%)" and
"eighty-five percent (85%)" shall be replaced by "fifty percent (50%)."

 

(c) In the event this Agreement shall be terminated by Parent or the Company
pursuant to Section 9.01(e), the Company shall promptly pay to Parent all
costs and expenses incurred by Parent and Merger Sub in connection with this
Agreement and the Transactions not to exceed Fifty Million Dollars
($50,000,000) (the " _Expense Reimbursement_ "); _provided_ that in the event
the Expense Reimbursement is paid and a Termination Fee is thereafter payable
pursuant to Section 9.03(b)(ii), the Termination Fee otherwise payable shall
be reduced by the amount of the Expense Reimbursement.

 

(d) In the event that this Agreement shall be terminated by the Company or
Parent pursuant to Section 9.01(b) or Section 9.01(c) (but for purposes of
Section 9.01(c) only if such illegality or prohibition is attributable to an
Antitrust Law) and all of the conditions to Closing set forth in Article VIII
(other than (i) the conditions set forth in Section 8.01(b) or Section
8.01(c) (but for purposes of Section 8.01(c) only if such restraint or
prohibition is attributable to an Antitrust Law) and (ii) those other
conditions that, by their nature, cannot be satisfied until the Closing Date,
but, in the case of clause (ii), which conditions would be satisfied if the
Closing Date were the date of such termination) have been satisfied or waived
on or prior to the date of such termination, then Parent shall pay to the
Company a termination fee equal to Three Hundred Fifty Million Dollars
($350,000,000) (the " _Reverse Termination Fee_ ").

(e) The Company and Parent acknowledge that the agreements contained in this
Section 9.03 are an integral part of the Agreement and the Transactions and
that, without these agreements, neither Parent and Merger Sub, on the one
hand, nor the Company, on the other hand, would enter into this Agreement.
Except with respect to Section 9.01(h), in which case the Termination Fee
shall be paid by the Company in accordance with Section 7.03(d), the
Termination Fee, Expense Reimbursement or Reverse Termination Fee, as the case
may be, shall be paid as directed in writing by Parent or the Company, as
applicable, in immediately available funds promptly following (and in any
event within two (2) Business Days after) the date of the event giving rise to
the obligation to make such payment. In the event that the Company or Parent,
as applicable, shall fail to pay the Termination Fee, Expense Reimbursement
or Reverse Termination Fee required pursuant to this Section 9.03 when due,
such Termination Fee, Expense Reimbursement or Reverse Termination Fee, as the
case may be, shall accrue interest for the period commencing on the date such
Termination Fee, Expense Reimbursement or Reverse Termination Fee, as the
case may be, became past due, at the rate of interest per annum equal to the
"Prime Rate" as set forth on the date such payment became past due in _The
Wall Street Journal_  "Money Rates" column plus 350 basis points. In
addition, if the Company or Parent, as applicable, shall fail to pay such
Termination Fee, Expense Reimbursement or Reverse Termination Fee, as the case
may be, when due, the Company shall also pay to Parent, or Parent shall pay
to the Company, as applicable, all of Parents costs and expenses (including
attorneys fees) incurred by such other party in connection with efforts to
collect such Termination Fee, 

 



\- 68 -   Expense Reimbursement or Reverse Termination Fee, as the case may be. For
the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, in no event will the Company or Parent, as
applicable, be obligated to pay the Termination Fee, the Expense Reimbursement
or Reverse Termination Fee, as the case may be, on more than one occasion.

Section 9.04 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto
by action taken by their respective boards of directors (or similar governing
bodies or entities) at any time prior to the Effective Time; _provided,
however_ , that, after Company Stockholder Approval has been obtained, no
amendment may be made without further stockholder approval which, by Law or in
accordance with the rules of the NYSE, requires further approval by such
stockholders. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in
writing signed by the parties hereto.

Section 9.05 _Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the Company,
on the one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, may (a) extend
the time for the performance of any obligation or other act of the other
party, (b) waive any inaccuracy in the representations and warranties of the
other party contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and
(c) waive compliance with any agreement of the other party or any condition
to its own obligations contained herein. Any such extension or waiver shall be
valid if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by the Company or Parent
(on behalf of Parent and Merger Sub). The waiver by any party hereto of a
breach of any provision hereunder shall not operate or be construed as a
waiver of any prior or subsequent breach of the same or any other provision
hereunder. The failure of any party to assert any of its rights under
this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of those rights.

\- 70 -  Section 10.03 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or
public policy or the application of this Agreement to any person or
circumstance is invalid or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the Transactions is not affected in any manner materially adverse
to any party. To such end, the provisions of this Agreement are agreed to be
severable. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner
in order that the Transactions be consummated as originally contemplated to
the fullest extent possible.

 

Section 10.04 _Entire Agreement; Assignment_. This Agreement, together with
the Confidentiality Agreement and the Company Disclosure Schedule, constitute
the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter
hereof, and supersede all prior agreements and undertakings, both written and
oral, among the parties, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter
hereof. This Agreement shall not be assigned, whether pursuant to a merger, by
operation of law or otherwise.

 

Section 10.05 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event any provision of this Agreement
were not performed in accordance with the terms hereof and that money damages
would not be a sufficient remedy for any breach of this Agreement, and
accordingly, the parties hereto shall be entitled to specific performance of
the terms hereof, in addition to any other remedy at law or equity (and each
party hereby waives any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in
connection with such remedy).

 

Section 10.06 _Parties in Interest_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto, and nothing in this
Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other
Person any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by
reason of this Agreement, other than the provisions of Section 7.06
(which are intended to be for the benefit of the persons covered thereby or
the persons entitled to payment thereunder and may be enforced by such
persons). With respect to any claim, suit, action or proceeding of any kind or
description, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or
otherwise, involving any lender, arranger, underwriter, agent or other
financing source which is providing, or has at any time agreed or committed to
provide, any financing with respect to the Transactions or any affiliate
thereof (each a " _Financing Party_ ") arising out of or relating to the
Transactions, any financing therefor or the performance of obligations or
services with respect thereto, each party hereto agrees (a) that such claims,
suits, actions or proceedings shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction
of the state and federal courts sitting in Delaware, (b) that it shall not
bring or permit any of its affiliates to bring or support anyone else in
bringing any such claim, suit, action or proceeding in any other court and (c)
to waive (and by its execution hereof it hereby waives) any right to trial by
jury in respect of any such claim suit, action or proceeding. The
parties hereto further agree that the Financing Parties (i) shall be subject
to no liability or claims arising from this Agreement or the Transactions,
(ii) shall be beneficiaries of all limitations on remedies and damages in this
Agreement that apply to Parent and (iii) are express third party
beneficiaries of this Section (which may not be changed as to any Financing
Party without its prior written consent).

 



\- 71 -  Section 10.07 _Governing Law; Forum_.

 

(a) All disputes, claims or controversies arising out of or relating to this
Agreement, or the negotiation, validity or performance of this Agreement, or
the Transactions contemplated hereby shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware without regard to its rules
of conflict of laws.

 

(b) All actions and proceedings arising out of or relating to this Agreement
shall be heard and determined in the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware (or, only if the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware declines
to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any federal court within the
State of Delaware). The parties hereby (i) submit to the
exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or,
only if the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware declines to accept
jurisdiction over a particular matter, any federal court within the State of
Delaware) for the purpose of any Action arising out of or relating to this
Agreement brought by any party and (ii) irrevocably waive, and agree not to
assert by way of motion, defense, or otherwise, in any such Action, any claim
that it is not subject personally to the jurisdiction of the above-named
courts, that its property is exempt or immune from attachment or execution,
that the Action is brought in an inconvenient forum, that the venue of the
Action is improper, or that this Agreement or the Transactions may not be
enforced in or by any of the above-named courts. Each of the parties hereto
agrees that mailing of process or other papers in connection with any action
or proceeding in the manner provided in Section 10.02 or such other manner as
may be permitted by law shall be valid and sufficient service of process.

Section 10.08 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY
WAIVES TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE
TO A TRIAL BY JURY WITH RESPECT TO ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY
ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR
THE TRANSACTIONS. Each of the parties (a) certifies that no representative,
agent or attorney of any other party has represented, expressly or otherwise,
that such other party would not, in the event of litigation, seek to enforce
that foregoing waiver and (b) acknowledges that it and the other hereto have
been induced to enter into this Agreement and the Transactions, as applicable,
by, among other things, the mutual waivers and certifications in this Section
10.08.

 

Section 10.09 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed and delivered
(including by facsimile or other form of electronic transmission) in two (2)
or more counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate
counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original
but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.

[THE REMAINDER OF THIS PAGE IS INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK]

 



\- 72 -  IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company have caused this
Agreement to be executed as of the date first written above by their
respective officers thereunto duly authorized.
