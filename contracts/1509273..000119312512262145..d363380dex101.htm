THIS STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT (this " _Agreement_ ") is dated as of June 5,
2012 (the " _Agreement Date_ ") and is made by and among CandJ SPEC-RENT
SERVICES, INC., an Indiana corporation (" _Buyer_ "), CASEDHOLE HOLDINGS,
INC., a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "), the shareholders of the
Company listed on the signature pages hereto (the " _Selling Shareholders_ "),
and the option holders of the Company listed on the signature pages hereto
(the " _Option Holders_ " and, collectively with the Selling Shareholders,
the " _Sellers_ "). Buyer, the Company and each Seller may be referred to
herein individually as a " _Party_ ," and collectively as the " _Parties_."

 

RECITALS

WHEREAS, the Company, through its Subsidiaries, is engaged in the business of
providing cased-hole wireline and other complementary services, including
pump-down and pressure testing, to customers in the oil and gas industry.

WHEREAS, the Sellers are (i) the record holders and beneficial owners of all
of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company (the "
_Shares_ ") and (ii) the holders of all outstanding options to purchase shares
of Company Common Stock granted under the Company Option Plan (" _Company
Options_ "). On the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, (i)
Buyer desires to purchase and acquire from the Selling Shareholders, and the
Selling Shareholders desire to sell and transfer to Buyer, all of the Shares
(the " _Acquisition_ "), and (ii) the Company and the Option Holders desire to
provide for the termination of the Company Options held by the Option Holders.

 

WHEREAS, the Parties desire to make the representations, warranties,
covenants, and agreements set forth in this Agreement and also to prescribe
various conditions to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the representations, warranties,
covenants, and agreements set forth herein, and for other good and valuable
consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged,
and on the terms and subject to the conditions hereinafter set forth, each of
the Parties, intending to be legally bound hereby, agrees as follows:

ARTICLE I

DEFINITIONS

 

1.1 _Definitions_. Unless otherwise expressly provided to the contrary in this
Agreement, capitalized terms used herein shall have the meanings set forth in
_Exhibit A_ hereto.

ARTICLE II

 

SALE AND TRANSFER OF THE SHARES

2.1 _The Shares_. Subject to and in accordance with the terms and conditions
set forth in this Agreement, at the Closing, each Selling Shareholder shall
sell, transfer, assign, and deliver to Buyer, and Buyer shall purchase from
each Selling Shareholder, such Selling Shareholders right, title, and
interest in and to the number of Shares set forth opposite such Selling
Shareholders name in _Schedule 2.1_ of the Company Disclosure Schedules. 2.2 _Purchase Price_.

 

(a) The aggregate consideration to be paid by Buyer to the Sellers in
connection with the purchase by Buyer of the Shares and the termination of
the Company Options shall be an amount equal to: (i) $272,466,938, _plus_ (ii)
the CapEx Expenditures/Payments, _plus_ (iii) the Closing Cash, if any,
_minus_ (iv) the Closing Debt, if any,  _minus_ (v) the Unpaid Company
Transaction Costs, if any, _plus_ (vi) the amount, if any, by which the Net
Working Capital is greater than the Working Capital Requirement, _minus_ (vii)
the amount, if any, by which the Net Working Capital is less than the Working
Capital Requirement, _plus_ or _minus_ , as applicable, (viii) the CapEx
Double Count Adjustment, if any (collectively, the " _Purchase Price_ "). The
estimate of the Purchase Price calculated pursuant to _Section 3.1_ (the "
_Pre-Adjustment Purchase Price_ ") shall be increased or decreased after the
Closing pursuant to _Sections 3.2_ and _3.3_.

 

(b) Each Option Holder hereby agrees with the Company and Buyer that,
effective immediately prior to the Closing, each outstanding Company Option
held by such Option Holder shall terminate and be of no further force or
effect and, in exchange for such termination, such Option Holder shall be
entitled to receive in respect of each such Company Option held by such Option
Holder a portion of the Purchase Price equal to (i) the portion of the
Purchase Price that such Option Holder would have been entitled to receive if
such Option Holder had exercised the Company Option in full immediately prior
to Closing and transferred all of the shares acquired thereunder to Buyer at
Closing, reduced by (ii) the aggregate exercise price of such Company Option
(the " _Option Payments_ "). Each Option Holder shall receive, at Closing from
the Closing Date Payment, a portion of such Option Holders Option Payment
set forth on _Schedule 2.2(b)_ , which Schedule shall (A) be prepared by the
Sellers Representative and delivered to the Option Holders and Buyer at least
one Business Day prior to the Closing and (B) indicate, for each Option
Holder, the portion of such Option Holders Option Payment that is to
constitute part of the respective Escrow Amounts deposited into the respective
Escrow Funds at Closing. At Closing, the appropriate party, that being Buyer,
the Company, the Sellers Representative, or the Escrow Agent (the "
_Withholding Party_ "), shall deduct and withhold from the Option Payments
deliverable at Closing to any Option Holder such amount of Taxes as the
Withholding Party reasonably determines that it is required to deduct and
withhold with respect to such Option Payments in accordance with applicable
Legal Requirements; _provided_ , _however_ , that the determination of such
amount of Taxes to deduct and withhold at Closing with respect to such Option
Payments shall be made by reference to the entire amount of any such Option
Holders Option Payment (including the portion of any such Option Holders
Option Payment that constitutes part of the Escrow Amounts deposited into the
Escrow Funds at Closing). Any such amount of Taxes deducted and withheld from
Option Payments shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement and the
Escrow Agreement as having been delivered and paid to such Option Holders in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made. Each Option Holder
hereby agrees to make an election under Section 83(b) of the Code with the
Internal Revenue Service within thirty (30) days from the Closing Date with
respect to the portion of such Option Holders Option Payments that constitute
part of the Escrow Amounts deposited into the Escrow Funds at Closing.

 

(c) Each Seller agrees that the portion of the Escrow Funds to which such
Seller is entitled upon any disbursement of Escrow Funds to the Sellers shall
be equal to such Sellers Pro Rata Percentage.

ARTICLE III

 

PURCHASE PRICE ADJUSTMENT

3.1 _Pre-Adjustment Purchase Price Statement_. At least one Business Day prior
to Closing, the Company shall deliver to Buyer (a) the Companys good faith
estimates of (i) the Purchase Price, (ii) the CapEx Expenditures/Payments,
(iii) the Closing Cash, if any, (iv) the Closing Debt, if any, (v) the

 



\- 2 -   Unpaid Company Transaction Costs, if any, and (vi) the Net Working Capital
(the " _Estimated Net Working Capital_ "), and (b) the consolidated balance
sheet of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as of 11:59 p.m. on the
date immediately preceding the Closing Date (the " _Pre-Adjustment Purchase
Price Statement_ "). Buyer shall promptly provide the Company with notice of
any disputes to the Pre-Adjustment Purchase Price Statement, describing its
objections with reasonable detail and specificity, and the Parties shall in
good faith attempt to resolve any disputes as promptly as practicable. If any
such disputes are resolved prior to the Closing, then the Pre-Adjustment
Purchase Price Statement shall be adjusted to reflect the resolution of such
disputed items. In the event any disputes remain unresolved immediately prior
to the Closing, Buyer shall accept the unresolved amounts as initially set
forth in the Pre-Adjustment Purchase Price Statement as delivered by the
Company, _provided_ that the aggregate amount of unresolved disputes which
will be included in the Pre-Adjustment Purchase Price Statement may not
exceed $3,000,000, with all such unresolved disputes (including any excess
over such amount) being fully and finally resolved in the Final Adjustment
Amount as provided below.

3.2 _Final Adjustment Amount_. The Parties hereby covenant and agree as
provided in this _Section 3.2_ and _Sections 3.3_ and _3.4_ with respect to
the adjustment of the Purchase Price following the Closing:

(a) As promptly as practicable after the Closing (but in no event later than
90 days after the Closing Date), Buyer shall cause the Company to prepare and
deliver to the Sellers Representative a balance sheet of the Company and its
Subsidiaries prepared as of 11:59 p.m. on the date immediately preceding the
Closing Date (the " _Final Balance Sheet_ "), and a statement (the " _Post-
Closing Statement_ ") which shall set forth in reasonable detail and
specificity its calculation of the following: (i) the Purchase Price, (ii)
the CapEx Expenditures/Payments, (iii) the Closing Cash, if any, (iv) the
Closing Debt, if any, (v) the Unpaid Company Transaction Costs, if any, (vi)
the Net Working Capital based on the Final Balance Sheet (the " _Final Net
Working Capital_ "), and (vii) the CapEx Double Count Adjustment, if any. The
Final Balance Sheet shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP and, to the
extent consistent with GAAP, using the same accounting methods, policies,
practices, principles and procedures with consistent classifications,
judgments and methodologies as were used in connection with preparing the
Interim Balance Sheet, shall include all accounting entries and adjustments
required in a year end closing of the books. The Post-Closing Statement will
be prepared based upon the information set forth in the Final Balance Sheet
and in a manner consistent with the preparation of the Pre-Adjustment Purchase
Price Statement. 

(b) Following the delivery of the Final Balance Sheet to the Sellers
Representative, Buyer and the Company shall provide the Sellers
Representative and its designees reasonable access during normal business
hours to all personnel, materials, books and records of the Company, including
such supporting schedules, analyses, workpapers, and other underlying records
or documentation as are reasonably necessary and appropriate for the Sellers
Representative to verify the Final Balance Sheet, the Post-Closing Statement
and the amount of the Final Net Working Capital. Buyer and the Company
shall reasonably cooperate with the Sellers Representative and its designees
in such examination, including providing answers to questions asked by the
Sellers Representative or its designees, and Buyer and the Company shall make
available to the Sellers Representative and its designees any records that
are requested by the Sellers Representative and its designees as promptly as
practicable.

(c) The calculation of the Final Balance Sheet, the Post-Closing Statement and
the amount of the Final Net Working Capital submitted by Buyer to the Sellers
Representative shall become final and binding upon the Parties 30 days
following the Sellers Representatives receipt thereof (the " _Review Period_
"), unless the Sellers Representative, within the Review Period, has
delivered to Buyer written notice (the " _Objection Notice_ ") of its
objections with reasonable detail and specificity to the Final Balance Sheet,
the Post-Closing Statement or the amount of the Final Net Working Capital, in
which case 

 



\- 3 -   the Final Balance Sheet, the Post-Closing Statement and the amount of the
Final Net Working Capital shall not be binding upon the Parties and such
dispute shall be resolved pursuant to  _Section 3.2(d)_; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that any item or amount contained in the Final Balance Sheet, the
Post-Closing Statement or the calculation of the Final Working Capital that is
not a Disputed Item (as defined below) shall be binding upon the Parties.

(d) After the receipt of the Objection Notice by Buyer, the Sellers
Representative and Buyer shall meet by telephone, or at a mutually agreeable
location, to discuss and attempt to reconcile their differences with respect
to the disputed items set forth in the Objection Notice (the " _Disputed
Items_ "). If the Sellers Representative and Buyer are unable to mutually
resolve each of the Disputed Items within 15 days after receipt of the
Objection Notice by Buyer, then no later than the second Business Day after
the expiration of such 15 day period the Sellers Representative and Buyer
shall each propose to the other at least one nationally recognized accounting
firm that does not have an existing relationship with Buyer or Sellers
Representative, as applicable, and Buyer and the Sellers Representative
shall attempt to agree on one such mutually acceptable nationally recognized
accounting firm (an " _Accounting Firm_ ") to be engaged to resolve such
Disputed Items that remain in dispute following such 15 day period for
resolution; _provided_ , _however_ , if the Sellers Representative and Buyer
have not agreed upon an Accounting Firm within seven days after either party
first proposes an Accounting Firm for such Disputed Items, one Accounting
Firm shall be chosen by each of the Sellers Representative and Buyer and the
two Accounting Firms so chosen will finally select an Accounting Firm to
resolve such Disputed Items (such Accounting Firm, as finally
selected pursuant to the foregoing procedures, the " _Independent Accountant_
"). The Independent Accountant: (i) will be jointly engaged by Buyer and the
Sellers Representative; (ii) will be provided, within three Business Days of
accepting the engagement, with a definitive written statement from the
Sellers Representative and Buyer of their respective positions with respect
to the unresolved Disputed Item(s); (iii) will be advised in the engagement
letter that the Parties accept the Independent Accountant as the appropriate
Person to interpret this _ARTICLE III_ for all purposes relevant to the
resolution of the unresolved Disputed Item(s); (iv) will be granted
reasonable access during normal business hours to all materials, books and
records and personnel of the Company; and (v) will have 30 days to carry out a
review, interview Buyers representatives and the Sellers Representative and
prepare a written statement of its decision regarding the unresolved Disputed
Item(s) and its determination of the Final Net Working Capital, the CapEx
Expenditures/Payments, the Closing Cash, the Closing Debt, the Unpaid Company
Transaction Costs, and the CapEx Double Count Adjustment, as the case may be,
based upon its decision regarding such Disputed Item(s). For the avoidance of
doubt, the Independent Accountant shall not be requested to, nor shall the
Independent Accountant make any determination, with respect to any item
reflected in the Final Balance Sheet or the Post-Closing Statement that is not
a Disputed Item submitted to the Independent Accountant in accordance with
this _Section 3.2(d)_ (which includes any Disputed Item that is resolved
during the 15 day period following Buyers receipt of the Objection Notice).
The Sellers Representative and Buyer will each be provided the opportunity to
present to the Independent Accountant any material such Party deems relevant
to the determination. In resolving any unresolved Disputed Item, the
Independent Accountant may not assign a value to any item greater than the
highest value for such item claimed by either Party or less than the
lowest value for such item claimed by either Party. The decision of the
Independent Accountant shall be final and binding upon the Parties and shall
be in substitution for and precludes the bringing of any Proceedings in any
court in connection with the resolution of any Disputed Item(s) under this
_Section 3.2(d)_. The fees and expenses of the Independent Accountant
incurred in resolving the Disputed Items(s) shall be shared equally by Buyer,
on the one hand, and the Sellers, on the other hand, in accordance with each
Sellers Pro Rata Percentage.

3.3 _Final Purchase Price_. Immediately after the Final Balance Sheet and the
Post-Closing Statement becomes final and binding upon the Parties in
accordance with _Section 3.2(c)_ or _3.2(d)_ , the Parties shall determine
the final Purchase Price using the amounts set forth in the Post-Closing
Statement (as such Post-Closing Statement is adjusted to reflect the
resolution of any disputes in accordance with _Section 3.2(c)_ or _3.2(d)_ ).

 



\- 4 -  3.4 _Final Payment_. On the fifth Business Day after the determination of the
final Purchase Price pursuant to this _ARTICLE III_ (the " _Adjustment
Payment Date_ "):

(a) if the final Purchase Price is less than the Pre-Adjustment Purchase
Price, then the Sellers Representative and Buyer shall issue joint written
instructions directing the Escrow Agent to pay to Buyer from the Adjustment
Escrow Fund, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account
specified in writing by Buyer, an amount equal to such difference plus
interest at the Agreed Rate from (and including) the Closing Date to (but
excluding) the date paid (the " _Shortfall_ "); _provided_ , that if the
Shortfall is less than the amount held in the Adjustment Escrow Fund, the
Sellers Representative and Buyer shall also simultaneously issue joint
written instructions directing the Escrow Agent to pay to the Sellers
Representative the excess of the amount held in the Adjustment Escrow Fund
over the Shortfall; _provided_ , _further_ that in the event the Adjustment
Escrow Amount is not sufficient to satisfy the Shortfall, then the Sellers
Representative and Buyer shall issue joint instructions directing the Escrow
Agent to pay to Buyer the entire amount of the Adjustment Escrow Fund and the
amount equal to the Shortfall less the Adjustment Escrow Amount from the
Indemnity Escrow Fund, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the
account specified in writing by Buyer; and

(b) if the final Purchase Price is greater than the Pre-Adjustment Purchase
Price, then (i) Buyer shall pay to the Sellers, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the account(s) specified in writing by the

such payment or acceleration of vesting is "reasonable compensation" for
services performed or to be performed in the future.

Affiliates, the Company, or any Company Subsidiary to, (i) amend any Tax
Return of the Company or any Company Subsidiary that covers a Tax period

Period, in each case without the prior written consent of the Sellers

except as otherwise provided in _Section 7.7(d)_, be determined as follows:

 

(i) In the case of any real property, personal property, ad valorem and
similar Taxes (" _Property Tax_ "), the amount of such Property Tax
attributable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period of such Straddle Period shall be
deemed to be the amount of such Property Tax for the entire Straddle Period,
multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in
such Straddle Period ending on and including the Closing Date, and the
denominator of which is the number of total days in the entire Straddle
Period.

 

(ii) In the case of all other Taxes not described in _Section 7.7(c)(i)_
(which, for the avoidance of doubt, includes any Tax based on income, sales,
revenue, production or similar items), the amount any such Tax that is
attributable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period of such Straddle Period shall be
determined based on an interim closing of the books as of and including the
Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that exemptions, allowances or
deductions that are calculated on an annual basis (including depreciation and
amortization deductions) shall be allocated between the Pre-Closing Tax
Period of such Straddle Period and the remainder of such Straddle Period in
proportion to the number of days in the Pre-Closing Tax Period of such
Straddle Period and the number of days in the remainder of such Straddle
Period.

 

(d) _Deductions for Option Payments_. Notwithstanding anything contained in
this Agreement to the contrary, unless otherwise required by applicable Legal
Requirements, any Tax deductions attributable to or arising from the Option

Purchase Price) received by Buyer, the Company, any Company Subsidiary or any
of their respective Affiliates shall be for the account of the Sellers. Any
such amount (including any interest thereon, net of any Taxes) shall be paid
by Buyer to the Sellers Representative within five days after any such

Notwithstanding the foregoing, any and all refunds or credits attributable to
any loss or credit in a Tax period (or portion of a Straddle Period)
beginning after the Closing Date applied (e.g., as a carryback) to income in a
Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be for the account of Buyer. For the avoidance of
doubt, this _Section 7.7(e)_ does not require the Sellers to be compensated

thereof) of the respective Tax period, and to abide by all record retention
agreements entered into with any Tax Authority, and (ii) to give the Sellers
Representative reasonable written notice prior to transferring, destroying, or

records. Each Party further agrees, upon reasonable request by another Party,

Sellers Representative shall keep Buyer reasonably informed regarding the
progress and substantive aspects of the Pre-Closing Tax Contest, (B) Buyer may

written materials prepared in connection with the Pre-Closing Tax Contest and
the right to attend any conferences relating thereto, and (C) the Sellers

covering any Straddle Period, any Tax Contest that is not a Pre-Closing Tax

has not assumed its right to control and defend such Pre-Closing Tax Contest
as contemplated by _Section 7.7(g)(ii)_ (an " _Other Tax Contest_ ") with
counsel (including, for the avoidance of doubt, accountants) of its choice,

 



\- 28 -    _provided_ , that, with respect to any Tax items in the Other Tax Contest

right to attend and participate in any conferences relating thereto, and (C)

file, or cause to be filed, all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation

reasonable efforts to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Transfer Taxes.

and pension and welfare and other benefits and compensation under plans,
programs and arrangements, which in the aggregate will provide base salary or
wages, cash bonus opportunity, and pension and welfare and other benefits
and compensation to the employees in the aggregate which, taken together, are
substantially comparable, in the aggregate, to the base salary or wages, cash
bonus opportunity, and pension and welfare and other benefits and compensation
(excluding equity-based awards) provided to such employees in the aggregate
under the Company Benefit Plans on the Agreement Date; _provided_ , _however_
, that (subject to compliance with the foregoing provisions of this _Section
7.8(a)_) nothing herein shall prevent the amendment or termination of any
benefit or compensation plan, program or arrangement maintained by Buyer or
its Affiliates or interfere with the right or obligation of Buyer or its
Affiliate to make such changes to such plans, programs or arrangements as are
necessary to conform with applicable Legal Requirements; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that Buyer shall not be obligated to provide such substantially
comparable levels of base salary or wages, cash bonus opportunities, and
pension and welfare and other benefits compensation to the extent the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, fail to perform at similar
levels of profitability and productivity as they performed at Closing. 

 



\- 29 -  (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained herein shall (i) be
treated as an amendment of any particular Company Benefit Plan or any

independently, or in connection with any reduction in the size of the
Companys or any of the Company Subsidiaries work force occurring within the
90-day period prior to the Closing Date, could be construed as a "plant
closing" or "mass layoff," as those terms are defined in the WARN Act, Buyer
shall be solely responsible for providing any notice required by the WARN Act

Representative pursuant to the terms of _ARTICLE III_ or this _Section 11.7_
or otherwise in connection with this Agreement, including the hiring of legal
counsel and the incurring of legal fees and costs (" _Representative Expenses_
"), shall be the responsibility of the Sellers. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the Sellers Representative shall have full
power and authority to interpret all the terms and provisions of this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, and to consent to any amendment hereof or
thereof, on behalf of all the Sellers and their respective heirs, successors
and assigns.

(b) The Sellers Representative shall keep the Sellers reasonably informed of
any (i) post-Closing adjustments contemplated by _ARTICLE III_ and
indemnification claims by any Buyer Indemnified Person pursuant to this
_ARTICLE XI_ , including any suits, actions, arbitrations, settlements or
compromises of, and orders of courts with respect to, such indemnification
claims, and (ii) claims against third parties that the Sellers Representative
becomes aware any of the Sellers may have in respect of any Damages recovered
by a Buyer Indemnified Person hereunder. At the written request of any
Seller, and to the extent not prohibited from doing so by Contract, Legal
Requirement or order of a Governmental Entity, the Sellers Representative
shall make available to such Seller copies of any pleadings,
notices, demands, claims and similar written instruments with respect to any
of the matters described in clauses (i) and (ii) above.

(c) The Sellers hereby appoint the Sellers Representative the true and lawful
attorney-in-fact of the Sellers, with full power in their name and on their
behalf to act according to the terms of this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement, to reimburse themselves, to pay to the Sellers any amounts paid to
the Sellers Representative from the Escrow Funds or other amounts paid to the
Sellers Representative pursuant to _ARTICLE III_ , and in general to do all
things and to perform all acts including executing and delivering the Escrow
Agreement and any other agreements, certificates, receipts, instructions,
notices or instruments contemplated by or deemed advisable in connection with
the Escrow Agreement. This power of attorney is coupled with an interest and
all authority hereby conferred is granted and shall be irrevocable and shall
not be terminated or affected by subsequent disability or incapacity of any
Seller or by any act of any Seller or by operation of law, whether by such
persons death (unless the Sellers Representative has actual knowledge of
such persons death), disability, protective supervision or any other event.
Without limiting the foregoing, this power of attorney is to ensure the
performance of a special obligation and, accordingly, each Seller shall be
deemed to have waived and renounced its, his or her right to renounce this
power of attorney unilaterally any time before the six month anniversary
following the termination of the Escrow Agreement. Each Seller shall be deemed
to have waived any and all defenses that may be available to contest, negate
or disaffirm the action of the 

 



\- 42 -   Sellers Representative taken in good faith under this Agreement or the
Escrow Agreement. Notwithstanding the power of attorney granted in this
_Section 11.7_, no agreement, instrument, acknowledgement or other act or
document shall be ineffective solely by reason of a Seller (instead of the
Sellers Representative) having signed or given the same directly.

 

(d) The provisions of this _Section 11.7_ shall in no way impose any
obligations on Buyer. In particular, notwithstanding any notice received by
Buyer to the contrary, Buyer shall be fully protected in relying upon and
shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall have no liability to the Sellers
with respect to actions, decisions or determinations of the
Sellers Representative. Buyer shall be entitled to assume that all actions,
decisions and determinations of the Sellers Representative are fully
authorized.

11.8 _Defense of Third-Party Claims_.

(a) Subject to the provisions hereof, the Indemnitor on behalf of the
Indemnitee shall have the right, but not the obligation, to elect to defend
any Third-Party Claim, and the costs and expenses incurred by the Indemnitor
in connection with such defense (including attorneys fees, other
professionals and experts fees and court or arbitration costs) shall be paid
by the Indemnitor.

(b) The Indemnitee shall give prompt written notice of any Third-Party Claim
to the Indemnitor; _provided_ that the failure to timely give the Notice of
Claim shall not limit or reduce the Indemnitees right to indemnity hereunder
unless (and then only to the extent that) the Indemnitor is actually
prejudiced thereby. The Indemnitor shall be entitled to assume the defense
thereof, including to settle such Third-Party Claim subject to the
requirements of _Section 11.8(d)_, utilizing legal counsel reasonably
acceptable to the Indemnitee.

(c) If the Indemnitor has the right to and does elect to defend any Third-
Party Claim, the Indemnitor shall: (i) notify Indemnitee within 15 days of
receipt of the Notice of Claim that it will defend such Third-Party Claim;
(ii) conduct the defense of such Third-Party Claim with reasonable diligence
and act affirmatively to keep the Indemnitee reasonably informed of material
developments in the Third-Party Claim at all stages thereof; (iii) promptly
submit to the Indemnitee copies of all pleadings, responsive pleadings,
motions and other similar legal documents and papers received or filed in
connection therewith; (iv) promptly respond to all reasonable requests by
Indemnitee relating thereto and otherwise permit the Indemnitee and its
counsel to participate in, but not control, the conduct of the defense
thereof; and (v) to the extent practicable in the circumstances, permit the
Indemnitee and its counsel an opportunity to review and comment upon all legal
papers to be submitted prior to their submission. Buyer, the Company and the
Sellers Representative will make available to each other and each others
counsel and accountants, without charge (other than any applicable third party
costs) all of its or their books and records (or portions thereof) that
relate to the Third-Party Claim, and each Party will render to the other Party
such assistance as may be reasonably required in order to insure the proper
and adequate defense thereof and shall furnish such records, information
and testimony and attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings,
trials and appeals as may be reasonably requested by the other Party in
connection therewith. The Indemnitor and the Indemnitee shall use their
reasonable best efforts, at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnitor, to
avoid production of confidential information (consistent with applicable Legal
Requirements and subject to a Partys right to waive its own privilege), and
seek to cause all communications among employees, counsel and others
representing any Party to a Third-Party Claim to be made so as to preserve any
applicable attorney-client or work-product privileges. Once the Indemnitor has
made the election to defend as set forth above, the Indemnitee shall have the
right to participate in any such defense and to employ separate counsel of its
choosing at its sole cost and expense; _provided_ , that if (i) the Indemnitee
shall have been advised by counsel in writing that there are legal defenses
available to the Indemnitee that are not available to, or in conflict with,
those of the Indemnitor, (ii) the Indemnitor shall authorize the Indemnitee in
writing to employ separate counsel at the 

 



\- 43 -   Indemnitors expense, or (iii) Indemnitor is not actively and reasonably
diligently defending such Third Party Claim with legal counsel reasonably
acceptable to Indemnitee, then the expenses of such counsel shall be
considered Damages. The assumption of the defense of any such Third-Party
Claim by the Indemnitor shall be an acknowledgement of the obligation of the
Indemnitor to indemnify the Indemnitee with respect to such claim hereunder.
If the Indemnitor fails or refuses to provide the defense notice within 15
days after receipt of a Notice of Claim, the Indemnitee shall have the sole
and exclusive right to undertake the defense, compromise and settlement of
such claim with counsel of its own choosing and the reasonable attorneys
fees and expenses incurred by the Indemnitee for such counsel will be included
in the Indemnitees Damages; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Indemnitees Damages shall not, in connection with any Proceeding or separate
but substantially similar Proceedings arising out of the same allegations,
include the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys at
any time for all Indemnitees, except to the extent that local counsel, in
addition to its regular counsel, is required in order to effectively defend
against such Proceeding. No compromise or settlement of such claim by the
Indemnitee shall be binding on the issue of whether, or the extent to which,
the Indemnitee may be entitled to indemnification hereunder, and the
Indemnitee shall not consent to the entry of any judgment or settle any claim
without the written consent of Indemnitor, such consent not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

(d) If the Indemnitor has the right to and does elect to defend any Third-
Party Claim, the Indemnitor shall not have the right to enter into any
settlement of a Third-Party Claim on the Indemnitees behalf without the
consent of the Indemnitee, which will not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed unless (i) in the case of a claim by a Buyer
Indemnified Person, the amount to be paid by the Indemnitee as a result of
such settlement does not exceed the balance of the funds then on deposit in
the Indemnity Escrow Fund (after taking into account any other outstanding
claims) from which such claim shall be paid, (ii) such settlement does not
involve any finding or admission of any violation of law or any injunctive or
other form of non-monetary relief binding upon the Indemnitee or any of
its Affiliates, officers, directors and agents, other than reasonable
confidentiality obligations related to the terms of such settlement, and (iii)
such settlement expressly and unconditionally releases the Indemnitee and its
Affiliates and such other Persons from all liabilities and obligations with
respect to such claim, and includes the giving by the claimant to the
Indemnitee of a release in respect thereof, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnitee, of any further liability, at law, in equity
or otherwise.

(e) The provisions of this _Section 11.8_ shall not apply to Tax Contests,
which shall be governed by the provisions of _Section 7.7(g)_.

11.9 _Mitigation_. Each Indemnitee shall be obligated in connection with any
claim for indemnification under this _ARTICLE XI_ to use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain any insurance proceeds available to such
Indemnitee with regard to the applicable claims under the Indemnitees
insurance policies or pursue any Tax benefits with regard to the applicable
claims. The amount of Damages paid by an Indemnitor to an Indemnitee pursuant
to this _ARTICLE XI_ shall be reduced (or reimbursed, if already paid) in the
amount of (a) any insurance proceeds actually received by the Indemnitee with
respect to such Damages (net of any costs and expenses, self-insured
retentions and retroactive premium adjustments incurred in connection with the
realization or receipt of such payment) under any applicable insurance
policies of the Indemnitee, but only to the extent the receipt of such
insurance proceeds does not result in any additional insurance premium or cost
to the Indemnitee, or (b) any Tax benefits realized by the Indemnitee with
respect to such Damages. Nothing in this Agreement shall in any way limit the
Indemnitors ability to defend against the Indemnitees recovery of Damages
that are caused or exacerbated by or attributable to (i) the actions of the
Indemnitee or (ii) the failure of the Indemnitee to mitigate any Damages in
accordance with applicable Legal Requirements.

Disclosure Schedules for which applicability of such information and

document prepared in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby

document, including a document sent by facsimile transmission or by email in
portable document format (pdf), shall have the same effect as if such Party
had executed and delivered an original of this Agreement, any such
Transaction Document or any such other document. Minor variations in the form
of the signature page, including footers from earlier versions of this
Agreement, any Transaction Document or any such other document, shall be
disregarded in determining the Partys intent or the effectiveness of such
signature.

 



\- 46 -  12.4 _Entire Agreement; Parties in Interest_. This Agreement, the
Confidentiality Agreement and the documents and instruments and other
agreements specifically referred to herein or delivered pursuant hereto,
including all the Exhibits, the Schedules, and the Company Disclosure
Schedules, (a) constitute the entire agreement among the Parties with respect
to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, among the Parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof and (b) are not intended to confer, and shall not be
construed as conferring, upon any Person other than the Parties any rights or
remedies hereunder; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) the Company officers,
directors and employees are intended third-party beneficiaries of  _Sections
7.8_ and _7.9_ and (ii) the Buyer Indemnified Persons and the Seller
Indemnified Persons are intended third-party beneficiaries of _ARTICLE XI_.

12.5 _Assignment_. Prior to the Closing, neither this Agreement nor any of the
rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement may be assigned or
delegated, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise by any of
the Parties without the prior written consent of the Company, the Sellers
Representative and Buyer, and any such assignment without such prior written
consent shall be null and void. From and after the Closing, neither this
Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement
may be assigned or delegated, in whole or in part, by operation of law or
otherwise by any of the Parties without the prior written consent of the Buyer
and the Sellers Representative, and any such assignment without such prior
written consent shall be null and void. Subject to the preceding sentences,
this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be
enforceable by, the Parties and their respective successors and permitted
assigns.

12.6 _Severability_. In the event that any provision of this Agreement, or
the application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this
Agreement shall continue in full force and effect and shall be interpreted so
as reasonably to effect the intent of the Parties. The Parties shall use all
reasonable efforts to replace such void or unenforceable provision of this
Agreement with a valid and enforceable provision that shall achieve, to the
extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of such void or
unenforceable provision.

12.7 _Remedies; Specific Performance_. The Parties agree that irreparable
damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement
were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached. Each Party agrees that, in the event of any breach or threatened
breach by any other Party of any covenant or obligation contained in this
Agreement, the non-breaching Party shall be entitled (in addition to any other
remedy that may be available to it whether in law or equity, including
monetary damages, except as limited by _Section 10.2_ and _ARTICLE XI_ ) to
seek and obtain without interference or challenge from the other Party (a) a
decree or order of specific performance to enforce the observance and
performance of such covenant or obligation and (b) an injunction restraining
such breach or threatened breach. In circumstances where Buyer, the Company or
any Seller is obligated to consummate the Acquisition and the Acquisition has
not been consummated (other than as a result of the other Partys refusal to
close in violation of this Agreement), each of Buyer, the Company and the
Sellers expressly acknowledges and agrees that the other Parties and their
equityholders shall have suffered irreparable harm, that monetary damages
will be inadequate to compensate such other Parties and equityholders and that
such other Parties on behalf of themselves and their equityholders shall be
entitled to enforce specifically Buyers, the Companys or the Sellers, as
the case may be, obligation to consummate the Acquisition. For the avoidance
of doubt, under the terms of the immediately preceding sentence the Company
and the Sellers shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement by Buyer or to enforce specifically the terms and

 



\- 47 -   provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches of or enforce compliance
with those covenants of Buyer in any court in the United States or any state
having jurisdiction, subject to  _Section 12.9_, this being in addition to
any other remedy to which the Company and the Sellers may be entitled at law
or in equity. Each of Buyer, the Sellers and the Sellers Representative
hereby agrees not to raise any objection to the availability of the equitable
remedy of specific performance to prevent or restrain breaches of or
threatened breaches of this Agreement by the other Parties and to specifically
enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches of or
threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and
obligations of the other Parties under this Agreement. Each Party further
agrees that no other Party or any other Person shall be required to obtain,
furnish or post any bond or similar instrument in connection with or as a
condition to obtaining any remedy referred to in this _Section 12.7_, and
each Party irrevocably waives any right it may have to require the obtaining,
furnishing or posting of any such bond or similar instrument.

12.8 _Choice of Forum._ Any dispute, controversy, claim, or action
arising out of or relating to this Agreement and any documents contemplated
hereby, each as amended from time to time, including regarding the validity or
effect of this Agreement or the performance, breach, validity, interpretation,
application, or termination hereof, and any of the transactions contemplated
hereunder, but excluding a dispute, controversy or claim governed by _ARTICLE
III_ , shall be brought in the federal or state courts located in the City of
Houston, State of Texas. Each of the Parties (a) irrevocably submits to the
exclusive jurisdiction of each such court in any such dispute, controversy,
claim, or action, (b) waives any objection it may now or hereafter have to
venue or to an inconvenient forum, (c) agrees that all such disputes,
controversies, claims, and actions shall be heard and determined only in such
courts, and (d) agrees not to bring any dispute, controversy, claim, or action
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any documents contemplated
hereby or any of the transactions contemplated hereunder in any other court.

12.9 _Governing Law._ This Agreement and the legal relations between the
Parties with respect hereto shall be governed by and construed in accordance
with the domestic laws of the State of Texas without regard or giving effect
to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of such state or
any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any
jurisdiction other than such state.

12.10 _Interpretation_. Unless expressly provided for elsewhere in this
Agreement, this Agreement shall be interpreted in accordance with the
following provisions:

 

(a) Whenever the context may require, any pronoun used in this Agreement shall
include the corresponding masculine, feminine or neuter forms, and the
singular form of nouns, pronouns and verbs shall include the plural and vice
versa.

shall mean "including, without limitation".

(k) The Exhibits, Company Disclosure Schedules and Annexes attached to this
Agreement are incorporated herein by reference and made a part of this
Agreement.

(l) The parties have participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of
this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly
by the parties and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or
disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any of the provisions of
this Agreement.

 

(m) The word "or" will have the inclusive meaning represented by the phrase
"and/or".

 

(n) "Shall" and "will" have equal force and effect.

Business Day.

specified as a "Business Day." 

(s) Time periods within or following which any payment is to be made or act is
to be done shall be calculated by excluding the day on which the time period
commences and including the day on which the time period ends and by extending
the period to the next Business Day following if the last day of the time
period is not a Business Day.

 



\- 49 -  (t) The phrase "Material Adverse Effect on the Company and its Subsidiaries"
or "Material Adverse Effect on the Company and the Company Subsidiaries"
means a Material Adverse Effect on the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
