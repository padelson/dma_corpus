Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to respond to such inquiries. If the Representative has any objections to the Closing Statement, the Representative shall deliver to the
Parent a written statement setting forth its objections in reasonable detail, indicating each disputed item or amount and the basis for its disagreement therewith (an &#147;<U>Objections Statement</U>&#148;). If an Objections Statement is not
delivered to the Parent within forty-five (45)&nbsp;days following the date of delivery of the Closing Statement, the Closing Statement shall be final, binding and non-appealable by the Parties. The Representative and the Parent shall negotiate in
good faith to resolve any such objections, but if they do not reach a final resolution within fifteen (15)&nbsp;days after the delivery of the Objections Statement, the Representative and the Parent shall submit such dispute to the New York City
office of Grant Thornton, LLC, or if they are not independent pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission at the time, another nationally recognized independent accounting firm reasonably acceptable to the Parent
and the Representative (the &#147;<U>Dispute Resolution Arbiter</U>&#148;). Any further submissions to the Dispute Resolution Arbiter must be written and delivered to each party to the dispute. The Dispute Resolution Arbiter shall consider only
those items and amounts that are identified in the Objections Statement as being items which the Representative and the Parent are unable to resolve. The Dispute Resolution Arbiter&#146;s determination shall be based solely on the definitions of
Cash, Indebtedness, Net Working Capital, or Transaction Expenses contained herein and the provisions of this Agreement, including this <U>Section&nbsp;1.08</U>. The Representative and the Parent shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to
cause the Dispute Resolution Arbiter to resolve all disagreements as soon as practicable in amounts between the disputed amounts set forth in the Closing Statement and the Objections Statement. Further, the Dispute Resolution Arbiter&#146;s
determination shall be based solely on the presentations by the Parent and the Representative that are in accordance with the terms and procedures set forth in this Agreement (i.e., not on the basis of an independent review). The resolution of the
dispute by the Dispute Resolution Arbiter shall be final and binding on and <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-appealable</FONT> by the Parties hereto. The costs and expenses of the Dispute Resolution Arbiter shall be allocated by the Dispute
Resolution Arbiter between the Parent, on the one hand, and the Representative (on behalf of the Securityholders), on the other hand, based upon the percentage that the portion of the contested amount not awarded to each Party bears to the amount
actually contested by such Party. For example, if the Representative claims Closing Cash Consideration is $1,000 greater than the amount determined by the Parent, and the Parent contests only $500 of the amount claimed by the Representative, and if
the Dispute Resolution Arbiter ultimately resolves the dispute by awarding the Representative (for the benefit of the Securityholders) $300 of the $500 contested, then the costs and expenses of arbitration shall be allocated sixty percent
