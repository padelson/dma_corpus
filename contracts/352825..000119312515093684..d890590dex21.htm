iv AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 

THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this " _Agreement_ "), dated as of March
13, 2015, is made by and among IOS Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation
(the " _Company_ "), L. B. Foster Company, a Pennsylvania corporation (the "
_Parent_ "), L. B. Foster Raven Merger Company, a Delaware corporation and
wholly owned subsidiary of the Parent (the " _Merger Sub_ "), and IOS Holding
Company, LLC, solely in its capacity as the representative for the Companys
shareholders (the " _Representative_ "). The Parent, the Merger Sub and the
Company, and, solely in its capacity as and solely to the extent applicable,
the Representative, shall be referred to herein from time to time as a "
_Party_ " and collectively as the " _Parties_ ". Capitalized terms used and
not otherwise defined herein have the meanings set forth in _Article XI_
below.

WHEREAS, the Parent desires to acquire one hundred percent (100%) of the
issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company in a reverse
subsidiary merger transaction on the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth herein;

 

WHEREAS, the boards of directors of the Company, the Parent and the Merger Sub
have each (i) determined that the Merger is fair, advisable and in the best
interests of their respective companies and stockholders and (ii) approved
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger,
upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein; and

WHEREAS, the boards of directors of each of Company and the Merger Sub have
determined to recommend to their respective stockholders the approval and
adoption of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including
the Merger.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants contained herein and
other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which
are hereby acknowledged, the Parties agree as follows:

 

ARTICLE I

_THE MERGER_

1.01 _The Merger_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, at the Effective Time, the
Merger Sub shall merge (the " _Merger_ ") with and into the Company in
accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the "
_DGCL_ "), whereupon the separate existence of the Merger Sub shall cease, and
the Company shall be the surviving company (the " _Surviving Company_ ").

(b) At the Closing, the Company and the Merger Sub shall cause a certificate
of merger substantially in the form of  _Exhibit A_ hereto (the "
_Certificate of Merger_ ") to be executed, acknowledged and filed with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and make all other filings or
recordings required by the DGCL in connection with the Merger. The Merger
shall become effective at such time as the Certificate of Merger is duly filed
with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such other time as
the Parent and the Company shall agree and specify in the Certificate
of Merger (the " _Effective Time_ "). (c) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Company shall succeed to
all the assets, rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises of and
be subject to all of the Liabilities, restrictions, and duties of the Company
and the Merger Sub, all as provided under the DGCL.

 

1.02 _Effect on Capital Stock_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
of this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without
any action on the part of the holders thereof:

(a) Each share of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time (other than Excluded Shares and Dissenting Shares) shall be
converted into the right to receive, at the times, and subject to the terms,
set forth in this Agreement, an amount in cash equal, without interest, to the
sum of: 

(i) the Per Share Closing Cash Consideration; and

 

(ii) the Per Share Additional Merger Consideration.

 

The aggregate consideration to which holders of Common Stock become entitled
pursuant to this _Section 1.02(a)_ is referred to herein as the " _Common
Stock Merger Consideration_ ".

(b) Each share of Common Stock, if any, held immediately prior to
the Effective Time by the Parent, the Merger Sub or the Company shall be
canceled and no payment shall be made with respect thereto (" _Excluded
Shares_ ").

 

(c) Each share of common stock of the Merger Sub that is issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted
into and become one (1) validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share
of common stock of the Surviving Company.

1.03 _Effect on Options_.

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, at the
Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further action on the
part of the Company or of any Securityholder, (i) each Option that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that is not an In-the-
Money Option shall automatically be canceled and extinguished, no longer be
outstanding and cease to represent the right to acquire shares of Common
Stock, without any payment of any consideration therefor; and (ii) each In-
the-Money Option, whether or not then vested or exercisable, shall
automatically be canceled and extinguished, no longer be outstanding and
cease to represent the right to acquire shares of Common Stock, and in
consideration therefor, the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive an
amount in cash, without interest, equal to the Option Consideration. The
Company shall, prior to the Effective Time, take all actions as are reasonably
necessary in order to effectuate the actions contemplated by this _Section
1.03_ and to ensure that no holder of Options shall have any rights from and
after the Effective Time with respect to any Options except as expressly
provided in this _Section 1.03_, _provided_ that such actions shall expressly
be conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger and each of the other
transactions contemplated hereby and shall be of no force or effect if this
Agreement is terminated.

 



2 (b) The Closing Option Consideration payable to the holders of In-the-Money
Options pursuant to  _Section 1.03(a)_ above shall be paid through the
Companys payroll system promptly following the Effective Time (and in any
event within five (5) Business Days following the Closing Date), and Parent
and the Representative shall make arrangements to cause any remaining portion
of the Option Consideration payable to the holders of In-the-Money Options to
be paid in accordance with their respective Optionholder Percentages through
the Surviving Companys payroll system promptly (and in any event within five
(5) Business Days) following each such time as any such Option Consideration
becomes payable to such holder, if any.

 

1.04 _Exchange of Common Stock_. The Parent shall effect the exchange of cash
for the shares of Common Stock that are outstanding as of immediately prior
to the Effective Time and entitled to payment pursuant to _Section 1.02_. In
connection with such exchange, prior to Closing the Parent shall provide each
holder of Common Stock with a Letter of Transmittal, reasonably acceptable to
the Company and Parent, in substantially the form of _Exhibit C_ hereto (each,
a " _Letter of Transmittal_ "). Each holder of Common Stock outstanding as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time may deliver a duly executed and
completed Letter of Transmittal together with a duly endorsed stock
certificate representing the Common Stock, and, after the Effective Time, the
Parent shall promptly deliver or cause to be delivered to such holder a wire
transfer in an amount equal to the amount of cash to which such holder is
entitled under _Section 1.02_ to the account(s) designated by such holder in
such holders Letter of Transmittal; _provided_ , that the Parent shall
deliver or cause to be delivered such amounts on the Closing Date to any
holder of Common Stock that has delivered a duly executed and completed Letter
of Transmittal, together with the applicable duly endorsed stock certificates,
to the Parent on the Closing Date. Except as provided in the Escrow Agreement
with respect to the Escrow Amount, in no event shall any holder of Common
Stock who delivers a Letter of Transmittal be entitled to receive interest on
any of the funds to be received in the Merger. Any Common Stock held by a
Common Shareholder that has delivered a Letter of Transmittal to the Parent
pursuant to this _Section 1.04_ shall not be transferable on the books of the
Company without the Parents prior written consent. At the Effective Time,
the share transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and thereafter there
shall be no further registration of transfers of Common Stock theretofore
outstanding on the records of the Company. From and after the Effective
Time, the holders of the shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto
except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or by Law. On or after the
Effective Time, any shares of Common Stock presented to the Surviving Company
or the Parent along with a properly executed Letter of Transmittal and duly
endorsed stock certificate shall solely evidence the right to receive the
consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to _Section 1.02_ without
any interest thereon. In the event that any certificates, to the extent such
shares of Common Stock are certificated, have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
such holder of Common Stock shall also be required to deliver a customary
affidavit and indemnity against any claim that may be made against the
Surviving Company (in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent).

 



3 1.05 _Organizational Documents_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the Parent, the Merger Sub, the
Company or the holders of any shares of capital stock of any of the foregoing,
the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Company shall be amended and
restated in its entirety in form and substance reasonably acceptable to
Parent and the Company, until thereafter amended, subject to _Section 6.03_,
in accordance with the provisions thereof and the DGCL. At the Effective Time,
the bylaws of the Surviving Company shall be amended and restated to be in
form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Company, until
thereafter amended, subject to _Section 6.03_, in accordance with the
provisions thereof, the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Company
and the DGCL.

1.06 _Directors and Officers_. From and after the Effective Time, until
successors are duly elected, appointed or otherwise designated in accordance
with applicable Law, the directors of the Merger Sub at the Effective Time
shall be the directors of the Surviving Company, and the officers of the
Merger Sub at the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving
Company, each such initial director and initial officer to hold office in
accordance with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving
Company as in effect from and after the Effective Time.

 

1.07 _Closing Calculations_. Prior to the anticipated Closing Date and
following reasonable consultation with Parent, the Company shall deliver to
the Parent, together with the Closing Date Payment Schedule, a statement,
prepared in good faith, setting forth (a) an estimated consolidated balance
sheet of the Group Companies as of the Reference Time, (b) a good
faith calculation of the Companys estimate of Cash (the " _Estimated Cash_
"), Indebtedness (the " _Estimated Indebtedness_ "), Net Working Capital (the
" _Estimated Net Working Capital_ ") and Transaction Expenses (" _Estimated
Transaction Expenses_ "), and (c) the Closing Cash Consideration, the Per
Share Closing Cash Consideration, the aggregate Closing Option Consideration
(the " _Estimated Closing Statement_ "). The Estimated Closing Statement and
the determinations contained therein shall be prepared in accordance with this
Agreement.

1.08 _Final Closing Balance Sheet Calculation_. As promptly as possible, but
in any event within ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, the Parent shall
deliver to the Representative (a) a consolidated balance sheet of the Group
Companies as of the Reference Time (the " _Closing Balance Sheet_ ") and (b)
a statement showing the Cash, Indebtedness, Net Working Capital, and
Transaction Expenses (the " _Closing Statement_ "). The Closing Balance Sheet
shall be prepared and Cash, Indebtedness, Net Working Capital, and
Transaction Expenses shall be determined in accordance with this Agreement.
The Parties agree that the purpose of preparing the Closing Balance Sheet and
determining Cash, Indebtedness, Net Working Capital, and Transaction Expenses
and the related purchase price adjustment contemplated by this _Section 1.08_
is to measure the amount of Cash, Indebtedness, changes in Net Working
Capital, and Transaction Expenses calculated in accordance with the
Accounting Principles. After delivery of the Closing Statement, the
Representative and its accountants and other representatives shall be
permitted full access at reasonable times to review the Surviving Companys
and its Subsidiaries books and records and any work papers, in each case,
related to the preparation of the Closing Statement. The Representative and
its accountants and other representatives may make inquiries of the Parent
regarding questions concerning or disagreements with the Closing Statement
arising in the course of their review thereof, and the

 



4  Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to respond to such
inquiries. If the Representative has any objections to the Closing Statement,
the Representative shall deliver to the Parent a written statement setting
forth its objections in reasonable detail, indicating each disputed item or
amount and the basis for its disagreement therewith (an " _Objections
Statement_ "). If an Objections Statement is not delivered to the Parent
within forty-five (45) days following the date of delivery of the Closing
Statement, the Closing Statement shall be final, binding and non-appealable by
the Parties. The Representative and the Parent shall negotiate in good faith
to resolve any such objections, but if they do not reach a final resolution
within fifteen (15) days after the delivery of the Objections Statement, the
Representative and the Parent shall submit such dispute to the New York
City office of Grant Thornton, LLC, or if they are not independent pursuant
to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission at the
time, another nationally recognized independent accounting firm reasonably
acceptable to the Parent and the Representative (the " _Dispute Resolution
Arbiter_ "). Any further submissions to the Dispute Resolution Arbiter must be
written and delivered to each party to the dispute. The Dispute Resolution
Arbiter shall consider only those items and amounts that are identified in
the Objections Statement as being items which the Representative and the
Parent are unable to resolve. The Dispute Resolution Arbiters determination
shall be based solely on the definitions of Cash, Indebtedness, Net Working
Capital, or Transaction Expenses contained herein and the provisions of this
Agreement, including this _Section 1.08_. The Representative and the Parent
shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Dispute
Resolution Arbiter to resolve all disagreements as soon as practicable in
amounts between the disputed amounts set forth in the Closing Statement and
the Objections Statement. Further, the Dispute Resolution
Arbiters determination shall be based solely on the presentations by the
Parent and the Representative that are in accordance with the terms and
procedures set forth in this Agreement (i.e., not on the basis of an
independent review). The resolution of the dispute by the Dispute Resolution
Arbiter shall be final and binding on and non-appealable by the Parties
hereto. The costs and expenses of the Dispute Resolution Arbiter shall be
allocated by the Dispute Resolution Arbiter between the Parent, on the one
hand, and the Representative (on behalf of the Securityholders), on the other
hand, based upon the percentage that the portion of the contested amount not
awarded to each Party bears to the amount actually contested by such Party.
For example, if the Representative claims Closing Cash Consideration is $1,000
greater than the amount determined by the Parent, and the Parent contests only
$500 of the amount claimed by the Representative, and if the Dispute
Resolution Arbiter ultimately resolves the dispute by awarding the
Representative (for the benefit of the Securityholders) $300 of the $500
contested, then the costs and expenses of arbitration shall be allocated sixty
percent (60%) (i.e., 300 ÷ 500) to the Parent and forty percent (40%) (i.e.,
200 ÷ 500) to the Representative (for the benefit of the Securityholders).

 

1.09 _Post-Closing Adjustment Payment_.

 

(a) If the Final Cash Consideration is greater than the Closing Cash
Consideration, the Parent shall promptly (but in any event within two (2)
Business Days) pay to (A) the Representative (for distribution to the Common
Shareholders in accordance with the updated payment schedule as contemplated
by Section 1.14) the Common Shareholder Percentage, with respect to
each holder of Common Stock that has previously delivered a duly executed
Letter of Transmittal (together with a duly endorsed certificate representing
the shares of Common Stock owned by such Person), of the amount of such
difference by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
designated in writing by the Representative to the

 



5  Parent and (B) the Surviving Company (for distribution to the holders of the
In-the-Money Options pursuant to _Section 1.03(b)_) the Optionholder
Percentage of the amount of such difference by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account designated in writing by the Surviving Company.

(b) If the Final Cash Consideration is less than the Closing Cash
Consideration, the Parent and the Representative (on behalf of the
Securityholders) shall promptly (but in any event within two (2) Business
Days) deliver a joint written instruction to the Escrow Agent to pay to the
Parent out of the funds held in the Adjustment Escrow Account, the absolute
value of such difference by wire transfer of immediately available funds to
one (1) or more accounts designated by the Parent to the Representative. In
the event that the funds available in the Adjustment Escrow Account are
insufficient to make the entire payment, the Representative, on behalf of all
Securityholders, shall promptly pay the remaining amount to Parent.

 

(c) The Parent and the Representative shall make commercially reasonable
efforts to comply with the timing requirements set forth in  _Section 1.08_
hereof, but, in the absence of bad faith, neither Party shall be deemed to be
in breach of this Agreement, or to have waived its rights hereunder, on the
basis of not satisfying the timing requirements set forth therein. 

(d) _Exhibit B_ sets forth an illustrative statement (the " _Reference
Statement_ ") prepared in good faith by the Company in cooperation with the
Parent setting forth the various line items used (or to be used) in, and
illustrating as of the date set forth therein, the calculation of Cash,
Indebtedness and Net Working Capital prepared and calculated in accordance
with this Agreement.

1.10 _Escrow Account_. At the Closing, pursuant to _Section 2.02(c)_, the
Parent shall deduct from the Merger Consideration and deposit (i) $1,100,000
(such amount the " _Indemnity Escrow Amount_ ") in immediately available funds
into an escrow account (the " _Indemnity Escrow Account_ "), (ii) $2,500,000
(such amount the " _Adjustment Escrow Amount_ ") in immediately available
funds into an escrow account (the " _Adjustment Escrow Account_ "), (iii)
$4,000,000 (such amount the " _Special Escrow Amount_ ") in immediately
available funds into an escrow account (the " _Special Escrow Account,_ " and
together with the Indemnity Escrow Account and the Adjustment Escrow Account,
the " _Escrow Accounts_ "), each such account to be established and
maintained by the Escrow Agent pursuant to the terms and conditions of an
escrow agreement reasonably acceptable to the Parent and the Representative,
to be entered into on the Closing Date by the Parent, the Representative and
the Escrow Agent (the " _Escrow Agreement_ "). The Indemnity Escrow Account
shall serve as a security for, and a source of payment of, Parents, Merger
Subs and the other Parent Indemnified Parties rights pursuant to this
Agreement, including _Article VIII_ , if any, the Adjustment Escrow Account
shall serve as security for, and a source of payment of, Parents and Merger
Subs rights pursuant to _Section 1.09_ and the Securityholders payment
obligations pursuant to _Section 10.03(b)_, if any, and the Special Escrow
Account shall serve as security for, and the sole source of payment of,
indemnification pursuant to _Section 8.02(ii)_.

  



6 1.11 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary and to the extent available under Section 262 of the DGCL, any share
of Common Stock that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and that is held by a Common Shareholder who did not consent to
or vote (by a valid and enforceable proxy or otherwise) in favor of the
approval of this Agreement, which Common Shareholder complies with all of the
provisions of the DGCL relevant to the exercise and perfection of dissenters
rights (such share being a " _Dissenting Share_ ," and such Common
Shareholder being a " _Dissenting Stockholder_ "), shall not be converted into
the right to receive the consideration to which the holder of such share would
be entitled pursuant to  _Section 1.02_ but rather shall be converted into
the right to receive such consideration as may be determined to be due with
respect to such Dissenting Share pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL. If any
Dissenting Stockholder fails to perfect such stockholders dissenters rights
under the DGCL or effectively withdraws or otherwise loses such rights with
respect to any Dissenting Shares, such Dissenting Shares shall thereupon
automatically be converted into the right to receive the consideration
referred to in _Section 1.02_, pursuant to the exchange procedures set forth
in _Section 1.04_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, if the Merger is rescinded or abandoned, then the right of a
stockholder to be paid the fair value of such holders Dissenting Shares
pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL shall cease. Promptly upon receipt, the
Company shall give the Parent (a) notice of any demand for payment of the
fair value of any shares of Common Stock or any attempted withdrawal of any
such demand for payment and any other instrument served pursuant to the DGCL
and received by the Company relating to any stockholders dissenters rights
and (b) the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings
with respect to any such demands for payment under the DGCL. Prior to the
Closing, the Company shall not voluntarily make any payment with respect to
any demand for appraisal with respect to any Dissenting Shares without the
prior written consent of the Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
conditioned, withheld or delayed). Within five (5) Business Days following
the date of this Agreement, the Company shall deliver in any manner permitted
by applicable Law the notice required pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL to
each holder of record of Common Stock that has not voted in favor of the
Merger and is entitled to such notice under the DGCL.

1.12 _Tax Withholding_. Parent, the Companies and the Surviving Company shall
be entitled to deduct and withhold, and shall be entitled to cause the Escrow
Agent to deduct and withhold, from the amounts otherwise payable pursuant to
this Agreement, such amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld
with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any other
applicable Law relating to any Tax. To the extent that amounts are so
deducted, withheld and paid over to the relevant taxing authority, such
deducted and withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction
and withholding was made.

1.13 _Unclaimed Merger Consideration_.

(a) Neither the Parent or the Surviving Company shall be liable to any Person
with respect to any portion of the consideration that is properly paid to any
Governmental Entity pursuant to any applicable abandoned property law, escheat
law or similar Law. If any Common Stock shall not have been surrendered prior
to the date which is six (6) months after the Effective Time (or immediately
prior to such earlier date on which any consideration pursuant hereto would
otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Authority),
any such consideration in respect thereof shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Company, free and clear
of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 



7 (b) At any time following the date which is six (6) months after the Closing
Date, Parent or the Surviving Company shall be entitled to require the
Representative to deliver to it any funds (including any interest or other
amounts earned with respect thereto) that had been made available to the
Representative for payment of the Merger Consideration or any and which have
not been disbursed to Securityholders, and thereafter, subject to the time
limitations in Section 1.13(a), such holders shall be entitled to look only to
the Surviving Company (subject to abandoned property, escheat or similar
Laws) as general creditors thereof with respect to the payment of any Merger
Consideration that may be payable upon surrender of any Common Stock, as
determined pursuant to this Agreement, without any interest thereon.

 

1.14 _Closing Date Payment Schedule_.

 

(a) Prior to the Closing Date and concurrently with the delivery of the
Estimated Closing Statement, following reasonable consultation with Parent,
the Company and the Representative shall prepare and deliver to Parent the
Closing Date Payment Schedule, certified by the Chief Financial Officer of the
Company. Additionally, at any other time Securityholders are entitled to
receive a payment under this Agreement, the Representative shall deliver to
Parent at least five (5) Business Days prior to the date on which such payment
is due to be made, an updated payment schedule with the detail of such
additional payments, in each case, in accordance with the manner set forth
above and as contained in the Closing Date Payment Schedule.

(b) With respect to each payment of cash that each Securityholder is entitled
to receive under this Agreement, the parties agree that the Representative
shall round such payment to the nearest cent (with $.005 being rounded up) and
compute such amount after aggregating the payment due at such time to each
such Securityholder.

(c) Parent and Merger Sub shall be entitled to rely conclusively on the
Closing Date Payment Schedule (and subsequent updates) in making payments
under this Agreement and Parent and Merger Sub shall not be responsible for
the calculations or the determinations in such Closing Date Payment Schedule.

 

1.15 _Reserved_.

1.16  _Earn-Out Payment_.

(a) _Payment and Definitions_.

 

(i) On the terms and subject to the provisions hereof, including the timing
and manner of payment contemplated by this  _Section 1.16(a)(i)_, the Parent
shall pay to the Securityholders (in accordance herewith) an aggregate amount
(the " _Earn-Out Payment_ ") equal to the dollar amount set forth opposite the
applicable Company Cumulative EBITDA (as defined below) as set forth on
_Schedule 1.16(a)(i)_ attached hereto, based on the actual Company Cumulative
EBITDA as of December 31, 2017. In

 



8  the event that Company Cumulative EBITDA is less than the lowest Company
Cumulative EBITDA number on _Schedule 1.16(a)(i)_ , the Earn-Out Payment shall
be equal to zero. In the event that Company Cumulative EBITDA is in between
two (2) of the target numbers set forth on _Schedule 1.16(a)(i)_ , the Earn-
Out Payment shall be an amount in between the two (2) corresponding payment
numbers set forth on _Schedule 1.16(a)(i)_ determined on a straight-line
basis.

(ii) " _Company Cumulative EBITDA_ " shall mean the cumulative consolidated
net income of the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries (the " _Stand-Alone
Business_ ") for the three-year period ended December 31, 2017 (the " _Earn-
Out Period_ "), before deducting any amounts in respect of interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization, in each case as those items are calculated in
accordance with the GAAP, as determined based on Parents audited financial
statements, but in all cases subject to the adjustments and provisions set
forth below. Company Cumulative EBITDA shall be calculated in a manner
consistent with the sample calculation attached hereto as _Schedule
1.16(a)(ii)_ and the other applicable provisions of this Agreement.

 

(iii) The following items will not be taken into account in the calculation of
Company Cumulative EBITDA:

 

(A) all general administrative overhead costs, expenses or charges incurred by
Parent or the Stand-Alone Business, including all (1) management or similar
fees or other corporate charges and (2) costs, expenses and charges related to
(x) employees providing joint or shared services to the Stand-Alone Business
and Parent or any of its other Affiliates, and (y) space or facilities shared
or jointly used by the Stand-Alone Business and Parent or any of its
Affiliates; _provided_ , that, specific administrative and operating expenses
that are solely for the benefit of the Surviving Company (or its
Subsidiaries) that are directly incurred by the Stand-Alone Business or
otherwise paid by Parent (or an Affiliate of Parent) and allocated to the
Surviving Company (or its Subsidiaries) shall be taken into account in the
calculation of Company Cumulative EBITDA subject to any other applicable
exclusions or adjustments set forth herein;

(B) all non-cash expenses, charges, losses or other Liabilities related to
(1) the write-down or write-off of any intangible asset of the Surviving
Company (or its Subsidiaries) as a result of the impairment thereof; (2) non-
cash compensation expenses and (3) purchase accounting adjustments;

(C) expenses, charges or other losses (i) incurred in connection with matters
relating to this Agreement (including, without limitation, the preparation
and completion of the Closing Statement or the EBITDA Statement or litigation
or other costs arising out of disputes relating to this Agreement) or (ii) for
which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Company and
its Subsidiaries) have received insurance coverage or indemnity, contribution
or any similar recovery (it being understood and agreed that Parent shall, or
shall cause its applicable Subsidiaries to, use commercially reasonable
efforts to pursue any such coverage or recovery to which such party is
entitled); or

 



9 (D) any extraordinary gain or loss, including (without limitation) any gain or
loss from any sale, exchange, or other disposition of assets (tangible or
intangible) outside of the ordinary course of business.

(iv) The determination of Company Cumulative EBITDA shall take into account
all recurring operating and administrative expenses undertaken by the
Surviving Company or any of its Subsidiaries in order to comply with
applicable Laws, including securities Laws that are applicable to publicly
traded corporations.

(b) _EBITDA Statement_.

 

(i) Within thirty (30) days after the issuance of audited financial statements
of Parent (on a consolidated basis) for the fiscal year ended December 31,
2017, but in no event later than April 30, 2018, Parent shall deliver to the
Representative a statement of Company Cumulative EBITDA (the " _EBITDA
Statement_ "), including a calculation of the amount of the Earn-Out Payment,
in each case accompanied by reasonable supporting or underlying documentation
used in preparation thereof, including the stand-alone consolidated balance
sheet and statements of operations and cash flows for the fiscal years ended
December 31, 2015, December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2017 of the Stand-Alone
Business.

 

(ii) During the forty-five (45) day period following the delivery of the
EBITDA Statement, the Representative and its accountants and other advisors
and representatives shall be permitted reasonable access at reasonable times
to review the Surviving Companys and its Subsidiaries books and records and
any work papers (subject to the receipt by the disclosing party of a standard
non-disclosure agreement), in each case, related to the preparation of the
EBITDA Statement. The Representative and its accountants and other
representatives may make inquiries of the Parent and the Surviving
Company regarding questions concerning or disagreements with the EBITDA
Statement arising in the course of their review thereof. Within forty-five
(45) days following delivery by Parent of the EBITDA Statement, the
Representative shall deliver written notice to Parent stating whether it
accepts or disputes the accuracy of the calculations reflected in the EBITDA
Statement. If the Representative accepts the calculations reflected in the
EBITDA Statement or if the Representative does not notify Parent of a dispute
with respect to the EBITDA Statement within such forty-five (45) day period,
then the calculation of the Earn-Out Payment (prepared in accordance with this
_Section 1.16(b)_) shall be deemed final, conclusive and binding on the
parties and the Securityholders in all respects, subject to clause (iv) below.
Any dispute by the Representative with respect to the calculation of
Cumulative Company EBITDA shall be resolved, _mutatis mutandis_ , in the
time and manner specified for the resolution of any dispute concerning the
Closing Statement as set forth in _Section 1.08_. For the avoidance of doubt,
the foregoing shall not limit or restrict any Party to this Agreement from
undertaking any Action in accordance with _Section 12.16_ that arises from
or alleges any breach or violation of this Agreement (including, without
limitation, any breach or violation of the provisions of this _Section 1.16_
).

 



10 (iii) Within five (5) Business Days following the final resolution of
the Earn-Out Payment, Parent shall pay an amount equal to the finally
determined Earn-Out Payment to the Securityholders in accordance with the
mechanism for the payment of the Post-Closing Adjustment Payment as set forth
in _Section 1.09(a)_. 

(iv) Parent, Merger Sub and the Surviving Company make no representations or
warranties to the Representative or Securityholders regarding Company
Cumulative EBITDA, the abilities of the Stand-Alone Business to meet any
forecast or projection of Company Cumulative EBITDA or whether an Earn-Out
Payment will be payable hereunder. The Parent and the Representative shall
make commercially reasonable efforts to comply with the timing requirements
set forth in this _Section 1.16(b)_, but, in the absence of bad faith,
neither Party shall be deemed to be in breach of this Agreement, or to have
waived its rights hereunder, on the basis of not satisfying the timing
requirements set forth therein.

(c) _Annual EBITDA Statement and Meetings_. Within ninety (90) days after the
end of each calendar year through and including the calendar year ending
December 31, 2017, Parent shall deliver to the Representative a statement
containing the Company Cumulative EBITDA earned during (A) such calendar year
and (B) the period between January 1, 2015, and the end of such calendar year
(the " _Annual EBITDA Statement_ "), accompanied by reasonable supporting or
underlying documentation used in preparation thereof, including the unaudited
consolidated balance sheet and statements of operations and cash flows of the
Stand-Alone Business for the such calendar year. During the thirty (30) day
period following the delivery of each Annual EBITDA Statement, the
Representative and its accountants and other advisors and representatives
shall be provided with copies of or permitted reasonable access at reasonable
times to review the Surviving Companys and its Subsidiaries books and
records and any work papers (subject to the receipt by the disclosing party of
a standard non-disclosure agreement), in each case, related to the preparation
of the Annual EBITDA Statement. At the Representatives request, following
delivery of any Annual EBITDA Report, Parent shall cause appropriate
management personnel of Parent and the Surviving Company to attend or
participate in a meeting or teleconference to discuss such report and the
Surviving Companys operations and performance. Any such meeting shall be
scheduled at a mutually agreeable time and place.

(d)  _Ownership_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
if (x) the Parent shall cease to own and control, directly or indirectly, a
majority of each class of outstanding equity interests of the Surviving
Company or (y) the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
transfer a majority of their collective assets to a third-party in one or more
transactions (an " _IOS Sale_ "), then the determination of Company Cumulative
EBITDA, and the amount of any Earn-Out Payment, shall be calculated by
calculating the Company Cumulative EBITDA from January 1, 2015 to the date of
the IOS Sale, dividing such number by the actual number of days elapsed during
the period beginning on January 1, 2015 (inclusive) and ending on the date of
the IOS Sale (inclusive) and then multiplying such resulting number by 1,095
days. The Earn-Out Payment, if any, will then be calculated (in the manner
consistent with the last sentence of Section 1.16(a)(i)) based on such
resulting Company Cumulative EBITDA. The Earn-Out Payment shall be due and
payable immediately upon the completion of such IOS Sale in a manner
consistent with _Section 1.09(a)_.

 



11 (e) In connection with any transaction or series of transaction pursuant to
which all or substantially all of the assets of Parent and its Subsidiaries
are sold or transferred to a third party acquirer, Parent shall cause such
third party acquirer to assume all of Parents obligations under this _Section
1.16_.

 

(f) To the extent that any equity of, or any material portion of the assets
of, any "Business Unit" identified on _Schedule 1.16(a)(iii)_ is sold,
liquidated, reorganized, integrated into or with another Affiliate of the
Parent or undergoes a similar transaction or restructuring following Closing
and during the Earn-Out Period, (A) each of the Company Cumulative EBITDA
target numbers on _Schedule 1.16(a)(i)_ shall be reduced by an amount equal to
the corresponding "Business Unit EBITDA Target" set forth opposite the
applicable Business Unit on _Schedule 1.16(a)(iii)_ , and (B) such Business
Unit shall no longer be included in the Stand-Alone Business.

(g) The right to receive the Earn-Out Payment, if any, payable pursuant to
this Agreement is a contract right only and no certificate evidencing such
right shall be issued. Additionally, the right to receive the Earn-Out
Payment, if any, shall not be transferred or assigned and no beneficial
interest therein may be pledged, sold, assigned or transferred by any
Securityholder.

(h) Parent may terminate its obligations at any time by paying to
the Securityholders (in accordance with the mechanism for payment set forth
in _Section 1.09(a)_) the maximum Earn-Out Payment on _Schedule 1.16(a)(i)_.

 _REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY_

 

Except as set forth in the Disclosure Schedules, the Company represents and
warrants to the Parent and Merger Sub, as of the date hereof and as of the
Closing, as follows:

3.01 _Organization and Power_. The Company is a corporation duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the State of
Delaware, and the Company has all requisite corporate power and authority
necessary to own and operate its properties and to carry on its businesses as
now conducted, except where the failure to hold such power and authority
would not have a Material Adverse Effect. _Schedule 3.01_ sets forth each
jurisdiction in which the Company is licensed or qualified to do business, and
the Company is qualified to do business and in good standing in
every jurisdiction in which its ownership of property or the conduct of
business as now conducted requires it to qualify, except where such failure to
be so qualified would not have a Material Adverse Effect.

 

3.02 _Subsidiaries_. _Schedule 3.02_ accurately sets forth each Subsidiary of
the Company, its name, place of incorporation or formation, the jurisdictions
in which it is qualified or licensed to do business and if not wholly owned
directly or indirectly by the Company, the record ownership as of the date of
this Agreement of all capital stock or other equity interests issued thereby.
Each of the Subsidiaries identified on _Schedule 3.02_ is duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the jurisdiction of
its incorporation or organization, has all requisite corporate, or other
legal entity, as the case may be, power and authority to own and operate its
properties and to carry on its businesses as now conducted and is qualified to
do business and in good standing in every jurisdiction in which its ownership
of property or the conduct of its businesses as now conducted requires it to
qualify, except in each

 



14  such case where the failure to hold such power or authority or to be so
qualified would not have a Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries owns or holds the right to acquire any stock,
partnership interest or joint venture interest or other equity ownership
interest in any corporation, organization or entity that is not a Group
Company. All of the issued and outstanding equity interests of the
Companys Subsidiaries (a) are fully paid and non-assessable and have been
duly authorized and validly issued, (b) were not issued in violation of any
preemptive right and (c) were issued in compliance with all applicable Laws,
including federal securities Laws and any applicable state securities or
"blue sky" Laws. Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.04(b)_ , there are no
outstanding rights, options, warrants, convertible securities, subscription
rights, conversion rights, exchange rights or other agreements that require
or would require any of the Companys Subsidiaries to issue, sell or transfer
any of its equity interests or other securities. Each of the Companys
Subsidiaries has no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to repurchase,
redeem or otherwise acquire any of its outstanding equity interests.

3.03 _Authorization; No Breach; Valid and Binding Agreement_.

(a) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and each other
Ancillary Agreement by the Company and Representative and the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly and validly authorized by
all requisite corporate action, and no other corporate proceedings on its part
are necessary to authorize the execution, delivery or performance of this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements.

(b) Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.03(b)_ , and except for the filing of
the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware, the execution, delivery, performance and compliance with the terms
and conditions of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements by the
Company and Representative and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby do not and shall not (i) violate, conflict
with, result in any breach of, or constitute a default under any of the
provisions of the certificates of incorporation or bylaws (or equivalent
organizational documents) of any Group Company, (ii) require the consent,
approval or notice of, or violate, conflict with or result in a breach of or
constitute a violation or default under or create in any party the right to
accelerate, terminate or modify any Material Contract, Lease, or Permit, in
each case with or without notice or lapse of time or both, (iii) violate any
Law to which any of the Group Companies is subject, or (iv) result in the
creation or imposition of any Lien other than Permitted Liens on any
properties or assets of any Group Company, except where the failure of any of
the representations and warranties contained in clauses (ii) or (iii) above
to be true would not have a Material Adverse Effect.

(c) This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company and
the Representative and assuming that this Agreement is a valid and binding
obligation of the Parent and Merger Sub, this Agreement constitutes a valid
and binding obligation of the Company and Representative, enforceable in
accordance with its terms, except as enforceability may be limited by
bankruptcy Laws, other similar Laws affecting creditors rights and general
principles of equity affecting the availability of specific performance and
other equitable remedies. When each Ancillary Agreement to which the Company
or Representative is or will be a party has been duly executed and delivered
by the Company or Representative, as applicable (assuming due authorization,
execution and delivery by each other party thereto), such Ancillary Agreement
will constitute a legal and binding obligation of the Company or
Representative, as

 



15  applicable, enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, except as
enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy Laws, other similar Laws affecting
creditors rights and general principles of equity affecting the availability
of specific performance and other equitable remedies.

3.04 _Capitalization_.

 

(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of nine hundred

holders of outstanding Options, including the number of shares of Common Stock
subject to each such Option, the grant date, exercise price and vesting

exercisable and the date on which such Option expires. Each Option was granted
in compliance with all applicable Laws and all of the terms and conditions of
the Company Equity Plan. Each Option that is not compliant with or otherwise
exempt from Section 409A of the Code was granted with an exercise price per
share equal to or greater than the fair market value per share of the
underlying shares on the date of grant. Except for the exercise or conversion
rights that attach to the Options that are listed on _Schedule 3.04(b)_ ,
there are no shares of Common Stock or any other equity security of the
Company issuable upon conversion or exchange of any issued and outstanding
security of the Company nor are there any rights, options, subscriptions or
other commitments outstanding or other agreements to acquire shares of Common
Stock or any other equity security of the Company, or any security convertible
into or exchangeable for Common Stock or any other equity security of the
Company, nor is the Company contractually obligated to purchase, redeem or
otherwise acquire any of its outstanding shares that would survive the
Closing. No Person is entitled to any preemptive or similar rights to
subscribe for shares of Common Stock or any other equity security of the
Company that would survive the Closing.

sheet as of December 31, 2014 (the " _Latest Balance Sheet_ ") and the related
statement of income for the twelve (12) month period then ended and the
Companys audited consolidated balance sheet and statements of operations,
stockholders equity and cash flows for the fiscal years ended December 31,
2013, December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011 (collectively, the " _Financial_
 

 



16   _Statements_ "), each of which have been delivered to the Parent, have been
prepared in accordance with GAAP, consistently applied, and present fairly in
all material respects the financial condition and results of operations of
the Company on a consolidated basis, as of the times and for the periods

to (i) the absence of footnote disclosures (that if presented, would not
differ materially from those in the audited financial statements) and other
presentation items and (ii) changes resulting from normal year-end adjustments
(the effect of which would not be material). All notes and accounts
receivable reflected on the Latest Balance Sheet are valid notes and accounts

the Ordinary Course of Business since the date of the Latest Balance Sheet,
(c) incurred in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby or (d) taken into account in the Final Closing Statement.

3.07 _Title to Property_.

(a) Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.07(a)_ , each Group Company has valid
title to, or a valid leasehold interest in (or other right to use), all of
the tangible personal property shown to be owned or leased by it on the Latest
Balance Sheet or acquired following the date of the Latest Balance Sheet in
the Ordinary Course of Business, in all cases, free and clear of all Liens,
except for Permitted Liens, or inventory or other assets of immaterial amounts
or obsolete assets disposed of in the Ordinary Course of Business since the
date of the Latest Balance Sheet. The shares of capital stock of each
Subsidiary are owned by the Company (or its direct or indirect Subsidiary)
free and clear of any and all Liens. The tangible assets and properties
currently owned or leased by the Group Companies are sufficient for the
continued conduct of the business of the Group Companies after the Closing in
substantially the same manner as conducted prior to the Closing and constitute
all of the rights, property and assets necessary to conduct the business of
the Group Companies as currently conducted.

 

(b) _Schedule 3.07(b)_ sets forth a list of all real property to which any
Group Company has a valid leasehold interest (collectively, the " _Leased
Realty_ "). The Company has provided the Parent with copies of all Leases.

(c) The Company or one of its Subsidiaries possesses leasehold interests in
the Leased Realty pursuant to the leases set forth on _Schedule 3.07(b)_ ,
including all amendments, modifications and supplements thereto (the "
_Leases_ "), free and clear of any Liens except Permitted Liens. Each Lease
is in full force and effect and enforceable against the Company or its
applicable Subsidiary party to such Lease and, to the knowledge of the
Company, each other party thereto in accordance with its terms. The Leased
Realty is in all material respects in sufficient order, condition and repair
for the current conduct of the business of the Group Companies. To the
knowledge of the Company, no event has occurred or condition exists that
constitutes, or after notice or lapse of time or both would constitute, a
material default under any of the Leases. All water, sewer, gas, electric,
telephone and drainage facilities are available to and located at the Leased
Realty in a capacity so as to adequately serve the improvements currently
located thereon in a manner consistent with the normal operation of the
Companys or its Subsidiaries business.

 

(d) _Schedule 3.07(d)_ sets forth a list of all real property owned in fee
simple by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Owned
Realty_ "). Either the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company owns good and
valid title in fee simple to the Owned Realty, free and clear of all Liens,
other than Permitted Liens and Liens that will be released at or prior to the
Closing. All water, sewer, gas, electric, telephone and drainage facilities
are available to and located at the Owned Realty in a capacity so as to
adequately serve the improvements currently located thereon in a manner
consistent with the normal operation of the Companys or its Subsidiaries
business. With respect to Owned Realty, the Company has

 



19  delivered or made available to the Parent true, complete and correct copies
of the deeds and other instruments (as recorded) by which the Company acquired
such Owned Realty, and copies of all title insurance policies, opinions, and
surveys in the possession of any Group Company relating to the Owned Realty.
No Group Company is a lessor, sublessor or grantor under any sublease or other
instrument granting to any other Person any right to the possession, lease,
occupancy or enjoyment of any Leased Realty or Owned Realty.

(e) The buildings and improvements on the Leased Realty and Owned Realty are
in all material respects in good operating condition and in a state of good
working maintenance and repair, ordinary wear and tear expected, are in
compliance with all applicable building codes and are adequate and suitable
for their current uses and purposes. There are no physical conditions or
defects on any part of the Leased Realty and Owned Realty that would
materially impair or would be reasonably expected to materially impair the
continued operation of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries as
presently conducted at each such property.

3.08 _Tax Matters_.

 

(a) During the three (3) year period prior to the date hereof, the Group
Companies have timely filed all income and other material Tax Returns that
are required to be filed by them (taking into account any extensions of time
to file). All Taxes (whether or not shown as owing by the Group Companies on
all such Tax Returns) have been fully paid for all Tax periods or will be
properly accrued on the final Closing Statement and all such accruals are in
the aggregate sufficient for all such Taxes in all material respects.

 

(b) No Group Company is, as of the date hereof, the subject of a Tax audit or
examination with respect to any material Taxes of any such Group Company. No
Group Company has any current material liability for Taxes of any Person
(other than the Group Companies) (i) under Treasury Regulations Section
1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state, local or foreign Law) or (ii)
as a transferee or successor.

(c) No Group Company has been a party to a "reportable transaction," as such
term is defined in Treasury Regulations Section 1.6011-4.

(d) No claim that remains pending has been made by any Tax authority, in a
jurisdiction where any Group Company has not filed a Tax Return, that it is
or may be subject to Tax by such jurisdiction.

(e) No Group Company has distributed stock of another Person, or has had its
stock distributed by another Person, in a transaction that was purported or
intended to be governed in whole or in part by Section 355 or Section 361 of
the Code.

 

(f) Each Group Company: (i) has made or caused to be made all withholdings of
Taxes required to be made, and such withholdings have either been timely paid
to the appropriate Governmental Entity or set aside in appropriate accounts
for such purpose if such Taxes have not been required to have been paid over
to a Governmental Entity; and (ii) has otherwise satisfied in all
material respects all applicable laws and agreements with respect to the
filing of Tax Returns with and the payment of Taxes to all taxing
jurisdictions. True, correct and complete copies of the federal, state and
local real, personal property and sales Tax Returns of the Group Company for
the last three (3) complete fiscal years have been made available to the
Parent.

 



20 (g) Each Group Company has properly accrued and reflected, or will properly
accrue and reflect, as a current Liability for purposes of computing Net
Working Capital through the Closing Date, all liabilities for unpaid Taxes and
assessments which are not yet due and payable, all such accruals being in the
aggregate sufficient for payment of all such Taxes and assessments for the
period through the Closing Date.

(h) No Tax deficiencies have been proposed or threatened against any Group
Company, nor are there any agreements, waivers or other arrangements providing
for extension of time with respect to the assessment or collection of any Tax
against any Group Company or with respect to the filing of any Tax Return to a
date later than the Closing Date.

(i) No Group Company is or ever has been a member of an affiliated group of
corporations (within the meaning of Section 1504 of the Code) other than an
affiliated group, the common parent of which is the Company, or filed or been
included in a combined, consolidated or unit income or franchise Tax Return
(other than one in which the Company is the common parent). No Group Company
has made a change in the method of accounting for a taxable year beginning on
or before the Closing Date, which would require it to include any adjustment
under Section 481(a) of the Code in taxable income of any taxable year, or
portion thereof, beginning on or after the Closing Date. No Group Company has
filed a consent pursuant to Section 341(f) of the Code, or agreed to have
Section 341(f)(2) of the Code apply to any disposition of a subsection (f)
asset (as defined in Section 341(f)(4) of the Code) owned by it. No
shareholder of the Company is a "foreign person" as that term is used in
Treasury Regulation Section 1.1445-2. There is no currently effective
election to be an S corporation under Section 1362(a) of the Code with respect
to any Group Company.

(j) There are no material Liens relating to Taxes upon the assets of any
Group Company other than for Taxes not yet due and payable.

(k) No Group Company will be required as a result of any "closing agreement,"
as described in Section 7121 of the Code, to include any item of income or
exclude any item of deduction from any taxable period (or portion thereof)
beginning after the Closing.

(l) Each Group Company has withheld and remitted on a timely basis to the
appropriate Governmental Authorities in compliance with all applicable Laws
and regulations all material Taxes required to be withheld and remitted by
such Company in connection with payments made to other persons.

 

(m) No Group Company is a partner, member, owner or beneficiary of any entity
treated as a partnership or a trust for tax purposes.

 

(n) No Group Company has deferred intercompany transactions within the meaning
of Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-13, and no Group Company has an excess
loss in the stock or equity of any entity as contemplated in Treasury
Regulations Section 1.1502-19.

 



21 (o) No Group Company has taken any action that is not in accordance with past
practice that could defer a liability for Taxes of such Group Company from
any taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date to any taxable period
ending after such date. Each Group Company has at all times used the accrual
method of accounting for income Tax purposes.

(p) There is currently no limitation on the utilization of net operating
losses, capital losses, built-in losses, tax credits or similar items of any
of the Group Companies under Sections 269, 382, 383, 384 or 1502 of the Code
and the Treasury Regulations thereunder (and comparable provisions of state,
local or foreign law).

parties) for the sale of products or services that provide for annual payments
to a Group Company in excess of $1,500,000 during the trailing twelve (12)
month period ending on the date of the Latest Balance Sheet;

 

(vii) employment Contracts pursuant to which the annual base salary for an
employee is greater than $200,000 or any Contracts with an employee
containing change in control payments, excluding, in each case, Contracts with
former employees for which no Group Company has any material continuing
obligations;

 



22 (viii) Contracts for the settlement of any Action and which provide for
payments or consideration by any Group Company after the date hereof of a
value in excess of $200,000 in the aggregate;

(ix) Contracts for joint ventures, partnerships or similar material joint

the Ordinary Course of Business, any written contractual obligation (or group
of related contractual obligations) for the purchase or sale of inventory, raw
materials, commodities, supplies, goods, products, equipment or other personal
property, in each case, with any Specified Customer or Specified Supplier; or

(xvii) Contract including covenants by any Group Company not to compete or
conduct business in any territory.

(b) The Parent either has been supplied with, or has been given access to, a
true and correct copy of all written Contracts, and summaries of all oral
Contracts, that are referred to on _Schedule 3.09(a)_ (collectively, the "
_Material Contracts_ "). Each Material Contract (assuming due power and
authority of, and due execution and delivery by, the other party or parties
thereto) is valid and binding on each Group Company that is a party thereto,
as applicable, and is in full force and effect.

 

(c) No Group Company has, in any material respect, violated or breached, or
committed any default under, any Material Contract. To the knowledge of the
Company, no other Person has materially violated or breached, or committed any
material default under, any Material Contract and no event has occurred, with
the lapse of time or the giving of notice or both, that is reasonably likely
to constitute a material breach or default by such other party. No event has
occurred and is continuing through any Group Companys actions or inactions
that will result in a material violation or breach of any of the provisions of
any Material Contract.

 



23 3.10 _Intellectual Property_.

 

(a) All material patents, registrations and applications pertaining to
Intellectual Property owned by any Group Company as of the date hereof are
set forth on _Schedule 3.10(a)_. Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.10(a)_ :
(A) the Company and/or its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, own or have the
right to use all material Intellectual Property used in the operation of
the business of the Group Companies; (B) during the two (2) year period prior
to the date of this Agreement, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
has received any written notices of material infringement or misappropriation
from any third party with respect to any third party material Intellectual
Property or challenging the validity or enforceability of any Intellectual
Property of any Group Company; (C) to the Companys knowledge, no Group
Company is currently infringing on the intellectual property of any other
Person and (D) to the Companys knowledge, no Person is currently infringing
on the Intellectual Property owned by a Group Company or any Intellectual
Property that is material to the operation of the business of the Group
Companies. The Company takes commercially reasonable steps to maintain the
confidentiality of its material trade secrets.

 

(b) _Schedule 3.10(b)_ accurately identifies (A) all Intellectual Property
licensed to a Group Company, other than any non-customized software that (1)
is so licensed solely in executable or object code form pursuant to a non-
exclusive, internal use software license, (2) is not incorporated into, or
used directly in the development, manufacturing, or distribution of, any of a
Group Companys products or services, and (3) is generally available on

business of the Company and its Subsidiaries as currently conducted. No Group
Company is bound by, and no Intellectual Property owned by a Group Company is

that in any way limits or restricts the ability of a Group Company to use,
exploit, assert, or enforce any of the Intellectual Property owned by a Group
Company anywhere in the world.

 

(c) The Group Companies collection, storage, use and dissemination of any
personally identifiable information are and have been in material compliance
with all applicable Laws relating to privacy, data security and data
protection, and all applicable privacy policies and terms of use or other
contractual obligations, and there are no claims pending or, to the
Companys knowledge, threatened by any Person alleging violation by the Group
Companies of any such Laws, policies and other contractual obligations. The
Group Companies have not used open source software in any manner that does, or
would reasonably be expected to, with respect to any software included in the
Companies Intellectual Property, (i) require its disclosure or distribution
in source code form, (ii) require the licensing thereof for the purpose of
making derivative works, or (iii) impose any restriction on the consideration
to be charged for the distribution thereof.

against any Group Company or their respective properties, assets or business.
Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.11_ , no Group Company is subject to any

complete copies of all Company Plans have been provided or made available to
the Parent prior to the date hereof. The Company Plans are and have been
administered in compliance with their terms and with the requirements of
ERISA, the Code and all other applicable Laws, in each case, in all material
respects. 

(b) Each Company Plan that is intended to be qualified within the meaning of
Section 401(a) of the Code has received a favorable determination letter or
can rely on an opinion letter as to its qualification and, to the knowledge of
the Company, nothing has occurred, whether by action or failure to act, that
would reasonably be expected to cause the loss of such qualification. 

(c) With respect to each Company Plan, the Group Companies have complied, and
are now in compliance, in all material respects, with all provisions of
ERISA, the Code and all Laws applicable to such Company Plan. Each Company
Plan has been administered in all material respects in accordance with its
terms.

 

(d) There does not now exist, nor do any circumstances exist that could result
in, any Controlled Group Liability that would be a liability of the Group
Companies following the Closing. No Company Plan is (i) subject to Title IV of
ERISA or (ii) a multiemployer plan within the meaning of Section 3(37) of
ERISA, and neither any Group Company nor any member of its Controlled Group

ERISA in respect of, any such arrangement.

 



25 (e) No Company Plan is a "nonqualified deferred compensation plan" subject
to Section 409A of the Code.

(f) Except as disclosed on _Schedule 3.13(f)_ or as contemplated by _Section
1.03_, neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the

in any payment becoming due or payable, or required to be provided, to any
employee or satisfy any prerequisite to any payment or benefit to any
employee, (ii) result in the forgiveness of any indebtedness of any such
employee, (iii) increase the amount or value of any benefits or compensation

which any Group Company is a party or by which it is bound to compensate any
employee for excise Taxes paid pursuant to Section 4999 of the Code.

 

3.14 _Insurance_. _Schedule 3.14_ lists each material insurance policy
maintained by the Group Companies as of the date hereof, including the name
of the insurer, type of policy and policy number. All of the insurance
policies of the Group Companies are in full force and effect, and no Group
Company is in material default with respect to its obligations under any
insurance policies. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has
received any written notice of cancellation of, premium increase with respect
to, or alteration of coverage under, any insurance policies listed (or
required to be listed) on _Schedule 3.14_. Except as set forth on _Schedule

Environmental Laws (which compliance includes, but is not limited to, the
possession by the Company of all permits and other governmental authorizations
required under applicable Environmental Laws, and compliance with the terms
and conditions thereof), except where failure to be in compliance would not
have a Material Adverse Effect. During such period, other than such matters
that have been resolved, the Group Companies have not received any written

failure of the Company and/or its Subsidiaries to comply in any material
respect with any Environmental Law or Permit.

 



26 (b) There is no material Environmental Claim pending or, to the knowledge of

_Schedule 3.16(c)_ , to the knowledge of the Company, no above ground or

(6) year anniversary of the Closing Date, the Parent shall, and shall cause
the Surviving Company to, provide the Representative and its authorized
representatives with access (for the purpose of examining and copying at the
Representatives expense), during normal business hours, upon reasonable
notice, to the books and records of the Group Companies with respect to
periods or occurrences prior to or on the Closing Date, including with

destroy, alter or otherwise dispose of any of the books and records of any
Group Company for any period prior to the Closing Date without first giving
reasonable prior notice to the Representative, and offering to surrender to
the Representative such books and records or any portion thereof which the
Parent or the Company may intend to destroy, alter or dispose of.

6.02 _Reserved_.

 



31 6.03 _Indemnification of Officers and Directors of the Company_.

 

(a) From and after the Closing, the Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Company and each of their respective Subsidiaries to, to
the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, indemnify, defend and hold
harmless, and provide advancement of expenses to, each Person who is now, or
has been at any time prior to the date hereof or who becomes prior to the
Closing, an officer, director or employee of a Group Company (each, a " _D andO
Indemnified Party_"), against all Losses, claims, damages, costs, expenses,
Liabilities or judgments or amounts that are paid in settlement of or in
connection with any claim, Action, suit, proceeding or investigation based in
whole or in part on or arising in whole or in part out of the fact that such
Person is or was an officer, director or employee of a Group Company, and
pertaining to any matter existing or occurring, or any acts or omissions
occurring, at or prior to the Closing, whether asserted or claimed prior to,
or at or after, the Closing (including matters, acts or omissions occurring in
connection with the approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby) to the same extent that such Persons are
indemnified or have the right to advancement of expenses as of the date hereof
by the Group Companies pursuant to their respective organizational documents
and indemnification agreements of the Company, if any, in existence on the
date hereof with any DandO Indemnified Party.

(b) For a period of six (6) years after the Closing and at all times subject
to applicable Law, the Parent shall not (and shall not cause or permit any
Group Company or any of the Parents other Subsidiaries or Affiliates to)
amend or modify in any way adverse to the DandO Indemnified Parties, or to the
beneficiaries thereof, the exculpation and indemnification provisions set
forth in the organizational documents of the Group Companies as of the date
hereof. Each of Parent and the DandO Indemnified Party shall cooperate, and
cause their respective Affiliates to cooperate, in the defense of any
investigation of, any litigation, claim or proceeding in respect of which such
DandO Indemnified Party is being indemnified hereunder and shall provide access
to properties and individuals as reasonably requested and furnish or cause to
be furnished records, information and testimony, and attend such conferences,
discovery proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals, as may be
reasonably requested in connection therewith.

(c) The Parent agrees to pay, or to cause the Surviving Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to pay, all expenses, including attorneys fees, that may be
incurred by the DandO Indemnified Parties in enforcing the indemnity and other
obligations provided for in this _Section 6.03_.

 

(d) At or prior to Closing, the Parent shall purchase and pay in full a six
(6) year "tail" prepaid directors and officers liability insurance policy
(the " _D andO Tail_"), effective as of the Closing, providing, for a period of
six (6) years after the Closing (including with respect to acts or omissions
occurring in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby, including the Merger), with coverage and amounts no less favorable to
the DandO Indemnified Parties than those of such policies in effect on the date
hereof. From and after the Closing, the Parent shall (and/or shall cause the
Group Companies or its other subsidiaries or Affiliates, as applicable, to)
continue to honor its obligations under any such insurance procured pursuant
to this _Section 6.03(d)_, and shall not cancel (or permit to be canceled)
or take (or cause to be taken) any action or omission that would reasonably be
expected to result in the cancellation thereof.

 



32 (e) If the Parent, the Surviving Company or any of their respective successors
or assigns proposes to (i) consolidate with or merge into any other Person
and the Parent or the Surviving Company shall not be the continuing or
Surviving Company or entity in such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfer
all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then,
and in each case, proper provision shall be made prior to or concurrently with
the consummation of such transaction so that the successors and assigns of the
Parent or the Surviving Company, as the case may be, shall, from and after
the consummation of such transaction, honor the indemnification and other
obligations set forth in this _Section 6.03_.

 

(f) The provisions of this _Section 6.03_ shall survive the consummation of
the Merger and the Effective Time and (i) are intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, each DandO Indemnified Party, and his or her
successors, heirs and representatives and shall be binding on all successors
and assigns of the Parent and the Surviving Company and (ii) are in addition
to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or
contribution that any such Person may have by Contract or otherwise.

 

6.04 _Employee Benefits_.

 

(a) Parent hereby acknowledges and agrees that it does not have any current
plans or intentions to cause the Surviving Company or its Subsidiaries to
implement or effect any mass layoff, plant closure, reduction in force or
similar action affecting employees of the Group Companies (" _Continuing
Employees_ ") that would trigger any notice requirements under the
Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 1988.

(b) For purposes of eligibility and vesting under the benefit plans,
programs, agreements and arrangements of Parent and any of its Subsidiaries
or any respective Affiliate thereof providing benefits to any Continuing
Employees after the Effective Time, and in which such Continuing Employees did
not participate prior to the Effective Time (the " _New Plans_ "), including
for purposes of accrual of vacation and other paid time off and severance
benefits under the New Plans (but excluding any New Plan that is established
after the Effective Time that does not recognize service prior to its
adoption), Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause each
Continuing Employee to be credited with his or her years of service with the
Group Companies before the Effective Time, to the extent permitted by such
New Plans and applicable Law, to the same extent as such Continuing Employee
was entitled, before the Effective Time, to credit for such service under any
substantially similar Company Plan disclosed in _Schedule 3.13(a)_ , except
where such credit would result in a duplication of benefits.

(c) Nothing contained herein shall be construed as requiring, and the Company
shall take no action that would have the effect of requiring, Parent or the
Surviving Company to continue any specific employee benefit plans or to
continue the employment of any specific person. The provisions of this Section
6.04 are for the sole benefit of the Parties and nothing herein, express or
implied, is intended or shall be construed to (i) constitute an amendment to
any of the compensation and benefits plans maintained for or provided to
employees prior to or following the Effective Time or (ii) confer upon or
give to any person (including for the avoidance of doubt any current or former
employees, directors, or independent contractors of the Group Companies, or on
or after the Effective Time, the Surviving Company or any of its
Subsidiaries), other than the Parties and their respective permitted
successors and assigns, any legal or equitable or other rights or remedies
(with respect to the matters provided for in this  _Section 6.04_) under or
by reason of any provision of this Agreement.

 _INDEMNIFICATION_

 

8.01 _Survival of Representations, Warranties, Covenants, Agreements and Other
Provisions_.

 

(a) The representations and warranties of the Company contained in _Article
III_ , shall survive the Closing and claims may be asserted with respect to a
Loss arising as a result of a breach thereof to the extent permitted by this
_Article VIII_. For the avoidance of doubt, the representations and warranties
made by each Common Shareholder in his, her or its Letter of Transmittal
shall survive the Closing indefinitely.

(b) The representations and warranties of the Parent and the Merger Sub
contained in  _Article IV_ shall survive the Closing and claims may be
asserted with respect to a Loss arising as a result of a breach thereof to the
extent permitted by this _Article VIII_.

 

(c) The party claiming indemnification with respect thereto must give notice
to the other party of any claim for indemnification under this  _Article
VIII_ in writing setting forth the specific claim and the basis therefor in
reasonable detail prior to the expiration of the Survival Period; provided,
however, that any obligation under _Sections 8.02_ and _8.03_ shall
not terminate with respect to any Losses in respect of which the Person to be
indemnified shall have given such notice to the indemnifying party in
accordance with _Section 8.06_ before the termination of the applicable
Survival Period.

 

(d) For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Survival Period" shall mean the
period ending on the eighteen (18) month anniversary of the Closing Date;
provided, however, that the Survival Period with respect to the Company
Fundamental Representations shall mean the six (6) year anniversary of the
Closing Date and claims made pursuant to  _Section 8.02(ii)_ shall be the
three (3) year anniversary of the Closing Date.

(e) No covenant or agreement contained herein that is to be performed on or
prior to the Closing shall survive the Closing. Any covenant or agreement to
be performed, in whole or in part, after the Closing, shall survive the
Closing in accordance with its terms. No claim for indemnification hereunder
for breach of any such covenants or agreements may be made after the
expiration of such survival period.

8.02  _Indemnification for the Benefit of the Parent Indemnified Parties_.
Subject to this _Article VIII_ , from and after the Closing the
Securityholders, severally (and not jointly and severally) in accordance with
their Pro Rata Percentages, shall indemnify and hold Parent and Merger Sub
and any of their respective Affiliates, officers, directors, stockholders,
employees,

 



34  agents and their successors and assigns (the " _Parent Indemnified Parties_
") harmless from and against, and pay to the applicable Parent Indemnified
Parties the amount of, any and all Losses to the extent arising from: (i) any
breach of any representation or warranty of the Company contained in _Article
III_ , and (ii) any Designated Environmental Losses (as defined in _Section
8.11_ below). Unless otherwise required by Law, all payments made from the
Escrow Account shall be treated by the Parties as an adjustment to the
proceeds received by the Securityholders pursuant to _Article II_ hereof.

 

8.03 _Indemnification by the Parent for the Benefit of the Securityholders_.
Subject to this _Article VIII_ , from and after the Closing, the Parent shall
indemnify the Representative, the Securityholders and their respective
Affiliates, and their respective officers, directors or employees
(collectively, the " _Securityholder Indemnified Parties_ ") and hold them
harmless against any Losses which the Securityholder Indemnified Parties may
suffer or sustain, arising from: (a) any breach of any representation or
warranty of the Parent or the Merger Sub contained in _Article IV_ and (b)
any non-fulfillment or breach of any covenant, agreement or other provision
of this Agreement by the Parent or the Merger Sub that survives the Closing.
Any indemnification of the Securityholders pursuant to this _Section 8.03_
shall be delivered to the Representative (on behalf of the Securityholders,
in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Percentages) by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by the
Representative within fifteen (15) days after the date upon which any
underlying claims are finally resolved or, pursuant to _Section 1.03(b)_,
paid to the Surviving Company for payment to the former holders of In-the-
Money Options in accordance with their Optionholder Percentages through the
Surviving Companys payroll system.

8.04 _Limitations on Indemnification_. The rights of the Parent Indemnified
Parties and the Securityholder Indemnified Parties to indemnification pursuant
to the provisions of this _Article VIII_ are subject to the following
limitations:

 

(a) Notwithstanding the foregoing, no claims for indemnification by the Parent
pursuant to _Section 8.02(i)_ shall be so asserted, and the Parent shall not
be entitled to recover Losses, unless and until the aggregate amount of Losses
that would otherwise be payable thereunder exceeds on a cumulative basis an
amount equal to $1,000,000 (the " _Deductible_ "), and then only to the
extent such Losses exceed the Deductible. In no event shall the aggregate
indemnification to be paid under _Section 8.02(i)_ exceed the Indemnity
Escrow Amount. In no event shall the aggregate indemnification to be
paid pursuant to _Section 8.02(ii)_ exceed the Special Escrow Amount.

(b) The amount of any Loss subject to indemnification under  _Section 8.02_
or _8.03_ shall be calculated net of (i) any Tax Benefit actually realized by
the Indemnitee on account of such Loss in the Tax year in which such Loss
occurs or in the two immediately following taxable years and (ii) any
insurance proceeds or any indemnity, contribution or other similar payment
actually recovered by the Indemnitee from any third party with respect
thereto, in each case, net of all expenses incurred by the Indemnitee with
respect to recovering or realizing such Tax Benefits or insurance proceeds.
For purposes hereof, " _Tax Benefit_ " shall mean, with respect to any Loss
subject to indemnity under _Section 8.02_ or _8.03_ , an amount by which the
Tax liability of a party (or a group of corporations filing a Tax Return that
includes such party), with respect to a taxable period, is reduced solely as a
result of such Loss or the amount of Tax refund 

 



35  that is generated solely as a result of such Loss, and any related interest
received from any relevant taxing authority. The Indemnitee shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to seek recovery under all insurance policies
(including, to the extent applicable, the RandW Policy) covering any Loss to the
same extent as they would if such Loss were not subject to indemnification
hereunder. In the event that an insurance or other recovery is made by any
Parent Indemnified Parties with respect to any Loss for which Parent
Indemnified Parties have been indemnified hereunder, then a refund equal to
the aggregate amount of the recovery (but not in excess of the Loss for which
such Parent Indemnified Parties was Indemnified by Securityholders hereunder)
shall be made promptly to the Representative, on behalf of the Securityholders
(subject to _Section 1.03(b)_). To the extent permitted by the RandW Policy,
Parent agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to seek recovery under
the RandW Policy prior to making any claims for indemnification pursuant to
section 8.02(ii).

 

(c) No Parent Indemnified Party shall be entitled to indemnification pursuant
to this _Article VIII_ to the extent that with respect to any Loss or alleged
Loss to the extent such Loss or alleged Loss is included in the calculation of
the Indebtedness or Net Working Capital.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, no access or
examination conducted by the Parent or Merger Sub, or any of their respective
representatives, prior to the Closing Date shall qualify or limit any
representation or warranty set forth in this Agreement.

 

8.05 _Mitigation_. Each Person entitled to indemnification hereunder shall
take reasonable steps to mitigate all Losses after becoming aware of any
event that could reasonably be expected to give rise to any Losses which are
indemnifiable or recoverable hereunder or in connection herewith.

 

8.06 _Indemnification Procedures; Defense of Third Party Claims_.

 

(a) Any Parent Indemnified Party or Securityholder Indemnified Party making a
claim for indemnification under _Section 8.02_ or  _Section 8.03_ (an "
_Indemnitee_ ") shall promptly notify the indemnifying party (an "
_Indemnitor_ ") and the Representative (on behalf of the Securityholders), if
applicable, in writing of any pending or threatened claim or demand that the
Indemnitee has determined has given or would reasonably be expected to give
rise to such right of indemnification (including a pending or threatened claim
or demand asserted by a third party against the Indemnitee, such claim being
a " _Third Party Claim_ "), describing in reasonable detail the facts and
circumstances with respect to the subject matter of such claim or demand;
_provided_ , that the failure to provide such notice shall not release the
Indemnitor from any of its obligations under this _Article VIII_ except to the
extent the Indemnitor is materially prejudiced by such failure, it being
agreed that notices for claims in respect of a breach of a representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement must be delivered prior to the expiration of
any applicable Survival Period specified in _Section 8.01_ for such
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement.

 

(b) Upon receipt of a notice of a Third Party Claim for indemnity from an
Indemnitee pursuant to _Section 8.02_ or  _Section 8.03_, the Indemnitor
shall be entitled, by notice to the Indemnitee delivered within twenty (20)
Business Days of the receipt of notice of such Third Party Claim, to assume
the defense and control of such Third Party Claim;  _provided_ , that

 



36  the Indemnitor shall allow the Indemnitee a reasonable opportunity to
participate in the defense of such Third Party Claim with its own counsel and
at its own expense. Such assumption of the conduct and control of the
settlement or defense shall not be deemed to be an admission or assumption of
liability by the Indemnitor. If the Indemnitor does not assume the defense and
control of any Third Party Claim pursuant to this  _Section 8.06(b)_, the
Indemnitee shall be entitled to assume and control such defense, but the
Indemnitor may nonetheless participate in the defense of such Third Party
Claim with its own counsel and at its own expense. The Parent or
the Representative, as the case may be, shall, and shall cause each of its
Affiliates and representatives to, reasonably cooperate with the Indemnitor in
the defense of any Third Party Claim, including by furnishing books and
records, personnel and witnesses, as appropriate for any defense of such
Third Party Claim. If the Indemnitor has assumed the defense and control of a
Third Party Claim, it shall be authorized to consent to a settlement or
compromise of, or the entry of any judgment arising from, any Third Party
Claim, in its sole discretion and without the consent of any Indemnitee if
such settlement relates solely to monetary damages in an amount not less than
the remaining funds in the Escrow Account. In all other circumstances in
which the Indemnitor has assumed the defense, neither the Indemnitor nor the
Indemnitee shall, without the written consent of the other party, including
(i) entering into any settlement or compromise of any claim that
imposes monetary obligations in excess of the remaining funds in the Escrow
Account, (ii) entering into any settlement or compromise of any claim that
imposes non-monetary obligations or (iii) permitting a default or consent to
entry of any judgment, in each case, unless the claimant and such party
provide to such other party an unqualified release from all liability in
respect of the claim; provided, that, if a settlement offer solely for money
damages is made by the applicable third-party claimant, and the Indemnitor
party notifies the Indemnitee in writing of the Indemnitors willingness to
accept the settlement offer and, subject to the applicable limitations of
_Section 8.04_, pay the amount called for by such offer, and the Indemnitee
declines to accept such offer, the Indemnitee may continue to contest such
claim, free of any participation by the Indemnitor, and the amount of any
ultimate liability with respect to such claim that the Indemnitor has an
obligation to pay hereunder shall be limited to the lesser of (A) the amount
of the settlement offer that the Indemnitee declined to accept plus the Losses
of the Indemnitee relating to such claim through the date of its rejection of
the settlement offer or (B) the aggregate Losses of the Indemnitee with
respect to such claim. No Indemnitee shall consent to the entry of any
judgment or enter into any settlement or compromise with respect to a Third
Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnitor (any such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

8.07 _Sole and Exclusive Remedy_.

(a) Following the Closing, the sole and exclusive remedy for any and all
claims against the Representative or Securityholders arising under, out of or
related to this Agreement, shall be the remedies provided in Section 1.09, the
remedies set forth in this Article VIII and the rights against a
Securityholder contained in the Letter of Transmittal or Option Cancellation
Acknowledgment, as applicable, and no Person will have any other entitlement,
remedy or recourse, whether in contract, tort or otherwise against the
Securityholders, it being agreed that all of such other remedies, entitlements
and recourse are expressly waived and released by the parties to the fullest
extent permitted by Law. Except in the case of fraud or for direct claims
against any Securityholder for any breach by such Securityholder of the
representations and warranties made by him, her or it in the applicable
Letter of Transmittal or

 



37  Option Cancellation Acknowledgment, as applicable, from and after the
Closing, the right of the Parent to recovery (i) against the Indemnity Escrow
Amount shall constitute the Parents sole and exclusive remedy for any claims
made with respect to _Section 8.02(i)_ and (ii) against the Special Escrow
Amount pursuant to _Section 8.02(ii)_ shall constitute the sole and exclusive
remedy for any claims made with respect to _Section 8.02(ii)_.

(b) The Parent acknowledges and agrees that the Parent may not avoid the
limitation on liability set forth in this _Article VIII_ by (x) seeking
damages for breach of contract, tort or pursuant to any other theory of
liability, all of which are hereby waived, or (y) asserting or threatening any
claim against any Person that is not a Party hereto (or a successor to a
Party hereto) for breaches of the representations or warranties contained in
Article III of this Agreement. The Parties hereto agree that the provisions in
this Agreement relating to indemnification, and the limits imposed on the
Parents remedies with respect to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, were specifically bargained for between sophisticated
parties and were specifically taken into account in the determination of the
amounts to be paid to the Securityholders hereunder. Following the Closing and
subject to the foregoing, to the maximum extent permitted by Law, the Parties
hereby waive all other rights and remedies with respect to any matter in any
way relating to this Agreement or arising in connection herewith, whether
under any Law at common law, in equity or otherwise.

8.08 _Escrow Release_. Any portion of the Indemnity Escrow Amount and Special
Escrow Amount remaining in escrow following the applicable Escrow Release
Date, less the aggregate amount, if any, claimed by the Parent Indemnified
Parties pursuant to claims (such claims, the " _Outstanding Claims_ ")
properly made against the applicable Indemnity Escrow Amount and/or Special
Escrow Amount in accordance with this _Article VIII_ and not fully resolved
prior to the applicable Escrow Release Date (such amount of the retained
Indemnity Escrow Amount and/or Special Escrow Amount, as it may be further

agreement entered into in connection herewith or contemplated hereby, and any
amendments hereto or thereto, to the extent signed and delivered by means of a

or to any such contract shall raise the use of a facsimile machine or email to

or communicated through the use of facsimile machine or email as a defense to
the formation of a contract and each such Party forever waives any such
defense.

12.14  _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in multiple
counterparts, any one of which need not contain the signature of more than one
(1) Party, but all such counterparts taken together shall constitute one and
the same instrument. 

12.15 _Governing Law_. All issues and questions concerning the construction,
validity, interpretation and enforceability of this Agreement and the
exhibits and schedules hereto shall be governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the Laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to

of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of
the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.

 

12.16 _Jurisdiction_. Any suit, Action or proceeding seeking to enforce any
provision of, or based on any matter arising out of or in connection with,

have jurisdiction, any such suit, Action or proceeding shall be brought
exclusively in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware
or any other court of the State of Delaware, and each of the Parties hereby
consents to the jurisdiction of such courts (and of the appropriate appellate
courts therefrom) in any such suit, Action or proceeding and irrevocably
waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, any objection which it may now
or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such suit, Action or
proceeding in any such court or that any such suit,

agrees that service of process on such Party as provided in _Section 12.03_
shall be deemed effective service of process on such Party.

12.17 _No Recourse_. Except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement or the
Ancillary Agreements, the Parties to this Agreement agree on their own behalf
and on behalf of their respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates that no Non-
Recourse Party of a Party to this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements shall
have any liability relating to this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements or
any of the transactions contemplated herein.

12.18 _Specific Performance_. Each of the Parties acknowledges that the
rights of each Party to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby are
unique and recognizes and affirms that in the event of a breach of this
Agreement by any Party, money damages may be inadequate and the non-breaching

prior to a valid termination of this Agreement in accordance with this
Agreement, such non-breaching Party shall have the right, in addition to any
other rights and remedies existing in its favor at Law or in equity, to
enforce its rights and the other Partys obligations hereunder not only by an

performance, injunctive and/or other equitable relief (without posting of
bond or other security). Each of the Parties agrees that it shall not oppose
the granting of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief
when expressly available pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, and hereby
waives (x) any defenses in any Action for an injunction, specific performance
or other equitable relief, including the defense that the other parties have
an adequate remedy at Law or an award of specific performance is not
an appropriate remedy for any reason at Law or equity, and (y) any
requirement under Law to post a bond, undertaking or other security as a
prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief.

 

12.19 _Waiver of Conflicts_. Recognizing that Willkie Farr and Gallagher LLP ("
_WF andG_") has acted as legal counsel to certain of the Securityholders and
the Company, its Affiliates and the Group Companies prior to the Closing, and
that WFandG intends to act as legal counsel to certain of the Securityholders
after the Closing, each of the Parent and the Surviving Company (including on
behalf of the Group Companies) hereby waives, on its own behalf and agrees to
cause its Affiliates to waive, any conflicts that may arise in connection with
WFandG representing any of the Securityholders and/or its Affiliates after the
Closing as such representation may relate to the Parent, any Group Company or
the transactions contemplated herein. In addition, all communications
involving attorney-client confidences between any Securityholders and
its Affiliates in the course of the negotiation, documentation and
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby shall be deemed to be
attorney-client confidences that belong solely to such Securityholders and
their Affiliates (and not the Group Companies). Accordingly, the Group
Companies shall not have access to any such communications, or to the files of
WFandG relating to engagement, whether or not the Closing shall have occurred.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, upon and after the Closing,
(i) the applicable Securityholders and their Affiliates (and not the Group
Companies) shall be the sole holders of the attorney-client privilege with
respect to such engagement, and none of the Group Companies shall be a holder
thereof, (ii) to the extent that files of WFandG in respect of such engagement
constitute property of the client,

 



61  only the applicable Securityholders and their Affiliates (and not the Group
Companies) shall hold such property rights and (iii) WFandG shall have no duty
whatsoever to reveal or disclose any such attorney-client communications or
files to any of the Group Companies by reason of any attorney-client
relationship between WFandG and any of the Group Companies or otherwise.
