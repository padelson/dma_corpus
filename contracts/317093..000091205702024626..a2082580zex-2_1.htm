equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law) and is in full force and effect. To Celiant's knowledge, each Real Property Lease is legal, valid,
binding and enforceable as to each other party thereto. All rent and other sums and charges payable by Celiant as tenant under each Real Property Lease are current and no termination event or
condition or uncured default of a material nature on the part of Celiant or, to Celiant's knowledge, the landlord, exists under any Real Property Lease, and no party has given notice to Celiant of an
alleged material breach or default under such Real Property Lease. Assuming the assumptions described in the immediately preceding clauses (A)&nbsp;and (B)&nbsp;are true and correct, Celiant has
good and valid leasehold interests in each parcel of property leased by it, free and clear of all Liens except Permitted Liens. No party to any such Real Property Lease has given notice to Celiant of,
or made a written claim against Celiant with respect to, any material default under such Real Property Lease. </FONT></P>
