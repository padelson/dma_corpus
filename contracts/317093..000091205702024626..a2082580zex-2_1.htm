 CONVERSION OF SHARES

  

 Section 3.1. _ Merger Consideration._ 

   

 (a) At the Effective Time and subject to the provisions of this Article III, by virtue of the Merger and without any further action on the part of any holder thereof, all of the issued and outstanding Celiant Common Stock and the Celiant Preferred Stock (as defined below) shall be converted and exchanged for the right to receive merger consideration in the aggregate of $119,621,923 in cash and 16,278,805 shares of Common Stock of the Company, par value $0.01 per share (the "Company Common Stock") (collectively the "Merger Consideration"). 

  

  

 (i) The registered holders of Common Stock of Celiant, par value $.01 per share (the "Celiant Common Stock") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares as to which dissenters\' rights shall have been duly demanded pursuant to the DGCL 

  

    

 ("Dissenting Shares")) shall have such shares converted into the right to
receive, in the aggregate, $4.735360195 in cash to be allocated as set
forth on _Schedule 3.1_, payable immediately upon the surrender of the
certificate (or a lost security affidavit in form reasonably satisfactory to
the Company) formerly representing such share of Celiant Common Stock in
accordance with Section 3.2 of this Agreement;

  

 (ii) The registered holders of Preferred Stock of Celiant, par value $0.01 per share (the "Celiant Preferred Stock"), issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (including, without limitation, PIK Shares (as defined in the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of Celiant) corresponding to such Preferred Stock and accrued through the date hereof but excluding Dissenting Shares) shall in the aggregate have such shares converted into the right to receive $119,621,918 in cash and 16,278,805 shares of Company Common Stock, such portion of the Merger Consideration to be allocated as set forth on _Schedule 3.1_, payable immediately upon the surrender of the certificate formerly representing such share of Celiant Preferred Stock (or lost security affidavit in form reasonably satisfactory to the Company) in accordance with Section 3.2 of this Agreement; 

  

  

 (b) The holders of Dissenting Shares, if any, shall be entitled to payment by the Company of the fair value of such shares in cash to the extent permitted by and in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL; provided, however, that (i) if any holder of Dissenting Shares shall deliver a written withdrawal of such holder\'s demand for the fair value of such shares, or (ii) if any holder fails to establish such holder\'s entitlement to rights to payment as provided in such Section 262 of the DGCL, such holder or holders (as the case may be) shall forfeit such right to payment for such shares and such shares shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted into the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 3.1(a) and/or 3.1(b) as of the Effective Time. The Company shall be solely responsible for, and shall pay out of its own funds, any amounts which become due and payable to holders of Dissenting Shares. Celiant shall notify the Company of each demand for dissenters\' rights under the DGCL promptly after such demand is received by Celiant. 

  

 Section 3.2. _ Exchange of Merger Consideration; Procedures._ At the Closing, each of the Stockholders will deliver the certificates representing their shares of Celiant Common Stock and Celiant Preferred Stock (the "Certificates") that were converted pursuant to Section 3.1 into the Merger Consideration and the Company will deliver to each such Stockholder in exchange therefor, the portion of the aggregate Merger Consideration set forth opposite such Stockholder\'s name on _Schedule 3.1_, after giving effect to any required tax withholdings, as well as cash in lieu of any fractional shares of the Company Common Stock to which such Stockholder is entitled pursuant to Section 3.4 and any dividends or distributions to which such Stockholder is entitled pursuant to Section 3.3. The Certificate(s) surrendered pursuant to this Section 3.2 shall forthwith be cancelled. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 3.2, each Certificate, other than Certificates evidencing Dissenting Shares, shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Company Common Stock and any dividends or distributions, which may be payable pursuant to Section 3.3 hereof. 

  

 Section 3.3. _ Dividends._ No dividends or distributions that are declared on shares of Company Common Stock will be paid to persons entitled to receive certificates representing shares of Company Common Stock until such persons surrender their Certificates.

 Section 3.4. _ No Fractional Shares._ No certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Company Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates, and such fractional interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights of a security holder. In lieu of any such fractional shares, each holder of Celiant Common Stock or Celiant Preferred Stock who would otherwise have been entitled to a fraction of a share of Company Common Stock upon surrender of such holder\'s Certificates will be entitled to receive a cash payment (without interest) determined by multiplying (i) the fractional interest to which such holder would otherwise be entitled (after taking into account all shares of Company Common Stock then held of record by such holder) and (ii) the average of the per share closing prices for Company Common Stock on the Nasdaq National Market ("NNM") for the 25 trading days immediately preceding the date hereof. 

  

 Section 3.5. _ Closing of Celiant Transfer Books._ At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of Celiant shall be closed and no transfer of shares of Celiant Common Stock or Celiant Preferred Stock shall thereafter be made. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Company, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Article III. 

   

 Section 3.6. _ Further Assurances._ If, at any time after the Effective Time, the Company shall consider or be advised that any deeds, bills of sale, assignments, assurances or any other actions or things are necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation its right, title or interest in, to or under any of the rights, properties or assets of Celiant acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger or otherwise to carry out this Agreement, the officers of the Company shall be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of Celiant or otherwise, all such deeds, bills of sale, assignments and assurances and to take and do, in such names and on such behalves or otherwise, all such other actions and things as may be reasonably necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm any and all right, title and interest in, to and under such rights, properties or assets in the Surviving Corporation or otherwise to carry out the purposes of this Agreement. 

  

ARTICLE IV. 
 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF CELIANT

  

 Celiant hereby represents and warrants to the Company and Sub as follows: 

  

 Section 4.1. _ Organization and Qualification of Celiant._ 

   

 (a) Celiant is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the state of Delaware. Celiant has all requisite corporate power and authority to own or lease all of its properties and assets and to conduct its business (the "Business") as it is now being conducted, and Celiant is duly licensed or qualified to do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the Business or the character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased by it makes such licensing or qualification necessary, except for those jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or licensed or to be in good standing individually or in the aggregate could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Celiant. Celiant has no direct or indirect subsidiaries and has no equity interest in any other Person. Correct and complete copies of the Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws of Celiant, as currently in effect, have been provided to the Company by Celiant. 

  

 (b) The corporate minute books of Celiant accurately reflect in all material respects all actions taken by the board of directors, including any committees, and the stockholders of Celiant. Celiant has provided to the Company a copy of the minute books of Celiant that is correct and complete in all material respects. 

  

 Section 4.2. _ Authorization._ Celiant has the requisite corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement, and subject to Stockholder Approval (as hereinafter defined), to 

     

 consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The execution
and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement have been duly and validly approved by the
Celiant board of directors. No other corporate proceedings on the part of
Celiant are necessary to approve this Agreement or, except for the Stockholder
Approval, to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. This
Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by Celiant and
constitutes the valid and binding obligation of Celiant, enforceable against
Celiant in accordance with its terms, except as enforceability may be limited
by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws
affecting the enforcement of creditors\' rights in general and subject to
general principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is
considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).

  

 Section 4.3. _ Capitalization._ The authorized capital stock of Celiant consists of (a) 129,583,333 shares of Celiant Common Stock, and (b) 104,583,333 shares of Celiant Preferred Stock of which 50,416,666 shares have been designated as "Series A-1 Convertible Participating Preferred Stock" and 54,166,667 shares have been designated as "Series A-2 Convertible Participating Preferred Stock." As of the date hereof, (i) 1 share of Celiant Common Stock is issued and outstanding, (ii) 36,666,666 (and assuming the issuance of the PIK Shares on the date hereof 38,109,954) shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock of Celiant are issued and outstanding and (iii) 41,666,667 (and assuming the issuance of the PIK Shares on the date hereof 43,461,188) shares of Series A-2 Preferred Stock of Celiant are issued and outstanding. As of the date hereof, 25,000,000 shares of Celiant Common Stock are reserved for issuance pursuant to the FS Corp. 2001 Stock Option Plan (the "Celiant Stock Option Plan"). Except as set forth on _Schedule 4.3_, the issued and outstanding shares of Celiant\'s capital stock have been duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid, nonassessable and free of statutory preemptive rights and contractual stockholder preemptive rights, with no personal liability attaching to the ownership thereof. Except as set forth on _Schedule 4.3_, Celiant does not have and is not bound by any outstanding subscriptions, options, voting trusts, convertible securities, warrants, calls, commitments or agreements of any character or kind calling for the purchase, issuance or grant of any additional shares of its capital stock or restricting the transfer of its capital stock. _Schedule 4.3_ contains a complete and correct list of (i) the name of each holder of an option, warrant or right to acquire capital stock or other securities of Celiant, (ii) the number of shares of capital stock (or number, principal amount and type of other securities) subject to each such option, warrant or right, (iii) the current exercise price (per share or otherwise) of each such option, warrant or right and (iv) a vesting schedule for such options, warrants or rights. 

  

 Section 4.4. _ Title and Condition of Assets._ Except as set forth in _Schedule 4.4_, Celiant has good and merchantable title to, or a valid leasehold interest in, all of the assets and properties owned or licensed by Celiant or as to which Celiant has legally enforceable rights to use, including those assets and properties reflected on the Interim Balance Sheet (as hereinafter defined) or acquired by Celiant after the date of the Interim Balance Sheet (and excluding those assets or properties disposed of by Celiant (y) in the ordinary course of Business consistent with past practice or (z) as otherwise permitted pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement (the "Acquired Assets"), free and clear of all Liens, except for Permitted Liens. The Acquired Assets constitute all the assets necessary for the conduct of the Business after the Closing by the Surviving Corporation in the manner as presently conducted by Celiant. "Interim Balance Sheet" means the unaudited balance sheet of Celiant as of December 31, 2001 provided to the Company. 

      

  Section 4.5. _ Real Property._ Celiant owns no real property.
Schedule 4.5 sets forth all leases, subleases and other agreements (the "Real
Property Leases") under which Celiant uses or occupies or has the right to use
or occupy or grants any other party the right to use or occupy, now or in the
future, any real property. Correct and complete copies of all the Real
Property Leases (and all amendments, supplements and modifications thereto)
have been made available to the Company. Assuming that (A) each Real Property
Lease is legal, valid, binding and enforceable as to each party thereto (other
than Celiant) and (B) each Real Property Lease is in full force and effect as
to each party thereto (other than Celiant), each Real Property Lease
constitutes the valid and legally binding obligation of Celiant, except to the
extent enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws affecting the enforcement of
creditors\' rights in general and subject to general principles of equity
(regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in
equity or at law) and is in full force and effect. To Celiant\'s knowledge,
each Real Property Lease is legal, valid, binding and enforceable as to each
other party thereto. All rent and other sums and charges payable by Celiant as
tenant under each Real Property Lease are current and no termination event
or condition or uncured default of a material nature on the part of Celiant
or, to Celiant\'s knowledge, the landlord, exists under any Real Property
Lease, and no party has given notice to Celiant of an alleged material breach
or default under such Real Property Lease. Assuming the assumptions described
in the immediately preceding clauses (A) and (B) are true and correct, Celiant
has good and valid leasehold interests in each parcel of property leased by
it, free and clear of all Liens except Permitted Liens. No party to any such
Real Property Lease has given notice to Celiant of, or made a written claim
against Celiant with respect to, any material default under such Real Property
Lease.

  

 Section 4.6. _ Contracts and Commitments._ 

  

 (a) Except as set forth on _Schedule 4.6_, Celiant is not a party to nor is Celiant bound by any written: 

  

  

 (i) Contract for the employment of any officer of Celiant; 

  

 (ii) Contract under which Celiant has made advances or loans to any Person, other than advances for business expenses made to employees in the ordinary course of business; 

  

 (iii) Contract for borrowed money; 

  

 (iv) Contract, other than the Real Property Leases, under which Celiant is lessee of or holds or operates any property owned by any other Person under which the annual rental payments exceed $100,000; 

  

 (v) Contract under which Celiant is lessor of or permits any third Person to hold or operate any material property owned or controlled by Celiant;
