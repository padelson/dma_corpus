Sellers or, upon transfer, the Buyers under such asset, permit, claim or
right, unless the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code permits and/or
the Sale Order authorizes the assumption and assignment of such asset, permit,
claim, or right irrespective of the consent or

 


  

 

17

  

 



 

lack thereof of a third party. If, with respect to any Transferred Asset,
such consent is not obtained or such assignment is not attainable pursuant to
the Bankruptcy Code or the Sale Order, then such Transferred Asset shall not
be transferred hereunder, and the Closing shall proceed with respect to the
remaining Transferred Assets and the Sellers shall use their reasonable best
efforts (which efforts will be subject to any winding-down of operations and
related capabilities of the Sellers post-Closing), and the Buyers shall
cooperate with the Sellers, to obtain any such consent and to resolve the
impracticalities of assignment after the Closing, _provided_ , that the
Sellers shall not have any liability to the Buyers arising out of or relating
to the failure to obtain any such consent on a post-Closing basis.

 

(b)

 

If (i) notwithstanding the applicable provisions of Sections 363 and 365 of
the Bankruptcy Code and the Sale Order and the reasonable best efforts of the
Sellers, any consent is not obtained prior to Closing and as a result thereof
the Buyers shall be prevented by a third party from receiving the rights and
benefits with respect to a Transferred Asset intended to be transferred
hereunder, (ii) any attempted assignment of a Transferred Asset would
adversely affect the rights of the Sellers thereunder so that the Buyers would
not in fact receive all the rights and benefits contemplated, or (iii) any
Transferred Asset is not otherwise capable of sale and/or assignment (after
giving effect to the Sale Order and the Bankruptcy Code), then, in each case,
the Sellers shall, subject to any approval of the Bankruptcy Court that may be
required, at the request of the Buyers cooperate with Buyers in any lawful and
commercially reasonable arrangement under which the Buyers would, to the
extent practicable, obtain the economic claims, rights and benefits under such
asset and assume the economic burdens and obligations with respect thereto in
accordance with this Agreement, including by subcontracting, sublicensing or
subleasing to the Buyers; _provided_ , that all reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses of such cooperation and related actions shall be paid by the Buyers.
Seller Parent shall promptly pay to the Buyers when received all monies
received by the Sellers under such Transferred Asset or any claim or right or
any benefit arising thereunder and the Buyers shall indemnify and promptly pay
the Sellers for all Liabilities of the Sellers associated with such
arrangement, if requested.

 

Section 2.6

 

 _Contract Designation._

 

(a)

 

No later than March 31, 2015, Sellers shall deliver to the Buyers a true,
correct and complete, to the best of the Sellers knowledge, list (the "
_Executory Contract List_ ") of all Contracts related to the Transferred
Assets or otherwise used, or held for use, in connection with the Business as
it is conducted by the Sellers (each, an " _Executory Contract_ "). The
Executory Contract List shall describe the monetary amounts that must be paid
and nonmonetary obligations that otherwise must be satisfied, including
pursuant to Section 365(b)(1)(A) and (B) of the Bankruptcy Code, in order for
Buyers to assume the Transferred Contracts pursuant to this Agreement ("
_Undisputed Cure Claims_ "). The Sellers will use commercially reasonable
efforts to provide the Buyers with copies of each such Contract so as to
permit Buyer to review such Contracts to determine such other commercial
information related to the Contracts listed thereon as Buyer desires.

 

(b)

 

Subject to the entry of the Sale Procedures Order and to the terms and
provisions thereof, no later than the tenth (10th) Business Day following
entry of the Sale Procedures Order, a copy of the Executory Contract List,
which shall be in form and substance

 


  

 

18

  

 



 

reasonably acceptable to Buyers, shall be served on all necessary parties.
The Executory Contract List shall identify the Undisputed Cure Claim, if any,
associated with each Contract listed therein, shall identify the Buyers, and
shall indicate that the Buyers will, if necessary, provide evidence of
adequate assurance of future performance at the Sale Hearing. Any
counterparty to an Executory Contract included on the Executory Contract List
shall have the time period prescribed by the Sale Procedures Order, or, if no
such time period is given, a reasonable amount of time prior to the Auction,
to object to the Cure Claims listed on the Executory Contract List and to
adequate assurance of future performance.

 

(c)

 

To the extent a counterparty to an Executory Contract objects or otherwise
challenges the Undisputed Cure Claims determined by Sellers and asserts a
different monetary amount that must be paid and/or nonmonetary obligations
that otherwise must be satisfied, including pursuant to Section 365(b)(1)(A)
and (B) of the Bankruptcy Code, in order for Buyers to assume such Executory
Contract pursuant to this Agreement, the difference between the Undisputed
Cure Claims determined by Sellers and such amounts and/or nonmonetary
obligations determined by such counterparty shall be referred to as the "
_Disputed Cure Claims_."

 

(d)

 

On or prior to the third (3rd) Business Day before Closing, Buyers may
designate in writing any Executory Contract as a Transferred Contract to be
assumed by it pursuant to this Agreement or remove any Executory Contract
previously designated by Buyers as a Transferred Contract. The Buyers shall
be obligated to pay at Closing any Undisputed Cure Claims associated with the
assumption of a Transferred Contract that is an Executory Contract or such
other amount as agreed to between the applicable Buyer and the counterparty.
The Disputed Cure Claims shall only be paid pursuant to an Order of the
Bankruptcy Court or mutual agreement between the Buyers and the counterparty
to the applicable Transferred Contract. To the extent any Transferred
Contract is subject to a Cure Claim, the Buyers shall pay such Cure Claim
directly to the applicable counterparty; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Buyers obligation to pay Cure Claims in connection with the Transferred
Contracts shall not exceed the Cure Claims Cap unless otherwise agreed to
between the applicable Buyer and the counterparty. In no event shall the
Sellers be responsible for curing any defaults under the Transferred Contracts
or otherwise satisfying the Cure Claims relating to the Transferred Contracts.
Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, Buyers shall only
assume, and shall only be responsible for, Contracts designated by it as
Transferred Contracts, and which Transferred Contracts are in fact assumed and
assigned to the Buyers at Closing, pursuant to this Section 2.6.

 

(e)

 

Sellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts to reduce, and shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with Buyers in its efforts to
reduce, the Disputed Cure Claims and negotiate rent reductions with respect to
Leases that are Transferred Contracts. Such efforts shall include providing
Buyers with access to relevant business records, personnel, equipment, and
Buyers other reasonable requests in order to allow Buyers to assist with
evaluating the Disputed Cure Claims, in each case, at Sellers sole cost and
expense prior to the Closing and at Buyers sole cost and expense if such
assistance, access and cooperation occurs during the post-Closing period.

 


  

 

19

  

 



 

(f)

 

At any time at least two (2) Business Days prior to Closing, the Buyer, in its
discretion by written notice to Sellers, may exclude from being assigned
pursuant hereto any Contracts or Leases, and, in such circumstances, such
Contracts or Leases shall not constitute Transferred Contracts and shall be
Excluded Assets, and Buyers shall not acquire any rights or assume any
Liabilities with respect thereto pursuant to Section 2.3 hereof. Upon Buyers
reasonable request, Sellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
provide additional information as to the Liabilities under the Contracts and
Leases sufficient for Buyers to make an informed assessment whether to
designate such Contracts or Leases as Excluded Assets.

 

Section 2.7

 

 _Consideration_

 

(a)

 

The aggregate consideration for the sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance and
delivery of the Transferred Assets to the Buyers at the Closing, shall consist
of: (i) cash consideration necessary to result in Full Payment of (A) the DIP
Obligations (to the extent the DIP Obligations have not been satisfied
pursuant to Section 2.7(b)) and (B) Pre-Petition ABL Debt ((A) and (B)
collectively, the " _Cash Component_ "), and (C) the Initial Credit Bid
((A)-(C) collectively, the " _Purchase Price_ "), and (ii) the assumption of
the Assumed Liabilities. The amount of the Purchase Price together with the
Assumed Liabilities is estimated to be $275,000,000 as of the Closing Date
(assuming a Closing Date of June 26, 2015), including an estimated Cash
Component of $130,000,000 and an estimated Initial Credit Bid of $113,000,000.

 

(b)

 

To the extent any of the Purchase Price will be paid to a lender under the DIP
Credit Agreement that is a direct or indirect owner of a Buyer (a " _Lender
Owner_ "), the Buyers may deduct from the Purchase Price and be deemed as
having paid to the Sellers such amount as otherwise would have been
distributed in cash to such Lender Owner. In the event of a dispute over the
obligations owed to a Lender Owner under the DIP Credit Agreement, the Buyers
shall have no obligation to otherwise fund the Purchase Price with cash
relating to such amount that would be paid to the Lender Owner until final
resolution of any and all disputes over such obligations owed to such Lender
Owner under the DIP Credit Agreement. 

 

Section 2.8

 

 _Minimum Deposit_. Within five (5) Business Days of entry of the Sale
Procedures Order, the Buyers shall deliver to Seller Parent a federal
reference number evidencing the wire transfer of a deposit into escrow of an
amount in cash equal to Two Million Dollars ($2,000,000) (such amount, the
"Minimum Deposit") in immediately available funds with U.S. Bank National
Association (the "Escrow Agent") pursuant to the terms of an escrow agreement
in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit 4 (the "Escrow
Agreement") by and among the Escrow Agent, Seller Parent and the US Buyer.
Prior to Closing, US Buyer shall prepare and Seller Parent and US Buyer shall
execute a Joint Written Direction (as defined in the Escrow Agreement)
directing the Escrow Agent to, subject to the occurrence of the Closing,
deliver the Minimum Deposit to pay amounts necessary (i) for Full Payment of
the DIP Obligations, or (ii) for the Full Payment of Pre-Petition ABL Debt.
If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.1(d)(i) or (iii) in
accordance with Section 8.2(b) (a "Buyer Default Termination"), US Buyer shall
prepare and Seller Parent and US Buyer shall execute a Joint Written Direction
(as defined in the Escrow Agreement) instructing the Escrow Agent to, within
two (2) Business Days after such instruction, pay the Minimum Deposit to
Seller Parent,

 


  

 

20

  

 



 

and if this Agreement is terminated for any reason other than Section
8.1(d)(i) or (iii), the Minimum Deposit shall be returned to the Buyers. If
this Agreement is terminated prior to Closing for any reason other than a
Buyer Default Termination, US Buyer shall prepare and Seller Parent and US
Buyer shall execute a Joint Written Direction (as defined in the Escrow
Agreement) instructing the Escrow Agent to, within two (2) Business Days after
such instruction, return the Minimum Deposit to the Buyer. The Minimum
Deposit shall not be subject to any lien, attachment, trustee process or any
other judicial process of any creditor of any Seller or the Buyer. The
Sellers, on the one hand, and Buyers, on the other hand, shall take, or cause
to be taken, all actions, necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the
Escrow Agreement and the actions contemplated thereby. All costs associated
with the Escrow Agreement shall be borne by the Buyers.

Section 2.10

 

 _Tax Allocation_

 

(a)

 

The Purchase Price (plus Assumed Liabilities and any other consideration
payable pursuant to this Agreement, to the extent properly taken into account
under the Code), shall be allocated among the Transferred Assets in accordance
with Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated
thereunder (the " _Allocation_ "). The Allocation shall be prepared by the
Buyers and delivered to the Sellers as promptly as reasonably practicable, and
in any event no later than thirty (30) days prior to the Closing Date. The
Allocation shall be considered final and binding on the Parties unless Seller
Parent conveys written objections (an " _Allocation Dispute Notice_ ") to the
Buyers within ten (10) Business Days of receipt of the Allocation. The Buyers
and Seller Parent shall endeavor in good faith to resolve any such
disagreement within ten (10) days following the delivery of the Allocation
Dispute Notice, and if resolution of such disagreement is reached, the
Allocation shall immediately become final and binding. If the Buyers and
Seller Parent are unable to completely resolve any such disagreement within
ten (10) days, the unresolved issues (the " _Allocation Dispute_ ") shall be
resolved by the Neutral Firm in accordance with Section 2.10(b). Upon the
Allocation becoming final and binding, the Buyers and the Sellers agree to (i)
be bound by the Allocation, (ii) act in accordance with the Allocation for all
applicable Tax purposes (including filing IRS Form 8594 with their U.S.
federal income Return for the taxable year that includes the Closing Date and
any other Returns required under U.S. or foreign Tax Law, and in the course of
any Tax audit, review or litigation), and (iii) take no position and cause
their Affiliates to take no position inconsistent with the Allocation for all
applicable Tax purposes, unless otherwise required by applicable Law or unless
the other Parties consent thereto.

 

(b)

 

If the Buyers and the Sellers are unable to completely resolve any Allocation
Dispute within the ten (10) day period referred to in Section 2.10(a), the
unresolved issues (and only such unresolved issues) (such unresolved issues
collectively, the " _Dispute_ ") shall be promptly submitted for resolution to
Deloitte LLP (the " _Neutral Firm_ "). The Neutral Firm shall be instructed
to resolve any outstanding Dispute; _provided_ , that the Neutral Firms
determination of any amount subject to the Dispute shall be no (i) less than
the lesser of the amounts claimed by the Buyers and Seller Parent,
respectively, or (ii) greater than the greater of the amounts claimed by the
Buyers and Seller Parent, respectively. The Parties shall instruct the
Neutral Firm to render its determination with respect to the entire Dispute
within fourteen (14) days of the referral of the Dispute thereto, and the
determination of the Neutral Firm shall be final and binding upon the Parties
for all purposes of this Agreement. The fees and expenses of the Neutral Firm
shall be borne by the Buyer, on the one hand, and the Sellers, on the other
hand, in the same proportion that the dollar amount subject to the Dispute
which is not resolved in favor of the Buyers and the Sellers, as applicable,
bears to the total dollar amount subject to the Dispute resolved by the
Neutral Firm. For illustration purposes only, if the total amount of the
Dispute is One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000), and the Sellers are
awarded Twenty Five Thousand Dollars ($25,000) by the Neutral Firm, the
Sellers shall bear seventy-five percent (75%) and the Buyers shall bear
twenty-five percent (25%) of the Neutral Firms fees and expenses.

accordance with the terms and subject to the limitations set forth in this
Section 2.11, one (1) or more wholly-owned Subsidiaries or Affiliates to (i)
purchase specified Transferred Assets (including specified Transferred
Contracts) and pay the corresponding Purchase Price amount and Cure Claims, as
applicable, (ii) assume specified Assumed Liabilities, and/or (iii) employ
specified Transferred Employees on and after the Closing Date (any such
wholly-owned Subsidiary or Affiliate of the Buyers that shall be properly
designated by the Buyers in accordance with this clause, a " _Designated
Buyer_ "). At the Closing, the Buyers shall, or shall cause their Designated
Buyer(s) to, honor their obligations at the Closing. Any reference to the
Buyers made in this Agreement in respect of any purchase, assumption or
employment referred to in this Agreement shall include reference to the
appropriate Designated Buyer(s), if any. After the Closing, all obligations
of the Buyers and their Designated Buyer(s) under this Agreement shall be
several and not joint and the only party with Liability as to a particular
Assumed Liability is the Buyer or the Designated Buyer assuming such
obligation at the Closing and no other Buyer or Designated Buyer.

 

(b)

 

The above designation in Section 2.11(a) shall be made by the Buyers by way of
a written notice to be delivered to the Sellers in no event later than three
(3) Business Days prior to Closing which written notice shall contain
appropriate information about the Designated Buyer(s) and shall indicate which
Transferred Assets, Assumed Liabilities and Transferred Employees the Buyers
intend such Designated Buyer(s) to purchase, assume and/or employ, as
applicable, hereunder and include a signed counterpart to this Agreement in a
form acceptable to the Sellers, agreeing to be bound by the terms of this
Agreement as it relates to such Designated Buyer(s) and authorizing the Buyers
to act as such Designated Buyer(s) agent for all purposes hereunder.

 

Section 2.12

 

 _Withholding_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
the Buyers and the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
the consideration otherwise payable to the Sellers pursuant to this Agreement
such Taxes as may be required to be deducted and withheld from such
consideration under the Code or any other applicable provision of U.S. or
foreign Tax Law. To the extent that any amounts are so deducted or withheld
by a Buyer or the Escrow Agent, as the case may be, such deducted and withheld
amounts shall be (a) remitted by the Buyer or the Escrow Agent, as the case
may be, to the applicable Governmental Authority and (b) treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Seller in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made by the Buyer or the Escrow
Agent, as the case may be. __

the non-paying Partys portion of the Apportioned Taxes in accordance with
this Section 6.4. Upon payment of any such Apportioned Taxes, the paying
Party shall present a statement to the non-paying Party setting forth the
amount of reimbursement to which the paying Party is entitled under this
Section 6.4, together with such supporting evidence as is reasonably necessary
to calculate the amount to be reimbursed. The non-paying Party shall make

(d)

 

If, following entry of the Sale Procedures Order, this Agreement is terminated
in the circumstances set forth in Section 8.3(a) or Section 8.3(b), then the
Sellers, jointly and severally, shall pay to Buyers the Break-Up Fee and/or

(b)

 

If this Agreement is terminated in accordance with the terms set forth in

delivery and approval by the Bankruptcy Court of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby in an amount not to exceed 1.5% of the

transfer of immediately available funds to an account specified by the Buyers
to the Sellers in writing. The Sellers obligation to pay the Expense
Reimbursement Amount pursuant to the terms of this Section 8.3(b) shall be

Credit Agreement and to the "Carve-Out" (as defined therein).

 

(c)

 

The obligations of the Sellers to pay the Break-Up Fee and the Expense
Reimbursement Amount as provided herein shall be entitled to superpriority
administrative expense status pursuant to Sections 503(b)(1) and 507(a)(2) of
the Bankruptcy Code, senior to all other general administrative expense claims
and superpriority administrative expense claims granted such status pursuant
to Sections 503(b)(1) and 507(a)(2) other than superpriority administrative
expense claims granted in favor of the DIP Credit Parties, in the Bankruptcy
Case.

 

(d)

 

The Sellers agree and acknowledge that the Buyers due diligence, efforts,
negotiation, and execution of this Agreement have involved substantial
investment of management time and have required significant commitment of
financial, legal, and other

 


  

 

65

  

 



 

resources by the Buyers and their Affiliates, and that such due diligence,
efforts, negotiation, and execution have provided value to the Sellers and, in
the Sellers reasonable business judgment, is necessary for the preservation
of the value of the Sellers estate. The Sellers further agree and
acknowledge that the Break-Up Fee and Expense Reimbursement Amount are
reasonable in relation to Buyers efforts, Buyers lost opportunities from
pursuing this transaction, and the magnitude of the transactions contemplated
hereby. The provision of the Break-Up Fee and the Expense Reimbursement
