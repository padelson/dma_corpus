                                  ARTICLE II
                    The Closing; Purchase Price Adjustments
                   ----------------------------------------

     SECTION 2.1.  Closing Date.  The closing of the sale and transfer of the

                   ------------------------------------------

     (a) GPC shall deliver or cause to be delivered to Purchaser the following:

            (i)   Certificates representing the Securities, duly endorsed (or
     accompanied by duly executed stock powers), in proper form for transfer to
     Purchaser;

            (ii)  a duly executed copy of each of the Ancillary Agreements to
     which GPC is a party; and

            (iii) [Intentionally left blank];

            (iv)  such other instruments or documents, in form and substance
     reasonably acceptable to Purchaser, the delivery of which is a condition to
     Closing.

     (b)    GPF shall deliver the Notes, duly endorsed, to Purchaser.

     (c)    Purchaser shall deliver to GPC the following:

            (i)   by wire transfer to an account designated in writing by GPC,

                                       2

     SECTION 2.3.  Equity Adjustment.
                   -----------------

     (a) Within 90 days following the Closing Date, Purchaser and Company with
the cooperation of GPC shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, and deliver to
GPC a balance sheet of the Company as of the Closing Date after giving effect to
the Restructuring, which balance sheet shall be audited by PWC (the "Closing
Balance Sheet").

     (b) GPC and its accountants shall have 30 days after the delivery to GPC of
the Closing Balance Sheet to review the Closing Balance Sheet.  In the event
that GPC determines that the Closing Balance Sheet has not been prepared on the
basis set forth in Section 2.5, GPC shall inform Purchaser in writing (an
"Objection"), setting forth a specific description of the basis of the Objection
and the adjustments to the Closing Balance Sheet which GPC believes should be
made, which Objection must be delivered to Purchaser on or before the last day
of such 30-day period.  Purchaser shall then have 30 days to review and respond
to the Objection.  The parties shall attempt in good faith to reach an agreement
with respect to any matters in dispute.  If the parties are unable to resolve
all of their disagreements with respect to the determination of the foregoing
items within 45 days following the delivery to GPC of Purchaser's response to
the Objection by GPC, they shall refer their remaining differences to Ernst &
Young LLP or such other firm mutually agreed to by the parties (the "CPA Firm"),
who shall determine in accordance with this Agreement, and only with respect to
the remaining differences so submitted, whether and to what extent, if any, the
Closing Balance Sheet requires adjustment.  The parties shall direct the CPA
Firm to use its best efforts to render its determination within 30 days after
such submission.  In arriving at its decision, the CPA Firm shall rely on its
expertise as certified public accountants and shall not be bound by the
submissions of the parties but shall be bound to apply the provisions of this
Agreement.  The CPA Firm's determination shall be conclusive and binding upon
Purchaser, Company, SCA, GPC and GPF.  The fees and disbursements of the CPA
Firm shall be paid one-half by Purchaser and one-half by GPC.  Purchaser and GPC
shall make readily available to the CPA Firm all relevant books and records and
any work papers (including those of the parties' respective accountants)
relating to the Closing Balance Sheet and all other items reasonably requested
by the CPA Firm.  The "Final Closing Balance Sheet" shall be deemed to be (i)

2000 (the "PWC Report").

     (b) GPC and its accountants shall have 30 days after the delivery of the
PWC Report to review the PWC Report.  In the event that GPC determines that the
PWC Report has not been prepared on the basis set forth in Section 2.4(a), GPC
shall inform Purchaser in writing (a "Section 2.4 Objection"), setting forth a
specific description of the basis of the Section 2.4 Objection and the
adjustments to the PWC Report which GPC believes should be made, which Section
2.4 Objection must be delivered to Purchaser on or before the last day of such
30-day period.  Purchaser shall then have 30 days to review and respond to the
Section 2.4 Objection.  The parties shall attempt in good faith to reach an
agreement with respect to any matters in dispute.  If the parties are unable to
resolve all of their disagreements with respect to the determination of the
foregoing items within 45 days following the delivery of Purchaser's response to
the Section 2.4 Objection by GPC, they shall refer their remaining differences
to the CPA Firm, who shall determine in accordance with this Agreement, and only
with respect to the remaining differences so submitted, whether and to what
extent, if any, the PWC Report requires adjustment.  The parties shall direct
the CPA Firm to use its best efforts to render its determination within 30 days
after such submission.  In arriving at their decision the CPA Firm shall rely on
their expertise as certified public accountants and shall not be bound by the
submissions of the parties but shall be bound to apply the provisions of this
Agreement.  The CPA Firm's determination shall be conclusive and binding upon
Purchaser, Company, SCA, GPC and GPF.  The fees and disbursements of the CPA
Firm shall be paid one-half by Purchaser and one-half by GPC.  Purchaser and GPC
shall make readily available to the CPA Firm all relevant books and records  and
any work papers (including those of the parties' respective accountants)
relating to the PWC Report and all other items reasonably requested by the CPA

                                       4
<PAGE>

Firm.  The "Final PWC Report" shall be deemed to be (i) the PWC Report in the
event that no Section 2.4 Objection is delivered by GPC during the 30-day period
specified above, or (ii) if a Section 2.4 Objection is delivered by GPC, the PWC
Report, as adjusted by either (A) the agreement of the parties or (B) the

     (c) GPC shall have the opportunity to participate in the preparation of the
PWC Report by (i) observing any physical inventory taken in connection therewith

required by Purchaser's or Company's accountants).  The Company shall provide
reasonable advance notice to GPC of any such physical inventory or audit
planning meeting.

     (d) In reviewing any Section 2.4 Objection, Purchaser and its accountants
shall have full access to all information used by GPC in preparing such Section
2.4 Objection, including the work papers of GPC and GPC's accountants (subject
to the reviewing party executing any necessary waivers or indemnifications
required by GPC's accountants).

     (e) If the earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization
("EBITDA"), as shown in the Final PWC Report are less than sixty-eight million
dollars ($68,000,000), Seller agrees to make a payment to Purchaser in an
amount, in immediately available funds, equal to 7.4 times the difference
between $68,000,000 and the EBITDA shown in the Final PWC Report plus interest
on such amount at the prime rate (as set forth in the "Money Rates" section of

The Wall Street Journal) from the Closing Date through the date of payment.

     SECTION 2.5.  Accounting Principles.  The Closing Balance Sheet will be
                   ---------------------
prepared from the books and records of the Company using U.S. GAAP consistent
with those used in the preparation of GPC's audited consolidated balance sheet
as of December 30, 2000 and the related audited consolidated statement of income
for the fiscal year then ended, as filed by GPC with the Securities and Exchange
Commission.

     Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Closing Balance Sheet
shall be prepared based on the following accounting principles or methods:

     (1)  Inventories will be stated at the lower of FIFO cost or market;

     (2)  Inventories related to the SKU's that will be supplied to the Company
          pursuant to the Finished Goods Agreement shall be excluded;

     (3)  Intangible assets, other those set forth on the Pro Forma Business
          Balance Sheet, shall be excluded;

     (4)  Whereas GPC, SCA and Purchaser have agreed to settle the issue
          regarding certain employee benefit matters and, as a result the
          Purchase Price has already been reduced by $7 million, the entry for
          (x) the underfunding of the Wisconsin Tissue Mills Retirement Plans
          for Hourly Employees and the Wisconsin Tissue

                                       5
<PAGE>

          Mills, Inc. Chicago Operations Retirement Plan for Hourly Employees
          and (y) the accumulated post retirement medical benefit obligation for
          active union employees shall be $7,000,000;

     (5)  The book value of any asset acquired by or transferred to the Company
          after December 30, 2000 shall be disregarded to the extent that it is
          in excess of the cash consideration paid for the asset and no effect
          shall be given to any write-up of assets; and

     (6)  If the Net Working Capital of the Company at the Closing exceeds
          $130,000,000, the excess shall be disregarded.


                                  ARTICLE III
                   Representations and Warranties of Seller
                   ----------------------------------------

     Seller hereby represents and warrants to Purchaser as follows:

     SECTION 3.1.  Organization, Standing and Qualifications.
                   -----------------------------------------

     (a) GPC is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the State of Georgia.

     (b) The Company is a limited liability company duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware and has
full power and authority to carry on its business as presently conducted by it
and to own, lease and operate its properties and assets in the places where it

Purchaser and are true, correct and complete.

     (c) Schedule 3.1(c) sets forth (a) each jurisdiction in which the Company

business or businesses as are conducted by it and the type of business or
businesses for which it is so licensed, authorized or registered.  Each such
qualification, license, authorization and registration (collectively,
"Qualification") is in full force and effect and neither the character of the
properties owned or held under lease or license by the Company nor the nature of
the business conducted by the Company requires any additional Qualification in
any such jurisdiction or any Qualification in any other jurisdiction, except any
such jurisdiction wherein the failure to be so qualified, licensed, authorized
or registered would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company.  No approval, consent or notification in
connection with any Qualification is necessary in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements to
prevent the termination or withdrawal of any such Qualification as a result of

                                       6
<PAGE>

such transactions, except those the failure of which to obtain or make,
individually or in the aggregate, would not have a Material Adverse Effect on
the Company.

     SECTION 3.2.  Authority.
                   ---------

     (a)  Seller has all requisite power and authority to execute, deliver and
perform this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.  The execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby have been duly authorized by all necessary action on the
part of Seller and, in the case of the Ancillary Agreements and the consummation
of the transactions contemplated thereby, will be authorized by all necessary
action on the part of Seller (to the extent it is a party thereto) prior to the
Closing.  This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Seller and
constitutes, and each Ancillary Agreement to be entered into by Seller will be
duly executed and delivered at the Closing and when so executed and delivered
will constitute, its legal, valid and binding obligation enforceable against it
in accordance with its terms.

     (b)  Except as set forth on Schedule 3.2(b), the execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements by Seller does not,
and the consummation by Seller of the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby and the compliance by Seller with the terms hereof and thereof will not
conflict with, or result in any breach or violation of or default (with or
without the giving of notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise to a
right of amendment, termination, cancellation or acceleration of any obligation
or loss of a benefit under, or result in the creation of any Lien upon any of
the properties or assets of the Company under, any provision of (i) the articles
of incorporation or by-laws (or comparable organizational documents) of Seller
or the Company, (ii) subject to the filings and other matters referred to in the
following paragraph (c), any Law, applicable to Seller, the Company or the
properties, assets or business of the Company, (iii) any Permit that is held by
the Company, or (iv) any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any Contract
to which the Company is a party or by which its properties or assets is bound,

violations, defaults, rights or Liens, that, individually or in the aggregate,
would not have a Material Adverse Effect on any of the Company and Seller.

     (c)  No Permit is necessary or required to be obtained or made by or with
respect to the Company or Seller in connection with the execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements or the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, except for (i) notice to and
consent by the United States pursuant to Section V of the Consent Decree, (ii)
those listed on Schedule 3.2(c) hereto, which have been duly obtained and are in
full force and effect or which will have been duly obtained and will be in full
force and effect on and at the Closing Date and (iii) those the failure of which
to obtain or make, individually or in the aggregate, would not have a Material
Adverse Effect on either the Company or Seller.

     SECTION 3.3.  Compliance with Applicable Laws.
                   -------------------------------

     (a)  Schedule 3.3(a)(i) contains a complete and accurate list of all
material Permits that are held by the Company including Permits required

<PAGE>

Permits listed in Schedule 3.3(a)(i) constitute all of the material Permits,

each Permit identified or required to be identified in Schedule 3.3(a)(i).
Except as set forth in Schedule 3.3(a)(ii) and except for Environmental Laws

complied in all respects with, all Laws applicable to it or to the conduct or
operation of its business or the ownership or use of any of its properties or
assets except where the failure to be in compliance would not have, individually
or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. Except as set
forth on Schedule 3.3(a)(iii) or Schedule 3.12, no investigation or review by
any Governmental Entity which is related to the Business or the properties or
assets of the Company is pending or, to the knowledge of Seller or the Company,

any such investigation or review. This Section 3.3 does not apply to employee
benefits matters for which Section 3.11 is applicable, Tax matters for which
Section 3.13 is applicable or labor and employment matters for which Section
3.14 is applicable.

     (b)  The Company has delivered to Purchaser true and correct copies of all
material Permits.  None of Seller, the Company or any of their Affiliates has
received any written notification from any Governmental Entity to the effect
that there is lacking any certificate of occupancy or other Permit needed in
connection with the operation or use of any Owned Property or Leased Property.

     SECTION 3.4.  Litigation; Decrees.  Except as set forth in Schedules 3.4 or
                   -------------------

otherwise is related to the Business or any of the properties or assets of the
Company or that is related to or affects the transactions contemplated hereby or
in the Ancillary Agreements and (ii) the Company is not a party to, or engaged
in, or to the knowledge of Seller, has been threatened with, any Action, and, to
the knowledge of Seller, no event has occurred or condition exists which would
form the basis of an Action described in this Section 3.4.  Except as set forth

disclosed in Schedule 3.4, if adversely determined, will have a Material Adverse
Effect on the Company.

Permitted Liens.  This Section 3.5 does not apply to Intellectual Property

real property or leasehold interests (which are exclusively the subject of
Section 3.6).  Attached as Schedule 3.5 is a complete list of all the Company's
material properties, assets and equipment (other than the Excluded Assets) which
sets forth for each such property, asset or equipment, its location, the
approximate date in service and cost thereof and, as applicable, its use in the
Business and capacity.

Leased Property.  True and correct copies of each Real Property Lease have been
delivered to Purchaser prior to the date hereof.  Each Real Property Lease is in
full force and effect and will be in full force and effect on the Closing Date.
The Company is not in default under any Real Property Lease and no lessor is in
default under any Real Property Lease, except for any such defaults that would
not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company.  The consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and in the
Ancillary Agreements will not cause the termination of any Real Property Lease
or any default thereunder.

     (c) All easements, licenses and other real property rights materially
necessary for the use and operation (as currently operated) of and access to the
Owned Property and Leased Property and the Facilities and the supply of
utilities thereto have been obtained by the Company.  True and correct copies of
all such documents have been delivered to Purchaser.  Except as set forth on
Schedule 3.6(c), the buildings and improvements necessary for the operation of
the Business are located on the Owned Property or Leased Property.  Each Owned
Property and Leased Property has legal access to a public road.  There are no
easements burdening any Owned Property or Leased Property that would have a

has received any notice that any of the improvements on any Owned Property or
Leased Property do not comply with legal requirements for the current use and
occupancy thereof.

     (h) None of Seller, the Company or any of their Affiliates has any
knowledge of and the Company has not received any notice of, any condemnation
affecting any Owned Property or Leased Property.

     (i) All buildings, plants and structures which are part of the Owned
Property or Leased Property lie wholly within the boundaries of said property
and do not encroach upon the property of, or otherwise conflict with the
property rights of, any other Person except for such

                                       9
<PAGE>

encroachments and conflicts which do not, individually or in the aggregate, have
a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

     Company has any knowledge of any other such infringement by the Company;

            (ii)   no trademark registration or letters patent comprising the
     Company's Intellectual Property is the subject of any pending opposition,
     interference, cancellation proceeding, claim challenging the validity,

     the Company, has any such action been threatened by any Person;

           (iii)   none of the Company's Intellectual Property is subject to any

nor the Company knows of any reason why any such rights should be found invalid
or unenforceable.

     (f)     After the Restructuring the Company will own, free and clear of any
Liens, all of the Company's Intellectual Property necessary for the conduct of
the Business as currently conducted.

     (g)     Schedule 3.7(g)(i) contains a list of all computer software

liability.

coverage or any notice that a defense will be afforded with reservation of
rights or (ii) any notice of cancellation or any other indication that any

are being used and are performing the functions for which they were intended and

practices of the Company.

     (b)  The Physical Plant of the Company (taking into account the services to
be provided pursuant to, and the actions contemplated by, the Ancillary
Agreements and that portion of the Physical Plant located in the common area of
the Alsip, Illinois Condominium Association) is sufficient for the continued
conduct of the Business after the Closing in substantially the same manner as
conducted prior to the Closing (after giving effect to the Restructuring).

     SECTION 3.11.  Employee Benefits.
                    -----------------

     (a)  Schedule 3.11 contains an accurate and complete list of each Plan, in
each case currently maintained or contributed to by the Company or Seller or its
ERISA Affiliates on behalf of Employees or former Employees of the Company
located at, or employed for the exclusive benefit of, the Converting Facilities,
the Paper Mills and the Service Center (all the foregoing being herein called
"Seller's Benefit Plans").  Schedule 3.11(a) contains a list of (i) each Plan
for which Purchaser will assume any liability pursuant to this Agreement, the
Human Resources Agreement or by operation of law, other than a Multiemployer
Plan, ("Assumed Benefit Plan") and (ii) each Multiemployer Plan for which
Purchaser will assume any liability pursuant to this Agreement, the Human
Resources Agreement or by operation of law ("Assumed Multiemployer Plan").

                                       15
<PAGE>

     (b)  Seller has delivered, or will deliver prior to the Closing Date, to
Purchaser current, accurate and complete copies of (i) each Seller Benefit Plan
that has been reduced to writing and all amendments thereto, other than any

advisory agreements, administrative services agreements or similar agreements

annual report/return is required to be filed, the two most recent such annual
report/returns, together with all schedules and exhibits, (v) the summary plan

Multiemployer Plan, and in the case of each other Assumed Benefit Plan, any
similar employee summary (including but not limited to any employee handbook
description), (vi) to the knowledge of Seller, copies of any correspondence from
the IRS, Department of Labor ("DOL") or other U.S. government agency or
department relating to any audit or any current asserted or assessed penalty

liability or penalty (including, but not limited to, any correspondence relating
to the IRS's EPCRS, VCR or CAP programs and the DOL's amnesty programs for later
filers and non-filers), (vii) for each Assumed Benefit Plan that is a defined
benefit pension plan, copies of the two most recent actuarial valuation reports
and the most recent Form PBGC 1s, and (viii) for each Assumed Qualified Plan,
copies of all applicable compliance testing results (including without
limitation applicable nondiscrimination tests under Code Sections 401(a)(4),
401(k) and 401(m) and tests under Code Sections 402(g), 410(b), 415 and 416) for
the two most recent plan years.

     (c)  The Company would not incur any "withdrawal liability" as defined in
ERISA under any Multiemployer Plan that is an Assumed Multiemployer Plan if it
were to withdraw from such plan on November 30, 2000.  To the knowledge of the
Company and Seller after due inquiry, no such Assumed Multiemployer Plan is
insolvent or in reorganization.  None of the Company, Seller nor any ERISA
Affiliate has partially or completely withdrawn from a Multiemployer Plan within
the six year period immediately preceding the Closing Date or entered into a
agreement covered by Section 4204 of ERISA which has or would result in a
material liability to the Company.

     (d)  To the knowledge of Seller, each Assumed Qualified Plan is so
qualified and the trust under each Assumed Qualified Plan is exempt from
taxation under Section 501(a) of the Code. The IRS has issued a favorable
determination with respect to the qualified status of each Assumed Qualified
Plan, which takes into account amendments for which the remedial amendment
period has expired, and to the knowledge of the Company and Seller nothing has
been done or not done that could result adversely affect the qualified status of
such Assumed Qualified Plan and the IRS has taken no action to revoke any such
determination letter.

     (e)  Except as set forth on Schedule 3.11(e), no "reportable event" as
defined at Section 4043 of ERISA for which the 30 day notice provision has not
been waived or given has occurred with respect to any Assumed Benefit Plan
subject to Title IV of ERISA.  With respect to each Assumed Benefit Plan subject
to Section 412 of the Code, there is no accumulated funding deficiency which has
not been waived under such Assumed Benefit Plan.

                                       16
<PAGE>

     (f)  To the knowledge of Seller, no "prohibited transaction" within the
meaning of Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code has occurred with
respect to any Assumed Benefit Plan, which is not otherwise exempt by statute,
regulation or administrative ruling or opinion which has resulted in or is
reasonably likely to result in a material liability to the Company.  Except as
set forth in Schedule 3.11(f), there are no actions, suits or claims pending
(other than routine claims for benefits) nor are there any actions, suits or
claims (other than routine claims for benefits) that could reasonably be
expected to be asserted against any Assumed Benefit Plan or the assets or
fiduciaries of any Assumed Benefit Plan.  To the knowledge of Seller, no Assumed
Benefit Plan nor any fiduciary of an Assumed Benefit Plan has been the direct or
indirect subject of an audit, investigation or examination by any governmental
or quasi-governmental agency.

     (g)  Except for continuation of health coverage to the extent required
under Section 4980B of the Code or Section 601 et seq. of ERISA, or as set forth
on Schedule 3.11(g), there are no obligations under any Assumed Benefit Plan
providing welfare benefits after termination of employment.

     (h)  All contributions on behalf of Employees and former Employees to each
Assumed Benefit Plan have been made on a timely basis, except where such failure
to make timely payments is not reasonably likely to result in a Material Adverse
Effect.

can be amended, modified or terminated without advanced notice to or consent by
any Employee, former employee or beneficiary, except as required by law or by
any collective bargaining agreement.

Balance Sheet") and the related unaudited consolidated statement of income for
the twelve-month period ended December 30, 2000 (the "Company Income
Statement"), in each case prepared by the management of GPC including, in each
case, a true and complete description of all accounting policies and procedures
used in the preparation thereof (collectively, the "Company Financial
Statements").

     (b)  Attached as Schedule 3.18 is a true and correct analysis of the
financial position of the Business, the left hand column of which is the Company
Balance Sheet and the right hand column of which represents the balance sheet of
the Company as of December 30, 2000, assuming that the Restructuring had taken
place immediately before the closing of the accounts for the balance sheet (the
"Pro Forma Business Balance Sheet").  Attached as Schedule 3.18 is a true and
correct detailed analysis of the Company Income Statement, the right hand column
of which represents the unaudited pro forma income statement for the Business
for the same twelve-month period (the "Pro Forma Business Income Statement").
The Pro Forma Business Balance Sheet and the Pro Forma Business Income Statement
(collectively, the "Pro Forma Business Financial Statements") were each prepared
by the management of GPC in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby.  In each case, a true and complete description of all accounting
policies and procedures used in the preparation thereof are attached thereto.
The Inventories in the Pro Forma Business Balance Sheet have been valued at the
lower of FIFO cost or market.

     (c)  The Company Financial Statements were prepared from the books and
records of the Company and are true and correct and fairly present the financial
condition and results of

                                       21
<PAGE>

operation of the Company as of the dates and for the periods indicated. Except
as described in Schedule 3.18 the Company Financial Statements have been
prepared using U.S. GAAP consistent with those used in the preparation of GPC's
audited consolidated balance sheet as of December 30, 2000 and the related
audited consolidated statement of income for the 12-month period then ended, as
filed by GPC with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

     (d)  The Pro Forma Business Financial Statements were prepared from the
books and records of the Company and management of GPC believes they fairly
present on a pro forma basis the financial condition and results of operation of
the Business after giving effect to the Restructuring as of the dates and for
the periods indicated.  The Pro Forma Business Financial Statements contain a
detailed, true and complete and verifiable description of all adjustments and
the rationale and allocation method used for each adjustment and all other
assumptions used in the preparation of the Pro Forma Business Financial
Statements, and management of GPC believes that all of such adjustments and
assumptions correctly reflect the impact of the Restructuring.  All group,
corporate and other overhead costs and other allocated costs set forth in the
Pro Forma Business Income Statement have been allocated on the basis of the
factors set forth in the Pro Forma Business Financial Statements and are not
less than the proportional share of the actual costs for such items incurred by
GPC.

     In addition, the Pro Forma Business Balance Sheet entry for (x) the
underfunding of the Wisconsin Tissue Mills Retirement Plans for Hourly Employees
and the Wisconsin Tissue Mills, Inc. Chicago Operations Retirement Plan for
Hourly Employees and (y) the accumulated post retirement medical benefit
obligations for active union employees is $7,000,000.

     (e)  The accounts receivable set forth in the Pro Forma Business Balance
Sheet and Company Balance Sheet and to be set forth in the Final Closing Balance
Sheet arose, in the case of the Pro Forma Business Balance Sheet and Company
Balance Sheet, and except as disclosed on Schedule 3.18 will have arisen, in the
case of the Final Closing Balance Sheet, from bona fide sales and deliveries of
goods in the ordinary course of business and have been, in the case of the Pro
Forma Business Balance Sheet and Company Balance Sheet, and will have been, in
the case of the Final Closing Balance Sheet, adequately reserved against therein
in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

     (f)  All Inventory of the Company consists of good and saleable items of a
quality or quantity usable or salable at prevailing prices in the ordinary
course of the Company's business and consistent with past practice (after giving
effect to the Restructuring), is not stale, obsolete or slow moving and does not
relate to discontinued product lines.  The quantities of each item of such
Inventory (whether raw materials, work-in-progress, or finished goods) were
procured or produced for sale in the ordinary course of the Company's business
and consistent with past practice (after giving effect to the Restructuring),
and the volume of production or purchases thereof and of orders therefor have
been consistent with ordinary and necessary production, purchasing and orders.
All Inventory included in the Company Balance Sheet and Pro Forma Business
Balance Sheet or to be included in the Final Closing Balance Sheet is or will
be, as the case may be, reflected at the lower of cost or market value in
accordance with U.S. GAAP.

     (g)  The fixed assets reflected in the Pro Forma Business Balance Sheet
include all fixed assets necessary to support the Business except for fixed
assets that are associated with

                                       22
<PAGE>

goods and services provided pursuant to the Ancillary Agreements and not located
at the Facilities.

     (h)  Attached hereto as Schedule 3.18(h) is the projected statement of
income of the Business for fiscal year 2001 together with appropriate supporting
details and a statement of the underlying assumptions (the "Projections").  The
Projections have been prepared by GPC in light of the past operations of the
Company.  As of November 28, 2000 the Projections, including the underlying
assumptions, were believed by GPC to be reasonable and to represent the good
faith estimate of GPC and its senior management concerning the Business in 2001
and since such date nothing has come to the attention of GPC or its senior
management to change such belief in a material way provided that no
representation is made as to the impact of the expected change in ownership of
the Company on the prospects of the Business.  Without limiting the foregoing,
as of November 28, 2000 GPC was of the opinion that the assumptions regarding
the levels of overhead and other costs included in the Projections were
reasonable based on the historical results of the Company's operations and the
likely effect of the Restructuring, and in particular the adjustment to the
level of costs for the Business after giving effect to the distribution of the
Excluded Assets and since such date nothing has come to the attention of GPC or
its management which has caused it to change such opinion in a material way
provided that no representation is made as to the impact of the expected change
in ownership of the Company on the prospects of the Business.  GPC does not
represent or warrant that the results set forth in the Projections are
achievable by the Business.

     SECTION 3.19.  No Undisclosed Liabilities or Distributions.
                    -------------------------------------------

     (a)  Except as set forth in Schedule 3.19 or, to the extent it is
reasonably apparent from the review of any other Schedule hereto, as set forth
on such other Schedule attached hereto, the Company has no Liabilities (whether
absolute, accrued, contingent, or otherwise) except for Liabilities or
obligations reflected or reserved against in the Company Balance Sheet and
current Liabilities, which have been incurred since the date thereof in the
ordinary course of business and consistent with past practice and which will be
reflected on the Final Closing Balance Sheet.

     (b)  Since December 30, 2000, the Company has not made any distribution of
or otherwise transferred any of its assets or properties (including any cash) to
or for the benefit of any of its membership unit holders or any of their
respective Affiliates, other than any such distribution or transfer contemplated
by the Restructuring or the payment of interest on Company Indebtedness in
accordance with the terms and conditions of such indebtedness in existence on
the date hereof.

     SECTION 3.20.  Transactions with Seller and Affiliate. Schedule 3.20 sets
                    --------------------------------------
forth each transaction or series of related transactions (including, without
limitation, the sale, purchase exchange or lease of assets, property or
services) to which the Company is or was a party and which are or were for the
benefit of Seller or any Affiliate of Seller and all or a part of which were
entered into or performed within the last five years. All of such transactions
or series of related transactions set forth on or required to be set forth on
Schedule 3.20 were entered into in good faith and are on terms that are no less
favorable to the Company than those that would be available in a comparable
transaction in arm's-length dealings with an unrelated third party.

                                       23
<PAGE>

Sales to Seller or Seller's Affiliates have been made only to fill each
purchaser's immediate needs for resale. During the period from January 1, 2000
until the date hereof, the share of sales made to Seller and Seller's Affiliates
out of the total sales in the Business has remained constant in amount except
for variances that are not material.

the Membership Units of the Company not owned by it.  At the Closing, Purchaser
will acquire good and valid title to the Securities, free and clear of any
Liens.

     SECTION 3.22.  Capitalization.  On the date of this Agreement, the
                    --------------
Company's authorized capitalization consists solely of 100 common membership
units (the "Membership Units"), of which 100 Membership Units are issued and
outstanding to the Persons and in the amounts set forth on Schedule 3.22.
Seller has entered into an agreement pursuant to which it is entitled to
purchase the 5% membership interest it currently does not own on the terms and
conditions set forth therein.  The Securities represent all the outstanding
equity securities of the Company.  Such issued and outstanding Membership Units
are validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable.  Except (a) as set forth in
Schedule 3.22 hereto, and (b) for rights granted to Purchaser under this
Agreement, there are no outstanding options, warrants or other rights to
purchase, obtain or acquire, or any outstanding securities or obligations
convertible into or exchangeable for, or any voting agreements with respect to,
any Membership Units of the Company or any other securities of the Company and
the Company is not obligated, now or in the future, contingently or otherwise,
to issue or purchase any Membership Units of the Company or any other securities
of the Company to or from any Person.  There are no treasury Membership Units of
the Company.

     SECTION 3.23.  Subsidiaries and Equity Interests.  Except as set forth in
                    ---------------------------------
Schedule 3.23, the Company owns no capital stock, membership units or other
securities of any Person.

     SECTION 3.24.  GPF Authority, etc.  GPF is a limited liability corporation
                    ------------------
duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
State of Delaware.  GPF has all requisite power and authority to execute,
deliver and perform this Agreement and to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby.  The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement
and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly
authorized by all necessary action on the part of GPF.  This Agreement has been
duly executed and delivered by GPF and constitutes its legal, valid and binding
obligation enforceable against it in accordance with its terms.

     SECTION 3.25.  Notes.  GPF is the beneficial and record owner of the Notes,
                    -----
free and clear of any Liens.  GPF will sell, transfer, assign and deliver good
and valid title to the Notes.  At the Closing, Purchaser will acquire good and
valid title to the Notes free and clear of any Liens.  The outstanding aggregate

              Representations and Warranties of Purchaser and SCA
              ---------------------------------------------------

     Each of Purchaser and SCA, with respect to itself only, hereby represents
and warrants to Sellers as follows:

     SECTION 4.1.   Organization, Standing and Power.  It is a corporation duly
                    --------------------------------
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
jurisdiction in which it is incorporated and has the requisite corporate power
and authority to carry on its business as currently conducted.

     SECTION 4.2.   Authority.
                    ---------

     (a)  The execution and delivery by it of this Agreement and each Ancillary
Agreement to which it is a party and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby have been duly authorized by all necessary
corporate action on its part prior to the Closing.  This Agreement and each
Ancillary Agreement to which it is a party, when duly executed and delivered by
it, will constitute its legal, valid and binding obligation enforceable against
it in accordance with its respective terms.

     (b)  Each of Purchaser and SCA has all requisite power and authority to
execute, deliver and perform this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements to
which it is a party and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby.  The execution and delivery of this Agreement by each of Purchaser and
SCA does not, and the consummation by each of Purchaser and SCA of the
transactions contemplated hereby and the compliance by each of Purchaser and SCA
with the terms hereof will not conflict with, or result in any violation of or
default (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, any provision
of (i) its certificate of incorporation or by-laws (or comparable organizational
documents), (ii) subject to the filings and other matters referred to in Section
4.2(c), any law, judgment, order, decree, statute, ordinance, rule or regulation
applicable to it, or (iii) any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any
Contract to which it is a party or by which its properties or assets is bound
other than, in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii), any such conflicts,
violations or defaults, that, individually or in the aggregate, would not
materially impair its ability to perform its obligations under this Agreement.
Purchaser is a direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of SCA.

     (c)  No Permit is required to be obtained or made by or with respect to
each of Purchaser and SCA in connection with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement by it or the consummation by it of the transactions contemplated
hereby, except for (i) notice to and consent by the United States pursuant to
Section V of the Consent Decree, and (ii) those the failure of which to obtain
or make, individually or in the aggregate, would not materially impair its
ability to perform its obligations under this Agreement.

     SECTION 4.3.   Available Funds.  SCA has, and on the Closing Date will make
                    ---------------
available to Purchaser, sufficient funds to enable Purchaser to consummate the

<PAGE>

     SECTION 4.4.   Investment Intent. Purchaser is acquiring the Securities for
                    -----------------
its own account for investment purposes only and not with a view to, or for sale
or resale in connection with, any public distribution thereof or with any
present intention of selling, distributing or otherwise disposing of the
Securities in violation of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
"Securities Act"). Purchaser understands that the Securities have not been
registered under the Securities Act or any state securities or "blue-sky" laws
by reasons that depend upon, among other things, the bona fide nature of its
                                                     ---- ----
investment intent as expressed herein and as explicitly acknowledged hereby and
that under such laws and applicable regulations such securities may not be
resold without registration under the Securities Act unless an applicable
exemption from registration is available.

                    -----------------------------------------------

the Securities Act.  Purchaser, by reason of its business and financial
experience in business, has such knowledge, sophistication and experience in
business and financial matters as to be capable of evaluating the merits and
risks of the purchase of the Securities, is able to bear the economic risk of
such investment in the Company, and is able to afford a complete loss of such
investment.

     SECTION 4.6.   Litigation; Decrees.  (i) There is no Order in effect to
                    -------------------
which either Purchaser or SCA is a party that is related to or affects the
transactions contemplated hereby or in the Ancillary Agreements and (ii) neither
Purchaser nor SCA is a party to, or engaged in, or to the knowledge of Purchaser
or SCA, has been threatened with, any Action that is related to or affects the
transaction contemplated hereby or in the Ancillary Agreements, and, to the
knowledge of Purchaser and SCA, no event has occurred or condition exists which
would form the basis of any such Action.

                                   Covenants
                                   ---------

     SECTION 5.1.   Conduct of Business. During the period from the date of this
                    -------------------
Agreement and continuing until the Closing (except as expressly provided in this
Agreement or the Schedules or to the extent that the parties shall otherwise
consent in writing), Seller agrees and, as applicable, each of Purchaser and SCA
agrees, that:

     (a)  Ordinary Course.  Except for the Restructuring and with respect to
         ---------------
matters contemplated in the Ancillary Agreements or to the extent Purchaser
shall otherwise consent in writing, Seller agrees to cause the Company to
operate and maintain its properties and assets and otherwise conduct its
business only in the usual and ordinary course in substantially the same manner
as presently conducted, maintained and operated, and to cause the Company to use
all commercially reasonable efforts to preserve intact its properties and assets
in their present condition, including the integrity of the Company's trademarks
and brands.  Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement and the Human
Resources Agreement, Seller agrees to cause the Company to use commercially
reasonable efforts to (i) preserve intact its current business organization;
(ii) keep available the services of its current officers and employees; (iii)
preserve its relationship with customers, suppliers, licensers, licensees,
advertisers, distributors and others having business dealings with the Company;
(iv) retain for the benefit of the Company all material current customer
contracts on terms and conditions which are no less favorable to the

                                       26
<PAGE>

Company than the terms and conditions that are currently in existence; (v)
preserve goodwill; (vi) maintain all existing business permits, licenses,
qualifications and authorizations; and (vi) comply in all material respects with
applicable Laws, including Environmental Laws. Seller will cause the Company to

are no less favorable to the Company than those that would be available in a
comparable transaction in arm's-length dealings with an unrelated third party.
Sales to Seller or Seller's Affiliates shall be made only to fill each
purchaser's immediate needs for resale. Seller will, and agrees to cause the
Company to, discuss with Purchaser, SCA and their representatives, as and when
requested but upon reasonable prior notice, the status of the Company's
operations and finances. Seller agrees to cause the Company to not increase the
salary of any employee and not hire or terminate the employment of any employee
except in each case in the ordinary course of business and consistent with past
practices or in accordance with the terms of the Human Resources Agreement.

     (b)  Notice of Changes.  Seller shall promptly advise Purchaser in writing
          -----------------

Company.  In addition, from the date of this Agreement until the Closing Date,
Seller will promptly notify Purchaser in writing of (i) any notice or other
communication from any Person alleging that the Consent of such Person is or may
be required in connection with the execution, delivery or performance of this
Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby; (ii) any notice or other communication from any
Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby;
(iii) any actions or investigations commenced or, to the knowledge of Seller,
threatened, and related to the Company or its properties, assets or business
which could reasonable be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect; (iv) any
Order or notification relating to any material violation or claimed violation of
Law by the Company; (v) the existence or nonexistence or occurrence or
nonoccurrence of any event, condition or circumstance the existence or
nonexistence or occurrence or nonoccurrence of which does or would cause any
representation or warranty contained in this Agreement to be untrue or
inaccurate in any material respect at or prior to the Closing Date; and (vi) any
failure of Seller to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement
to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder; provided, however, that no
                                                  --------  -------
notice of the facts, conditions or circumstances referred to therein delivered
pursuant to this Section 5.1(b) may be considered in determining the fulfillment
of the conditions set forth in Article VI of this Agreement or be effective to
cure or correct any breach of a representation, warranty or covenant which would
have existed by reason of Seller's not giving such notice and will not limit or
otherwise affect the remedies available to Purchaser.

     (c)  Forbearance by Seller. Except for the Restructuring or as contemplated
          ---------------------
by the Ancillary Agreements or disclosed in Schedule 3.9(b), Seller will not

<PAGE>

          (iii)  increase or enhance in any manner the compensation or benefits
     of any of its Employees or pay any pension or retirement benefit not
     required by any existing Plan or Contract to any such Employee, or become a
     party to, amend or commit itself to any pension, retirement, profit-sharing

     required by Law, Plan or any Contract delivered to Purchaser prior to the
     date hereof, voluntarily accelerate the vesting of any compensation or
     benefit to any Employee of the Company; provided, however, that the

     Person will not be an Employee of the Company after the Closing;

determining the fulfillment of the conditions set forth in Article VI of this
Agreement or be effective to cure or correct any breach of a representation,
warranty or covenant which would have existed by reason of Purchaser's or SCA's
not giving such notice and will not limit or otherwise affect the remedies

                   -------------------
Company an amount equal to the aggregate amount of all accounts receivable net

     SECTION 5.11. Allocation; Tax Matters.
                   -----------------------

     (a) Within 180 days following the Closing, Purchaser shall prepare and
deliver to Seller a statement (the "Allocation Statement") allocating the
Purchase Price and any assumed Liabilities among the assets of the Company in
accordance with Treas. Reg. (S)1.1060-1T (or any comparable provision of state
or local tax laws).  Seller will have the right to raise reasonable objections
to the Allocation Statement within ten days after receipt thereof, in which case
Purchaser and Seller will negotiate in good faith to resolve said objections.
Purchaser and Seller

                                       31
<PAGE>

shall agree upon revisions to the Allocation Statement to reflect any
adjustments to the consideration for Tax purposes. Purchaser and Seller and each
of their respective Affiliates shall report the Tax consequences of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement in a manner consistent with the
Allocation Statement, as it may be revised from time to time, and shall not take
any position inconsistent therewith in any examination of any Tax Return, in any
refund claim or in any litigation or investigation, except as required by
applicable law.

     (b) Purchaser and Seller shall file and cause to be filed all Tax Returns
and execute such other documents as may be required by any taxing authority, in
a manner consistent with the Allocation Statement, as it may be revised from
time to time.  Purchaser shall prepare Internal Revenue Service Form 8594

by this Agreement based on the Allocation Statement, as it may be revised from
time to time, and deliver such form to Seller.  Purchaser and Seller shall file,
or cause the filing of, such form with each relevant taxing authority.

     (c) Seller shall bear, and to the extent permitted by law shall pay, all
transfer, documentary, sales, use, registration, stamp, value-added and other

contemplated by this Agreement and including the use of a Tax attribute to
reduce Taxes) ("Transfer Taxes"), and Seller shall reimburse Purchaser for any
Transfer Taxes paid by Purchaser within 30 days of Purchaser's written request.
Seller and Purchaser shall cooperate in timely making and filing all Tax Returns
as may be required to comply with the provisions of any Transfer Tax laws and in
making arrangements that lawfully minimize Transfer Taxes without increasing
other Taxes above the amount that would otherwise be payable in the absence of
such arrangements.  To the extent it is legally able to do so, Purchaser shall
deliver to Seller exemption certificates satisfactory in form and substance to
Seller with respect to Transfer Taxes if such delivery would reduce the amount
of Transfer Taxes that would otherwise be imposed.

     (d) At the Closing, Seller shall deliver to Purchaser a duly executed
certificate certifying that the transaction contemplated hereby is exempt from
withholding under Section 1445 of the Code.

taxable periods ending on or before the Closing Date.  Purchaser shall prepare
or cause to be prepared and shall file or cause to be filed all other Tax
Returns required of the Company or in respect of its assets or activities.  Any

that include the activities of the Company prior to the Closing Date shall,
insofar as they relate to the Company, be prepared in accordance with the
methodology used in prior taxable years.

     (f) Seller shall pay or cause to be paid all Taxes of the Company, its
assets and activities, due (i) for all tax periods ending on or before the
Closing Date and (ii) for that portion

cause to be paid all Taxes owed by the Company other than Taxes described in the
preceding sentence.

     (g) Purchaser and Seller shall each provide the other with such assistance

the Company.  Purchaser and Seller each shall, and shall cause their Affiliates
to, retain until seven years after the Closing Date all Tax Returns, schedules,
work papers and other records that are owned by such Person immediately after
the Closing and that relate to the Company, its assets and activities; after the
end of such period, before disposing of any such Tax Returns, schedules, work
papers or other records, each shall give notice to such effect to the other, and
shall give the other, at the other's cost and expense, a reasonable opportunity
to remove and retain all or any part of such Tax Returns, schedules, work papers
or other records as the other may select.

     (h) In the event any Tax authority informs Seller on the one hand, or
Purchaser on the other, of any notice of a proposed audit, claim, assessment or
other dispute concerning an amount of Taxes with respect to which the other
party may incur Liability hereunder, the party so informed shall promptly notify
the other party of such matter.  Such notice shall contain factual information
(to the extent known) describing any asserted Tax Liability in reasonable detail
and shall be accompanied by copies of the relevant portions of any notice or
other documents received from any Tax authority with respect to such matter.
The failure to give such notice shall not affect the indemnification provided
hereunder except to the extent that the other party has actually been prejudiced
as a result of such failure.

     (i) The filing party under this Section 5.11 shall control any audits,
disputes and administrative, judicial or other proceedings related to Taxes with
respect to which either party may incur Liability hereunder.  Subject to the
preceding sentence, in the event an adverse determination may result in each
party having responsibility for an amount of Taxes under this Section 5.11, each
party shall be entitled to fully participate in that portion of the proceedings
relating to the Taxes with respect to which it may incur Liability hereunder.
For purposes of this Section 5.11 the term "participation" shall include (i)
participation in the portion of conferences, meetings or proceedings with any
Tax authority, the subject matter of which includes an item for which such party
may have Liability hereunder; (ii) participation in appearances before any court
or tribunal, the subject matter of which includes an item for which a party may
have Liability hereunder; and (iii) with respect to the matters described in the
preceding clauses (i) and (ii), participation in the portion of the submission
and determination of the portion of the content of the documentation, protests,
memorandum of fact and law, briefs, and the conduct of oral arguments and
presentations.

     (j) In the case of any Straddle Period:  (i) the periodic Taxes of the
Company that are not based on income or receipts (e.g., property Taxes) for the
portion of any Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date (the "Pre-Closing Tax
Period") shall be computed based upon the ratio of the number of days in the
Pre-Closing Tax Period and the number of days in the entire Tax Period; and (ii)
Taxes of the Company for the Pre-Closing Tax Period (other than Taxes described
in clause (i)) shall be computed as if such taxable period ended as of the close
of business on the Closing Date, and in the case of any Taxes of the Company
attributable to the

                                       33
<PAGE>

ownership by the Company of any equity interest in any partnership of other
"flow-through" entity, as if the taxable period of such partnership ended as of
the close of business on the Closing Date.

     (k) Purchaser and Seller hereby agree to utilize the "Standard Procedure"
set forth in Revenue Procedure 96-60, 1996-2 C.B. 399, or a corresponding future
revenue procedure or other administrative pronouncement with regard to the
reporting requirements attributable to wages paid or to be paid to employees of
the Company.

settlement agreement without the consent of the Company, and such consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

            (iv)   Seller agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to

involved, then the Company shall have the right to undertake such Remedial
Action and Seller shall be responsible for indemnifying the Company for any
reasonable costs and liabilities associated with implementing such Remedial
Action.

dealings with any Governmental Entity regarding a Remedial Action and shall
promptly provide the Company with copies of all material environmental
information, including technical and analytical data, environmental reports,
assessments, evaluations, and correspondence or verbal or written information,
to or from any environmental consultant or Governmental Entity regarding a
Remedial Action.  Nothing herein shall be deemed to prevent the Company from
contacting or dealing with any Governmental Entity.

            (vi)   The Remedial Action shall be deemed complete when the
relevant Governmental Entity issues a binding determination that no further
Remedial Actions are required at such location at such time except for on-going
monitoring activities which shall be the sole responsibility of Seller. The
completion of any Remedial Action shall not relieve Seller of its obligation to
indemnify the Company for any further liability that may arise in the future
with respect to such conditions at the site of the Remedial Action.

            (vii)  Purchaser and/or the Company shall deliver notice of a claim
involving Remedial Action with reasonable promptness to Seller after becoming
aware of circumstances giving rise to such claim; provided, however, that
                                                  --------  -------
failure to give such notification shall (1) not affect the indemnification
provided hereunder except to the extent Seller shall have been actually
prejudiced as a result of such failure (except that Seller shall not be liable
for any expense incurred during the period in which Purchaser and/or the Company
failed to give such notice) and (2) notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, operate to extend the applicable time periods set
forth in Section 8.2(b) or 8.5(a).  Disputes concerning Seller's obligations
with respect to any Remedial Action shall be subject to good faith negotiations
between the Parties.  If the dispute is not resolved through negotiation, then
it shall be presented to an environmental consultant for a binding arbitration,
and any such disputes shall be resolved within 60 days of submission to the
environmental consultant.  The environmental consultant shall be chosen by
Seller from a list of three consultants from nationally recognized environmental
consulting firms submitted by Purchaser and the Company and none of the

                                       46
<PAGE>

consultants listed shall have a conflict of interest with respect to either
Party.  The Parties shall mutually agree on the procedures to conduct the
arbitration; provided, however, if the Parties can not agree on the procedures,
             --------  -------
then the environmental consultant shall specify the arbitration procedures.  The
environmental consultant shall be jointly retained by Seller and the Company who
shall share equally such environmental consultant's fees and expenses.

     (e)   If the Pre-Closing Environmental Liability for which Seller has
liability involves an Off-Site Environmental Liability, the resolution of such
matter shall be controlled by Seller.

     SECTION 8.4.  Losses Net of Insurance.  Subject to the insurer's
                   -----------------------
maintaining its right of recourse or contribution against a person who has
caused an injury or damage, the amount of any Loss for which indemnification is
provided under this Article VIII shall be net of any amounts recovered or
recoverable by the Indemnified Party under insurance policies with respect to
such loss, liability, claim, damage or expense.

     SECTION 8.5.  Limitation on Indemnification by Seller.
                   ---------------------------------------

     (a)   The obligation of Seller to indemnify and hold harmless Purchaser and
the Company for breaches of Seller's representations and warranties (except with
respect to the representations and warranties in Sections 3.21, 3.22 and 3.25)
shall terminate two years after the Closing Date; provided, that the obligation
                                                  --------
to indemnify for a breach of Seller's representations and warranties in Sections
3.5, 3.13 and 3.14 shall survive the Closing for a period equal to the
applicable statute of limitations, as extended or tolled, plus 90 days.  The
obligation of Seller to indemnify Purchaser and the Company for breaches of
Seller's covenants and agreements contained herein shall terminate two years
after the Closing Date except covenants which by their express terms continue
for a longer period, as to which such obligation to indemnify shall continue for
a period of two years after such obligation so terminates and for any breach of
Section 5.6 (in respect of which Seller's obligation to indemnify shall not
terminate).  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the obligation of Seller to
indemnify and hold harmless shall not terminate with respect to any item as to
which Purchaser or the Company shall have, before the expiration of the
applicable period, previously made a claim by delivering a notice pursuant to
this Article VIII (stating in reasonable detail the basis of such claim) to
Seller.  The obligation of Seller to indemnify and hold harmless Purchaser and
the Company pursuant to Section 8.3 shall terminate seven years after the
Closing Date, except with respect to any Off-Site Environmental Liability or the
matters listed on Schedule 8.5, in respect of which the obligation of Seller to
indemnify and hold harmless Purchaser shall not terminate.

     (b)   Subject to the last sentence of this Section 8.5(b), Seller shall not
have any liability under clause (a)(i) of Section 8.1 (other than with respect
to a breach of Section 3.19, 3.21, 3.22, 3.23 or 3.25) or under Section 8.3
unless the aggregate of all Losses for which Seller would, but for this Section
8.5(b) be liable exceeds on a cumulative pre-Tax basis an amount equal to
$2,000,000 (the "Seller's Threshold"), in which event the entire amount in
respect of such Losses in excess of $1,000,000 will be payable.  Subject to the
last sentence of this Section 8.5(b), the aggregate maximum amount recoverable
by Purchaser, the Company and their Affiliates and their respective officers,
directors, employees, stockholders, agents and representatives pursuant to
Section 8.1(a)(i) (other than with respect to a breach of Sections 3.21, 3.22
and 3.25) will not, in the aggregate, exceed $425,000,000 and pursuant to
Section 8.3 will

                                       47
<PAGE>

not, in the aggregate, exceed $850,000,000, less the amount of any
indemnification payments made pursuant to Section 8.1(a)(i). Except for Off-Site
Environmental Liabilities and any Environmental Liability associated with the
items identified on Schedule 8.5 for which this Section 8.5(b) shall not apply,
and for which Seller shall be entirely responsible, any individual claim of less
than $50,000 shall not be aggregated for purposes of reaching the Seller's
Threshold to the extent that such individual claim did not arise out of or
relate to similar facts and circumstances that form the basis for any other
individual claim.

     SECTION 8.6.  Procedures Relating to Third Party Claims (other than Tax
                   ---------------------------------------------------------
Liabilities).
------------

     (a)   In order for a Person making a claim for indemnification hereunder
(the "Indemnified Party"), to be entitled to any indemnification in respect of,
arising out of or involving a claim made by any third Person against the
Indemnified Party (other than with respect to Tax liabilities or matters,
procedures for which are specified in Section 5.11(h) and (i)) (a "Third Party
Claim"), such Indemnified Party must notify the Person from whom indemnity is
being sought (the "Indemnifying Party") in writing, and in reasonable detail, of
the Third Party Claim within ten business days after receipt by such Indemnified
Party of written notice of the Third Party Claim; provided, however, that
                                                  --------  -------
failure to give such notification shall (1) not affect the indemnification
provided hereunder except to the extent the Indemnifying Party shall have been
actually prejudiced as a result of such failure (except that the Indemnifying
Party shall not be liable for any expenses incurred during the period in which
the Indemnified Party failed to give such notice) and (2) notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this agreement, operate to extend the
applicable time periods set forth in Section 8.2(b) or 8.5(a).  Thereafter, the
Indemnified Party shall deliver to the Indemnifying Party, promptly after the
Indemnified Party's receipt thereof, copies of all notices and documents
(including court papers) received by the Indemnified Party relating to the Third
Party Claim.

     (b)   If a Third Party Claim is made against an Indemnified Party, the
Indemnifying Party will be entitled to participate in the defense thereof and,
if it so chooses, to assume the defense thereof with counsel selected by the
Indemnifying Party provided that such Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled
to assume the defense of any Third Party Claim (i) in which the Indemnified
Party and Indemnifying Party have or could reasonably be expected to have an
actual or potential conflict of interest or (ii) which involves entirely or
predominantly an environmental enforcement action encompassing a claim for
injunctive relief or a requirement to install pollution controls or other
capital improvements or restricts or increases the costs of operation
("Environmental Enforcement Claim").  Should the Indemnifying Party be entitled
and so elect to assume the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying
Party will not be liable to the Indemnified Party for any legal expenses
subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with the defense
thereof.  If the Indemnifying Party so assumes such defense, the Indemnified
Party shall have the right to participate in the defense thereof and to employ
counsel, at its own expense, separate from the counsel employed by the
Indemnifying Party, it being understood that the Indemnifying Party shall
control such defense.  The Indemnifying Party shall be liable for the fees and
expenses of counsel employed by the Indemnified Party for any period during
which the Indemnifying Party has not assumed or is not entitled to assume the
defense thereof (other than during any period in which the Indemnified Party
shall have failed to give notice of the Third Party Claim as provided above).
If the Indemnifying Party chooses pursuant to the first sentence of this Section
8.6(b) to defend or prosecute a Third Party Claim,

                                       48
<PAGE>

all the parties hereto shall cooperate in the defense or prosecution thereof.
Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the Indemnifying Party's
request) the provision to the Indemnifying Party of records and information
which are reasonably relevant to such Third Party Claim and making employees
(including any employee familiar with such Third Party Claim) available on a
mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of
any materials provided hereunder. If the Indemnifying Party chooses to defend or
prosecute any Third Party Claim pursuant to the first sentence of this Section
8.6(b), the Indemnified Party will agree to any settlement, compromise or
discharge of such Third Party Claim which the Indemnifying Party may recommend
and which by its terms obligates the Indemnifying Party to pay the full amount
of the liability in connection with such Third Party Claim unless (i) such Third
Party Claim involves an Environmental Enforcement Claim or (ii) such settlement
would unreasonably interfere with the normal operations of the Indemnified Party
or cause material damage to it. Whether or not the Indemnifying Party shall have
assumed the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall not
admit any liability with respect to, or settle, compromise or discharge, such
Third Party Claim without the Indemnifying Party's prior written consent (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld).

     SECTION 8.7.  Procedures Relating to Non-Third Party Claims.  In order for
                   ---------------------------------------------
an Indemnified Party to be entitled to any indemnification provided for under
this Agreement in respect of a claim that does not involve a Third Party Claim
or a Remedial Action, the Indemnified Party shall deliver notice of such claim
with reasonable promptness after having become aware of the existence of such
claims to the Indemnifying Party. The failure by any Indemnified Party to so
notify the Indemnifying Party shall (1) not relieve the Indemnifying Party from
any liability which it may have to such Indemnified Party under this Agreement,
except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party shall have been actually
prejudiced by such failure (except that the Indemnifying Party shall not be
liable for any expenses incurred during the period in which the Indemnified
Party failed to give such notice) and (2) notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, operate to extend the applicable time
periods set forth in Section 8.2(b) or 8.5(a). If the Indemnifying Party has
timely disputed its liability with respect to such claim, the Indemnifying Party
and the Indemnified Party shall proceed in good faith to negotiate a resolution
of such dispute and, if not resolved through negotiations, such dispute shall be
resolved by litigation in an appropriate court of competent jurisdiction.

     SECTION 8.8.  [Intentionally Omitted]

     SECTION 8.9.  Acknowledgment.  The indemnities provided for in Article VIII
                   --------------
shall not be construed as an admission or conclusion, express or implied, as to
liability or damages in respect of the subject matter of such indemnities.

     SECTION 8.10. Tax and Accounting.  Indemnities shall constitute a
                   ------------------
reduction of the Purchase Price.  Each party hereto shall, for tax and
accounting purposes, treat any indemnity paid to Purchaser hereunder as a
reduction of the Purchase Price.

     SECTION 8.11. Reasonableness of Parties; Obligation to Mitigate.  Each
                   -------------------------------------------------
party agrees that notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article VIII,
it will act to mitigate any Loss

                                       49
<PAGE>

or potential Loss and will otherwise act reasonably in enforcing its rights
under, and otherwise dealing with the other parties hereto in connection with,
this Article VIII.
