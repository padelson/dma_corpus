Certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented shares
of Company Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect to such

form that immediately prior to the Effective Time evidenced shares of Company
Common Stock (each, a " _Certificate_ "), an amount in cash sufficient to pay
the aggregate Merger Consideration, and (ii) instruct the Paying Agent to pay
the Merger Consideration in accordance with this Agreement. The Merger
Consideration deposited with the Paying Agent pursuant to this _Section

, _however_ , that any such investment or any payment of earnings from any
such investment shall not modify Parents obligation to pay the Merger
Consideration pursuant to this _Section 3.02(a)_. Any interest or income
produced by such investments shall not be deemed part of the Exchange Fund and
shall be payable as directed by Parent. In the event that the funds in the
Exchange Fund shall be insufficient to make the payments contemplated by
_Section 3.01_, Parent shall promptly deposit, or cause to be deposited,
additional funds with the Paying Agent in an amount that is equal to the
deficiency in the amount required to make such payments. The Paying Agent
shall cause the Exchange Fund to be (A) held for the benefit of the holders of
shares of Company Common Stock and (B) applied promptly to making the
payments provided for in _Section 3.01(b)_. The Exchange Fund shall not be
used for any purpose that is not expressly provided for in this Agreement.

(b) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock; Transfer Books_. The
Merger Consideration paid by the Paying Agent in accordance with the terms of
this 

 



-16-    _Section 3.02_ upon conversion of any shares of Company Common Stock shall
be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to
such shares of Company Common Stock and after the Effective Time there shall
be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the
Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent
for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in _Section
3.03_.

 

(c) _Payment of Option Consideration_. Promptly following (but in no event
less than two Business Days after) the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit,
or cause to be deposited with the Surviving Corporation cash in an aggregate
amount, together with any cash in the Companys bank accounts immediately
prior to the Closing, equal to the aggregate Option Consideration payable to
all Optionholders pursuant to _Section 3.01(d)_. The Option Consideration
shall be paid by the Company through its payroll system (to the extent
practicable), or if not practicable checks for such payment shall be drawn by
the Surviving Corporation and sent by overnight courier to the holders last
address on the Companys records, in each case, as soon as reasonably
practicable after the Effective Time.

 

Section 3.03 _Exchange of Shares_.

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall
cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of a Certificate (i) a letter of
transmittal in customary form (which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon
delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent), and (ii) instructions for
use in effecting the surrender of Certificates in exchange for the Merger
Consideration issuable and payable in respect thereof (in accordance with
_Section 3.01(b)_).

 

(b) If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to any Person other
than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered in exchange
therefor, it shall be a condition of the payment thereof that the Certificate
so surrendered shall be properly endorsed (or accompanied by an appropriate
instrument of transfer) and otherwise in proper form for transfer, and that
the Person requesting such exchange shall pay to the Paying Agent in advance
of any transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason of the payment of
the Merger Consideration to any Person other than the registered holder of the
Certificate surrendered or required for any other reason relating to such
holder or requesting Person, or shall establish to the reasonable satisfaction
of Parent and the Paying Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

 

(c) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the
Shareholders for six months after the Effective Time shall be paid, at the
request of Parent, to Parent. Any Shareholder who has not theretofore complied
with this _Section 3.03_ shall thereafter look only to the Surviving
Corporation for payment of the Merger Consideration payable in respect of each
share of Company Common Stock held by such Person at the Effective Time as
determined pursuant to this Agreement, without interest thereon.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, none of Parent, the
Company, the Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent, Merger Sub or any other
Person shall be liable to any former Shareholder for any amount properly
delivered to a

 



-17-   public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Laws. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by former holders of
Certificates five years after the Effective Time (or such earlier date
immediately prior to such time when the amounts would otherwise escheat to or
become property of any Governmental Entity) shall become, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, the property of Parent free and clear of any
claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto.

(d) In the event that any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen
or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
Parent or the Paying Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond in such
amount as Parent may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against

-28-  (g) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is a party to any Contract,
agreement, plan or arrangement covering any employee or former employee
thereof that, individually or collectively, could give rise to imposition of
any excise Tax or the payment of any amount that would not be deductible by
reason of Section 280G of the Code. Except as set forth on _Section 4.11(g)_
of the Company Disclosure Schedule, the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement will not (either alone or upon the occurrence
of additional subsequent events) (i) result in any payment of severance or

obligated under, any agreement that provides for a gross up of Taxes imposed

has been operated in material compliance with Section 409A of the Code. No
Company Stock Option or other right to acquire Company Common Stock or other
equity of the Company (i) has been issued with an exercise price less than the
fair market value of the underlying equity as of the date that such option or
right was granted; (ii) has any feature for the deferral of compensation other

for in accordance with GAAP in the Companys financial statements.

(i) None of the Company, any Company Subsidiary, or, to the Knowledge of the

with respect to any Company Benefit Plan, engaged in or been a party to any
non-exempt "prohibited transaction," as such term is defined in Section 4975
of the Code or Section 406 of ERISA, which could reasonably be expected to
result in the imposition of a material penalty assessed pursuant to Section
502(i) of ERISA or a material Tax imposed by Section 4975 of the Code, in
each case applicable to the Company, any Company Subsidiary or any Company
Benefit Plan or for which the Company or any Company Subsidiary has any
indemnification obligation. 

(j) All material required contributions, premiums and other payments required
to be made with respect to any Company Benefit Plan have been timely made,

Company Material Adverse Effect.

the United States substantially for employees who are situated outside the
United States (the " _Foreign Plans_ "):

(i) all employer and employee contributions to each Foreign Plan required by
Law or by the terms of such Foreign Plan have been made, or, if applicable,
accrued in accordance with normal accounting practices;

 

(ii) to the Knowledge of the Company, (A) the fair market value of the assets
of each funded Foreign Plan and the liability of each insurer for any Foreign
Plan funded through insurance or the book reserve established for any Foreign
Plan, together with any accrued contributions, is sufficient to procure or
provide for the accrued benefit obligations, as of the Closing Date, with
respect to all current or former participants in such Foreign Plan according
to the actuarial assumptions and valuations most recently used to determine
employer contributions to such Foreign Plan, and (B) no transaction
contemplated by this Agreement shall cause such assets or insurance
obligations to be less than such benefit obligations; and

(iii) to the Knowledge of the Company, each Foreign Plan required to be
registered has been registered and has been maintained in good standing with
applicable Governmental Entities.

Section 4.12 _Compliance with Applicable Law; Permits_.

(a) None of the Company or any Company Subsidiary is in violation of, or has
violated, any provisions of any applicable Law or requirements of any
Governmental Entity, except for any such violations that would not reasonably
be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

(b) Each of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries is in possession of all
franchises, grants, authorizations, licenses, permits, easements, variances,
exceptions, consents, certificates, certifications, approvals and orders of
any Governmental Entity required for each of the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries to own, lease and operate its respective assets and properties
or to carry on its respective business as it is now being conducted (the "
_Permits_ "), except where the failure to have, or the suspension or
cancellation of, any of the Permits has not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. No revocation, suspension
or cancellation of any of the Permits is pending or, to the Knowledge of the
Company, threatened, and there have not occurred any defaults
under, violations of, or events giving rise to a right of termination,
amendment or cancellation of any of the Permits (with or without notice, the
lapse of time or both), except where the revocation, suspension or
cancellation of any of, or defaults under, violations of, or events giving
rise to a right of termination, amendment or cancellation of, the Permits has
not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect. Neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries has,
since December 1, 2007, received any written notice that is not fully resolved
from any Governmental Entity alleging that it is not in compliance in all
material respects with any Permit. All Permits are in full force and effect
in all material respects and, since December 1, 2007, neither the Company nor
any Company Subsidiary has received any written notice from any Governmental
Entity asserting that the Company or any Company Subsidiary is not in
compliance with any Law or material Permit.

 



-30-  (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this _Section
4.12_, no representation or warranty shall be deemed to be made in this
_Section 4.12_ in respect of environmental, Tax, employee benefits, labor or

months ended November 30, 2010). Since December 1, 2010, neither the Company
nor any Company Subsidiary has received any written or, to the Knowledge of
the Company, oral notice from any customer, supplier or distributor to the
effect that any customer, supplier or distributor (a) has changed, modified,
amended or reduced, or is reasonably likely to change, modify, amend or
reduce, its business relationship with the Company or any Company Subsidiary
in a manner that is reasonably expected to result in a Company Material
Adverse Effect, or (b) will fail to perform, or is reasonably likely to fail
to perform, its obligations under any Contract with the Company or any
Company Subsidiary in any manner that is reasonably expected to result in a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

force and effect, is valid and enforceable against the Company and, to the
Knowledge of the Company, is valid and binding on the other parties thereto,
except as such enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy,

equity. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary, as applicable, (i) is
in default under any Company Contract or (ii) has committed or failed to

constitute a default under any Company Contract except, in each case, with

respect to any transfer or assumption of the Export and Import Approvals or
any Permit or novation relating to a Government Contract held by the Company

by the other party. The Company has made available to Parent true, complete
and correct copies of all Company Contracts.

this Agreement, or (d) that would not reasonably be expected to result in a

without any further action on the part of the Shareholders or the Company
Board.

Section 4.17 _Title to Property_.

 

(a) _Real Property_. Except as set forth on _Section 4.17(a)_ of Company
Disclosure Schedule, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary owns any

forth a list of all real property currently owned by the Company or any
Company Subsidiary (the " _Company Owned Facilities_ "), the size of each
site, the uses of each site and all Liens (other than Permitted Liens) on each
site. The Company or one of the Company Subsidiaries has fee title to each
Company Owned Facility, free and clear of any Liens other than Permitted
Liens. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company does not,
and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will not, result
in any breach of or constitute a default (or an event that with notice
or lapse of time or both would become a default) thereunder, or materially
impair the rights of the Company or any Company Subsidiary or alter the rights
or obligations of any party thereunder, or give to others any rights of
termination, amendment, acceleration or cancellation thereunder, or otherwise
adversely affect the continued use and possession of the Company Owned
Facilities for the conduct of business of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries as presently conducted.

 

(b) _Personal Property_. The Company and the Company Subsidiaries have good,
valid and marketable title to all tangible personal property owned by them on
the date hereof, free

 



-34-   and clear of all Liens other than Permitted Liens, except where the failure

Material Adverse Effect. With respect to personal property used in the
business of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries which is leased rather
than owned, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is in default under

result in a Company Material Adverse Effect.

master lessor and/or lessee, the date and term of the lease, license, sublease
or other occupancy right and each amendment thereto, the size of the premises

each Company Lease is valid and binding in accordance with its terms (except
as such enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws affecting or relating to
creditors rights generally and is subject to general principles of equity), in
full force and effect, and there is not under any Company Lease any existing
default by the Company or any Company Subsidiary or, to the Knowledge of the
Company, the lessors thereunder, or any event which with notice or lapse of
time would constitute such a default; and (ii) the Company or one of the
Company Subsidiaries quietly enjoys the premises provided for in each Company
Lease.

(d)  _Company Facilities_. The Company has made available to Parent true,
correct and complete copies of all leases, lease guaranties, licenses,
subleases, agreements for the leasing, use or occupancy of, or otherwise
granting a right in or relating to the Company Leased Facilities, including
all amendments, terminations and modifications thereof (" _Company Leases_ ").
Except as would not reasonably be expected to result in a Company Material
Adverse Effect, the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company
does not, and the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby will not, result in any breach of or constitute a default
(or an event that with notice or lapse of time or both would become a
default) under, or impair the rights of the Company or any Company Subsidiary
or alter the rights or obligations of the sublessor, lessor or licensor under,
or give to others any rights of termination, amendment, acceleration
or cancellation of, any Company Leases or otherwise adversely affect the
continued use and possession of the Company Leased Facilities for the conduct
of business of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as presently
conducted.

such losses and risks and in such amounts as the management of the Company
reasonably has

 



-35-   determined to be prudent in accordance with industry practice (taking into
account the cost and availability of such insurance) except, in each case, as
would not reasonably be expected to result in a Company Material Adverse
Effect. The Company and each Company Subsidiary are in compliance with their
insurance policies and are not in default under any of the terms thereof
except, in each case, as would not reasonably be expected to result in a
Company Material Adverse Effect. Each such policy is outstanding and in full
force and effect (other than due to the ordinary expiration of the term
thereof). All premiums and other payments due under any such policy have been
paid.

 

Section 4.19 _Environmental Matters_. Except in each case as would not
reasonably be expected to result in a Company Material Adverse Effect:

Company and the Company Subsidiaries, are in compliance in all respects with
applicable Environmental Laws, which compliance includes obtaining,
maintaining and compliance with any franchises, grants, authorizations,
permits, leases, easements, variances, exceptions, consents, certificates,
certifications, approvals and orders of any Governmental Entity required for
the conduct of its respective business as presently and planned to
be conducted under applicable Environmental Laws (" _Environmental Permits_
").

water and surface water thereof, that the Company has at any time owned,
operated, occupied or leased.

 

(e) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has (i) exposed its

as to create any liability for the Company or any Company Subsidiary; (ii)
disposed of, transported, sold, released, stored, or manufactured (or
permitted any third party to dispose of, transport, sell, release, store, or

Substance, in violation of any Environmental Law or, to the Knowledge of the
Company, to any location or facility that is not in compliance in any respect
with applicable Environmental Laws; or (iii) violated, failed to provide any
notice, or failed to take legally mandated action with respect to end-of-life
disposal of any such Hazardous Substance (or any product containing a
Hazardous Substance).

 



-36-  (f) Except as would not be reasonably expected to result in a Liability of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary, the Company has not entered into any

in any Employee IP Agreement that is related to any Company Product or to any
other aspect of the business of the Company or any Company Subsidiary
(collectively, the " _Employee Retained IP_ ") is included in (or claimed or
purported to be included in) any Intellectual Property or Intellectual
Property Rights included in any Company Products (other than Employee
Retained IP that is generally available to the public under Open Source
license terms).

 

(h) _Enforceability, Validity of IP_. To the Knowledge of the Company, there
are no facts or circumstances that would be reasonably expected to render
invalid or unenforceable any of the Intellectual Property Rights included in
the Owned Company Intellectual Property (or provide any reasonable grounds
therefor). To the Knowledge of the Company, there are no facts
or circumstances that would reasonably be expected to adversely affect,
limit, restrict, impair or impede the ability of the Surviving Corporation and
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to use and practice the Owned Company
Intellectual Property from and after the Effective Time in substantially the
same manner in which it was used prior to the Effective Time. Since January 1,
2009, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has received any written
notice of any Action challenging the validity or enforceability of any of the
Registered Company Intellectual Property or the Owned Copyrights, or
containing any threat on the part of any Person to bring an Action that any of
the Registered Company Intellectual Property or the Owned Copyrights is
invalid, is unenforceable or has been misused.

(i) _No Infringement or Misappropriation of Company IP_. To the Knowledge of
the Company, no third party is infringing, misappropriating, using or
disclosing without authorization, or otherwise violating any Intellectual
Property Rights owned or exclusively licensed by the Company or any
Company Subsidiary. Since January 1, 2009, neither the Company nor any
Company Subsidiary has commenced any Action with respect to infringement or
misappropriation of any Intellectual Property Rights owned by or exclusively
licensed to the Company or any Company Subsidiary against any third party.
Since January 1, 2009, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has

included in the Owned Company Intellectual Property or suggesting that any
other Person has any claim of legal or beneficial ownership with respect
thereto.

 

(j) _Infringement by the Company_. To the Knowledge of the Company, none of
the Company, any Company Subsidiary, or any Company Product infringes,
misappropriates, uses or discloses without authorization, or otherwise
violates any Intellectual Property Rights of any Person. Since January 1,
2005, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has received any notice
of any Action relating to any of the foregoing and, to the Knowledge of the
Company, there are no facts, circumstances or information that would be
expected to be the basis for such Action. Since 

 



-39-   January 1, 2005, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has received
any communication inviting the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries to
take a license, covenant not to sue or the like with respect to a third
partys Intellectual Property Rights, other than in connection with licenses
or covenants not to sue granted to the Company or the Company Subsidiaries in
the Ordinary Course of Business and not related to any infringement or other
violation by the Company or any Company Subsidiary.

(k) _Ownership; Licenses_. The Company and the Company Subsidiaries solely
and exclusively own all right, title and interest (including the sole right to

granted to customers of the Company or any Company Subsidiary pursuant to
written agreements with respect to Company Products in the Ordinary Course of
Business), and have not exclusively licensed any Intellectual Property
or Intellectual Property Rights to any third party, and are under no
obligation to grant any such licenses. Following the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation will own or have (pursuant to the Company Intellectual
Property Agreements and the Companys and the Company Subsidiaries other
Contracts) the same rights as Company and the Company Subsidiaries had
immediately prior to the Effective Time with respect to all Company
Intellectual Property and all other Intellectual Property and Intellectual
Property Rights used in any Company Products or in the development of any
Company Products.

(l)  _No Government Funding and Rights_. No government funding, facilities or
resources of a university, college, other educational institution, multi-

used in the development of the Owned Company Intellectual Property, and, set
forth in _Section 4.20(l)_ of the Disclosure Schedule, no Owned Company
Intellectual Property was developed pursuant to the requirements of a

contemplated hereby will violate or result in the breach, material
modification, cancellation, termination or suspension of, loss of any rights
or acceleration of any payments under the Company Intellectual Property
Agreements (or give rise to any right with respect to any of the foregoing).
Following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will have and be

and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement not occurred, without the
payment of any additional amounts or consideration other than ongoing fees,
royalties or payments that Company and Company Subsidiaries would otherwise
have been required to pay pursuant to the Company Intellectual Property
Agreements. No Contract, arrangement, commitment or understanding to which the
Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party or otherwise bound will cause or
require (or

Corporation) with respect to licensing or granting of any Owned Company
Intellectual Property Rights (other than licenses that survive with respect to
the copyright in contributions made during such past participation).

requirement, condition, limitation, understanding, agreement or order so long

binding on the Company in the event that the Closing occurs.

 

(c) Nothing in this _Section 6.07_ shall be deemed to prevent the Company or
the Company Board from taking any action that it is permitted or required to
take under, and in compliance with, _Section 6.10_ or that it is required to
take under applicable Law.

Section 6.08 _Employees; Employee Benefit Plans_.

similar payments) made under the Company Benefit Plans for the remainder of

case of clause (i), (ii) or (iii) above, where doing so would cause a
duplication of benefits.

(c) Nothing contained in this _Section 6.08_ or elsewhere in this Agreement,

no later than five Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall
provide Parent with evidence that such 401(k) Plan(s) have been terminated

directors (or other governing body) of the applicable Company Subsidiary. The
form and substance of such resolutions shall be subject to the reasonable
prior review and approval of Parent. The Company also shall take such other
actions in furtherance of terminating such 401(k) Plan(s) as Parent may
reasonably require. In the event that termination of a 401(k) Plan would
reasonably be anticipated to trigger liquidation charges, surrender charges
or other fees, then the Company shall provide a reasonable estimate of the
amount of such charges and/or fees in writing to Parent no later than ten
Business Days prior to the Closing.

 

Section 6.09 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_.

severally (i) indemnify and hold harmless each individual who served as a
director and/or officer of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries
prior to the Effective Time (collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") to
the fullest extent authorized or permitted by Pennsylvania law, as now or
hereafter in effect, in connection with any Claim and any judgments, fines
(including excise Taxes), penalties and amounts paid in settlement (including
all interest, assessments and other charges paid or payable in connection with
or in respect of such judgments, fines, penalties or amounts paid
in settlement) resulting therefrom; and (ii) promptly pay on behalf of or,
within 30 days after any request for advancement, advance to each of the
Indemnified Parties, to the fullest extent authorized or permitted by
Pennsylvania law, as now 

 



-58-   or hereafter in effect, any Expenses incurred in defending, serving as a
witness with respect to or otherwise participating in any Claim in advance of
the final disposition of such Claim, including payment on behalf of or
advancement to the Indemnified Party of any Expenses incurred by such
Indemnified Party in connection with enforcing any rights with respect to such
indemnification and/or advancement, in each case without the requirement of
any bond or other security, but in the case of advancement of Expenses upon
receipt of an undertaking, to the extent required by applicable Law, from such
Indemnified Party to repay such advanced Expenses if it is determined by
a court of competent jurisdiction in a final order that such Indemnified
Party was not entitled to indemnification hereunder with respect to such
Expenses. In the event any Claim is brought against any Indemnified Party,
Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall each use all reasonable efforts to
assist in the vigorous defense of such matter, _provided_ that neither Parent
nor the Surviving Corporation shall settle, compromise or consent to the entry
of any judgment in any Claim (and in which indemnification could be sought by
such Indemnified Party hereunder) without the prior written consent of such
Indemnified Party if and to the extent that the claimant seeks any non-
monetary relief from such Indemnified Party, which consent will not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. The indemnification and
advancement obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation pursuant to
this _Section 6.09(a)_ shall extend to acts or omissions occurring at or
before the Effective Time and any Claim relating thereto (including with
respect to any acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of
this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
and any Claim relating thereto) and all rights to indemnification and
advancement conferred hereunder shall continue as to an individual who has
ceased to be a director or officer of the Company or any Company Subsidiary
prior to the Effective Time and shall inure to the benefit of such
individuals heirs, executors and personal and legal representatives. In
connection with any determination as to whether the Indemnified Parties are
entitled to the benefits of this _Section 6.09(a)_, the burden of proof
shall be on Parent and the Surviving Corporation to establish that an
Indemnified Party is not so entitled.

(b) From the Effective Time until the sixth anniversary of the Effective
Time, Parent shall cause the Company Articles and the Company Bylaws to
contain provisions no less favorable to each Indemnified Party with respect to
limitation of liabilities of directors and officers and indemnification than
those that are contained in such documents as of the date of this Agreement.

 

(c) As of the Effective Time, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Company
shall maintain in full force and effect for a period of six years after the
Closing Date (or, if any claim arising out of or pertaining to matters that
relate to an Indemnified Partys duties or service as a director, officer,
trustee, employee, agent or fiduciary of the Company, any Company Subsidiary
or any employee benefit plan maintained by any of the foregoing at or prior to
the Effective Time is asserted or made within such six-year period, Parent
shall ensure that such insurance remains in effect until final disposition of
such claim) a prepaid directors and officers liability insurance "tail"
policy or policies providing each individual currently covered by the
Companys directors and officers liability insurance coverage for
events occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including acts or
omissions relating to the approval of this Agreement and consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby) that is no less favorable than the Companys
existing policy;  _provided_ ,

 



-59-    _however_ , that Parent may substitute therefor policies of at least the
same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions that are in the
aggregate no less advantageous to such individuals than the terms and
conditions of the existing directors and officers liability insurance policy
of the Company from reputable carriers having a rating comparable to the
Companys current carrier; _provided_ ,  _further_ , _however_ , that, if the
aggregate annual premiums for such policies exceed 275% of the current
aggregate annual premiums, Parent shall provided or cause to be provided a
policy for such individuals with the best coverage as shall then be available
at an annual premium of 275% the current aggregate annual premiums.

(d) The provisions of this  _Section 6.09_ shall survive the consummation of
the Merger and (i) are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and
representatives and (ii) are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any
other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such Person may have
by contract or otherwise. The obligations of Parent or the Surviving
Corporation under this _Section 6.09_ shall not be terminated (other than a
valid termination pursuant to _Article VIII_) or modified in such a manner as
to adversely affect the rights of any Indemnified Party under this _Section
6.09_ without the consent of such affected Indemnified Party. Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to perform all of the obligations of the
Surviving Corporation under this _Section 6.09_.

(e) From the Effective Time until the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time,
if Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns
shall (i) consolidate with or merge into any other Person and shall not be
the continuing or surviving Person of such consolidation or merger, or (ii)
transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person,
then, in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that the
successors and assigns of Parent and the Surviving Corporation, as the case
may be, assume all of the obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation
set forth in this _Section 6.09_.

 

Section 6.10 _Go Shop; Acquisition Proposals_.

(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
during the period beginning on the date of this Agreement and continuing until
12:01 a.m. New York, New York time on the date that is the 40th day following
the date of this Agreement (the " _No-Shop Period Start Date_ "), the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries and their respective directors, officers,
employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants, and other advisors and
representatives (collectively, " _Company Representatives_ ") shall have the
right (acting under the direction of the Company Board or any authorized
committee thereof) to (i) initiate, solicit and encourage Acquisition
Proposals (or inquiries, proposals or offers or other efforts or attempts that
are reasonably expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal), including by way
of providing access to non-public information pursuant to (but only pursuant
to) one or more Acceptable Confidentiality Agreements, _provided_ that the
Company shall (A) concurrently provide to Parent any non-public information
concerning the Company or any Company Subsidiary that is provided to any
Person if such information was not previously provided to Parent or its
representatives, and (B) withhold those portions of documents or information,
or provide pursuant to customary "clean room" or other appropriate procedures,
to the extent relating to any pricing or other matters that are highly
sensitive

 



-60-   or competitive in nature if the exchange of such information (or portions
thereof) could be reasonably likely to be harmful to the operation of the
Company in any material respect; (ii) enter into, engage in and maintain
discussions or negotiations with respect to Acquisition Proposals; and (iii)
otherwise cooperate with, assist or participate in or facilitate any such
inquiries, proposals, discussions or negotiations.

(b) Except as permitted by _Section 6.10(c)_, on the No-Shop Period Start
Date, the Company shall, and shall cause each Company Subsidiary and the
Company Representatives to, (i) immediately cease any solicitation,
encouragement, discussions or negotiations with any Person or group (other
than an Excluded Party) that may be ongoing with respect to an Acquisition
Proposal, and (ii) promptly (and in any event within two Business Days) cause
each Person (other than an Excluded Party or Parent and its representatives)
to whom it provided confidential information prior to the No Shop Period
Start Date to promptly return or destroy all confidential information
concerning the Company and the Company Subsidiaries. Except as permitted by
_Section 6.10(c)_, from the No Shop Period Start Date until the Effective
Time or, if earlier, the termination of this Agreement in accordance with
_Article VIII_, the Company shall not, and shall cause each Company
Subsidiary and the Company Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (A)
solicit, initiate or facilitate or encourage (including by way of furnishing
non-public information) any inquiries regarding, or the making of any proposal
or offer that constitutes or that might reasonably be expected to lead to, an
Acquisition Proposal; (B) engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any
discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any other Person
information in connection with or for the purpose of encouraging or
facilitating, an Acquisition Proposal; (C) enter into any letter of intent,
term sheet, agreement or agreement in principle (in each case, whether binding
or nonbinding) with respect to an Acquisition Proposal (other than an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement); (D) furnish to any Person or group
(other than Parent and its representatives) any non-public information or
afford to any Person or group (other than Parent and its representatives)
access to the business, properties, assets, books, records or other non-
public information, or to any personnel, of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary; (E) take any action to make the provisions of any Takeover Statute
(including any transaction under, or a Person or group becoming an "interested
shareholder" under, the PBCL), or any restrictive provision of any applicable
anti-takeover provision in the Company Articles or Company Bylaws,
inapplicable to any transactions contemplated by an Acquisition Proposal (and,
to the extent permitted thereunder, the Company shall promptly take all steps
necessary to terminate any waiver that may have been previously granted to any
Person other than Parent or any of its Affiliates under any such provisions);
(F) grant any waiver or release under any standstill agreement with respect
to any class of equity securities of the Company (including by providing any
consent or authorization to make an Acquisition Proposal to the Company Board
(or any committee thereof) pursuant to any confidentiality or standstill
agreement); or (G) resolve, propose or agree to do any of the foregoing or
otherwise facilitate any effort or attempt by any Person to make an
Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing
restrictions shall not apply to any Excluded Party. No later than 24 hours
following the No-Shop Period Start Date, in addition to the information
required to be provided pursuant to this _Section 6.10_, the Company shall
identify to Parent (x) each Acquisition Proposal previously received by the
Company and the Person or group making each such Acquisition Proposal, and (y)
which Person or group submitting an Acquisition Proposal has been 

 



-61-   determined by the Company Board (or any committee thereof) to be an Excluded
Party and provide to Parent a summary of the reasons for such determination
and an unredacted copy of each Acquisition Proposal (including any materials
relating to such Excluded Partys proposed financing commitments, if any (it
being understood that the Company shall provide a written summary of all
materials terms of any such financing commitments that, pursuant to the terms
of the engagement letter with the financing source thereto, cannot be provided
in unredacted form)) submitted by such Excluded Party (or a written summary of
the material terms of any such Acquisition Proposal not made in writing).
Notwithstanding anything contained in this _Section 6.10_ to the contrary,
any Excluded Party shall cease to be an Excluded Party for all purposes under
this Agreement upon the earlier of (1) 12:01 a.m. New York, New York time on
the date that is the 20th day after the No-Shop Period Start Date (the "
_Excluded Party End Date_ ") and (2) such time as the Acquisition Proposal
made by such Person or group is withdrawn, terminated, expires or no
longer constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, a Superior
Proposal. The Company agrees that any breach or violation of the restrictions
set forth in this _Section 6.10_ by any Company Representative shall be
deemed to be a breach of this Agreement (including this _Section 6.10_) by
the Company.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this _Section
6.10_, if at any time on or after the No-Shop Period Start Date and prior to
obtaining the Company Required Vote, the Company or any of the Company
Representatives receives a _bona fide_ Acquisition Proposal from any Person
or group (which Acquisition Proposal was made or renewed on or after the No-
Shop Period Start Date or, in the case of an Excluded Party, was made or
renewed on or after the Excluded Party End Date (it being understood that
such Person or group shall not thereafter be an Excluded Party)) that did not
result from any breach of this _Section 6.10_ and the Company Board (or any
committee thereof) determines in good faith, after consultation with its
independent financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that (i) failure to
take such action set forth in clauses (x) and (y) below would be inconsistent
with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law and (ii)
such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or is reasonably expected to lead to a
Superior Proposal, then the Company and the Company Representatives may (x)
furnish, pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, information
(including non-public information) with respect to the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries to the Person or group that has made such Acquisition
Proposal, _provided_ that the Company shall (1) concurrently provide to Parent
any non-public information concerning the Company or any Company Subsidiary
that is provided to any Person if such information was not previously provided
to Parent or its representatives, and (2) withhold those portions of documents
or information, or provide pursuant to customary "clean room" or other
appropriate procedures, to the extent relating to any pricing or other matters
that are highly sensitive or competitive in nature if the exchange of such
information (or portions thereof) could be reasonably likely to be harmful to
the operation of the Company in any material respect; and (y) engage in or
otherwise participate in discussions or negotiations with the Person or group
making such Acquisition Proposal, _provided_ that the Company shall promptly
(and in any event within 24 hours) provide to Parent (A) an unredacted copy of
any Acquisition Proposal (including any materials relating to any proposed
financing commitments (it being understood that the Company shall provide a
written summary of all materials terms of any such financing commitments that,
pursuant to the terms of the engagement letter with the financing source
thereto, cannot be provided in unredacted form)) made in writing provided to
the Company or any Company Representative and

 



-62-   the identity of the Person or group making the Acquisition Proposal, or (B)
a written summary of the material terms of any such Acquisition Proposal not
made in writing. For the avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding the occurrence
of the No-Shop Period Start Date, until the Excluded Party End Date the
Company and the Company Representatives may continue to engage in the
activities described in _Section 6.10(a)_ with respect to an Excluded Party.
From and after the date of this Agreement, the Company shall provide Parent
with 48 hours prior notice (or such lesser prior notice as is provided to the
members of the Company Board) of any meeting of the Company Board (or
any committee thereof) at which the Company Board (or any committee thereof)
is expected to consider any Acquisition Proposal or any request for non-public
information concerning the Company or any Company Subsidiary related to or
from any Person or group who would reasonably be expected to make an
Acquisition Proposal or any request for discussions or negotiations related to
an Acquisition Proposal. Prior to taking any of the actions referred to in
this _Section 6.10(c)_, the Company shall notify Parent orally and in
writing that it proposes to furnish non-public information or engage in
discussions or negotiations as provided in this _Section 6.10(c)_.

 

(d) From and after the date of this Agreement, the Company shall keep Parent
reasonably informed on a current basis (and in any event within 24 hours) of
(i) any initial request for non-public information concerning the Company or
any Company Subsidiary related to or from any Person or group who would
reasonably be expected to make an Acquisition Proposal; (ii) any initial
request for discussions or negotiations related to an Acquisition Proposal;
(iii) receipt of any Acquisition Proposal; or (iv) any material developments,
changes, discussions or negotiations regarding any Acquisition Proposal.
In connection with the foregoing, the Company shall (A) provide Parent with
the identity of the Person or group making such request or Acquisition
Proposal and the material terms thereof and related written correspondence
provided in connection therewith (including, if applicable, unredacted copies
of any written requests, proposals, offers or proposed agreements, including
any materials relating any proposed financing commitments (it being understood
that the Company shall provide a written summary of all materials terms of
any such financing commitments that, pursuant to the terms of the engagement
letter with the financing source thereto, cannot be provided in unredacted
form)), and (B) thereafter keep Parent reasonably informed on a current basis
(and in any event within 24 hours) of any material changes to the terms
thereof. The Company, Parent and Merger Sub agree that subsections (i) and
(ii) above shall apply only with respect to inbound, unsolicited requests
from any Person or group. The Company shall, or shall cause the Company
Representatives to, (x) promptly notify Parent in writing of the identity of
all parties who enter into an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement or (y) no
later than 24 hours following the No-Shop Period Start Date, notify the Parent
in writing of the identity of all parties that were contacted by the Company
or the Company Representatives pursuant to _Section 6.10(a)_. Until
the Effective Time or, if earlier, the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with _Article VIII_, the Company agrees that it and the Company
Subsidiaries will not enter into any confidentiality agreement with any Person
subsequent to the date of this Agreement that prohibits the Company from
providing any information to Parent in accordance with this _Section 6.10_.

(e) Except as expressly permitted by _Section 6.10(f)_, neither the Company
Board nor any committee thereof shall (i)(A) fail to recommend to its
Shareholders that the Company Required Vote be given (the " _Company
Recommendation_ ") or fail to include the Company

 



-63-   Recommendation in the Proxy Statement; (B) change, qualify, rescind,
withhold, withdraw or modify, or propose to change, qualify, rescind,
withhold, withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent, the Company
Recommendation; (C) take any other action or make any recommendation or public
statement in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer or otherwise
take any action inconsistent with the Company Recommendation other than a
recommendation against such offer or a "stop, look and listen" communication
by the Company Board pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange
Act; (D) adopt, approve or recommend, or propose to adopt, approve or
recommend, to the Shareholders an Acquisition Proposal; or (E) except as
permitted by _Section 6.10(h)_, grant any waiver or release under any
standstill agreement, or fail to enforce such agreement, with respect to any
class of equity securities of the Company (each of the actions described in
this _Section 6.10(e)(i)_, a " _Company Recommendation Change_ "); or (ii)
authorize, cause or permit the Company or any Company Subsidiary to enter
into any letter of intent, term sheet, agreement or agreement in principle
(in each case, whether binding or nonbinding) with respect to an Acquisition
Proposal (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement) (each, a "
_Company Acquisition Agreement_ "). After receipt of a written request by
Parent, the Company shall publicly reaffirm the Company Recommendation within
ten Business Days of the commencement of any tender or exchange offer or the
public announcement or public notice of an Acquisition Proposal unless a
Company Recommendation Change is permitted pursuant to _Section 6.10(f)_.

 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained this _Section 6.10_,
prior to the time that the Company Required Vote is obtained, but not after,
the Company Board may make a Company Recommendation Change in order to enter
into a Company Acquisition Agreement with respect to an Acquisition Proposal
that did not result from a breach of this _Section 6.10_ if and only if,
prior to making such Company Recommendation Change, (i) the Company Board (or
any committee thereof) has determined in good faith, after consultation with
its independent financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that
such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal; (ii) the Company
Board (or any committee thereof) shall have determined in good faith, after
consultation with its independent financial advisors and outside legal
counsel, that the failure to effect such Company Recommendation Change and
enter into such Company Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior
Proposal would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the Shareholders
under applicable Law; (iii) the Company Board (or any committee thereof)
provides Parent with at least four Business Days advance written notice (such
period, the " _Notice Period_ ") advising Parent of its intention to make a
Company Recommendation Change and to terminate this Agreement to enter into a
definitive agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal; (iv) the Company
provides Parent a written summary of the material terms and conditions of such
Superior Proposal, the identity of the Person or group making such Superior
Proposal and an unredacted copy of the relevant proposed transaction documents
and any other material documents (including any materials relating to any
proposed financing commitments (it being understood that the Company
shall provide a written summary of all materials terms of any such financing
commitments that, pursuant to the terms of the engagement letter with the
financing source thereto, cannot be provided in unredacted form)) with the
Person or group making such Superior Proposal; (v) the Company and the
Company Representatives discuss and negotiate in good faith with Parent and
its representatives, to the extent that Parent wishes to discuss and
negotiate, any proposed changes by Parent to the terms of this Agreement so
as to permit the Company Board (or any

 



-64-   committee thereof) not to effect a Company Recommendation Change or to
terminate this Agreement in response to such Superior Proposal (including
providing Parent and its representatives, to the extent that they desire to
do so, an opportunity to make a presentation to the Company Board (or any
committee thereof) regarding this Agreement and any proposed changes with
respect thereto); and (vi) the Company Board (or any committee thereof),
following the Notice Period, and taking into account any revised proposal made
by Parent since the commencement of the Notice Period, determines in good
faith, after consultation with its independent financial advisors and outside
legal counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal continues to constitute a
Superior Proposal and that the failure to effect a Company Recommendation
Change and enter into a Company Acquisition Agreement with respect to such
Superior Proposal would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the
Shareholders under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the event
of any change to the material terms of such Superior Proposal (it being
understood that any change in price or type of consideration shall be deemed
to be a change of a material term), the Company Board (or any committee
thereof) shall deliver to Parent an additional notice and shall comply with
this _Section 6.10(f)_ with respect to such new notice, except that if the
only change is a change in price, then the Notice Period shall be two Business
Days (rather than the four Business Days otherwise contemplated by this
_Section 6.10(f)_). Until the Effective Time or, if earlier, the termination
of this Agreement in accordance with _Article VIII_, none of the Company
Board, any committee thereof or the Company shall enter into any binding
agreement with any Person to limit or not provide prior notice to Parent of
its intent to make a Company Recommendation Change or to terminate this
Agreement in response to any Superior Proposal.

(g) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company, the
Company Board (or any committee thereof) from (i) taking and disclosing to the
Shareholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the
Exchange Act or (ii) making any disclosure to the Shareholders if the Company
Board determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel,
that such disclosure is required by applicable securities Law, _provided_ that
any such disclosure (other than (A) a "stop, look and listen" letter or
similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated
under the Exchange Act, (B) an express rejection of any applicable Acquisition
Proposal or (C) an express reaffirmation of the Company Recommendation) shall
be deemed to be a Company Recommendation Change.

(h) At any time prior to the time that the Company Required Vote is obtained,
but not after, the Company Board (or any committee thereof) may grant a waiver
or release under any standstill agreement with respect to any class of equity
securities of the Company if the Company Board determines in good faith,
after consultation with its independent financial advisors and outside legal
counsel, that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law. From the date of this Agreement until
the No-Shop Period Start Date, the Company may grant any such waiver solely to
permit any counterparty to any such agreement to make non-public inquiries,
proposals or offers that constitute or may reasonably be expected to lead to
an Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall provide written notice to Parent of
any such waiver or release of any standstill by the Company concurrent with
the granting of such waiver or release. Except for the waiver or release of
any standstill as contemplated by this _Section 6.10(h)_, from and after the
date of this Agreement, the Company shall, and shall cause each Company
Subsidiary to,

 



-65-   enforce, and shall not release or permit the release of any Person from, or
amend, waive, terminate or modify, and shall not permit the amendment, waiver,
termination or modification of (whether by any Company Subsidiary or any
other Person), any provision of any confidentiality, standstill or similar
agreement or provision to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a
party or pursuant to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary has any
rights.

Section 6.11 _Notification of Certain Events_. The Company will notify Parent
and Merger Sub, and Parent and Merger Sub will notify the Company, promptly
(and in any event within 48 hours) of (a) any written communications from any
Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, _provided_
that the foregoing shall not apply in respect of any immaterial consents; (b)
any written communication from any Governmental Entity in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (other than any such
communication from a Governmental Entity in its capacity as a counterparty to
any contract with the Company thereof); (c) any legal, administrative,
arbitral or other proceedings, claims or Actions commenced against the
Company or Parent or their respective subsidiaries that are related to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (d) any event, change or effect

is reasonably likely to cause the conditions set forth in _Section 7.02(a)_
or _Section 7.02(b)_ of this Agreement (in the case of the Company) or
_Section 7.03(a)_ or _Section 7.03(b)_ of this Agreement (in the case of
Parent and Merger Sub) not to be satisfied; or (e) any notice or any other
communication from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or
may be required in connection with the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated hereby.

Section 6.12 _Takeover Statutes_. If any Takeover Statute becomes or is deemed
to be applicable to the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, the Merger or any other
transaction contemplated by this Agreement, then each of the Company, Parent,
Merger Sub, and their respective Boards of Directors shall grant such
approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that the transactions
contemplated hereby may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated hereby and otherwise act to render such Takeover Statute
inapplicable to the foregoing.

 

Section 6.13 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
Board shall take all such steps as may be required and permitted to cause the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any dispositions of
shares of Company Common Stock (including derivative securities with respect
to such Company Common Stock) by each individual who is or will be subject to
the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect
to the Company, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange
Act.

 

Section 6.14 _Delisting_. Each of the parties agrees to cooperate with each
other in taking, or causing to be taken, all actions necessary to delist the
Company Common Stock from the Nasdaq Stock Market and terminate registration
under the Exchange Act, _provided_ that such delisting and termination shall
not be effective until or after the Effective Time. 

Section 6.15 _Additional Agreements_. In case at any time after the Effective
Time any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes
of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full title to all
properties, assets, rights, approvals, immunities and franchises of either of
the Company or Merger Sub, the proper officers and directors of each party to
this Agreement shall use all reasonable efforts to take all such necessary
action.

Subsidiaries, and shall use all reasonable efforts to cause the Company

with the Debt Financing, including delivery within 15 days of the close of

(ix) using all reasonable efforts to assist Parent to obtain waivers,

encumbrances and contracts;

(x) taking all actions reasonably requested by Parent to permit, subject to

and hold harmless the Company, the Company Subsidiaries the Company
Representatives against any and all losses, damages, claims, costs or expenses

(e) Notwithstanding this _Section 6.16_, Parents and Merger Subs ability
to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby is
not, and shall not be, contingent on the ability of Parent of Merger Sub to

(f) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, none of the
Financing Sources or their former, current and future equity holders,
controlling persons, agents, advisors, representatives or Affiliates, or the
heirs, executors, successors and assigns of any of the foregoing (each such
Person and all such Persons, the " _Financing Sources Related Parties_ "),
shall have any liability or obligation to pay any damages to the Company or
any of its current and future equity holders, controlling persons, agents,
advisors, representatives or Affiliates, or the heirs, executors, successors
and assigns of any of the foregoing, in respect of any breach or failure to
comply with the terms of any of the Debt Financing Commitments or otherwise in

-74-  Section 8.02 _Company Termination Fee_.

 

(a) If this Agreement is terminated (i) pursuant to _Section 8.01(c)(i)_ or
_Section 8.01(d)(i)_ or (ii) pursuant to _Section 8.01(b)(ii)_, _Section
8.01(b)(iii)_ or _Section 8.01(d)(ii)_, the Company shall pay Parent or its
designee the Company Termination Fee by wire transfer of immediately available
funds (x) in the case of any termination pursuant to clause (i) above, prior
to or contemporaneous with such termination, and (y) in the case of any
termination pursuant to clause (ii) above, only if (A) prior to such
termination but after the date hereof, an Acquisition Proposal is made known
to the Company or publicly announced by any Person (other than Parent, Merger
Sub or their respective Affiliates) and (B) an Acquisition Proposal is
consummated or the Company enters into an acquisition agreement for, or the
Company Board (or any committee thereof) recommends to Shareholders, an
Acquisition Proposal with any Person, in any case, within 12 months following
such termination, in which case such payment shall be made prior to or
contemporaneous with the consummation of, or entering into an acquisition
agreement for, an Acquisition Proposal, _provided_ that for purposes of this
clause (B), each reference to "20%" in the definition of Acquisition Proposal
shall be deemed to be a reference to "50%." For the avoidance of doubt, in no
event shall the Company be obligated to pay, or cause to be paid, the Company
Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

 

(b) As used herein, " _Company Termination Fee_ " shall mean a cash amount
equal to $9,150,000 except that in the event that this Agreement is
terminated by the Company pursuant to _Section 8.01(c)(i)_ and the Company
(i) prior to the No-Shop Period Start Date, simultaneously enters into a
definitive agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal or (ii) on or
following the No-Shop Period Start Date but prior to the Excluded Party End
Date, enters into a definitive agreement with an Excluded Party with respect
to a Superior Proposal, then the Company Termination Fee shall mean a
cash amount equal to $5,050,000.

(c) In the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section
8.01(c)(i)_ or  _Section 8.01(d)(i)_, the Company shall reimburse Parent or
its designee for the documented reasonable out-of-pocket fees and expenses
incurred by Parent, Merger Sub or any of their Affiliates in connection with
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (" _Deal Expenses_ ")
up to an aggregate amount of $2,750,000, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds not later than two Business Days after delivery to the Company
of an itemization setting forth in reasonable detail all such reimbursable
expenses, and such reimbursed expenses will be in addition to the amount of
the Company Termination Fee. In the event that this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to _Section 8.01(b)(ii)_,  _Section 8.01(b)(iii)_ or _Section
8.01(d)(ii)_, the Company shall reimburse Parent or its designee for Deal
Expenses up to an aggregate amount of $2,750,000, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds not later than two Business Days after delivery
to the Company of an itemization setting forth in reasonable detail all such
reimbursable expenses, and such reimbursed expenses will be in addition to the
amount of any Company Termination Fee; _provided_ ,  _however_ that such
expenses shall not be payable by the Company until such time as the Company
Termination Fee is payable. In the event that this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to _Section 8.01(b)(ii)_, the Company shall reimburse Parent or its
designee for any Deal Expenses up to an aggregate amount of $1,000,000 not
later than two Business Days after delivery to the Company of an itemization
setting

 



-75-   forth in reasonable detail such Deal Expenses, _provided_ that any amounts
paid by the Company to Parent pursuant to this sentence shall reduce on a
dollar-for-dollar basis any Company Termination Fee that becomes due and
payable pursuant to _Section 8.02(a)_. The parties acknowledge that (i) the
agreements contained in this _Section 8.02_ are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated in this Agreement, (ii) the damages resulting from
termination of this Agreement under circumstances where a Company Termination
Fee is payable are uncertain and incapable of accurate calculation and
therefore, the amounts payable pursuant to  _Section 8.02(a)_ are not a
penalty but rather constitute liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that
will compensate Parent for the efforts and resources expended and
opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on
this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, and (iii) without the agreements contained in this
_Section 8.02_, Parent would not have entered into this Agreement. If the
Company fails to pay all amounts due to Parent on the dates specified, then
the Company shall pay all costs and expenses (including legal fees and
expenses) incurred by Parent in connection with any action or proceeding
(including the filing of any lawsuit) taken by it to collect such unpaid
amounts, together with interest on such amounts at the prime lending rate
prevailing on the date that such payment was required to be made, as published
in _The Wall Street Journal_ , from the date that such amounts were required
to be paid until the date actually received by Parent.

Section 8.03 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this
Agreement by either Parent or the Company as provided in this _Article VIII_,
this Agreement shall forthwith become null and void and have no further force
or effect, and none of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, any of their
respective subsidiaries or any of the officers or directors of any of them
shall have any liability of any nature whatsoever hereunder, or in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby;  _provided_ , _however_ , that (a)
_Section 6.01(a)_, _Section 6.16(d)_, _Article VIII_ and _Article IX_
shall survive any termination of this Agreement, and (b) neither Parent,
Merger Sub nor the Company shall be relieved or released from any liabilities
or damages arising out of fraud or its intentional breach of this Agreement;
_provided_ , _further_ , _however_ , that receipt of the Company Termination
Fee and to the extent applicable, Deal Expenses, as provided herein shall be
the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent and Merger Sub under circumstances
where the Company Termination Fee is payable and is actually paid by the
Company.

that such Shareholders and Optionholders would not receive the benefit of the
bargain negotiated by the Company on their behalf as set forth in this
Agreement,  _provided_ that the maximum aggregate liability of Parent and
Merger Sub under or in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be limited to the Merger Consideration and in no
event shall the Company seek multiple or punitive damages against Parent or
Merger Sub, or any recovery, judgment or damages or any kind against Parent or
Merger Sub in excess of the Merger Consideration.

(b) The Company hereby agrees that specific performance as provided for in
_Section 9.09(a)_ shall be its sole and exclusive remedy with respect to
breaches by Parent, Merger Sub or any other Person or otherwise in connection
with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (whether in
contract, tort or otherwise) and except as provided in _Section 6.16(d)_ and
_Section 9.09(c)_, that it may not seek or accept any other form of relief
that may be available for breach under this Agreement or otherwise in
connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby
(including monetary damages).

 

(c) If a court of competent jurisdiction has declined to specifically enforce
the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the Merger pursuant to
a claim for specific performance brought against Parent pursuant to this
_Section 9.09_ and has instead granted an award of damages for such alleged
breach against Parent, the Company may enforce such award and accept damages
for such alleged breach only if, within 14 days following such determination,
the Company confirms to Parent in writing that it is prepared and willing to
consummate the Merger in accordance with this Agreement, and Parent is
not willing to consummate the Merger within such 14-day period in accordance
with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. In addition, the Company
agrees to cause any legal proceeding still proceeding to be dismissed with
prejudice at such time as Parent consummates the Merger in accordance with
_Article III_ of this Agreement or is otherwise willing to do so.

 

Section 9.10 _Captions_. The table of contents, headings and captions used in
this Agreement are used for convenience only and are not to be considered in
construing or interpreting this Agreement.

Section 9.11 _Certain References_. Whenever the context may require, any
pronoun used in this Agreement shall include the corresponding masculine,
feminine or neuter forms, and the singular form of nouns, pronouns and verbs
shall include the plural and vice versa. Whenever the words "include,"
"includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to
be followed by the words "without limitation." The terms "herein," "hereof" or
"hereunder" or similar

 



-80-   terms as used in this Agreement refer to this entire Agreement and not to
the particular provision in which the term is used. Unless the context
otherwise requires, "neither," "nor," "any," "either" and "or" shall not be
exclusive. Unless otherwise stated, all references herein to Articles,
Sections, subsections or other provisions are references to Articles,
Sections, subsections or other provisions of this Agreement. All references
herein to "days" in this Agreement (excluding references to Business Days) are
references to calendar days. Whenever the words "as of the date hereof" are
used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to mean the day and year first
above written. Any reference to any statute or regulation refers to the
statute or regulation as amended, modified, supplemented or replaced from time
to time (and, in the case of statutes, includes any rules and regulations
promulgated under the statue) and any reference to any section of any statute

Section 9.12 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in separate
counterparts, each such counterpart being deemed to be an original
instrument, and all such counterparts will together constitute the same
agreement. Any such counterpart, to the extent delivered by means of a fax
machine or by .pdf, .tif, .gif, .jpeg or similar attachment to electronic mail
(any such delivery, an " _Electronic Delivery_ ") shall be treated in all
manner and respects as an original executed counterpart and shall be
considered to have the same binding legal effect as if it were the original
signed version thereof delivered in person. No party hereto shall raise the
use of Electronic Delivery to deliver a signature or the fact that any
signature or agreement or instrument was transmitted or communicated through
the use of Electronic Delivery as a defense to the formation of a contract,
and each such party forever waives any such defense, except to the extent that
such defense relates to lack of authenticity.

Section 9.13 _Amendment or Supplement_. At any time prior to the Effective
Time, this Agreement may be amended or supplemented in any and all respects,
whether before or after receipt of the Company Required Vote, by written
agreement of the parties hereto, by action taken by their respective Boards of
Directors; _provided_ , _however_ , that following approval of the Merger by
the Shareholders, there shall be no amendment or change to the provisions
hereof which by Law would require further approval by the Shareholders without
such approval.

 

Section 9.14 _Interpretation_. This Agreement shall be construed reasonably to
carry out its intent without presumption against or in favor of either party.
The parties have participated jointly in negotiating and drafting this
Agreement.

Section 9.15  _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time,
the parties may, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, (a) extend the
time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other
party, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties
contained herein or in any instrument delivered pursuant hereto, and (c) waive
compliance with any of the agreements, covenants, or conditions contained
herein. Any agreement on the party of a party hereto to any such extension or
waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on
behalf of such party. The failure or delay of a party to assert any of its
rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of
those rights. No single or

 



-81-   partial exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder shall
preclude any other or future exercise thereof or the exercise of any other
right, remedy, power or privilege. Any waiver shall be effective only in the
specific instance and for the specific purpose for which given and shall not
constitute a waiver to any subsequent or other exercise of any right, remedy
power or privilege hereunder.

 

Section 9.16 _No Limitation_. It is the intention of the parties that, to the
extent possible, unless provisions are mutually exclusive and effect cannot
be given to both or all such provisions, the representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements in this Agreement shall be construed to be cumulative
and that each representation, warranty, covenant and agreement in this
Agreement shall be given full, separate and independent effect and nothing set
forth in any provision in this Agreement shall in any way be deemed to limit
the scope, applicability or effect of any other provision hereof.

 

Section 9.17 _Delivery_. For purposes of this Agreement, references to the
term "delivered by the Company," "delivered to Parent," "made available to
Parent" and similar expressions shall mean that the Company has (a) filed such
