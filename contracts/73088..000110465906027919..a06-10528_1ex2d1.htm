shall be turned over to Parent). Any cash deposited with the Paying Agent
shall hereinafter be referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_." The agreement

transmittal materials and cash are to be mailed to holders of Certificates
(as defined below) as specified in paragraph (b) of this Section 2.02.

Agent to mail to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates which
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented shares of Company Common
Stock (the " _Certificates_ ") whose shares were converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.01, (i) a letter of
transmittal in a form mutually agreed upon by Parent Group and the Company,
which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates
to the Paying Agent and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of the
Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a
Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent, together with such letter
of transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be
required by the Paying Agent, Parent, Holding Company, Holdings and the
Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to promptly pay, to the
holder of such Certificate in exchange therefor the amount of cash into which
the shares of Company Common Stock theretofore represented by such
Certificate shall have been converted pursuant to Section 2.01 and the amount
of Outstanding Dividends due thereon, and the Certificate so surrendered
shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer

  



        
   

  



  

of ownership of shares of Company Common Stock that is not registered in the
transfer records of the Company, payment may be made to a person other than
the person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered, if
such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form
for transfer. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.02, each
Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent
only the right to receive upon such surrender the amount of cash, without
interest, into which the shares of Company Common Stock theretofore
represented by such Certificate shall have been converted pursuant to Section
2.01 and the amount of Outstanding Dividends due thereon. No interest will be
paid or will accrue on the cash payable upon the surrender of any
Certificate.

  



  

(c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. All cash paid upon
the surrender of Certificates in accordance with the terms of this Section
2.02 shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock theretofore represented by
such Certificates. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the
Company shall be closed, and there shall be no further registration of
transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the
shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to
the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent for any reason, they shall be
canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article II.

  



  

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which
remains undistributed to holders of Certificates for twelve (12) months after
the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, and any holders of
Certificates who have not theretofore complied with this Article II shall
thereafter look only to Parent for the Merger Consideration and Outstanding
Dividends with respect to such Certificates.

  



  

(e) _Investment of the Exchange Fund_. The Paying Agent may invest any cash
included in the Exchange Fund, as directed by Parent or the
Surviving Corporation. Any interest and other income resulting from such
investments shall be paid to Parent or the Surviving Corporation. To the
extent that there are losses with respect to such investments, or the
Exchange Fund diminishes for other reasons below the level required to make
prompt payments of the Merger Consideration, Outstanding Dividends and
Warrant Consideration as contemplated hereby, Parent, Holding Company,
Holding shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, and the Surviving
Corporation shall, promptly replace or restore the portion of the Exchange
Fund lost through investments or other events so as to ensure that the
Exchange Fund is, at all times, maintained at a level sufficient to make such
payments.

  



  

(f) _No Liability_. None of Parent Group, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent or any of their respective directors,
officers, employees and agents shall be liable to any person with respect to
any Merger Consideration from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
Law. If any Certificate shall not have been surrendered prior to five (5)
years after the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on
which any cash in respect of such Certificate would otherwise escheat to or
become the property of any Governmental Entity), any such cash in respect of
such Certificate shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the
property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of any person
previously entitled thereto.

  



        
   

  



  

(g) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
Parent, the posting by such person of a bond in such reasonable amount as
Parent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it
with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall deliver, in exchange
for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the applicable Merger
Consideration and Outstanding Dividends with respect thereto.

  



  

(h) _Withholding Tax_. Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled
to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to
this Agreement to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time such amounts as may be required to be
deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the
applicable Tax Law, and shall promptly remit all withheld amounts to the
applicable taxing authority. To the extent that amounts are so withheld, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made.

  



  

(i) _Certain Adjustments_. If, between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time, the outstanding Company Common Stock shall have been changed
into a different number of shares or different class by reason of any
reclassification, recapitalization, stock split, split-up, combination or
exchange of shares or a stock dividend or dividend payable in any other
securities shall be declared with a record date within such period, or any
similar event shall have occurred, the Merger Consideration shall be
equitably adjusted to eliminate the effects of such event.

  



  

(j) _Exchange Procedure for Warrants_. Upon the surrender to the Paying Agent
of an original copy of a Warrant, the Paying Agent shall pay to
such Warrantholder the Warrant Consideration. The procedures and other
provisions set forth in this Section 2.02 shall apply to any surrender of a
Warrant.

including any structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity
or person, on the other hand, or any "off-balance sheet arrangements" (as

(f) _No Undisclosed Liabilities_. Except as reflected, reserved against or

or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed and

over financial reporting required to be disclosed in any Company SEC Document
has been so disclosed.

  



  

(ii) Since December 31, 2005, (A) neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries nor, to the Knowledge of the Company, any Representative of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries has received or otherwise obtained

written or oral, regarding the accounting or auditing practices, procedures,
methodologies or methods of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or their
respective internal accounting controls relating to periods after December

after the date of this Agreement which have no reasonable basis), and (B) to
the Knowledge of the Company, no attorney representing the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, whether or not employed by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a material violation of securities
Laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation, relating to periods
after December 31, 2005, by the Company or any of its officers, directors,
employees or agents to the Company Board or any committee thereof or to any
director or executive officer of the Company.

  



  

(h) _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_. Since December 31, 2005, (i)
through the date of this Agreement, each of the Company and its Subsidiaries
has conducted its business only in the ordinary course consistent with past
practice, and (ii) there has not been any event or occurrence that would
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

(i) _Information Supplied_. None of the information supplied or to be
supplied by or on behalf of the Company for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in (i) the Proxy Statement or (ii) any other document filed or to
be filed with the SEC in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (the " _Other Filings_ ") will, on each relevant filing date
and in the case of the Proxy Statement, on the date of mailing to the Company
Stockholders and at the time of the Stockholders Meeting, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. The
Proxy Statement and the Other Filings will comply as to form in all material
respects with the provisions of the Exchange Act. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Company makes no

  



        
   

  



  

representation or warranty with respect to any information supplied by Parent

(j) _Employee Benefit Plans_.

  



  

(i) Section 3.01(j)(i) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth all
Benefit Plans maintained or contributed to by the Company and any of its
Subsidiaries, or for which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries could incur
any liability, true, complete and correct copies of which have been provided
or otherwise made available to Parent. The Company has also provided or
otherwise made available to Parent with respect to each Benefit Plan (to the
extent applicable) copies of: the trust agreement, the most recently filed
annual report on IRS Form 5500 (including all schedules and audited financial
statements), the most recently received IRS determination letter, the most
recently prepared actuarial report and financial statement, the most recent

employee handbooks, and any material written communications by the Company or
its Subsidiaries to any current or former employees, consultants or directors
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries concerning the extent of the
benefits provided under a Benefit Plan.

  



  

(ii) Except where failure to comply would not have a Material Adverse Effect,
each Benefit Plan maintained by the Company and any Subsidiary of the Company
has been operated and administered in compliance with its terms and
applicable Law. Each Benefit Plan that is intended to be qualified under
Section 401(a) of the Code has received a favorable determination letter from
the IRS that the Benefit Plan is so qualified, and, to the Knowledge of the
Company, no fact or circumstances exists that would result in the revocation
of such letter. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has incurred
or reasonably expects to incur, either directly or indirectly (including as a
result of an indemnification obligation), any liability under Title I or IV
of ERISA or the penalty, excise tax or joint and several liability provisions
of the Code or any regulations relating to employee benefit plans (including,
without limitation, Sections 406, 409, 502(i), 502(1), 4069 or 4212(c) of
ERISA, or Sections 4971, 4975 or 4976 of the Code). Neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries nor any "party in interest" or "disqualified person"
in respect of the Benefit Plans has engaged in a "prohibited transaction"
(within the meaning of Section 4975 or Section 406 of ERISA) that would
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

(iii) Except for the continuation coverage requirements of COBRA, neither the
Company nor any Subsidiary of the Company has any liability or potential
liability for benefits to any employees following termination of employment
or retirement under any of the Benefit Plans that are employee welfare
benefit plans.

  



  

(iv) The execution of this Agreement and the consummation of the Merger will
not constitute an event under any Benefit Plan maintained by the Company or
any Subsidiary of the Company that will or may result in any payment,
acceleration, termination, forgiveness of indebtedness, vesting,
distribution, increase in compensation or benefits or obligation to fund
benefits with respect to any employee of the Company or any Subsidiary of the
Company which would reasonably be expected to have a Material

  



        
   

  



  

Adverse Effect. The execution of this Agreement and the consummation of the
Merger will not give rise to any excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code or
a loss of deduction under Section 280G of the Code. Except as would not
have a Material Adverse Effect, all contributions and other payments required
to be made by the Company or its Subsidiaries by Law or by the terms of any
Benefit Plan with respect to any period ending before the Closing Date have
been timely made to any funds or trusts established thereunder or in
connection therewith, or reserves adequate for such contributions or other
payments have been or will be set aside therefor and have been or will be
reflected in financial statements, and no accumulated funding deficiencies
exist in any of such plans subject to Section 412 of the Code.

  



  

(v) Except as would not have a Material Adverse Effect, there are no existing
(or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened) lawsuits, claims or other
controversies, other than claims for information or benefits in the normal
course, with respect to any Benefit Plan maintained by the Company or any
Subsidiary of the Company. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary of the
Company has incurred, nor reasonably expects to incur, any liability under
Title IV of ERISA (other than liability for premium payments to the Pension
Benefit Guaranty Corporation arising in the ordinary course) other than those
liabilities which would not result in a Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

(k) _Litigation_. There is no suit, claim, action, proceeding (at law or in
equity) or any investigation, arbitration, administrative or other proceeding
by or before any Governmental Entity or, to the Knowledge of the Company,
threatened against or affecting the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company
or any of their respective properties or assets or any of their respective
officers, employees or directors in their capacity as such, except for any
such suit, claim, action, proceeding or investigation as would not have a
Material Adverse Effect. As of the date of this Agreement, neither the
Company nor its Subsidiaries is subject to any outstanding order, writ,
judgment, injunction, decree, rule or order of any Governmental Entity that
would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

(l) _Permits_. Other than with respect to Environmental Laws, which are
governed by Section 3.01(o), each of the Company and its Significant
Subsidiaries holds all permits, licenses, authorizations, certificates,
rights, variances, exemptions, orders and approvals of all Governmental
Entities that are required pursuant to any Laws and necessary for the lawful
conduct of its business as of the date of this Agreement (the " _Company
Permits_ "), except for failures to hold such Company Permits that would not
have a Material Adverse Effect. Each of the Company and its Significant
Subsidiaries is in compliance with the terms of the Company Permits, except

permitted by the Charter Documents and applicable Law.

  



        
   

  



  

SECTION 5.02 _No Solicitation._

  



  

(a) Subject to the remainder of this Section 5.02, from the date of this
Agreement until the earlier of the Effective Time and the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Article VII, the Company shall not, and shall use its
reasonable best efforts not to permit any Representative of the Company or
its Subsidiaries to, (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage, directly
or indirectly, the submission of any Acquisition Proposal (as defined below),
(ii) enter into any agreement with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, or
(iii) participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to
any person any non-public information with respect to, or knowingly take any
other action to, directly or indirectly, facilitate any inquiries or the
making of any proposal that constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to
lead to, any Acquisition Proposal.

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Company
may, in response to an Acquisition Proposal that was not the result of any
actions prohibited in paragraph (a) above and that was received at any time
prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, and which the
Company Board determines, in good faith, after consultation with its outside
legal counsel and financial advisor, may reasonably be expected to lead to a
Superior Proposal (as defined below) and the following actions are required
for the Company Board to act in a manner consistent with its fiduciary duties
to the Company Stockholders under applicable Law, (x) enter into a customary
confidentiality agreement with the person making such Acquisition Proposal
having terms and conditions not in the aggregate materially more favorable to
such person than the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement are to Parent,
(y) furnish, and authorize and permit its Representatives to furnish,
information with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the person
making such Acquisition Proposal and its Representatives pursuant to such
customary confidentiality agreement and (z) participate in discussions or
negotiations with such person and its Representatives regarding any
Acquisition Proposal; _provided, however_ , that the Company shall promptly
provide to Parent any non-public information concerning the Company or any
Subsidiary that is provided to the person making such Acquisition Proposal or
its Representatives which was not previously provided to Parent; _provided
further_ , _however_ , that the Company shall also promptly (and in any event
within 48 hours) notify Parent of the receipt of each Acquisition Proposal,
set forth in reasonable detail the material terms and conditions of the
Acquisition Proposal (including, without limitation, information relating to
the financing) and, to the extent not prohibited by any confidentiality
agreement or other similar agreement in existence as of the date of this
Agreement, identify the party submitting the Acquisition Proposal, and
thereafter shall keep Parent reasonably informed of the status and
material terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal.

  



  

(c) Neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw
(or modify in a manner adverse to Parent), or publicly propose to withdraw
(or modify in a manner adverse to Parent), the recommendation of this
Agreement by the Company Board or any such committee, (ii) approve or
recommend, or publicly propose to approve or recommend, the approval or
adoption of any Acquisition Proposal, or resolve or agree to take any such
action, or (iii) cause or permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to

agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option
agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or other similar
agreement constituting or related to, or that is intended to or
may reasonably be expected to lead

  



        
   

  



  

to, any Acquisition Proposal, other than any confidentiality agreement
referred to in Section 5.02(b).

  



  

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to the time when the
Company Stockholder Approval has been obtained:

  



  

(i) upon having received an Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board
concludes constitutes a Superior Proposal, the Company Board may withhold,
withdraw or modify its recommendation of this Agreement and the Merger,
approve or recommend the Superior Proposal or terminate this Agreement
pursuant to Section 7.01(c) and shall promptly notify Parent in writing of
any such determination.

  



  

(ii) In circumstances other than as provided in Section 5.02(d)(i) above, the
Company Board may, if it determines in good faith, after consulting with
outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action could result in a
breach of the Company Boards fiduciary obligations under applicable Law,
withhold, withdraw or modify, or propose publicly to withhold, withdraw or
modify, the recommendation by the Company Board or any committee thereof of
this Agreement and the Merger, but only after (A) the Company has notified
Parent in writing that the Company Board is prepared to make the
determination set forth in this clause (ii), (B) for a period of five (5)
Business Days following Parents receipt of the notice set forth in clause
(A) of this sentence, the Company negotiates with Parent in good faith to
make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement as would
enable the Company Board to proceed with its recommendation of this Agreement
and the Merger and (C) at the end of such five (5) Business Day period the
Company Board maintains its determination described in this clause (ii)
(after taking in account such adjustments to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement).

  



  

(e) Nothing contained in this Section 5.02 shall prohibit the Company from
taking and disclosing to the Company Stockholders a position contemplated by
Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making
any required disclosure to the Company Stockholders if, in the good faith
judgment of the Company Board, after consultation with outside legal counsel,
failure so to disclose would be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations
under applicable Law.

financial advisor, is (x) reasonably capable of being completed, taking into
account all legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of the Acquisition
Proposal and the person submitting such proposal and (y) more favorable to

SECTION 5.03 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_. To the
extent permitted by applicable Law, the Company agrees that upon reasonable
notice it shall (and shall cause its Significant Subsidiaries to) afford
Parent Groups Representatives reasonable access, during normal business

Representatives in developing a transition or integration plan to be utilized

applicable Law requires the Company or its Subsidiaries to restrict or
prohibit access to any such properties or information, (B) the information is
subject to confidentiality obligations to a third party ( _provided_ , that
the Company shall use its best efforts to obtain a waiver of
such confidentiality obligations to permit Parent Group to have access) or

of attorney-client privilege; _provided further, however_ , that with
respect to this clause (C), if requested by Parent, the Company will enter
into joint defense agreements or other arrangements with Parent to allow such

outside legal counsel, but in its sole discretion, that so doing will fully
preserve the attorney-client privilege; _provided further_ , _however_ , that
any information provided to Parent Group pursuant to this Section 5.03 shall
be subject to the Confidentiality Agreement, the terms of which shall
continue to apply, except as otherwise agreed by the Company, notwithstanding
termination of this Agreement. In the event of any conflict between the terms
of this Section 5.03 (other than clause (C) above) and the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement, the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement shall
control. No review of information pursuant to this Agreement will affect any
of the representations or warranties of the parties hereto contained in this
Agreement or the conditions hereunder to the obligations of the parties
hereto.

  



  

SECTION 5.04 _Regulatory Matters; Reasonable Best Efforts_. (a) Each
party hereto shall cooperate and promptly prepare and file all

initiated by a third party, (ii) promptly inform the other party of any

administrative, challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including seeking to have any

thereto would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect or
Parent Material Adverse Effect (as applicable), or (B) conduct or agree to
conduct its business in any particular manner if such conduct or agreement
with respect thereto would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect or Parent Material Adverse Effect (as applicable).

  



  

(c) Parent Group shall not, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries not
to, enter into, engage in or agree to engage in any transaction or series of

authorization required in connection with the Merger or otherwise prevent
or materially delay the consummation of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby.

  



  

(d) Parent Group shall not, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries not

employees and agents of the Company and its Subsidiaries and all other
persons who may presently serve or have served at the request of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries as a director, officer, employee or agent of
another person, including as a fiduciary with respect to an employee benefit
plan (the " _Indemnified Parties_ "), in each case, for acts or failures to
act in such capacity, against any costs or expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees), judgments, amounts paid in settlement, fines, losses,
claims, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil or criminal,
administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to matters
existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including for acts
or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement and
the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby), whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective
Time, to the same extent such individuals are indemnified or have the right
to advancement of expenses as of the date of this Agreement by the Company or
such Subsidiary pursuant to its Charter Documents, or similar organizational
documents, as applicable, and the indemnification agreements identified in
Section 5.06(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter.

  



  

(b) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under paragraph
(a) of this Section 5.06, upon receiving written notification of any such
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, shall promptly notify
Parent or the Surviving Corporation thereof, but the failure to so notify
shall not relieve the Surviving Corporation of any liability it may have to
such Indemnified Party except if, and only to the extent that, such
failure materially and irreversibly prejudices Parent. In the event of any
such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, (i) Parent, Holding
Company and Holdings shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, and the
Surviving Corporation shall, pay the fees and expenses of counsel selected by
the Indemnified Party, promptly after statements therefor are received, and
otherwise advance to such Indemnified Party upon request reimbursement of
documented expenses reasonably incurred, and (ii) Parent, Holding Company and
Holdings shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, and the Surviving
Corporation shall, cooperate in the defense of any such matter.

with the same or better credit rating as the Companys current insurance
carrier with coverage in amount and scope at least as favorable as the
Companys existing directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary
liability insurance coverage for the period ending on the later of (i) six
(6) years and one (1) month after the Effective Time and (ii) the applicable
statute of limitations for such acts and omissions; _provided_ , _however_
, that in lieu of such coverage, the Surviving Corporation may substitute
a prepaid "tail" policy for such coverage, which it may cause the Company
to obtain prior to the Closing.

  



  

(d) In determining whether an Indemnified Party is entitled to
indemnification under Section 5.06(a), if requested by such Indemnified
Party, such determination shall be made in a written opinion by independent
counsel mutually acceptable to Parent and the Indemnified Party, which
counsel shall not have, at the time of such determination,
otherwise performed services for the Surviving Corporation or Parent or their
respective Subsidiaries or affiliates during the preceding three (3) years.

  



  

(e) If Parent, Holding Company, Holdings or the Surviving Corporation or any
of their respective successors or assigns shall (i) consolidate with or merge
into any other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all
or substantially all of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in
each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of Parent, Holding Company, Holdings or the Surviving Corporation, as
the case may be, shall assume all of the obligations of Parent, Holding
Company, Holdings and the Surviving Corporation set forth in this Section
5.06.

  



  

(f) The rights of each Indemnified Party under this Section 5.06 shall be in
addition to any right such person might have under the Charter Documents of
the Company or the similar organizational documents of any of its
Subsidiaries, or under applicable Law (including the DGCL), or under any
agreement of any Indemnified Party with the Company or its Subsidiaries. The
provisions of this Section 5.06 are intended to be for the benefit of, and
shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties, their respective
heirs and representatives.

  



  

(g) The obligations of Parent, Holding Company, Holdings and the Surviving
Corporation under this Section 5.06 shall not be terminated or modified in
such a manner as to adversely affect any indemnitee to whom this Section 5.06
applies without the written consent of such affected indemnitee (it being
expressly agreed that the indemnitees to whom this Section 5.06 applies shall
be third-party beneficiaries of this Section 5.06).

  



  

(h) The Company (or, after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation)
shall indemnify any Indemnified Party against all reasonable costs and
expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses), such amounts to
be payable in advance upon request as provided in this Section 5.06, relating
to the enforcement of such Indemnified Partys rights under this Section 5.06
or under the Charter Documents or existing indemnification agreements. Any
amounts due pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be payable upon request
by the Indemnified Party.

or results of operations without the consent of the other party, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

such Transfer Taxes.

date hereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that, subject to obligations under
applicable Law and applicable collective bargaining agreements, commencing on
the second (2nd) anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
and its Subsidiaries shall not have to maintain Comparable Benefits if a
Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction determines that such Comparable

Time under any plan maintained for the Affected Employee immediately prior to
the Effective Time, (ii) with respect to any health insurance plan, provide
each Affected Employee with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid
prior to the Effective Time in satisfying any applicable deductible or out-
of-pocket requirements under any such plan that such Affected Employees are
eligible to participate in after the Effective Time and (iii) with respect to
any life or long-term disability plan, waive any medical certification
otherwise required in order to assure the continuation of coverage at a level
not less than that in effect immediately prior to the implementation of such

thereunder, prior to the termination of this Agreement, without the written
consent of the Company.

  



  

(d) The Company acknowledges that, prior to the Effective Time, Parent may,
and Parent may request that the Company and its Subsidiaries, take actions
with respect to (i) prepaying, redeeming and/or obtaining the consent of the
holders of the Companys outstanding Senior Notes in accordance with the
terms of the indenture pursuant to which such notes were issued or (ii)
restructuring the Company Credit Facility. The Company agrees to cooperate
with such efforts and provide such information or take such actions as may be
reasonably requested by Parent Group with respect thereto, including call for
prepayment or redemption, or to renegotiate, as the case may be, the Senior
Notes; _provided_ , that (i) no such prepayment or redemption shall actually
be made until substantially contemporaneous with or after, or, in the case of
the call for prepayment, immediately prior to or contemporaneous with, the
Effective Time and (ii) no such call for prepayment or redemption shall be
required prior to the Effective Time unless the Company is permitted to
condition such call for prepayment or redemption on the occurrence of the
Effective Time or to withdraw such call for prepayment or redemption if the
Effective Time shall not have occurred on or prior to the applicable
scheduled prepayment or redemption date; and _provided_ , _further_ , that
the Company shall not be required to enter into any bank commitment that will
become effective prior to the Effective Time. **.**

  



  

SECTION 5.15 _No Agreements with Company Stockholders_. Neither
Parent, Holding Company, Holdings nor Sub will, nor will they authorize or
permit any of their affiliates or Representatives to, enter into any
agreement, arrangement or understanding (in each case, whether oral or
written), or to authorize, commit or agree to enter into any agreement,
arrangement or understanding (in each case, whether oral or written),
pursuant to which any Company Stockholder would be entitled to receive
consideration of a different amount or nature

  



        
   

  



  

than the Merger Consideration or pursuant to which a Company Stockholder
agrees to vote to adopt this Agreement or agrees to vote against any Superior
Proposal.

  



  

SECTION 5.16 _Letter of Credit_.

  



  

(a) In consideration for the Company entering into, and as an inducement and
condition to the willingness of the Company to enter into, this Agreement,
Parent Group has delivered to the Company an irrevocable letter of credit
duly issued by Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited, New York
Branch in an amount equal to US$70,000,000 with a termination date of April
25, 2007 in the form of _Exhibit A_ hereto (the " _Letter of Credit_ ").

  



  

(b) No later than 5:00 P.M. New York City time on January 25, 2007 (the " _LC
Date_ "), Parent Group shall deliver, or caused to be delivered, to the
Company an irrevocable substitute letter of credit duly issued by Australia
and New Zealand Banking Group Limited, New York Branch, or another financial
institution reasonably acceptable to the Company, in a form exactly the same
as _Exhibit A_ hereto, except that such substitute letter of credit shall
have a termination date that is thirty (30) Business Days following the Final
Date (the " _Substitute Letter of Credit_ "). The Substitute Letter of Credit
shall be in full force and effect. There shall be no conditions precedent or
other contingencies related to the funding of the full amount of the
Substitute Letter of Credit, other than as set forth in, or contemplated by,
the Substitute Letter of Credit. As of the date of delivery of the Substitute
Letter of Credit, no event shall have occurred which, with or without notice,
lapse of time or both, shall constitute a default or breach on the part of
Parent, Holding Company, Holdings or Sub with respect to any term or
condition of the Substitute Letter of Credit. If the Substitute Letter
of Credit is delivered to the Company prior to an LC Default Draw (as defined
below), the Company will promptly return the Letter of Credit to Parent
Group.

  



  

(c) The Company and Parent Group agree that if Parent Group fails to deliver,
or fails to cause to be delivered, the Substitute Letter of Credit on or
before the LC Date (an " _LC Default_ "), then unless and until Parent Group
delivers the Substitute Letter of Credit to the Company, the Company shall
have the right to immediately draw (without any further action on the part of
Parent Group) upon the Letter of Credit in an amount equal to the Business
Interruption Fee (such actual draw by the Company, the " _LC Default Draw_
"); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that in no event shall a LC Default be
considered an event of termination pursuant to Section 7.01 hereof; _provided
further_ , _however_ , that a LC Default Draw shall be deemed to be payment
of a Business Interruption Fee within the meaning of Section 7.02(c)(i). The
LC Default Draw funds shall be held by the Company in a separate interest
bearing account, segregated from all other funds of the Company (such
account, the " _Separate Account_ "). All LC Default Draw funds, together
with all interest thereon (collectively, the " _Funds_ "), shall be held by
the Company until the earliest of (i) delivery of a Substitute Letter of
Credit, (ii) a Return Event or (iii) a termination of this Agreement as
described in Section 7.02(c) hereof. If Parent Group shall deliver
the Substitute Letter of Credit to the Company after a LC Default Draw, or
there shall have occurred a Return Event, the Company shall within two (2)
Business Days return the Funds to Parent Group. In no event shall such return
affect the right of the Company to draw upon the Substitute Letter of Credit
thereafter in accordance with this Agreement. If a termination of this
Agreement as described in Section 7.02(c) hereof shall have occurred, the
Company shall have the right to withdraw the Funds from the Separate Account
and retain an

  



        
   

  



  

amount of such Funds equal to the Business Interruption Fee. The Company
shall promptly return any excess to the Parent.

  



  

(d) The Letter of Credit or the Substitute Letter of Credit, as the case may
be, shall serve as a source of funds for Parent Groups obligations under
Section 7.02(c) hereof. The Company agrees to return the Letter of Credit or
the Substitute Letter of Credit, as the case may be, to Parent Group (or its
designee), upon the earlier to occur of (i) the receipt of the Merger
Consideration, Outstanding Dividends and Warrant Consideration by the Paying
Agent and the receipt of the Disputed Claims Consideration by LaSalle or, if
later, the Effective Time or (ii) the termination of this Agreement under
circumstances where the Company is not entitled to the Business Interruption
Fee pursuant to Section 7.02 (a " _Return Event_ ").

 **ARTICLE VII 
  
 TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER**

  



  

SECTION 7.01 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time
prior to the Effective Time, whether before or after the Company Stockholder
Approval shall have been obtained:

  



        
   

  



  

(a) by mutual written consent of Parent and the Company, if the Board of
Directors of each party so determines by a vote of a majority of the members
of its entire Board;

  



  

(b) by either the Company or Parent, if:

  



  

(i) the Company Stockholder Approval shall not have been obtained at a
meeting duly convened therefor or at any adjournment or postponement thereof;
or

  



  

(ii) any Restraint having any of the effects set forth in Section 6.01(b)
shall be in effect and have become final and nonappealable; _provided,
however_ , that the party seeking to terminate this Agreement shall have used
its reasonable best efforts to remove or lift such Restraint; or

  



  

(iii) the Merger shall not have been consummated on or before the date that
is twelve (12) months after the date of this Agreement (the " _Outside Date_
"); _provided_ , that if on the Outside Date the conditions to Closing set
forth in Sections 6.01(c) or 6.01(d) shall not have been fulfilled but all
other conditions to the Closing shall have been fulfilled or shall be capable
of being fulfilled (including in the case of Parent Group, the ability to
effect the Closing pursuant to Section 1.03 hereof and to satisfy their
obligations under Article II hereof, including depositing (or causing to be
deposited) with the Paying Agent and LaSalle sufficient funds to make all
payments pursuant to Article II hereof), then either party may (on one or
more occasions) extend the Outside Date for up to six (6) months (the "
_Extended Outside Date_ "); _provided_ , _further_ , that, if the Outside
Date (as it may be extended to an Extended Outside Date) shall occur during
any Final Order Waiting Period, the Outside Date or Extended Outside Date, as
the case may be, shall be extended until the third (3rd) Business Day after
the expiration of such Final Order Waiting Period; _provided_ ,  _further_ ,
that either party may terminate this Agreement if the Merger shall not have
been consummated on or before the date that is twenty-four (24) months after
the date of this Agreement (the " _Final Date_ "); and _provided_ , _further_
, that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section
7.01(b)(iii) shall not be available to any party whose failure to perform any
of its obligations under this Agreement results in the failure of the Merger
to be consummated by the Outside Date, the Extended Outside Date or the Final
Date.

  



  

(c) by the Company prior to when Company Stockholder Approval has been
obtained, if the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation
with its outside legal and financial advisors), in the exercise of its
fiduciary duties, that an Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior
Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company may not terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this clause (c) until after the fifth (5th) Business
Day following Parents receipt of a written notice (a " _Notice of Superior
Proposal_ ") from the Company advising Parent that the Company intends to
take such action and specifying the reason thereof, including the material
terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal and, to the extent
not prohibited by any confidentiality agreement or other similar agreement
in existence as of the date of this Agreement, identifying the person making
such Superior Proposal (it being understood and agreed that in determining
whether an Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal, the Company
Board shall take into account any changes to the terms and conditions of

Proposal); _provided further_ ,

to this clause (c) is conditioned upon the payment by the Company to Parent

obtained, the Company Board shall have (i) withheld, withdrawn or materially
modified in a manner adverse to Parent, its recommendation of the Merger or
this Agreement, (ii) approved or recommended any Acquisition Proposal, (iii)
publicly proposed to approve or recommend any Acquisition Proposal or (iv)
resolved to effect any of the foregoing;

  



  

(e) by Parent, if the Company breaches or fails to perform any of its
representations, warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement, which
breach or failure to perform (i) would give rise to the failure of a
condition set forth in Section 6.02(a) or 6.02(b) and (ii) cannot be cured by
the Outside Date, ( _provided_ , that neither Parent nor Sub is then in
material breach of any representation, warranty or covenant contained in
this Agreement); or

  



  

(f) by the Company, if Parent, Holding Company, Holdings or Sub breaches or
fails to perform any of its representations, warranties or covenants
contained in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (i) would
give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in Section 6.03(a) or
6.03(b) and (ii) cannot be cured by the Outside Date ( _provided_ , that the
Company is not then in material breach of any representation, warranty or
covenant contained in this Agreement).

  



  

SECTION 7.02 _Effect of Termination_.

  



  

(a) In the event of a termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.01,
this Agreement shall forthwith become null and void and there shall be no
liability or obligation on the part of Parent Group or the Company or their
respective officers or directors, except with respect to the last proviso of
the first sentence of Section 5.03 ( _Confidentiality_ ), Section 5.05 (
_Fees and Expenses_ ), this Section 7.02 ( _Effect of Termination_ ) and
Article VIII ( _General Provisions_ ), which provisions shall survive such
termination.

  



  

(b) _Termination Fee_.

  



  

(i) In the event that (x) this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to
Section 7.01(c) or (d) or (y) (A) prior to the obtaining of the Company
Stockholder approval, an Acquisition Proposal has been publicly proposed and
not publicly withdrawn by any person (other than Parent Group or any of their
respective affiliates), (B) thereafter this Agreement is terminated by either
Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 7.01(b)(iii) (but only if the
Stockholders Meeting has not been held prior to such time) or Section
7.01(b)(i) and (C) any person (other than Parent Group or any of their
respective affiliates) shall enter into a definitive agreement to consummate,
or consummate, an Acquisition Proposal with the Company within twelve (12)
months following the termination of this Agreement, then the Company shall
pay to Parent, by wire transfer of same day funds, a termination fee of
US$50,000,000 (the " _Termination Fee_ ") on the date such person and the
Company enter into such definitive agreement or, if earlier, consummate
an Acquisition Proposal, as applicable; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that,

  



        
   

  



  

subject to Section 7.02(b)(ii) below, the Company shall have no liability
under this Agreement in the event that the Company pays Parent the
Termination Fee; _provided further_ , _however_ , that for the purpose of
this Section 7.02(b)(i)(y)(C), the term " _Acquisition Proposal_ " shall have
the meaning assigned to such term in Section 5.02, except that references to
"more than 20%" shall be deemed to be references to "more than 50%."

  



  

(ii) The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section
7.02 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
that the damages resulting from the termination of this Agreement under
circumstances where a Termination Fee is payable are uncertain and incapable
of accurate calculation and that the amounts payable pursuant to Section
7.02(b)(i) are reasonable forecasts of the actual damages which may be
incurred and constitute liquidated damages and not a penalty, and that,
without these agreements, Parent Group would not enter into this Agreement;
accordingly, if the Company fails to promptly pay the Termination Fee, and,
in order to obtain such payments Parent Group commences a suit which results
in a judgment against the Company for the Termination Fee, the Company shall
pay to Parent Group its costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys
fees) in connection with such suit.

  



  

(c) _Business Interruption Fee_.

  



  

(i) In the event that this Agreement is validly terminated by the Company
pursuant to Section 7.01(f) (including, without limitation, as a result of
Parent Group breaching their obligation to effect the Closing pursuant to
Section 1.03 hereof or failing to satisfy their obligations under Article II
hereof including, depositing (or causing to be deposited) with the Paying
Agent and LaSalle sufficient funds to make all payments pursuant to Article
II hereof), then Parent Group shall pay US$70,000,000 (the " _Business
Interruption Fee"_ ) to the Company. Contemporaneously with such termination,
the Company shall be entitled to immediately draw (without any further action
on the part of Parent Group) upon the Letter of Credit or the Substitute
Letter of Credit, as the case may be, in an amount equal to the Business
Interruption Fee. Such amount shall be credited to the payment of the
Business Interruption Fee by Parent Group to the Company. If, for any reason,
the funds available under the Letter of Credit or the Substitute Letter of
Credit, as the case may be, are insufficient to satisfy Parent Groups
obligation to pay the Business Interruption Fee, then Parent Group shall pay
the balance of the Business Interruption Fee owing to the Company by wire
transfer in immediately available funds to an account specified by the
Company in writing to Parent as promptly as reasonably practicable (and, in
any event, within two (2) Business Days following such termination);
_provided_ , _however_ , that, subject to Section 7.02(c)(ii) below,
Parent Group shall have no liability under this Agreement in the event that
Parent pays the Company the Business Interruption Fee.

  



  

(ii) Parent Group acknowledge that the agreements contained in this Section
7.02 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
that the damages resulting from the termination of this Agreement under
circumstances where a Business Interruption Fee is payable are uncertain and
incapable of accurate calculation and that the amounts payable pursuant to
Section 7.02(c)(i) are reasonable forecasts of

  



        
   

  



  

the actual damages which may be incurred and constitute liquidated damages
and not a penalty, and that, without these agreements, the Company would not
enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if Parent Group fails to promptly pay
the Business Interruption Fee, and, in order to obtain such payments the
Company commences a suit which results in a judgment against Parent Group for
the Business Interruption Fee, Parent shall pay to the Company its costs and
expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees) in connection with such suit.

  



  

SECTION 7.03 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties
hereto, by action taken or authorized by their respective boards of
directors, at any time before or after approval of the matters presented in
connection with the Merger by the Company Stockholders, _provided, however_
, that after any such approval, no amendment shall be made which by Law
requires further approval by such Company Stockholders without obtaining such
further approval of such Company Stockholders. This Agreement may not be
amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the
parties hereto.

  



  

SECTION 7.04 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time,
each party hereto, by action taken or authorized by its board of directors,
may, to the extent legally allowed, (i) extend the time for the performance
of any of the obligations or other acts of the other party hereto, (ii) waive
any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained herein or in
any document delivered pursuant hereto or (iii) waive compliance with the
agreements or conditions for the benefit of such party contained herein. Any
agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall
be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such
party. The failure of any party hereto to assert any of its rights hereunder
or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of those rights.

  



  

 **ARTICLE VIII

SECTION 8.01 _Nonsurvival of Representations and Warranties_. None of the
representations, warranties, covenants and other agreements in this Agreement

covenants and other agreements, shall survive the Effective Time, except for
those covenants and agreements contained herein and therein (including
Section 5.06) that by their terms apply or are to be performed in whole or in
part after the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , __ that Parent shall
have no direct liability with respect to Sections 5.06 and 5.11 after the
Effective Time other than in its capacity as the direct or indirect
shareholder of Holding Company, Holdings and the Surviving Corporation and
then only to the extent of its rights as such shareholder.

SECTION 8.03 _Interpretation_. When a reference is made in this Agreement to
Sections, Exhibits or Schedules, such reference shall be to a Section of, or
an Exhibit to, or Schedule to, this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The
table of contents and headings contained in this Agreement are for reference
purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation
of this Agreement. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including"
are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words
"without limitation." The words "hereof," "herein" and "hereunder" and words
of similar import when used in this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement
as a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement. All terms
defined in this Agreement shall have the defined meanings when used in any
certificate or other document made or delivered pursuant hereto
unless otherwise defined therein. The definitions contained in this Agreement
are applicable to the singular as well as the plural forms of such terms and
to the masculine as well as to the feminine and neutral genders of such
terms. Any agreement, instrument or statute defined or referred to herein
means such agreement, instrument or statute as from time to time amended,
modified or supplemented, including (in the case of agreements or
instruments) by waiver or consent and (in the case of statutes) by succession
of comparable successor statutes and references to all attachments thereto
and instruments incorporated therein. References to a person are also to its
permitted successors and assigns. All parties will be considered drafters of

any particular party.

  



  

SECTION 8.04 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and
shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each
of the parties and delivered to the other parties, including delivery by

counterpart.

  



  

SECTION 8.05 _Entire Agreement; Third Party Beneficiaries_.

  



  

(a) This Agreement (including the documents and instruments referred to
herein and the Company Disclosure Letter) and the Confidentiality Agreement
constitute the entire agreement, and supersede all prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof.

  



  

(b) This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of
each party hereto, and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is
intended to or shall confer upon any other person any right, benefit or
remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement, other
than Section 5.06 (which is intended to be for the benefit of the persons
covered thereby and may be enforced by such persons).

  



        
   

  



  

SECTION 8.06 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of Delaware (without
giving effect to choice of Law principles thereof).

  



  

SECTION 8.07 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this
Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any Law or
public policy, all other terms and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or
legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in
any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any
term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced,
the parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to
effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable law in an acceptable manner in order
that the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated as originally
contemplated to the greatest extent possible.

  



  

SECTION 8.08 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties,
in whole or in part (whether by operation of Law or otherwise), without the
prior written consent of the other party, which consent may be withheld for
any reason by such other party in its sole discretion, and any attempt to
make any such assignment without such consent shall be null and void and of
no effect whatsoever. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will

SECTION 8.09 _Submission To Jurisdiction; Waivers_. Each of the
parties irrevocably agrees that any legal action or proceeding with respect
to this Agreement or for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in
respect hereof brought by the other party hereto or its successors or assigns
shall be brought and determined exclusively in the Delaware Court of Chancery
(and if the Delaware Court of Chancery shall be unavailable, any court of the
State of Delaware or the federal court of the United States of America
sitting in the Sate of Delaware), and each of the parties hereby irrevocably
submits with regard to any such action or proceeding for itself and in
respect to its property, generally and unconditionally, to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts. Each of the parties hereby irrevocably
waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as a defense,
counterclaim or otherwise, in any action or proceeding with respect to this
Agreement, (a) any claim that it is not personally subject to the
jurisdiction of the above-named courts for any reason other than the failure
to lawfully serve process, (b) that it or its property is exempt or immune
from jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process commenced in
any such court (whether through service of notice, attachment prior to
judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment
or otherwise), and (c) to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law,
that (i) the suit, action or proceeding in any such court is brought in an
inconvenient forum, (ii) the venue of such suit, action or proceeding is
improper and (iii) this Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may not be
enforced in or by any such court. Process in any such suit, action or
proceeding may be served on any party anywhere in the world, whether within
or without the jurisdiction of the above-named courts. Without limiting the
foregoing, each party agrees that service of process on such party as
provided in Section 8.02 shall be deemed effective service of process on such
party.

  



        
   

  



  

SECTION 8.10 _Enforcement_. The parties agree that irreparable damage
would occur and the parties would not have any adequate remedy at law in the
event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is
accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to (i) an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to (ii) specific
performance of the terms hereof, this being in addition to any other remedy
to which they are entitled at Law or in equity.
