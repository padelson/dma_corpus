 The Board of Directors of each of Danisco, the Buyer and the Company has approved the acquisition of the Company by Danisco upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement.   

 Therefore it is proposed that the Buyer make a cash tender offer, subject to the terms and conditions stated herein (the "Offer"), to acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock that are not already owned by Danisco or a subsidiary of Danisco for $19.25 per share net to the seller in cash (such price, or any higher price per share as may be paid in the Offer, being referred to as the "Offer Price").   

 Also in furtherance of such acquisition, the Board of Directors of each of Danisco, the Buyer and the Company has approved this Agreement and the Merger (as defined in Section 1.5) in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ ") and upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement.   

 The Board of Directors of the Company (the "Company Board of Directors") has determined that the Offer and the Merger are fair to the Unaffiliated Stockholders (as defined below in this Recital), and has resolved to recommend that the Unaffiliated Stockholders accept the Offer and that the stockholders of the Company adopt this Agreement upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement. As used in this Agreement, "Unaffiliated Stockholders" means the holders of issued and    ##### 

  

  

outstanding shares of Common Stock other than (i) Danisco and its affiliates
and (ii) Eastman and its affiliates.   

 The Special Committee of the Company Board of Directors (the "Special Committee") has determined that the Offer and the Merger are fair to the Unaffiliated Stockholders, and has resolved to recommend that the Company Board of Directors approve this Agreement and that the Unaffiliated Stockholders accept the Offer and approve and adopt this Agreement, if approval by the Companys stockholders is required by applicable law to consummate the Merger (as defined below), in each case upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement.   

 Danisco and Eastman have concurrently herewith entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the "Stock Purchase Agreement"), pursuant to which Danisco is to acquire, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, all of the shares of the capital stock of the Company owned by Eastman and Eastmans affiliates.   

 The Company, Danisco and Eastman have concurrently herewith entered into the Fourth Amendment to Stockholder Agreement, pursuant to which, among other things, the Company, Danisco and Eastman have agreed that as of the time set forth in the Fourth Amendment, the obligations of the parties to the Stockholder Agreement (as defined in Section 1.3 hereof) under Section 4 thereof shall terminate.   

 The Company, Danisco and the Buyer desire to make certain representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the Offer and the Merger.

Earnings from such investments shall be the sole and exclusive property of Danisco and the Surviving Corporation, and no part of such earnings shall accrue to the benefit of holders of shares of Common Stock.   

 (b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time, the Paying Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates, which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Common Stock (the "Certificates"), whose shares were converted pursuant to Section 2.1 into the right to receive the Common Stock Merger Consideration (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Danisco may reasonably specify) and (ii)    ##### 

  

  

instructions for effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for
payment of the Common Stock Merger Consideration for each share of Common
Stock formerly represented thereby. Upon surrender of a Certificate for
cancellation to the Paying Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be
appointed by Danisco, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed,
the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor the Common Stock Merger Consideration for each share of Common Stock
formerly represented by such Certificate and the Certificate so surrendered
shall forthwith be cancelled. If payment of the Common Stock
Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person (as defined in Section 3.2)
other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is
registered, it shall be a condition precedent of payment that (x) the
Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in
proper form for transfer and (y) the Person requesting such payment shall
have paid any transfer and other taxes required by reason of the payment of
such Common Stock Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered
holder of the Certificate surrendered or shall have established to
the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such tax either has been
paid or is not required to be paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this
Section 2.2, each Certificate shall be deemed after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive, for each share of Common Stock formerly
represented thereby, the Common Stock Merger Consideration in cash as
contemplated by this Section 2.2, without interest thereon.   

 (c) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in shares of Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of Common Stock or Preferred Shares on the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of certificates evidencing ownership of shares of Common Stock or Preferred Shares, as the case may be, outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares of Common Stock or Preferred Shares, as the case may be, except as otherwise provided for herein or by applicable laws or regulations. If, after the Effective Time, certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Article II.   

 (d) _Termination of Fund; No Liability_. At any time following one year after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any interest received with respect thereto) made available to the Paying Agent and not disbursed (or for which disbursement is pending subject only to the Paying Agents routine administrative procedures) to holders of Certificates, and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look only to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar laws) only as general creditors thereof with respect to the consideration payable upon due surrender of their Certificates, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Surviving Corporation nor the Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder of a Certificate for consideration properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.    ##### 

  

  

 (e) _Withholding Rights_. Danisco, the Buyer, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent, as the case may be, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the relevant consideration otherwise payable in the Merger pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Common Stock or Preferred Shares such amounts that Danisco, the Buyer, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder or any provision of state, local or foreign law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Danisco, the Buyer, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of shares of Common Stock or Preferred Shares in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Danisco, the Buyer, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent.   

 Section 2.3 _Dissenting Shares of Common Stock_. (a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who has not voted in favor of the adoption of this Agreement or consented thereto in writing and who has complied with Section 262 of the DGCL ("Dissenting shares of Common Stock") shall not be converted into a right to receive the Common Stock Merger Consideration unless such holder fails to perfect or withdraws or otherwise loses his or her right to appraisal. A holder of Dissenting shares of Common Stock shall be entitled to receive payment of the appraised value of such shares held by him or her in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL, unless, after the Effective Time, such holder fails to perfect or withdraws or loses his or her right to appraisal, in which case each of such shares of Common Stock shall be converted into and represent only the right to receive the Common Stock Merger Consideration without interest thereon, upon surrender of the Certificate or Certificates representing such shares of Common Stock.   

 (b) The Company shall give Danisco (i) prompt notice of any written demands for appraisal of any shares of Common Stock, attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company relating to rights of appraisal and (ii) the opportunity to participate in the conduct of all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands for appraisal under the DGCL. Except with the prior written consent of Danisco, the Company shall not voluntarily make any payment with respect to any such demands for appraisal or settle or offer to settle any such demands for appraisal.   

 Section 2.4 _Company Stock Plans_. Effective as of and after the Effective Time, all outstanding awards ("Company Stock Awards") of stock options, stock appreciation rights ("SARs"), restricted shares of Common Stock, or units of Common Stock under the Companys Stock Option and Stock Appreciation Right Plan (the "SOAR"), or under the Companys 2002 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the "OI"), that remain unexercised or unpaid at the Effective Time, whether or not such awards had become vested or exercisable before such time, and all shares of Common Stock standing to participants credit in Stock Accounts maintained for them under, or which are to be credited to their Stock Accounts after the Effective Time pursuant to elections made by them before such time in accordance with, the provisions of the Companys Nonqualified    ##### 

  

  

Deferred Compensation Plan (the "NQDCP" and, collectively with the SOAR and
the OI, the "Company Stock Plans") shall be treated in the manner set forth
in the amendments to the Company Stock Plans which are to be adopted by the
Company Board of Directors, or by its Management Development and Compensation
Committee, pursuant to the resolutions set forth in Annex II to
this Agreement, as provided in Section 6.12 hereof. If any option outstanding
under the SOAR is exercised at any time after the date of this Agreement and
while the Offer remains in effect (the "Offer Period"), the holder thereof
shall not be required to pay the exercise price for the shares of Common
Stock as to which the holder intends to exercise the option, and no shares of
Common Stock shall be issued or delivered to the holder upon such exercise of
the option. Instead, the holder shall be entitled to receive a single lump
sum cash payment, in an amount determined by multiplying (i) the number of
shares covered by the holders exercise of such option, by (ii) the excess of
the Offer Price over the exercise price for such shares, such lump sum to be
paid promptly after the Effective Time if and only if the Effective Time
occurs (it being understood that if the Effective Time does not occur such
exercise shall be deemed not to have occurred). The amount so payable to the
holder shall be reduced by all taxes required by law to be
withheld therefrom. As soon as possible after the execution of this
Agreement, all holders of outstanding options under the SOAR shall be
furnished with written notice advising them that their options will be cash
settled in accordance with the provisions of this Section 2.4 if exercised
during the Offer Period.

 (e) For purposes of this Agreement:    

 (i) "Acquisition Proposal" means any offer, proposal or indication of interest, as the case may be, by any Third Party that contemplates (1) a transaction or series of transactions (including any merger, consolidation, recapitalization or other direct or indirect business combination) involving the issuance or acquisition by such Third Party of shares of capital stock or other equity securities of the Company representing 10% (in number or voting power) or more of the outstanding capital stock of the Company, (2) any tender or exchange offer that if consummated would result in such Third Party, together with all affiliates thereof, acquiring beneficial ownership of shares of capital stock or other equity securities of the Company representing 10% (in number or voting power) or more of the outstanding capital stock of the Company, or (3) the acquisition, exclusive license (outside the ordinary course of business), or purchase by such Third Party of 10% or more of the assets (including the capital stock or assets of any Company Subsidiary) of the Company; and    

 (ii) "Superior Proposal" means any bona fide written Acquisition Proposal to acquire all of the outstanding common and preferred shares of the Company, or all or substantially all of the assets of the Company, in either case for cash or Registered Shares (as defined below), or a combination thereof (such consideration to be distributed or transferred as soon as is practicable to the stockholders of the Company, in the case of an asset sale), which on its most recently amended or modified terms, if amended or modified, the Special Committee determines in good faith After Consultation contemplates a    ##### 

  

  

transaction (1) that, if consummated, would be more favorable to the
Unaffiliated Stockholders (in their capacities as stockholders), from a
financial point of view, than the Offer and the Merger, and (2) for which
financing, if necessary, is committed or reasonably capable of being
obtained. "Registered Shares" means equity securities that are traded on a
national securities exchange or the NASDAQ Stock Market and that, as of
the date the transaction contemplated by the Superior Proposal is
consummated, will either be (A) registered on a registration statement that
has been declared effective by the SEC or (B) subject to a customary
registration rights agreement executed by the Third Party who submitted such
Superior Proposal.   

 (f) If the Special Committee determines that an Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal, then the Company shall thereafter deliver to Danisco a written notice (a "Notice of Superior Proposal") that (i) advises Danisco that the Company has received an Acquisition Proposal that the Special Committee has determined to constitute a Superior Proposal, (ii) specifies the material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal and (iii) identifies the Third Party making such Superior Proposal.

Bylaws and under any agreements (the "Indemnification Agreements") as in

previously provided to Danisco) ( _provided_ , that the Surviving
Corporations obligation to pay any amount in settlement shall be conditioned
upon such settlement being effected with the written consent of Danisco,
which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld), arising out of or in
connection with actions or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time, whether or not asserted prior to the Effective Time (including acts or

Transactions and the consummation of the Transactions); _provided_ , 
_however_ , that in the event any claim or claims are asserted or made within

 (d) Danisco shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain and extend all existing officers and directors liability insurance ("DandO Insurance") for a period of not less than the Specified Period with respect to claims arising in whole or in part from facts or events that actually or allegedly occurred on or before the Effective Time, including in connection with the approval of this Agreement and the Transactions and the consummation of the Transactions;  _provided_ , _however_ , that Danisco may substitute therefor policies of substantially equivalent coverage and amounts containing terms no less favorable to the Covered Person;  _provided_ , _further_ , that if the existing DandO Insurance expires or is terminated or cancelled during such period through no fault of Danisco or the Surviving Corporation, then Danisco shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, obtain substantially similar DandO Insurance;  _provided_ _further_ , however, that in no event shall Danisco be required to pay aggregate annual premiums for insurance under this Section 6.8(d) in excess of 300% of the aggregate premiums paid by the Company in 2004 (such aggregate annual premiums paid by the Company in 2004 being referred to as the "Average Premium"), which true and correct amount is set forth in Section 6.8(d) of the Company Disclosure Schedule; and _provided_ , _further_ , that if Danisco or the Surviving Corporation is unable to obtain the amount of insurance required by this Section 6.8(d) for such aggregate annual premiums, Danisco shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, obtain as much insurance as can be obtained for aggregate annual premiums not in excess of 300% of the Average Premium. In lieu of the foregoing, the Company may elect to obtain prepaid policies prior to the Effective Time, which policies provide the Covered Persons with DandO Insurance coverage of equivalent amount and on at least as favorable terms as that provided by the Companys current DandO Insurance for an aggregate period of at least six years with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or before the Effective    ##### 

  

  

Time, including in connection with the approval of this Agreement and the
Transactions and the consummation of the Transactions; _provided_ , _however_

effect, and continue to honor the obligations thereunder. The Company and the
Company Subsidiaries shall consult with Danisco in connection with the

 (e) During the Specified Period, the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of Covered Persons than are currently set forth in the Company Certificate and the Company Bylaws. The Indemnification Agreements with Covered Persons in existence on the date of this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect after the Effective Time in accordance with their terms. Danisco shall not permit the Surviving Corporation to distribute or dispose of assets in a manner that would render the Surviving Corporation unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations pursuant to this Section 6.8.   

 (f) In the event the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any person, then and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that such continuing or surviving corporation or entity or transferee of such assets, as the case may be, shall assume all of the applicable obligations set forth in this Section 6.8.   

 (g) The Covered Persons (and their successors and heirs) are intended third party beneficiaries of this Section 6.8, and this Section 6.8 shall not be amended in a manner that is adverse to the Covered Persons (including their successors and heirs) or terminated without the consent of the Covered Persons (including their successors and heirs) affected thereby.

If any state "fair price," "control share acquisition," "business combination" or other state takeover statute becomes or is deemed to become applicable to the Company, the Offer, the acquisition of shares of Common Stock pursuant to the Offer, or the Merger, then the Company Board of Directors shall (i) in the case of Section 203 of the DGCL, take all action necessary and (ii) in the case of any other state takeover statute, use its commercially reasonable efforts, to render such statute inapplicable to the foregoing.   

 Section 6.11 _Company Stock Plans_. As promptly as possible following the execution of this Agreement but in any event by no later than the third business day after the date of this Agreement, (i) the Company Board of Directors, or its Management    ##### 

  

  

Development and Compensation Committee, as the case may be, shall adopt the
resolutions set out in Annex II to this Agreement amending the Company Stock
Plans and the Companys Employee Stock Purchase Plan in the manner set forth
in Documents A, B, C and D appended to such resolutions; and (ii) the
Management Development and Compensation Committee shall make the
determinations and take the actions with respect to cash settlement upon
exercise of outstanding options under the OI as are set forth in Document E

 (a) Danisco shall duly perform each of its obligations under the Stock Purchase Agreement in a timely manner;   

 (b) Danisco shall require that Eastman duly perform each of Eastmans obligations under the Stock Purchase Agreement in a timely manner and (to the extent requested by the Company) shall enforce Daniscos rights under the Stock Purchase Agreement;   

 (c) Danisco shall immediately provide the Company with written notice of (i) any breach or alleged breach by Danisco or Eastman of any provision of the Stock Purchase Agreement and (ii) any fact or circumstance that may affect the accuracy of any of the representations and warranties in the Stock Purchase Agreement or that may affect the likelihood that the transactions contemplated by the Stock Purchase Agreement will be consummated on a timely basis; and   

 (d) Danisco shall not (without the prior written consent of the Company): (i) permit the Stock Purchase Agreement to be terminated or amended in any respect; (ii) permit the extension of the time for performance of any of the obligations or acts of Danisco or Eastman under the Stock Purchase Agreement; (iii) waive or permit the waiver of any right of Danisco or Eastman, or any condition to any obligation of Danisco or Eastman, under the Stock Purchase Agreement; or (iv) enter into, or permit any affiliate of Danisco to enter into, any agreement or transaction with Eastman or with any affiliate of Eastman relating to the Company or any Company Subsidiary or relating to any of the securities or assets of the Company or any Company Subsidiary.   

 Without limiting the generality of Section 6.12(d), prior to the Acceptance Time, Danisco shall not (and Danisco shall ensure that its affiliates do not), directly or indirectly, acquire any shares of common stock or preferred stock of the Company beneficially owned by Eastman or any affiliate of Eastman (whether pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement or otherwise).   

 Section 6.13 _Grant of Option_. The Company hereby grants to the Buyer an irrevocable option to purchase from the Company (such grant being referred to herein as the "Option"), for the Offer Price per share, a number of shares of Common Stock (the "Optioned Shares") equal to the Applicable Amount. The "Applicable Amount" shall be the number of shares of Common Stock which, when added to (1) the number of shares of Common Stock owned by Danisco and the Buyer (and their respective affiliates) immediately prior to the exercise of the Option and (2) the 25,000,000 shares of Common    ##### 

  

  

Stock owned by Eastman and its affiliates as of the date hereof, would result
in Danisco and the Buyer owning immediately after the exercise of the Option
90% of the then-outstanding shares of Common Stock (assuming the exercise of
all Company Awards outstanding and vested as of the time of the exercise of
the Option). The Buyer may exercise the Option only following the Acceptance
Date. The Option shall expire if not exercised prior to the Effective Time.
The purchase price for the shares may be paid, at the election of Danisco,
either (i) in cash or (ii) by a promissory note of Danisco in a principal
amount equal to the Offer Price multiplied by the number of shares of
Common Stock purchased pursuant to the Option, which promissory note shall
mature in 12 months (and be prepayable at any time by Danisco without
penalty) and shall bear interest at the rate charged to Danisco by its
principal lenders.   

 (b) In the event that the Buyer wishes to exercise the Option, it shall give written notice (the date of such notice, the "Notice Date") to the Company, specifying the number of Optioned Shares to be purchased pursuant to such exercise and a place and date (not sooner than two nor later than ten business days from the Notice Date) for the closing of such purchase.   

 (c) At any closing hereunder, (i) the Buyer will make payment to the Company of the full purchase price for the Optioned Shares by (A) certified or official bank check payable to the Company or by wire transfer to the Company, or (B) delivery of the promissory note described in the last sentence of Section 6.13(a), and (ii) the Company will deliver to the Buyer a duly executed certificate or certificates representing the number of Optioned Shares so purchased, registered in the name of the Buyer or its nominee in the denominations designated by the Buyer in its notice of exercise.   

 (d) The Buyer represents that any Optioned Shares purchased by the Buyer will be acquired for investment only and not with a view to any public distribution thereof and the Buyer will not offer to sell or otherwise dispose of any Optioned Shares so acquired by it in violation of the registration requirements of the Securities Act. The certificate(s) representing the shares of Common Stock acquired pursuant to the exercise of the Option will bear a legend indicating that such shares of Common Stock were sold without registration under the Securities Act.   

 (e) In the event of any change in the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock by reason of any stock dividend, stock split, recapitalization, combination, exchange of shares, merger, consolidation, reorganization or the like or any other change in the corporate or capital structure of the Company that would have the effect of diluting the Buyers rights hereunder, the number of Optioned Shares and the purchase price shall be adjusted appropriately so as to restore the Buyer to its rights hereunder with respect to the Option; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this Section shall be construed as permitting the Company to take any action or enter into any transaction prohibited by this Agreement.    #####

 (iv) if the Special Committee shall have made and publicly announced a Company Change in Recommendation; or

 (1) If any option outstanding under the Plan is exercised at any time during the period in which the cash tender offer to purchase outstanding shares of the Companys Common Stock pursuant to the terms of the Acquisition Agreement dated as of January 27, 2005 between Danisco A/S, DH Subsidiary Inc., and the Company (the "Acquisition Agreement") remains in effect (the "Offer Period"), the holder of such option shall not be required to pay the exercise price for the shares of Common Stock as to which the holder intends to exercise the option, and no shares of Common Stock shall be issued or delivered to the holder upon such exercise of the option. Instead, the holder shall be entitled to receive a single lump sum cash payment, in an amount determined by multiplying (i) the number of shares covered by the holders exercise of such option, by (ii) the excess of the Offer Price (as defined in the Acquisition Agreement) over the exercise price for such shares, such lump sum to be paid promptly after the Effective Time if and only if the Effective Time occurs (it being understood that if the Effective Time does not occur such exercise shall be deemed not to have occurred). The amount so payable to the holder shall be reduced by all taxes required by law to be withheld therefrom.
