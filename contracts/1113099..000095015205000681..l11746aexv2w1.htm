Subsidiary Inc., and the Company (the &#147;Acquisition Agreement&#148;) remains in effect (the &#147;Offer
Period&#148;), the holder of such option shall not be required to pay the exercise price for the shares
of Common Stock as to which the holder intends to exercise the option, and no shares of Common

excess of the Offer Price (as defined in the Acquisition Agreement) over the exercise price for
such shares, such lump sum to be paid promptly after the Effective Time if and only if the
Effective Time occurs (it being understood that if the Effective Time does not occur such exercise
shall be deemed not to have occurred). The amount so payable to the holder shall be reduced by all
taxes required by law to be withheld therefrom.
