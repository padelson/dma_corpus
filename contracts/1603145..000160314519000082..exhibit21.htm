|

2.3

|

Post-Closing Adjustments. 

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

Preparation of Estimated Closing Statement. Sellers' Representative shall
prepare in good faith and deliver to Buyer, at least five (5) Business Days
prior to the anticipated Closing Date and at the sole expense of Sellers, a
statement setting forth a detailed determination by Sellers in good faith of
the Estimated Purchase Price, balance of cash on hand of the Acquired
Companies, and the Cash Purchase Price, including a breakdown of each Seller's
Share thereof (the "Estimated Closing Statement"). Such Estimated Closing
Statement shall include a reasonably detailed explanation and supporting
detail of the calculations thereof. With respect to Sellers' Representative's
estimate of the adjustments in Section 2.2(a)(v), (vi) and (vii), the
Estimated Closing Statement shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP, Annex
5, Annex 6 and Annex 7, as applicable, and Exhibit G. If Buyer has any
questions or disagreements regarding the Estimated Closing Statement, Buyer
shall deliver written notice of any such questions or disagreements to
Sellers' Representative at least two (2) Business Days prior to the
anticipated Closing Date, and in such case Sellers' Representative and Buyer
shall in good faith attempt to resolve any disagreements. If Buyer and
Sellers' Representative agree on changes to the Estimated Purchase Price and
the Cash Purchase Price based on such discussions, then the Estimated Purchase
Price and the Cash Purchase Price shall, for purposes of Section 2.2, be based
on such changes. If Buyer and Sellers' Representative do not agree on changes
to the Estimated Purchase Price and the Cash Purchase Price, then the
Estimated Purchase Price and the Cash Purchase Price shall, for 

purposes of Section 2.2, be based on the amounts set forth in the Estimated
Closing Statement delivered by Sellers' Representative. In either such case,
appropriate adjustments to the Estimated Purchase Price and the Cash Purchase
Price shall be made after the Closing pursuant to this Section 2.3.

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

Preparation of Closing Statement. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Closing Date (and, in any event, within sixty (60) days after the Closing
Date), Buyer shall prepare in good faith and deliver to Sellers'
Representative, at the sole expense of Buyer, a closing statement setting
forth the proposed final calculation of the Purchase Price (the "Proposed
Closing Statement"). With respect to Buyer's calculation of the adjustments in
Section 2.2(a)(v), (vi) and (vii), the Proposed Closing Statement shall be
prepared in accordance with GAAP, Annex 5, Annex 6 and Annex 7, as applicable,
and Exhibit G. 

| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

Examination of Proposed Closing Statement. Sellers' Representative shall
review the Proposed Closing Statement to confirm the accuracy of the Proposed
Closing Statement and Buyer's calculations therein. If Sellers' Representative
fails to give Buyer written notice of any disputed amounts within thirty (30)
days after Sellers' Representative receives the Proposed Closing Statement
(the "Review Period"), then the Proposed Closing Statement shall become the
Final Closing Statement for purposes hereof. If Sellers' Representative gives
Buyer written notice of any disputed item within the Review Period, Buyer and
Sellers' Representative shall attempt in good faith to agree on any
adjustments that should be made to the Proposed Closing Statement. If Buyer
and Sellers' Representative fail to resolve any disputed amounts within
fifteen (15) days after the end of the Review Period, Buyer and Sellers'
Representative will engage the Audit Firm to resolve any such disputed matters
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, and, in connection with such
engagement, Buyer and Sellers' Representative shall execute any engagement,
indemnity or other agreements as the Audit Firm may require as a condition to
such engagement. The Audit Firm's engagement shall be limited to the
resolution of disputed amounts set forth in the Proposed Closing Statement
that have been identified by Sellers' Representative, and no other matter
relating to the Proposed Closing Statement shall be subject to determination
by the Audit Firm except to the extent affected by resolution of the disputed
amounts. In resolving any such disputed item, the Audit Firm may not assign a
value to any item greater than the greatest value for such item claimed by a
Party or lower than the lowest value for such item claimed by a Party. The
Audit Firm may not award damages or penalties. Buyer and Sellers'
Representative shall cooperate diligently with any reasonable request of the
Audit Firm in an effort to resolve any disputed matter as soon as reasonably
possible after the Audit Firm is engaged, but neither such party will have ex
parte meetings, teleconferences or other correspondence with the Audit Firm,
as it is intended for each of Sellers' Representative and Buyer to be included
in all discussions and correspondence with the Audit Firm. If possible, the
decision of the Audit Firm shall be made within thirty (30) days after being
engaged, or as soon as possible thereafter. In any event, the final decision
of the Audit Firm shall be final and binding on the Parties. The provisions in
this Section 2.3(c) shall be the Parties' 



sole and exclusive remedy with respect to any disputes in connection with
determinations of the Final Purchase Price and the Final Closing Statement.
The Proposed Closing Statement shall be revised, if necessary, to reflect the
final determination of the Parties or the Audit Firm, as applicable (the final
form of the Proposed Closing Statement, including any revisions that are made
thereto pursuant to this Section 2.3(c), is referred to herein as the "Final
Closing Statement"). The Purchase Price as calculated pursuant to the Final
Closing Statement shall be referred to herein as the "Final Purchase Price."

| 
---|--- 

(d)

|

Adjustments. 

| 
---|--- 

(i)

|

If the Final Purchase Price is less than the Estimated Purchase Price, then
Buyer and Sellers' Representative shall promptly (but no later than five (5)
Business Days after the determination of the Final Closing Statement) submit a
Joint Direction to the Escrow Agent to release by wire transfer of immediately
available funds from the Adjustment Escrow Account (A) to Buyer, the lesser of
(1) the amount of such deficit and (2) the Adjustment Escrow Funds and (B) the
remainder of the Adjustment Escrow Funds, if any, to Sellers; provided,
however, to the extent such deficit is greater than the aggregate amount in
the Adjustment Escrow Account, then, in addition to the disbursement of the
Adjustment Escrow Funds to Buyer pursuant to this Section 2.3(d), Sellers will
promptly pay to Buyer by wire transfer of immediately available funds an
amount equal to such remaining deficit (but no later than five (5) Business
Days after the determination of the Final Closing Statement). 

| 
---|--- 

(ii)

|

If the Final Purchase Price exceeds the Estimated Purchase Price, then
Sellers' Representative shall promptly deliver payment instructions to Buyer
reflecting each Seller's Share of such excess, and (A) Buyer shall promptly
(but no later than five (5) Business Days after receipt of such instructions)
tender payment of such excess to each Seller in accordance with such payment
instructions, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts
specified with respect to such Seller under the heading "Wire Instructions" on
Exhibit F or to another account or accounts otherwise designated by Sellers'
Representative in such payment instructions, and (B) Buyer and Sellers'
Representative shall submit a Joint Direction to the Escrow Agent to release
and pay to Sellers, by wire transfer of immediately available funds from the
Adjustment Escrow Account, the aggregate amount of the Adjustment Escrow
Funds. 

| 
---|--- 

(e)

|

No Duplicative Effect. The provisions of this Section 2.3 and of any other
Transaction Document shall apply in such a manner so as not to give the
components and calculations duplicative effect to any item of adjustment and,
except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, the Parties covenant
and agree that no amount shall be (or is intended to be) included, in whole or
in part (either as an increase or reduction) more than once in the calculation
of the Purchase Price Adjustments, the Purchase Price, any component of any of
the 



foregoing or any other calculated amount pursuant to this Agreement if the
effect of such additional inclusion (either as an increase or reduction) would
be to cause such amount to be overstated or understated for purposes of such
calculation. The Parties acknowledge and agree that, if there is a conflict
between a determination, calculation or methodology set forth in Annex 5,
Annex 6 or Annex 7, Exhibit G or the definitions contained in this Agreement,
as applicable, on the one hand, and those provided by GAAP, on the other hand,
(i) the determination, calculation or methodology set forth in Annex 5, Annex
6 or Annex 7, Exhibit G or the definitions contained in this Agreement, as
applicable, shall control to the extent that the matter is included in Annex
5, Annex 6 or Annex 7, Exhibit G or the definitions contained in this
Agreement as a line item or specific adjustment and (ii) the determination,
calculation or methodology prescribed by this Agreement shall otherwise
control.

| 
---|--- 

(f)

|

Fees and Expenses of the Audit Firm. If the Parties submit any disputed
amounts to the Audit Firm for resolution as provided in Section 2.3(c), the
fees and expenses of the Audit Firm (the "Audit Fees") will be borne one-half
by Sellers and one-half by Buyer; provided, however, that (i) if the aggregate
estimate by Buyer of the disputed amount or amounts differs by ten percent
(10%) or more from the determination of the Audit Firm, then Buyer shall pay
one hundred percent (100%) of the Audit Fees, and (ii) if the aggregate
estimate by Sellers of the disputed amount or amounts differs by ten percent
(10%) or more from the determination of the Audit Firm, then Sellers shall pay
one hundred percent (100%) of the Audit Fees; provided, further, however, if
the aggregate estimates by Buyer and Sellers of the disputed amount or amounts
both differ by ten percent (10%) or more from the determination of the Audit
Firm, then the Party whose estimate differs most greatly from the
determination of the Audit Firm shall pay one hundred percent (100%) of the
Audit Fees. Sellers and Buyer shall promptly, and in any event within five (5)
Business Days after the final determination of the Final Closing Statement,
pay to the Audit Firm the amount of Audit Fees payable by Sellers and Buyer
pursuant to the preceding sentence. For the avoidance of doubt, all costs and
expenses incurred by the Parties in connection with a dispute under Section
2.3(c), other than the Audit Fees, shall be borne by the Party incurring such
cost or expense. 

| 
---|--- 

(g)

|

Tax Withholding. Buyer shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payments
under the Code, or any provision of state, local, provincial or foreign Tax
Law, and shall timely remit to the appropriate Tax Authority any amounts so
deducted or withheld. In the event that Buyer determines that it is required
to withhold any amounts from amounts otherwise payable to any Seller pursuant
to this Agreement, prior to withholding any such amounts Buyer shall (i) give
the applicable Sellers reasonable advanced notice of its intention to make any
such deduction or withholding, (ii) cooperate with the applicable Sellers to
reduce or eliminate any such withholding, and (iii) consider, in good faith,
any objections of the applicable Sellers with respect to such proposed
deduction or withholding. To 



the extent that amounts are deducted or withheld from amounts payable by Buyer
pursuant to this Agreement, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the Person entitled to receipt of the
payment in respect of which such deduction or withholding was made. For the
avoidance of doubt, this Section 2.3(g) shall not apply to Transfer Taxes,
which are addressed in Section 7.3.

Update Information. 

From the Execution Date until two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date,
if Sellers have Knowledge of any matter or matters first occurring after the
Execution Date that the Sellers believe, individually or in the aggregate,
cause the conditions to Closing set forth in Section 8.2(b) or Section 8.2(d)
to fail to be satisfied, then Sellers' Representative shall notify Buyer in
writing of such matter or matters (including by providing amendments to the
Disclosure Schedules), along with written acknowledgment from Sellers'
Representative that such matter or matters would cause the conditions to
Closing set forth in Section 8.2(b) or Section 8.2(d) to fail to be satisfied

this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.1(e), or (subject to the satisfaction

8.2(b) or Section 8.2(d) to fail to be satisfied. If Buyer does not exercise
such termination right within five (5) Business Days after receipt of such
notice from Sellers' Representative, then such DS Update shall be deemed for

whether the conditions to Closing set forth in Section 8.2(b) and Section
8.2(d) have been satisfied, to have amended the Disclosure Schedules as of the
Execution Date and to have cured any misrepresentation or breach of
representation, warranty or covenant that otherwise would have existed

acknowledges and agrees that obtaining the RandW Insurance Policy is not a
condition to the Closing, and Buyer shall remain obligated, subject only to
the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VIII, to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement regardless of
whether the RandW Insurance Policy becomes effective. From and after the

| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

Subject to compliance with Section 6.1, the Parties agree that nothing in this
Section 6.11 will limit or restrict (i) any Seller or any of its Affiliates

result in any liability or obligation of an applicable Acquired Company of
such Seller prior to the Closing, or any further liability or obligation of
such Seller. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Buyer's failure
to obtain the Debt Financing shall not relieve Buyer of its obligation to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement whether or not the
Debt Financing is available. Buyer shall reimburse each Seller for such
Seller's reasonable, documented out of pocket expenses actually incurred by
such Seller in complying with this Section 6.13. In no event shall any Seller,

of their gross negligence or willful misconduct or Fraud, and Buyer hereby
releases and agrees to defend, indemnify and hold harmless each Seller, the

Cooperation. 

Buyer and the applicable Sellers shall cooperate fully, and Buyer shall cause
the Acquired Companies to cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably
requested by the other Party (or Parties), in connection with the preparation
and filing of Tax Returns pursuant to this Article VII and any audit,
litigation or other proceeding (each, a "Tax Proceeding") with respect to such
Tax Returns and Taxes related to such Tax Returns. Such cooperation shall
include access to, the retention and (upon the other Party's (or Parties')
request) the provision of records and information that are reasonably relevant
to any such Tax Return or Tax Proceeding, and the making available of
employees on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and
explanation of any material provided hereunder. Buyer and Sellers further
agree, upon request, to use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to obtain any
certificate or other document from any Tax Authority or any other Person as
may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be
imposed (including with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement).

7.3

|

Transfer Taxes. 

|

(a)

|

Subject to Section 9.5(b)(ii), Sellers shall be responsible for and pay all
transfer, sales, use, stamp, registration or other similar Taxes, if any,
including, for the avoidance of doubt, (i) any Pennsylvania Realty Transfer
Taxes or other Taxes imposed under 61 PA Code Chapter 91 ("PA Taxes"),
resulting from the 



transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) any PA Taxes imposed upon
the transfer of the Pipeline Interests by Operator to Buyer occurring after
the Closing (collectively, "Transfer Taxes"). Buyer and Sellers shall
cooperate in good faith to minimize, to the extent permissible under
applicable Law, the amount of any such Transfer Taxes. Subject to Section
7.3(c), Sellers' Representative shall prepare Tax Returns, if any, for or with
respect to Transfer Taxes, including any amendments thereto ("Transfer Tax
Returns"). No later than five (5) Business Days prior to the due date
(including extensions) of any Transfer Tax Return to be filed hereunder
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, any PA Transfer Tax Return), Sellers'
Representative shall deliver a copy of any such Transfer Tax Return, together
with all supporting documentation and work papers, to Buyer for review and
reasonable comment. Sellers' Representative shall consider in good faith any
such comments. Prior to Closing, Sellers' Representative shall deliver signed
PA Transfer Tax Returns to Morgan, Lewis and Bockius LLP, as escrow agent under
the Transfer Documents Escrow Agreement, for filing in connection with the
recording of the Transfer Documents.

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

At the Closing, a portion of the Purchase Price shall be paid to the Title
Company in the aggregate amount of the Transfer Taxes shown as due on each PA
Transfer Tax Return (collectively, the "Filed PA Transfer Tax Returns") and
the amount of all recording fees, to be held in escrow until such Transfer
Taxes and recording fees are paid to the Department and/or the relevant county
recorder of deeds in connection with the recording of the Transfer Documents
(such amount, the "Closing Transfer Tax Amount") in accordance with Section
2.2(d)(ii). Buyer shall arrange with the Title Company for the payment of all
such Transfer Taxes and recording fees from the Closing Transfer Tax Amount. 

| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

Prior to the Closing Date, Sellers shall obtain the PA Transfer Tax Opinion
specified in Section 8.2(f). The fees and expenses incurred in obtaining the
PA Transfer Tax Opinion shall be borne by Buyer subject to the Maximum
Transfer Taxes Legal Fees Amount. The Filed PA Transfer Tax Returns shall be
prepared in a manner consistent with the PA Transfer Tax Opinion. Any PA
Transfer Tax Return with respect to any property for which an exemption from
PA Taxes is being claimed shall include specific reference to the applicable
exemption claimed on such Filed PA Transfer Tax Return. 

| 
---|--- 

(d)

|

Sellers' Representative shall seek a Transfer Tax letter ruling from the
Pennsylvania Department of Revenue (the "Department") addressing that (i) the
portion of the Pipeline Interests constituting mains and equipment will not be
treated as taxable "real estate" for purposes of the PA Taxes and (ii) the
portion of the Pipeline Interests constituting easements and rights-of-way
will be treated as easements granted to a person furnishing public utility
service, for use in, or useful for, furnishing public utility services, and
the assignment of such easements and rights-of-way will be treated as an
excluded transaction for purposes of the PA Taxes (a "Realty Transfer Tax
Ruling"). The request for the Realty Transfer Tax Ruling shall include the
fact that the Company leases its rights in the Pipeline Interests to Operator
and Operator utilizes such Pipeline 



Interests in the provision of transportation and public utility services.
Prior to filing a request for a Realty Transfer Tax Ruling, Sellers'
Representative shall provide Buyer with a draft of such Realty Transfer Tax
Ruling request for Buyer's review and reasonable comment. Sellers'
Representative shall consider in good faith any such comments, and shall
incorporate Buyer's reasonable comments involving the accuracy of the facts
and representations included in the ruling request. The fees and expenses
incurred in seeking the Realty Transfer Tax Ruling shall be borne by Buyer
subject to the Maximum Transfer Taxes Legal Fees Amount.

| 
---|--- 

(e)

|

If, upon receipt of a Realty Transfer Tax Ruling, such Realty Transfer Tax
Ruling supports a refund of a portion of the PA Taxes liability reported on
the Filed PA Transfer Tax Returns, Sellers' Representative shall prepare and
Buyer shall file amended Transfer Tax Returns or any other any supplemental
filings necessary to request a refund of the excess PA Taxes paid. Any such
refund shall be for the account of the Sellers and shall be paid to Sellers
Representative by the Company within five (5) Business Days of receipt such
refund. 

| 
---|--- 

(f)

|

Transfer Tax Escrow Release. 

| 
---|--- 

(i)

|

If, upon receipt of a Realty Transfer Tax Ruling, such Realty Transfer Tax
Ruling supports the Transfer Taxes liability reported on the Filed PA Transfer
Tax Returns, then Sellers shall be entitled to receive, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds from the Transfer Tax Escrow Account in accordance
with instructions delivered by Sellers' Representative in accordance with the
terms of the Transfer Tax Escrow Agreement, an amount equal to the amount, if
any, by which the remaining Transfer Tax Escrow Funds exceed Two Million
Dollars ($2,000,000). 

| 
---|--- 

(ii)

|

If, upon receipt of a Realty Transfer Tax Ruling, such Realty Transfer Tax
Ruling supports a refund of a portion of the Transfer Taxes liability reported
on the Filed PA Transfer Tax Returns, then Sellers shall be entitled to
receive, by wire transfer of immediately available funds from the Transfer Tax
Escrow Account in accordance with instructions delivered by Sellers'
Representative in accordance with the terms of the Transfer Tax Escrow
Agreement, an amount equal to the amount, if any, by which the remaining
Transfer Tax Escrow Funds exceed Two Million Dollars ($2,000,000). 

| 
---|--- 

(iii)

|

If, upon receipt of a Realty Transfer Tax Ruling, such Realty Transfer Tax
Ruling requires the payment of an amount of Transfer Taxes greater than the
amount of Transfer Taxes reported on the Filed PA Transfer Tax Returns, then
Buyer and Sellers' Representative shall submit a Joint Direction to the Escrow
Agent to release to Buyer for payment to the Department and/or the relevant
county recorder of deeds, by wire transfer of immediately available funds from
the Transfer Tax Escrow Account an 



amount equal to the amount by which the amount that the Transfer Taxes
required to be paid pursuant to the Realty Transfer Tax Ruling exceeds the
amount of Transfer Taxes paid by the Sellers pursuant to the Filed PA Transfer
Tax Returns, and thereafter Sellers shall be entitled to receive, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds from the Transfer Tax Escrow Account
in accordance with instructions delivered by Sellers' Representative in
accordance with the terms of the Transfer Tax Escrow Agreement, an amount
equal to the amount, if any, by which the remaining Transfer Tax Escrow Funds
(after the disbursement contemplated immediately above) exceed Two Million
Dollars ($2,000,000).

| 
---|--- 

(iv)

|

The remaining amount held in the Transfer Tax Escrow Account will continue to
be held and disbursed by the Escrow Agent pursuant to the terms of the
Transfer Tax Escrow Agreement and subject to Section 9.5(b)(ii). 

| 
---|--- 

(g)

|

If the Realty Transfer Tax Ruling or a Tax Proceeding requires determination
of the relative values of each of the Pipeline Interests for purposes of
allocating Transfer Taxes among the Pipeline Interests (the "Transfer Tax
Valuation"), then Buyer and Sellers' Representative shall attempt in good
faith to agree upon the Transfer Tax Valuation. If Buyer and Sellers'
Representative are unable to reach such agreement within fifteen (15) days
after receipt of the Realty Transfer Tax Ruling or notice of the Tax
Proceeding, then Buyer and Sellers' Representative shall jointly engage Duff and
Phelps or another firm with no prior material relationship with Buyer, Sellers
or their respective Affiliates that is mutually agreed upon by Buyer and
Sellers' Representative (the "Transfer Tax Valuation Firm") to determine the
Transfer Tax Valuation, and in connection with such engagement, Buyer and
Sellers' Representative shall provide all information and documentation
requested by the Transfer Tax Valuation Firm. The Transfer Tax Valuation shall
be binding on the Parties. The fees and expenses of the Transfer Tax Valuation
Firm shall be borne one-half by Sellers and one-half by Buyer.

Buyer shall provide Sellers' Representative with written notice of any
inquiries, audits, examinations or proposed adjustments by the IRS or any
other Tax Authority, which relate to any Transfer Taxes. Sellers shall have
the sole right to represent the interests of the Acquired Companies in any Tax
Proceeding relating to any Transfer Taxes, and to take any actions in
connection with such Tax Proceeding; provided, that without Buyer's prior
written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed), Sellers shall not settle any Tax Proceeding relating to Transfer
Taxes that would cause the Company or Buyer to incur a liability for Transfer
Taxes in excess of the then-current Transfer Tax Escrow Funds. Buyer shall
have the right to participate in, but not direct, the prosecution or defense
of such Tax Proceeding at Buyer's sole expense.

(a)

|

Any Buyer Indemnified Party or Seller Indemnified Party claiming
indemnification under this Agreement (an "Indemnified Party") with respect to
any claim asserted against the Indemnified Party by a Third Party (a "Third-
Party Claim") in respect of any matter that is subject to indemnification
under Section 9.2 shall promptly (i) notify (A) in the case of a Buyer
Indemnified Party, Sellers' Representative or (B) in the case of a Seller
Indemnified Party, Buyer (the Party notified under either (A) or (B), an
"Indemnifying Party") of the Third-Party Claim and (ii) transmit to the
Indemnifying Party a written notice (a "Claim Notice") describing in
reasonable detail the nature of the Third-Party Claim, a copy of all papers
served with respect to such Third-Party Claim (if any), the Indemnified
Party's reasonable estimate of the amount of Losses attributable to the Third-
Party Claim and the basis of the Indemnified Party's request for
indemnification under this Agreement. Failure to timely provide such Claim
Notice shall not affect the right of the Indemnified Party's indemnification
hereunder, except to the extent the Indemnifying Party is materially
prejudiced by such delay or omission. If a Third-Party Claim relates
exclusively to any Seller or Sellers other than the Seller that is serving as
Sellers' Representative, Sellers' Representative may, upon written notice
delivered to the Indemnified Party and executed by one or more such other
Sellers, elect to substitute such other Seller or Sellers as the Indemnifying
Party handling or controlling the defense with respect to such Third-Party
Claim. 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to control the defense of the
Indemnified Party against such Third-Party Claim in accordance with and
subject to the following; provided that, prior to the Indemnifying Party
assuming control of such defense, the Indemnifying Party, shall first verify
to the Indemnified Party in writing that the Indemnifying Party shall be fully
responsible for all Losses relating to such claim for indemnification to the
extent indemnifiable under this Agreement and that it will provide full
indemnification to the Indemnified Party with respect to such proceeding or
other claim giving rise to such claim for indemnification hereunder to the
extent indemnifiable under this Agreement. If the Indemnifying Party notifies
the Indemnified Party that the Indemnifying Party elects to assume the defense
of the Third-Party Claim, to the extent indemnifiable under this Agreement
then, subject to the following, the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to
defend such Third-Party Claim at the Indemnifying Party's sole cost and
expense with counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party, by all appropriate
proceedings, to a final conclusion or settlement at the discretion of the
Indemnifying Party in accordance with this Section 9.3(b). The Indemnifying
Party shall have full control of such defense and proceedings, including any
compromise or settlement thereof; provided, however, that the Indemnifying
Party shall not be permitted to assume defense of any Third-Party Claim
against an Indemnified Party for which indemnification is available hereunder
(without the written consent of the Indemnified Party) if (i) the claim for
indemnification relates to or arises in connection with any criminal
proceeding, action, indictment, allegation or investigation; (ii) the Third
Party claimant is seeking injunctive or similar relief against Buyer
Indemnified Parties; or (iii) the Third Party asserting the Third-Party Claim
is the Operator and the matter in dispute affects the post- 



Closing operations of the Company and the Operator; provided, further, that
the Indemnifying Party shall not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter
into any settlement agreement without the written consent of the Indemnified
Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed); provided, further, that the Indemnified Party shall not be obligated
to consent to any settlement or judgment (A) if it provides for injunctive or
other nonmonetary relief affecting the Indemnified Party, (B) unless it
includes as an unconditional term thereof the giving by each claimant or
plaintiff to the Indemnified Party and its Affiliates of a release from all
liability with respect to such Third-Party Claim, or (C) if it involves a
finding or admission of any violation of Law or the rights of any Person or
has an effect on any other claims that may be made against the Indemnified
Party. If requested by the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party agrees,
at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party, to reasonably
cooperate with the Indemnifying Party and its counsel in contesting any Third-
Party Claim that the Indemnifying Party elects to contest, including the
making of any related counterclaim against the Person asserting the Third-
Party Claim or any cross complaint against any Person. The Indemnified Party
may otherwise participate in, but not control, any defense or settlement of
any Third-Party Claim controlled by the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this
Section 9.3, and the Indemnified Party shall bear its own costs and expenses
with respect to such participation unless the Indemnified Party has been
advised by counsel that there could be a material conflict of interest in the
case of joint representation or that there are legal defenses available to the
Indemnified Party that are different (in a non de minimis way) from those
available to the Indemnifying Party, in which case the Indemnified Party shall
be entitled to separate counsel of the Indemnified Party's own choosing at the
Indemnifying Party's expense.

| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

If the Indemnifying Party does not notify the Indemnified Party that the
Indemnifying Party elects to defend the Indemnified Party pursuant to Section
9.3(b), then the Indemnified Party shall have the right to defend, and be
reimbursed for its reasonable costs and expenses (but only if the Indemnified
Party is entitled to indemnification hereunder) in regard to the Third-Party
Claim with counsel selected by the Indemnified Party (which counsel shall be
reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnifying Party), by all appropriate
proceedings, which proceedings shall be prosecuted diligently by the
Indemnified Party. In such circumstances, the Indemnified Party shall defend
any such Third-Party Claim in good faith and have full control of such defense
and proceedings; provided, however, that the Indemnified Party may not enter
into any compromise or settlement of such Third-Party Claim if indemnification
is to be sought hereunder, without the Indemnifying Party's consent (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). The
Indemnifying Party may participate in, but not control, any defense or
settlement controlled by the Indemnified Party pursuant to this Section
9.3(c), and the Indemnifying Party shall bear its own costs and expenses with
respect to such participation. 

| 
---|--- 

(d)

|

Subject to the other provisions of this Article IX, in the event that an
Indemnified Party determines that it has a claim for indemnifiable Losses
against an 



Indemnifying Party hereunder (other than as a result of a Third-Party Claim),
the Indemnified Party shall give written notice thereof to the Indemnifying
Party, specifying, in reasonable detail, the amount of such claim, the nature
and basis of the alleged breach or act giving rise to such claim and all
relevant facts and circumstances relating thereto. The Indemnified Party shall
provide the Indemnifying Party with reasonable access to its books and records
(and, if a Seller is the Indemnifying Party, the books and records of the
Acquired Companies) during normal business hours for the purpose of allowing
the Indemnifying Party a reasonable opportunity to verify any such claim for
indemnifiable Losses. The Indemnifying Party shall notify the Indemnified
Party within thirty (30) days following its receipt of such notice and
granting of such access if the Indemnifying Party disputes its liability to
the Indemnified Party under this Article IX. If the Indemnifying Party does
not so notify the Indemnified Party, the claim specified by the Indemnified
Party in such notice shall be a liability of the applicable Indemnifying Party
under this Article IX, and the Indemnifying Party shall pay the amount of such
claim to the Indemnified Party on demand or, in the case of any notice in
which the amount of the claim (or any portion of the claim) is estimated, on
such later date when the amount of such claim (or such portion of such claim)
becomes finally determined. If the Indemnifying Party has timely disputed its
liability with respect to such claim as provided above, the Indemnifying Party
and the Indemnified Party shall negotiate in good faith to resolve such
dispute. Promptly, and in any event within five (5) Business Days, following
the final determination of the amount of indemnifiable Losses to which the
Indemnified Party is entitled (whether determined in accordance with this
Section 9.3(d) or by a court of competent jurisdiction), the Indemnifying
Party shall pay such indemnifiable Losses to the Indemnified Party by wire
transfer or certified check made payable to the order of the Indemnified
Party.

| 
---|--- 

(e)

|

In the event an Indemnified Party shall recover Losses in respect of a claim
of indemnification under this Article IX, no other Indemnified Party shall be
entitled to recover the same Losses in respect of a claim for indemnification. 

| 
---|--- 

(f)

|

This Section 9.3 shall not apply to Tax Proceedings, which shall be controlled
by Section 7.4. 

| 
---|--- 

9.4

|

Limitations on Liability. 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary stated in this Agreement:

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

Except in the event of Fraud, (i) Sellers' aggregate liability under Section
7.3 and under Section 9.2(a)(i) shall not exceed the Transfer Tax Escrow
Amount; (ii) Sellers' aggregate liability for all covenants and agreements in
this Agreement (other than under Section 2.3(d) and Section 7.3) shall not
exceed the Indemnity Escrow Amount; and (iii) Sellers' aggregate liability
under this Agreement after the Closing shall not exceed the sum of the
Transfer Tax Escrow Amount, the Indemnity Escrow Amount and the Adjustment
Escrow Amount. 



| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

The amount of any Losses subject to indemnification under this Article IX
shall be reduced or reimbursed, as the case may be, by any Third Party
insurance proceeds actually received by the relevant Buyer Indemnified Party
or Seller Indemnified Party, as applicable, with respect to such Losses (in
each case calculated net of reasonable Third Party out-of-pocket costs and
expenses of such recoveries, including any deductibles paid by Buyer to obtain
such insurance coverage and any costs or expenses attributable to increases in
insurance premiums). Buyer and each Seller shall, and shall cause Buyer
Indemnified Parties and Seller Indemnified Parties, as applicable, to, use
Commercially Reasonable Efforts to collect any amounts available under such
Third Party insurance coverage and from any Person alleged to have
responsibility. If a Buyer Indemnified Party or Seller Indemnified Party, as
applicable, receives an amount under Third Party insurance coverage or from a
Third Party with respect to Losses that were the subject of indemnification
under this Article IX at any time subsequent to indemnification provided
hereunder, then such Buyer Indemnified Party or Seller Indemnified Party, as
applicable, shall as soon as reasonably practicable reimburse Buyer or Sellers
(pro rata in proportion to the percentage of such Loss paid by such Seller),
as applicable, the amount that Buyer or Sellers, as applicable, would not have
had to pay pursuant to this Article IX had such insurance proceeds been
received prior to the making of such indemnification payment. 

| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

To the extent that a Tax Benefit is actually realized by an Indemnified Party
due to Losses for which such Indemnified Party has received a payment pursuant
to Section 9.2, the Indemnified Party shall refund to Indemnifying Party the
amount of such Tax Benefit within a reasonable time, but in no event more than
ninety (90) days, after the Tax Return reflecting such Tax Benefit is filed
with the applicable Tax Authority. For purposes of this Section 9.4(c), a "Tax
Benefit" means an amount by which the Tax liability of the Indemnified Party
is actually reduced by a deduction, reduction of income or entitlement to
refund or credit, net of any Taxes and any reasonable out-of-pocket expenses
incurred by the Indemnified Party and paid to a Person unrelated to such
Indemnified Party in obtaining such deduction, reduction of income, refund or
credit. This Section 9.4(c) shall not be construed to require any Indemnified
Party to (i) pay any amount to an Indemnifying Party the payment of which
would place the Indemnified Party in a less favorable net after-Tax position
than the Indemnified Party would have been in if the Losses subject to
indemnification and giving rise to the Tax Benefit had not been incurred and
the indemnification payments with respect to such Losses had never been paid,
or (ii) make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to
its Taxes that it deems confidential) to the Indemnifying Party or any other
Person. An Indemnifying Party, upon the request the Indemnified Party, shall
repay to the Indemnified Party the amount paid to such Indemnifying Party
pursuant to this Section 9.4(c) in the event that the Indemnified Party is
required to repay a related Tax Benefit to such Taxing Authority.

|

Recourse. 

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

RandW Insurance. Except in the event of Fraud, Buyer or any Buyer Indemnified
Party's sole and exclusive recourse from and after the Closing for any breach
or inaccuracy of a representation or warranty made by Sellers or any Seller
under Article III or Article IV or in any certificate delivered pursuant to
this Agreement shall be to make a claim under the RandW Insurance Policy, which
shall be obtained at Buyer's sole expense in accordance with Section 6.7, and
no Seller shall have any liability for any such breach or inaccuracy. Buyer
agrees (on behalf of itself and each of its Affiliates) that (i) none of
Sellers, any of their respective Affiliates or their respective
Representatives shall have any liability whatsoever for or under the RandW
Insurance Policy (including for any premiums or other amounts payable in
respect thereof); (ii) the RandW Insurance Policy shall at all times provide
that the RandW Insurer (A) waives and agrees not to pursue, directly or
indirectly, any subrogation rights against any Seller, any Affiliate of any
Seller or any of its or their respective Representatives, other than for Fraud
and (B) agrees that none of Buyer or any of its Affiliates shall have any
obligation to pursue any claim against any Seller, any Affiliate of any Seller
or any of its or their respective Representatives and (iii) the absence of
coverage under the RandW Insurance Policy or the failure of the RandW Insurance
Policy to be in full force and effect for any reason shall not expand, alter,
amend, change or otherwise affect the liability of any Seller, any Affiliate
of any Seller or any of its or their respective Representatives under this
Agreement. 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

Escrow. Any claims by Buyer or any Buyer Indemnified Party for indemnifiable
Losses under Section 9.2(a) from and after the Closing shall be subject to the
following terms: 

| 
---|--- 

(i)

|

Except in the event of Fraud, Buyer or any Buyer Indemnified Party's sole and
exclusive recourse from and after the Closing for indemnifiable Losses
pursuant to Section 9.2(a)(ii) and Section 9.2(a)(iii) shall be to make a
claim for payment from the Indemnity Escrow Funds in accordance with, and
subject to, the terms and conditions of the Indemnity Escrow Agreement, and no
Seller shall have any further liability for any such Losses. Subject to the
remainder of this Section 9.5(b)(i), the Indemnity Escrow Account shall remain
outstanding until the earlier of the date that is twenty-four (24) months
after the Closing Date (the "Final Indemnity Escrow Release Date") and the
date on which the Indemnity Escrow Funds are reduced to Zero Dollars ($0). 

| 
---|--- 

(A)

|

If the Indemnity Escrow Funds have not already been reduced to Zero Dollars
($0) and all of the Welded Claims have not been resolved and paid by the date
that is eighteen (18) months after the Closing Date (the "Initial Indemnity
Escrow Release Date"), then Sellers shall be entitled to receive, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds from the Indemnity Escrow Account in
accordance with the terms of the Indemnity Escrow Agreement, an amount 



equal to the amount, if any, by which the remaining Indemnity Escrow Funds at
such time exceed the sum of (1) the Welded Indemnity Escrow Amount and (2) the
amount of any then outstanding unpaid claims for payment from the Indemnity
Escrow Account timely asserted in good faith by a Buyer Indemnified Party as
of such time for claims made under Section 9.2(a)(ii) and Section
9.2(a)(iii)(B) (the claims addressed in this clause (2), the "Pending Non-
Welded Claims").

| 
---|--- 

(B)

|

If the Indemnity Escrow Funds have not already been reduced to Zero Dollars
($0) and all of the Welded Claims have been resolved and paid as of the
Initial Indemnity Escrow Release Date, then Sellers shall be entitled to
receive, by wire transfer of immediately available funds from the Indemnity
Escrow Account in accordance with the terms of the Indemnity Escrow Agreement,
an amount equal to the amount, if any, by which the remaining Indemnity Escrow
Funds at such time exceed the amount of any Pending Non-Welded Claims. 

| 
---|--- 

(C)

|

If the Indemnity Escrow Funds have not already been reduced to Zero Dollars
($0) as of the Final Indemnity Escrow Release Date, then Sellers shall be
entitled to receive, by wire transfer of immediately available funds from the
Indemnity Escrow Account in accordance with the terms of the Indemnity Escrow
Agreement, an amount equal to the amount, if any, by which the remaining
Indemnity Escrow Funds at such time exceed the sum of (1) any Welded Claims
that have been resolved at such time but are unpaid (provided that, for the
avoidance of doubt, if any Welded Claims remain in controversy as of the Final
Indemnity Escrow Release Date, no amount shall be retained in the Indemnity
Escrow Account with respect thereto) (the "Unpaid Settled Welded Claims") and
(2) the amount of any Pending Non-Welded Claims that remain outstanding and
unpaid as of the Final Indemnity Escrow Release Date. The remaining amount
held in the Indemnity Escrow Account in respect of Pending Non-Welded Claims
(from and after the Initial Indemnity Escrow Release Date) or Unpaid Settled
Welded Claims (from and after the Final Indemnity Escrow Release Date), if
any, will continue to be held and disbursed by the Escrow Agent pursuant to
the terms of the Indemnity Escrow Agreement. 

| 
---|--- 

(ii)

|

Except in the event of Fraud, Buyer or any Buyer Indemnified Party's sole and
exclusive recourse from and after the Closing for indemnifiable Losses
pursuant to Section 9.2(a)(i) shall be to make a claim for payment from the
Transfer Tax Escrow Funds in accordance with, and subject to, the terms and
conditions of the Transfer Tax Escrow Agreement, and no Seller shall have any
further liability for any such Losses. The Transfer 



Tax Escrow Account shall remain outstanding until the date that is the earlier
of forty-eight (48) months after the Closing Date (the "Transfer Tax Escrow
Release Date") and the date on which the Transfer Tax Escrow Funds are reduced
to Zero Dollars ($0). If the Transfer Tax Escrow Funds have not already been
reduced to Zero Dollars ($0) as of the Transfer Tax Escrow Release Date, then
Sellers shall be entitled to receive, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds from the Transfer Tax Escrow Account in accordance with
instructions delivered by Sellers' Representative in accordance with the terms
of the Transfer Tax Escrow Agreement, an amount equal to the amount, if any,
by which the remaining Transfer Tax Escrow Funds exceed the amount of any
outstanding claims for payment from the Transfer Tax Escrow Account timely
asserted in good faith by a Buyer Indemnified Party under Section 9.2(a)(i)
("Pending Transfer Tax Claims"). The remaining amount held in the Transfer Tax
Escrow Account for Pending Transfer Tax Claims (from and after the Transfer
Tax Escrow Release Date), if any, will continue to be held and disbursed by
the Escrow Agent pursuant to the terms of the Transfer Tax Escrow Agreement.

| 
---|--- 

(iii)

|

Except in the event of Fraud, in no event shall a Buyer Indemnified Party
deliver notice of a claim for payment directly against, or otherwise make or
assert any claim for damages or other Losses against, any Seller from and
after the Closing other than in accordance with this Section 9.5(b).

except as expressly set forth in this Agreement or in any certificate
delivered at the Closing.

11.7

|

Disclosure Schedules. 

Unless the context otherwise requires, all capitalized terms used in the
Disclosure Schedules shall have the respective meanings assigned to such terms
in this Agreement. No reference to or disclosure of any item or other matter
in the Disclosure Schedules shall be construed as an admission or indication
that such item or other matter is material or that such item or other matter
is required to be referred to or disclosed in the Disclosure Schedules. No
disclosure in the Disclosure Schedules relating to any possible breach or
violation of any agreement or Law shall be construed as an admission or
indication that any such breach or violation exists or has actually occurred.
The inclusion of any information in the Disclosure Schedules shall not be
deemed to be an admission or acknowledgment by any Seller that in and of
itself, such information is material to or outside the ordinary course of the
Business or is required to be disclosed on the Disclosure Schedules. Each
numbered Schedule in the Disclosure Schedules qualifies the correspondingly
numbered representation, warranty or covenant to the extent specified therein
and such other representations, warranties or covenants to the extent a matter
in such numbered Schedule is disclosed in such a way as to make its relevance
to such other representation, warranty or covenant reasonably apparent on the
face of such disclosure.

| 
---|--- 

11.8

|

Amendments. 

This Agreement may be amended or supplemented at any time only by additional
written agreements signed by Buyer and each Seller, each in its respective
sole discretion, as may mutually be determined by the Parties to be necessary,
desirable or expedient to further the purpose of this Agreement or to clarify
the intention of the Parties. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, Sections 9.8, 11.3 or 11.11, (and any other provision of
this Agreement to the extent an amendment, supplement, waiver or other
modification of such provision would modify the substance of such Sections)
may not be amended, supplement, waived or otherwise modified in any manner
that impacts or is otherwise adverse in any material respect to the Financing
Sources without the prior written consent of the Financing Sources.

| 
---|--- 

11.9

|

Publicity. 

No Party or any Affiliate or Representative of such Party shall issue or cause
the publication of any press release or public announcement or otherwise
communicate with any news media in respect of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby without the prior written consent of the
other Party (or Parties) (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), except as may be required by Law or applicable
securities exchange rules (which may include the disclosure of this Agreement
and the terms and conditions hereof) and except with respect to customary
investor and analyst presentations, meetings and conference calls, in which
case, the Party issuing or publishing such press release or making such public
announcement shall provide, to the 



extent reasonably practicable, the other Party (or Parties) with a copy of
such press release or public announcement (including any slides or transcripts
to be used in any investor or analyst presentation or conference) in advance
of its issuing or publishing such press release or making such public
announcement, as applicable.

| 
---|--- 

11.10

|

Severability. 

If any term or other provision of this Agreement is illegal, invalid or
unenforceable under any Law or as a matter of public policy, all other
conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full
force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement is not affected in any manner
materially adverse to any Party. Upon such determination that any term or
other provision contained herein is, to any extent, invalid or unenforceable
in any respect under the Laws governing this Agreement, the Parties to this
Agreement shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to
effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in a mutually
acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement be consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent
possible.

11.11

|

Governing Law; Jurisdiction. 

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the Laws
of the State of New York (without regard to the conflict of laws principles
thereof, other than Section 5-1401 of the New York General Obligations Law).
Each of the Parties irrevocably agrees that any legal action or proceeding
with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby,
including any action or proceeding against the Financing Sources or arising
out of or relating in any way to the Debt Financing or the performance thereof
or the transactions contemplated thereby, shall be brought and determined in

this Agreement. The Parties further agree that the Parties shall not bring
suit with respect to any disputes arising out of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, including any dispute arising out of or
relating in any way to the Debt Financing or the performance thereof or the
transactions contemplated thereby, in any court or jurisdiction other than the
above specified courts; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not limit
the rights of the Parties to obtain execution of judgment in any other
jurisdiction. The Parties further agree, to the extent permitted by Law, that
a final and unappealable judgment against a Party in any action or proceeding
contemplated above shall be conclusive and may be enforced in any other
jurisdiction within or outside the United States by suit on the judgment, a
certified copy of which shall be conclusive evidence of the fact and amount of
such judgment. Except to the extent that a different determination or finding
is mandated due to the applicable Law being that of a different jurisdiction,
the Parties agree that all judicial determinations or findings by a state or
federal court in the Borough of Manhattan, City of New York with respect to
any matter under 



this Agreement, including any matter relating in any way to the Debt Financing
or the performance thereof or the transactions contemplated thereby, shall be
binding. In the event a dispute arises under this Agreement, the prevailing
Party or Parties shall be entitled to receive their reasonable attorneys' fees
and court costs from the non-prevailing Party or Parties.

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

To the extent that any Party has or hereafter may acquire any immunity from
jurisdiction of any court or from any legal process (whether through service
or notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution,
execution or otherwise) with respect to itself or its property, each such
Party hereby irrevocably (i) waives such immunity in respect of its
obligations with respect to this Agreement and (ii) submits to the personal
jurisdiction of any court described in this Section 11.11. 

| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

THE PARTIES AGREE THAT THEY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVE THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY
JURY IN ANY ACTION TO ENFORCE OR INTERPRET THE PROVISIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT OR
OTHERWISE ARISING FROM THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THE DEBT
FINANCING, INCLUDING ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM AGAINST ANY
FINANCING SOURCE. 

| 
---|--- 

11.12

|

Seller Individual and Several Liability. 

Without affecting Buyer's recourse to the Escrow Accounts in accordance with
Section 9.5(b), the liability of each Seller for any amount or obligation
under this Agreement or any certificate delivered by any Sellers hereunder or
in connection with any of the transactions contemplated hereby shall be
individual and several (and not joint and several).

| 
---|--- 

11.13

|

Privilege. 

Buyer shall not assert, and shall cause its Affiliates not to assert, any
attorney-client privilege with respect to any communication between any of the
Acquired Companies (prior to the Closing) or any Seller or any of Sellers'
Affiliates or any of their respective officers, employees, managers or
directors (any such Person, a "Designated Person"), on the one hand, and any
legal counsel currently or formerly representing a Designated Person in
connection with this Agreement or any other agreements or transactions
contemplated hereby (collectively, "Privileged Information"), including in
connection with a dispute between any Designated Person and one or more of
Buyer, the Acquired Companies and their respective Affiliates, it being the
intention of the Parties that all rights to such attorney-client privilege and
to control such attorney-client privilege shall be retained by Sellers and
their Affiliates (excluding the Acquired Companies). Furthermore, Buyer
acknowledges and agrees that no Privileged Information is subject to any joint
privilege (whether or not the Acquired Companies also received such advice or
communication) and that all Privileged Information shall be owned solely by
Sellers and their Affiliates (excluding the Acquired Companies). All books and
records of the Acquired Companies to the extent containing any such Privileged
Information shall be 



excluded from the transaction, and shall be distributed (or deemed to have
been distributed) to Sellers immediately prior to the Closing, with no copies
retained by the Acquired Companies.

| 
---|--- 

11.14

|

Equitable Remedies. 

The Parties agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even if
available, would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that the
Parties do not perform the provisions of this Agreement (including failing to
take such actions as are required of them hereunder to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement) in accordance with its specified
terms or otherwise breach such provisions. It is accordingly agreed that the
Parties shall be entitled to an injunction, specific performance and other
equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof, this being in addition to any
other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity, as limited by
this Agreement. Each of the Parties agrees that it will not oppose the
granting of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief on
the basis that the Party seeking the injunction, specific performance and
other equitable relief has an adequate remedy of law, except to the extent
Buyer has a remedy (or limitation thereon) pursuant to Article IX. To the
extent any Party brings any action to enforce specifically the performance of
the terms and provisions of this Agreement (other than an action solely to
specifically enforce any provision that expressly survives termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1) when available to such Party pursuant to
the terms of this Agreement, the Outside Date shall automatically be extended
by (i) the amount of time during which such action is pending, plus twenty
(20) Business Days, or (ii) such other time period established by the court
presiding over such action.

|

Sellers' Representative 

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

Each Seller designates as its true and lawful representative, agent and
attorney-in-fact of such Seller WGLM (in such capacity, and any successor
appointed to serve in such capacity, the "Sellers' Representative") solely for
the express purpose of acting in the name of and on behalf of such Seller in
each of the following: (i) giving and receiving all notices or consents
permitted or required by this Agreement and otherwise acting on Sellers'
behalf hereunder for all purposes expressly specified herein, to the extent
specified herein and subject to any limitations on such authority included in
this Agreement or any other Contract between Sellers' Representative and one
or more Sellers; (ii) attending to any and all matters related to the Closing
in accordance with Section 2.4, including executing and delivering the
executed Escrow Agreements under Section 2.4(b) and the certificate described
in Section 8.2(e) and receiving Buyer's deliverables pursuant to Section
2.4(c) (provided that Sellers' Representative shall have no authority to waive
conditions to Closing on behalf of the other Sellers or to allocate or direct
the payment of funds hereunder other than as expressly set forth hereunder);
(iii) communicating to Buyer any amounts determined in accordance with, and
coordinating the resolution of any dispute under, Section 2.3; (iv) providing
DS Updates in accordance with Section 6.6; (v) coordinating the 



resolution of any dispute relating to Tax Returns in accordance with Section
7.1 and preparing the Transfer Tax Returns in accordance with Section 7.3,
(vi) coordinating the resolution of any dispute relating to the allocation
statement in accordance with Section 7.5(b); (vii) administering, controlling
and satisfying any Third-Party Claim in accordance with Section 9.3; (viii)
submitting Joint Directions to the Escrow Agent for the release of Escrow

notices, requests, instructions, instruments, certificates, letters and other
writings, and in general doing all things and taking all actions that Sellers'
Representative may consider necessary or proper in connection with any of the
foregoing, subject in all respects to any limitations on such authority
included in this Agreement or any other Contract between Sellers'
Representative and one or more Sellers. All actions taken hereunder by
Sellers' Representative shall be deemed to be taken on behalf of Sellers as a
group, and not on behalf of itself in its capacity as a Seller.

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

By executing this Agreement, WGLM (i) accepts its appointment and
authorization to act as Sellers' Representative as attorney-in-fact and agent
on behalf of Sellers in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and (ii)
agrees to perform its obligations under, and otherwise comply with, this
Section 11.15. 

| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

If WGLM or any successor Sellers' Representative ceases to function in its
capacity as Sellers' Representative for any reason whatsoever, then Sellers
shall have the right to appoint a successor Sellers' Representative by written
notice to Buyer signed by each Seller other than the Seller serving as
Sellers' Representative. 

| 
---|--- 

(d)

|

Each Seller hereby authorizes Buyer and its Affiliates to rely in good faith
on any action taken by Sellers' Representative in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement as having been fully and properly authorized by Sellers. 

| 
---|--- 

(e)

|

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Sellers' Representative shall
not have any liability to Buyer or any other Buyer Indemnified Party in
connection with this Agreement, except to the extent such liability is a
result of Sellers' Representative's gross negligence, willful misconduct or
Fraud, or incurred in the Person serving as Sellers' Representative's capacity
as a Seller hereunder, it being understood and agreed that Sellers'
Representative is acting solely as the representative of Sellers and solely
for the purposes set forth herein.

company ("COG" and together with EIF, VED II, VED I and WGLM, "Sellers"),
Buyer and Sellers have agreed to establish an escrow arrangement as Buyer's
recourse for payment of any adjustment payment due under Section 2.3(d)(i) of
the Purchase Agreement;

WHEREAS, a condition to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
the Purchase Agreement is that the Interested Parties enter into this
Agreement;

WHEREAS, pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, Sellers have authorized Sellers'
Representative to enter into this Agreement on their behalf; and

WHEREAS, the Interested Parties wish to appoint Citibank as Escrow Agent to
receive, hold and invest the Escrow Deposit (as defined below) to satisfy a
portion of the Sellers' obligations under Section 2.3(d)(i) of the Purchase
Agreement and to disburse said Escrow Deposit in accordance with the terms set
forth herein, and Citibank is willing to accept such appointment and to so act
as Escrow Agent, in each case upon the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual representations, warranties and
covenants contained herein, and for other good and valuable consideration, the
receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby irrevocably acknowledged, the
parties hereto agree as follows:

1. Appointment.

transfer of immediately available funds the amount of $10,000,000 (the "Escrow
Deposit", and together with any investment income or proceeds received from

binding arbitrator to enforce an award (a "Final Award") with respect to the
Escrow Property, such Interested Party may concurrently or promptly thereafter
deliver to the Escrow Agent and the other Interested Party a copy of such
Final Award (certified by the delivering Interested Party as being a true and

provided that it is received on or before 11:00 a.m. New York City time. Any
Escrow Deposit received by the Escrow Agent after 11:00 a.m. New York City
time shall be treated as if received on the following Business Day. For
purposes of this Agreement, "Business Day" shall mean any day that the Escrow
Agent is open for business.



(b) The Escrow Agent shall send an account statement to each of the Interested
Parties on a monthly basis reflecting activity in the Escrow Account for the
preceding month.

(c) The Escrow Agent is hereby authorized and directed to sell or redeem any
such investments as it deems necessary to make any payments or distributions
required under this Agreement. The Escrow Agent shall have no responsibility
or liability for any loss in the value of any investment made pursuant to this
Agreement, or for any loss, cost or penalty resulting from any sale or
liquidation of the Escrow Property, except in the event of gross negligence,
fraud or willful misconduct. The Escrow Agent is hereby authorized to execute
purchases and sales of investments through the facilities of its own trading
or capital markets operations or those of any affiliated entity. The Escrow
Agent does not have a duty nor will it undertake any duty to provide
investment advice.

(d) The Escrow Agent shall disburse all investment income on an annual basis
to each Seller in accordance with the allocation set forth on Schedule D.

5. Tax Matters.

(a) The Interested Parties agree that any earnings or proceeds received on or
distributions of earnings or proceeds from the Escrow Property during a
calendar year period shall be treated as the income of each Seller in
accordance with the allocation set forth on Schedule D and shall be reported
on an annual basis by the Escrow Agent on the appropriate United States
Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") Form 1099 (or IRS Form 1042-S), as required
pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and
the regulations thereunder. The Interested Parties and the Escrow Agent agree
that the Escrow Agent will not be responsible for providing tax reporting and
withholding for payments which are for compensation for services performed by
an employee or independent contractor.

(b) If IRS imputed interest requirements apply, the Interested Parties are
solely responsible to inform the Escrow Agent, provide the Escrow Agent with
all imputed interest calculations, and the Escrow Agent shall rely solely on
such provided calculations and information and shall have no responsibility
for the accuracy or 

completeness of any such calculations or information or for the failure of the
Interested Parties to provide such calculations or information.

(c) The Interested Parties shall each, upon the execution of this Agreement,
provide the Escrow Agent with a duly completed and properly executed IRS Form
W-9 or applicable IRS Form W-8, in the case of a non-U.S. person, for each
payee and each Seller together with any other documentation and information
reasonably requested by the Escrow Agent in connection with the Escrow Agent's
tax reporting obligations under the Code and the regulations thereunder. With
respect to the Escrow Agent's tax reporting obligations under the Code, the
Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act and the Foreign Investment in Real Property
Tax Act and any other applicable law or regulation, the Interested Parties
understand that, in the event valid U.S. tax forms or other required
supporting documentation are not provided to the Escrow Agent, the Escrow
Agent may be required to withhold tax from the Escrow Property and report
account information on any earnings, proceeds or distributions from the Escrow
Property.

(d) Should the Escrow Agent become liable for the payment of taxes other than
taxes imposed on or with respect to the income or profits of the Escrow Agent,
including withholding taxes relating to any funds, including interest and
penalties thereon, held by it pursuant to this Agreement or any payment made
hereunder (any such taxes ("Indemnified Taxes"), the Escrow Agent shall
satisfy such liability to the extent possible from the Escrow Property. The
Interested Parties agree, jointly and severally, to indemnify and hold the
Escrow Agent harmless pursuant to Section 7(c) hereof from any liability or
obligation on account of Indemnified Taxes that may be assessed or asserted
against the Escrow Agent.

(e) The Escrow Agent's rights under this Section 5 shall survive the
termination of this Agreement or the resignation or removal of the Escrow
Agent.

6. Concerning the Escrow Agent.

(a) Escrow Agent Duties. Each Interested Party acknowledges and agrees that
(i) the duties, responsibilities and obligations of the Escrow Agent shall be
limited to those expressly set forth in this Agreement, each of which is
administrative or ministerial (and shall not be construed to be fiduciary) in
nature, and no duties, responsibilities or obligations shall be inferred or
implied, (ii) the Escrow Agent shall not be responsible for any of the
agreements referred to or described herein (including, without limitation, the
Purchase Agreement), or for determining or compelling compliance therewith,
and shall not otherwise be bound thereby, and (iii) the Escrow Agent shall not
be required to expend or risk any of its own funds to satisfy payments from
the Escrow Property hereunder.

(b) Liability of Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent shall not be liable for any
damage, loss or injury resulting from any action taken or omitted in the
absence of gross negligence, fraud or willful misconduct (as finally
adjudicated by a court of competent jurisdiction). In no event shall the
Escrow Agent be liable for indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive or
special losses or damages (including, but not limited to, lost profits),
regardless of the form of action and whether or not any such losses or damages 

were foreseeable or contemplated. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely
upon any instruction, notice, request or other instrument delivered to it and
believed by the Escrow Agent, acting in good faith, to be genuine and what it
purports to be without being required to investigate the authenticity or
validity thereof, or the truth or accuracy of any information stated therein.
The Escrow Agent may act in reliance upon any signature believed by it, acting
in good faith, to be genuine and may assume that any person that is designated
as an Authorized Person purporting to make any statement, execute any
document, or send any instruction in connection with the provisions hereof has
been duly authorized to do so. The Escrow Agent may consult with counsel
satisfactory to it (provided that such counsel is selected with reasonable
care), and the opinion or advice of such counsel shall be full and complete
authorization and protection in respect of any action taken, suffered or
omitted by it in good faith and in accordance with the opinion and advice of
such counsel in the absence of gross negligence, bad faith, fraud or willful
misconduct (as finally adjudicated by a court of competent jurisdiction). The
Escrow Agent may perform any and all of its duties through its agents,
representatives, attorneys, custodians and/or nominees. The Escrow Agent shall
not incur any liability for not performing any act or fulfilling any
obligation hereunder by reason of any occurrence beyond its reasonable control
(including, without limitation, any provision of any present or future law or
regulation or any act of any governmental authority, any act of God or war or
terrorism, or the unavailability of the Federal Reserve Bank wire services or
any electronic communication facility); provided that the Escrow Agent shall
use its best efforts to avoid and mitigate the adverse impacts of such
occurrence and remedy the same as promptly as possible to resume performance.

(c) Reliance on Orders. The Escrow Agent is authorized to comply with Final
Awards with respect to the Escrow Property, without determination by the
Escrow Agent of such court\'s jurisdiction in the matter. If any portion of
the Escrow Property is at any time attached, garnished or levied upon under
any Final Award, or in case the payment, assignment, transfer, conveyance or
delivery of any such property shall be stayed or enjoined by any Final Award,
or in case any Final Award shall be made or entered by any court affecting
such property or any part thereof, then and in any such event, the Escrow
Agent is authorized to rely upon and comply with any such Final Award which it
is advised is binding upon it without the need for appeal or other action; and
if the Escrow Agent complies with any such Final Award, it shall not be liable
to any of the Interested Parties or to any other person or entity by reason of
such compliance even though such Final Award may be subsequently reversed,
modified, annulled, set aside or vacated.

(d) Inspection. All funds or other property held as part of the Escrow
Property shall at all times be clearly identified as being held by the Escrow
Agent hereunder.

(e) Accounting. The Escrow Agent shall keep accurate and detailed records of
all investments, receipts, disbursements, and all other transactions with
respect to the Escrow Property. The Escrow Agent will send monthly statements
to Buyer and Sellers' Representative. Within fifteen (15) days following the
close of each month and within five (5) Business Days after the removal or
resignation of the Escrow Agent, the Escrow Agent shall deliver to Buyer and
Sellers' Representative a written account of its administration of the Escrow
Account during such month or during the period from the 

close of the last preceding month to the date of such removal or resignation,
setting forth all receipts, disbursements and other transactions with respect
to the Escrow Property effected by it, and showing all cash, securities and
other property held in the Escrow Account within the terms hereof at the end
of such month or as of the date of such removal or resignation, as the case
may be.

7. Compensation, Expense Reimbursement and Indemnification.

(a) Compensation. Each of the Interested Parties covenants and agrees to pay
one half of the Escrow Agent's compensation specified in Schedule A. Each of
the Interested Parties covenants and agrees to pay to the Escrow Agent one
half of all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses actually incurred by the Escrow
Agent in the performance of its role under this Agreement (including, but not
limited to, any reasonable attorney's fees incurred in connection with the
preparation and negotiation of this Agreement, which shall be due and payable
upon the execution of this Agreement).

(b) Security and Offset. The Interested Parties hereby grant to the Escrow
Agent a first lien upon, and right of offset against, the Escrow Property with
respect to any fees or expenses due to the Escrow Agent hereunder (including
any claim for indemnification hereunder). In the event that any fees or
expenses, or any other obligations owed to the Escrow Agent (or its counsel)
are not paid to the Escrow Agent within thirty (30) calendar days following
the presentment of an invoice for the payment of such fees and expenses or the
demand for such payment, then the Escrow Agent shall provide notice thereof to
Sellers' Representative and Buyer and if such invoice is not paid by the
Interested Parties within ten (10) days after receipt of such notice, the
Escrow Agent may, without further action or notice, pay such fees and expenses
from the Escrow Property and may sell, convey or otherwise dispose of any
Escrow Property for such purpose.

(c) Indemnification. Each of the Interested Parties covenants and agrees,
jointly and severally, to indemnify the Escrow Agent and its employees,
officers, directors, affiliates, and agents (each, an "Indemnified Party")
for, hold each Indemnified Party harmless from, and defend each Indemnified
Party against, any and all claims, losses, actions, liabilities, costs,
damages and expenses of any nature incurred by any Indemnified Party, arising
out of or in connection with this Agreement or with the administration of its
duties hereunder, including, but not limited to, reasonable attorney's fees,
costs and expenses, except to the extent such loss, liability, damage, cost or
expense shall have been finally adjudicated by a court of competent
jurisdiction to have resulted from the Indemnified Party\'s own gross
negligence, fraud or willful misconduct. The foregoing indemnification and
agreement to hold harmless shall survive the termination of this Agreement and
the resignation or removal of the Escrow Agent. Although certain of the
Interested Parties' obligations pursuant to this Section 7(c) are joint and
several, the Interested Parties agree that as between the Interested Parties,
such obligations shall be apportioned pro-rata in accordance with their
relative obligation in accordance with the following sentence. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, the Interested Parties agree, solely as
between themselves, that any obligation for indemnification under this Section
7(c) (or for Indemnified Taxes or reasonable fees and expenses of the Escrow
Agent described in Section 8) shall be borne by the party or parties
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be responsible for causing
the loss, damage, liability, cost or 

expense against which the Escrow Agent is entitled to indemnification or, if
no such determination is made, then one-half by Buyer and one-half by Sellers'
Representative. This Section 7(c) shall not apply to claims for
indemnification in respect of taxes.

8. Dispute Resolution.

In the event of any disagreement among any of the Interested Parties to this
Agreement, or between any of them and any other person, resulting in adverse
claims or demands being made with respect to the subject matter of this
Agreement, or in the event that the Escrow Agent, in good faith, is in doubt
as to any action it should take hereunder, the Escrow Agent may, at its
option, refuse to comply with any claims or demands and refuse to take any
other action hereunder, so long as such disagreement continues or such doubt
exists, and in any such event, the Escrow Agent shall not be liable in any way
or to any person for its failure or refusal to act (except to the extent of
the Escrow Agent's gross negligence, fraud or willful misconduct), and the
Escrow Agent shall be entitled to continue to so refuse to act and refrain
from acting until the Escrow Agent shall have received (a) a Final Award or
(b) a written agreement executed by each of the Interested Parties involved in
such disagreement, in which case the Escrow Agent shall be authorized to
disburse the Escrow Property in accordance with such Final Award or fully
executed agreement. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to receive (from and at
the expense of the presenting party) an opinion of counsel to the effect that
any Final Award is final and not subject to appeal. The Escrow Agent shall
have the option, after thirty (30) calendar days' notice to the Interested
Parties of its intention to do so, to petition (by means of filing an action
in interpleader or any other appropriate method) any court of competent
jurisdiction, for instructions with respect to any dispute or uncertainty, and
to the extent required or permitted by law, pay into such court the Escrow
Property for holding and disposition in accordance with the instructions of
such court. The actual, out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable
attorneys' fees and expenses) incurred by the Escrow Agent in connection with
such proceeding shall be paid by, and be the joint and several obligation of,
the Interested Parties.

9. Entire Agreement; Exclusive Benefit; Assignment.

This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement among the Interested Parties
and the Escrow Agent and sets forth in its entirety the obligations and duties
of the Escrow Agent with respect to the Escrow Property. As between Buyer and
Sellers' Representative, nothing in this Agreement shall override or amend any
provision of the Purchase Agreement and, to the extent there is a conflict
between the terms of this Agreement and the Purchase Agreement, the Purchase
Agreement shall control. This Agreement is for the exclusive benefit of the
parties to this Agreement and their respective permitted successors, and shall
not be deemed to give, either expressly or implicitly, any legal or equitable
right, remedy, or claim to any other entity or person whatsoever. No party may
assign any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior
written consent of the other parties (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, (i) the
Sellers' Representative may assign this Agreement and all of its rights and
obligations hereunder to any successor Sellers' Representative appointed in
accordance with Section 11.15(c) of the Purchase Agreement, provided, however,
that, such assignment shall be subject to completion by the Escrow Agent to
its satisfaction of its "Know Your Customer" review of such assignee and (ii)
the Buyer may transfer and assign its rights and obligations under this
Agreement without the prior written consent of the Sellers' Representative by
way of collateral assignment to any bank, 

financing institution or other lender providing financing to Buyer now or in
the future or to an affiliate of Buyer or to any successor to Buyer by merger,
consolidation or reorganization, provided, that, such successor will own all
or substantially all of the assets of Buyer, provided, further, however, that,
such assignment shall be subject to (x) completion by the Escrow Agent to its
satisfaction of its "Know Your Customer" review of such assignee and (y) the
Escrow Agent's satisfaction with the indemnity provided by such assignee to
the Escrow Agent.

Resignation and Removal. 

(a) The Interested Parties may remove the Escrow Agent at any time by giving
to the Escrow Agent thirty (30) calendar days' prior written notice of removal
signed by an Authorized Person of each of the Interested Parties. The Escrow
Agent may resign at any time by giving to each of the Interested Parties
thirty (30) calendar days' prior written notice of resignation.

(b) Within thirty (30) calendar days after giving the foregoing notice of
removal to the Escrow Agent or within thirty (30) calendar days after
receiving the foregoing notice of resignation from the Escrow Agent, the
Interested Parties shall appoint a successor escrow agent and give notice of
such successor escrow agent to the Escrow Agent. If a successor escrow agent
has not accepted such appointment by the end of such thirty (30)-day period,
the Escrow Agent may either (i) safe keep the Escrow Property until a
successor escrow agent is appointed, without any obligation to invest the same
or continue to perform under this Agreement (other than the obligation to
retain and safeguard the Escrow Property), or (ii) apply to a court of
competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor escrow agent or for
other appropriate relief.

(c) Upon receipt of notice of the identity of the successor escrow agent
signed by an Authorized Person of each of the Interested Parties, the Escrow
Agent shall either deliver the Escrow Property then held hereunder to the
successor escrow agent, less the Escrow Agent's fees, costs and expenses, or
hold such Escrow Property (or any portion thereof) pending distribution, until
all such fees, costs and expenses are paid to it. Upon delivery of the Escrow
Property to the successor escrow agent in accordance herewith, the Escrow
Agent shall have no further duties, responsibilities or obligations hereunder.

11. Security Procedure. 

In the event Escrow Fund transfer instructions are given by or on behalf of an
Interested Party, whether in writing, or otherwise, Escrow Agent shall seek
confirmation of such instructions by telephone call-back to the person or
persons designated on Schedule B or C hereto as applicable, and Escrow Agent
may rely upon the confirmation of anyone purporting to be the person or
persons so designated. The persons and telephone numbers for call-backs may be
changed only in a writing actually received and acknowledged by Escrow Agent.

WHEREAS, a condition to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
the Purchase Agreement is that the Interested Parties enter into this
Agreement;

WHEREAS, the Interested Parties wish to appoint Citibank as Escrow Agent to

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual representations, warranties and
covenants contained herein, and for other good and valuable consideration, the
receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby irrevocably acknowledged, the
parties hereto agree as follows:

1. Appointment.

Buyer and Sellers' Representative hereby do appoint and designate Citibank as
the Escrow Agent for the purposes set forth herein, and Citibank does hereby
accept such appointment and 

agrees to hold, safeguard and disburse the Escrow Property under the terms and
conditions set forth herein.

2. Establishment of Escrow Account.

of the Purchase Agreement, Buyer is depositing with the Escrow Agent by wire
transfer of immediately available funds the amount of $[___] (the "Escrow
Deposit", and together with any investment income or proceeds received from
the investment thereof from time to time pursuant to Section 4 below,
collectively, the "Escrow Property"), and the Escrow Agent shall hold the
Escrow Property in one separate and distinct account established with the

3. Claims and Payment; Release from Escrow.

The Escrow Property shall be distributed by the Escrow Agent solely in
accordance with the following:

(b) Final Award. If at any time either of the Interested Parties receives a

Escrow Agent with a copy to Sellers' Representative (the "Indemnification
Notice"). Each Indemnification Notice must (A) state the actual or estimated

amount to which the Buyer Indemnified Party would be entitled upon resolution
of such Indemnification Claim and (B) have attached thereto a copy of the
Claim Notice (as defined in the Purchase Agreement) or the notice delivered
under Section 9.3(d) of the Purchase Agreement, as applicable, with respect to
such Indemnification Claim. Prior to 5:00 p.m., Eastern Time on the thirtieth

Notice, Sellers' Representative may deliver notice to Buyer and the Escrow
Agent (a "Counter Indemnification Notice") disputing such Indemnification
Claim in whole or in part (any disputed amount, the "Contested Amount"). The
Escrow Agent shall not inquire into or consider whether an Indemnification
Claim complies with the requirements of the Purchase Agreement.

(ii) If, prior to 5:00 p.m., Eastern Time on the thirtieth (30th) day after
Sellers' Representative's receipt of an Indemnification Notice, Sellers'
Representative does not deliver a Counter Indemnification Notice with respect
to such Indemnification Notice to the Escrow Agent and Buyer, then Buyer may

Uncontested Direction, the Escrow Agent shall promptly, and in any event
within two (2) Business Days after receipt of such Uncontested Direction,
disburse all or a portion of the Escrow Property strictly in accordance with
such Uncontested Direction.

(iii) If, prior to 5:00 p.m., Eastern Time on the thirtieth (30th) day after
Sellers' Representative's receipt of an Indemnification Notice, Sellers'
Representative delivers a Counter Indemnification Notice with respect to such
Indemnification Notice to the Escrow Agent and Buyer, then Buyer may
thereafter deliver an Uncontested Direction to the Escrow Agent, with a copy
to Sellers' Representative, instructing the Escrow Agent to disburse an
amount, if any, equal to the Indemnification Amount set forth in such
Indemnification Notice minus the Contested Amount with respect to such
Indemnification Notice from the Escrow Property to Buyer. Upon receipt by the
Escrow Agent of such Uncontested Direction, the Escrow Agent shall promptly,
and in any event within two (2) Business Days after receipt of such
Uncontested Direction, disburse all or a portion of the Escrow Property
strictly in accordance with such Uncontested Direction. Thereafter, the Escrow
Agent shall continue to hold and shall make disbursement of Escrow Property
with respect to such Contested Amount only in accordance with (A) a Joint
Direction or (B) a Final Award Direction (resolved as between Buyer and
Sellers in accordance with the terms of the Purchase Agreement). Upon receipt
of a Joint Direction or Final Award Direction as specified in the preceding
sentence, the Escrow Agent shall disburse to Buyer the dollar amount specified
in the Joint Direction or Final Award Direction, in accordance with Section
3(a) or Section 3(b), as applicable. 

(d) Notices. The Escrow Agent shall conclusively presume that any
Indemnification Notice or Counter Indemnification Notice delivered to it was
simultaneously delivered to Buyer or the Sellers' Representative as provided
above.

(e) Step-Down Release.

(i) On or after the Initial Indemnity Escrow Release Date or the Final
Indemnity Escrow Release Date (each as defined below), as applicable, Sellers'
Representative shall have the right to seek payment of the amount to which
Sellers are entitled under Section 9.5(b)(i) of the Purchase Agreement out of
the Escrow Property by delivering notice containing the information set forth
below to the Escrow Agent with a copy to Buyer (the "Release Notice"). Each
Release Notice must (A) state the dollar amount sought to be paid from the
Escrow Property and include a certification that such amount represents
Sellers' Representative's good faith estimate of the amount to which the
Sellers are entitled pursuant to Section 9.5(b)(i) of the Purchase Agreement
(such amount, the "Released Amount") and (B) include the Sellers'
Representative's basis for calculating the Released Amount in accordance with
Section 9.5(b)(i)(A), (B) or (C) of the Purchase Agreement, as applicable.
Prior to 5:00 p.m. Central Time on the tenth (10th) Business Day after Buyer's
receipt of the Release Notice, Buyer may deliver notice to Sellers'
Representative and the Escrow Agent (a "Counter Release Notice") disputing
such Released Amount in whole or in part (any disputed amount, the "Contested
Released Amount"). The Escrow Agent shall not inquire into or consider whether
a Release Notice complies with the requirements of the Purchase Agreement. The
"Initial Indemnity Escrow Release Date" means the date that is eighteen (18)
months after the Effective Date. The "Final Indemnity Escrow Release Date"
means the date that is twenty-four (24) months after the Effective Date.

(ii) If, prior to 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on the tenth (10th) Business Day
after Buyer's receipt of a Release Notice, Buyer does not deliver a Counter
Release Notice with respect to such Release Notice to the Escrow Agent and
Sellers' Representative, then Sellers' Representative may thereafter deliver a
notice to the Escrow Agent with a copy to Buyer (an "Uncontested Release
Direction") instructing the Escrow Agent to disburse the Released Amount set
forth in such Release Notice from the Escrow Property to Sellers. Upon receipt
by the Escrow Agent of such Uncontested Release Direction, the Escrow Agent
shall promptly, and in any event within two (2) Business Days after receipt of
such Uncontested Release Direction, disburse all or a portion of the Escrow
Property strictly in accordance with such Uncontested Release Direction.

(iii) If, prior to 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on the tenth (10th) Business Day
after Buyer's receipt of a Release Notice, Buyer delivers a Counter Release
Notice with respect to such Release Notice to the Escrow Agent and Sellers'
Representative, then Sellers' Representative may thereafter deliver an
Uncontested Release Direction to the Escrow Agent, with a copy to Buyer,
instructing the Escrow Agent to disburse an amount, if any, equal to the
Release Amount set forth in such Release Notice minus the Contested Release
Amount with respect to such Release Notice from the Escrow Property to
Sellers. Upon receipt by the Escrow Agent of such Uncontested Release
Direction, the Escrow Agent shall promptly, and in any event within two (2)
Business Days after receipt of such Uncontested Release Direction, disburse
all or a portion of the Escrow Property 

strictly in accordance with such Uncontested Release Direction. Thereafter,
the Escrow Agent shall continue to hold and shall make disbursement of Escrow
Property with respect to such Contested Release Amount only in accordance with
(A) a Joint Direction or (B) a Final Award Direction (resolved as between
Buyer and Sellers in accordance with the terms of the Purchase Agreement).
Upon receipt of a Joint Direction or Final Award Direction as specified in the
preceding sentence, the Escrow Agent shall disburse to Sellers the dollar
amount specified in the Joint Direction or Final Award Direction, in
accordance with Section 3(a) or Section 3 (b), as applicable.

(f) No Obligation to Replenish. With respect to any distributions by the
Escrow Agent to an Interested Party, such distributions shall reduce the
amount of the Escrow Property, and no Interested Party shall be obligated to
replenish such distributed amounts.

4. Investment of Funds.

(a) Unless otherwise instructed in writing by the Parties, the Escrow Agent
shall invest the Escrow Funds in an interest-bearing deposit obligation of
Citibank N.A. insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC") to
the applicable limits. The Interested Parties acknowledge that the initial
interest rate is subject to change from time to time and shall be reflected in
the monthly statement provided to the Parties. The Escrow Funds shall at all
times remain available for distribution in accordance with Section 3 above.
The Escrow Agent shall invest the Escrow Deposit on the date of deposit,
provided that it is received on or before 11:00 a.m. New York City time. Any
Escrow Deposit received by the Escrow Agent after 11:00 a.m. New York City
time shall be treated as if received on the following Business Day. For
purposes of this Agreement, "Business Day" shall mean any day that the Escrow
Agent is open for business.



(b) The Escrow Agent shall send an account statement to each of the Interested
Parties on a monthly basis reflecting activity in the Escrow Account for the
preceding month.

(c) The Escrow Agent is hereby authorized and directed to sell or redeem any
such investments as it deems necessary to make any payments or distributions
required under this Agreement. The Escrow Agent shall have no responsibility
or liability for any loss in the value of any investment made pursuant to this
Agreement, or for any loss, cost or penalty resulting from any sale or
liquidation of the Escrow Property, except in the event of gross negligence,
fraud or willful misconduct. The Escrow Agent is hereby authorized to execute
purchases and sales of investments through the facilities of its own trading
or capital markets operations or those of any affiliated entity. The Escrow
Agent does not have a duty nor will it undertake any duty to provide
investment advice.

(d) The Escrow Agent shall disburse all investment income on an annual basis
to each Seller in accordance with the allocation set forth on Schedule D.

5. Tax Matters.

(a) The Interested Parties agree that any earnings or proceeds received on or
distributions of earnings or proceeds from the Escrow Property during a
calendar year 

period shall be treated as the income of each Seller in accordance with the
allocation set forth on Schedule D and shall be reported on an annual basis by
the Escrow Agent on the appropriate United States Internal Revenue Service
("IRS") Form 1099 (or IRS Form 1042-S), as required pursuant to the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and the regulations thereunder.
The Interested Parties and the Escrow Agent agree that the Escrow Agent will
not be responsible for providing tax reporting and withholding for payments
which are for compensation for services performed by an employee or
independent contractor.

(b) If IRS imputed interest requirements apply, the Interested Parties are
solely responsible to inform the Escrow Agent, provide the Escrow Agent with
all imputed interest calculations, and the Escrow Agent shall rely solely on
such provided calculations and information and shall have no responsibility
for the accuracy or completeness of any such calculations or information or
for the failure of the Interested Parties to provide such calculations or
information.

(c) The Interested Parties shall each, upon the execution of this Agreement,
provide the Escrow Agent with a duly completed and properly executed IRS Form
W-9 or applicable IRS Form W-8, in the case of a non-U.S. person, for each
payee and each Seller together with any other documentation and information
reasonably requested by the Escrow Agent in connection with the Escrow Agent's
tax reporting obligations under the Code and the regulations thereunder. With
respect to the Escrow Agent's tax reporting obligations under the Code, the
Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act and the Foreign Investment in Real Property
Tax Act and any other applicable law or regulation, the Interested Parties
understand that, in the event valid U.S. tax forms or other required
supporting documentation are not provided to the Escrow Agent, the Escrow
Agent may be required to withhold tax from the Escrow Property and report
account information on any earnings, proceeds or distributions from the Escrow
Property.

(d) Should the Escrow Agent become liable for the payment of taxes other than
taxes imposed on or with respect to the income or profits of the Escrow Agent,
including withholding taxes relating to any funds, including interest and
penalties thereon, held by it pursuant to this Agreement or any payment made
hereunder (any such taxes ("Indemnified Taxes"), the Escrow Agent shall
satisfy such liability to the extent possible from the Escrow Property. The
Interested Parties agree, jointly and severally, to indemnify and hold the
Escrow Agent harmless pursuant to Section 7(c) hereof from any liability or
obligation on account of Indemnified Taxes that may be assessed or asserted
against the Escrow Agent.

(e) The Escrow Agent's rights under this Section 5 shall survive the
termination of this Agreement or the resignation or removal of the Escrow
Agent.

6. Concerning the Escrow Agent.

(a) Escrow Agent Duties. Each Interested Party acknowledges and agrees that
(i) the duties, responsibilities and obligations of the Escrow Agent shall be
limited to those expressly set forth in this Agreement, each of which is
administrative or ministerial (and shall not be construed to be fiduciary) in
nature, and no duties, responsibilities or 

obligations shall be inferred or implied, (ii) the Escrow Agent shall not be
responsible for any of the agreements referred to or described herein
(including, without limitation, the Purchase Agreement), or for determining or
compelling compliance therewith, and shall not otherwise be bound thereby, and
(iii) the Escrow Agent shall not be required to expend or risk any of its own
funds to satisfy payments from the Escrow Property hereunder.

(b) Liability of Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent shall not be liable for any
damage, loss or injury resulting from any action taken or omitted in the
absence of gross negligence, fraud or willful misconduct (as finally
adjudicated by a court of competent jurisdiction). In no event shall the
Escrow Agent be liable for indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive or
special losses or damages (including, but not limited to, lost profits),
regardless of the form of action and whether or not any such losses or damages
were foreseeable or contemplated. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely
upon any instruction, notice, request or other instrument delivered to it and
believed by the Escrow Agent, acting in good faith, to be genuine and what it
purports to be without being required to investigate the authenticity or
validity thereof, or the truth or accuracy of any information stated therein.
The Escrow Agent may act in reliance upon any signature believed by it, acting
in good faith, to be genuine and may assume that any person that is designated
as an Authorized Person purporting to make any statement, execute any
document, or send any instruction in connection with the provisions hereof has
been duly authorized to do so. The Escrow Agent may consult with counsel
satisfactory to it (provided that such counsel is selected with reasonable
care), and the opinion or advice of such counsel shall be full and complete
authorization and protection in respect of any action taken, suffered or
omitted by it in good faith and in accordance with the opinion and advice of
such counsel in the absence of gross negligence, bad faith, fraud or willful
misconduct (as finally adjudicated by a court of competent jurisdiction). The
Escrow Agent may perform any and all of its duties through its agents,
representatives, attorneys, custodians and/or nominees. The Escrow Agent shall
not incur any liability for not performing any act or fulfilling any
obligation hereunder by reason of any occurrence beyond its reasonable control
(including, without limitation, any provision of any present or future law or
regulation or any act of any governmental authority, any act of God or war or
terrorism, or the unavailability of the Federal Reserve Bank wire services or
any electronic communication facility); provided that the Escrow Agent shall
use its best efforts to avoid and mitigate the adverse impacts of such
occurrence and remedy the same as promptly as possible to resume performance.

(c) Reliance on Orders. The Escrow Agent is authorized to comply with Final
Awards with respect to the Escrow Property, without determination by the
Escrow Agent of such court\'s jurisdiction in the matter. If any portion of
the Escrow Property is at any time attached, garnished or levied upon under
any Final Award, or in case the payment, assignment, transfer, conveyance or
delivery of any such property shall be stayed or enjoined by any Final Award,
or in case any Final Award shall be made or entered by any court affecting
such property or any part thereof, then and in any such event, the Escrow
Agent is authorized to rely upon and comply with any such Final Award which it
is advised is binding upon it without the need for appeal or other action; and
if the Escrow Agent complies with any such Final Award, it shall not be liable
to any of the Interested 

Parties or to any other person or entity by reason of such compliance even
though such Final Award may be subsequently reversed, modified, annulled, set
aside or vacated.

(d) Inspection. All funds or other property held as part of the Escrow
Property shall at all times be clearly identified as being held by the Escrow
Agent hereunder.

(e) Accounting. The Escrow Agent shall keep accurate and detailed records of
all investments, receipts, disbursements, and all other transactions with
respect to the Escrow Property. The Escrow Agent will send monthly statements
to Buyer and Sellers' Representative. Within fifteen (15) days following the
close of each month and within five (5) Business Days after the removal or
resignation of the Escrow Agent, the Escrow Agent shall deliver to Buyer and
Sellers' Representative a written account of its administration of the Escrow
Account during such month or during the period from the close of the last
preceding month to the date of such removal or resignation, setting forth all
receipts, disbursements and other transactions with respect to the Escrow
Property effected by it, and showing all cash, securities and other property
held in the Escrow Account within the terms hereof at the end of such month or
as of the date of such removal or resignation, as the case may be.

7. Compensation, Expense Reimbursement and Indemnification.

(a) Compensation. Each of the Interested Parties covenants and agrees to pay
one half of the Escrow Agent's compensation specified in Schedule A. Each of
the Interested Parties covenants and agrees to pay to the Escrow Agent one
half of all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses actually incurred by the Escrow
Agent in the performance of its role under this Agreement (including, but not
limited to, any reasonable attorney's fees incurred in connection with the
preparation and negotiation of this Agreement, which shall be due and payable
upon the execution of this Agreement).

(b) Security and Offset. The Interested Parties hereby grant to the Escrow
Agent a first lien upon, and right of offset against, the Escrow Property with
respect to any fees or expenses due to the Escrow Agent hereunder (including
any claim for indemnification hereunder). In the event that any fees or
expenses, or any other obligations owed to the Escrow Agent (or its counsel)
are not paid to the Escrow Agent within thirty (30) calendar days following
the presentment of an invoice for the payment of such fees and expenses or the
demand for such payment, then the Escrow Agent shall provide notice thereof to
Sellers' Representative and Buyer and if such invoice is not paid by the
Interested Parties within ten (10) days after receipt of such notice, the
Escrow Agent may, without further action or notice, pay such fees and expenses
from the Escrow Property and may sell, convey or otherwise dispose of any
Escrow Property for such purpose.

(c) Indemnification. Each of the Interested Parties covenants and agrees,
jointly and severally, to indemnify the Escrow Agent and its employees,
officers, directors, affiliates, and agents (each, an "Indemnified Party")
for, hold each Indemnified Party harmless from, and defend each Indemnified
Party against, any and all claims, losses, actions, liabilities, costs,
damages and expenses of any nature incurred by any Indemnified Party, arising
out of or in connection with this Agreement or with the administration of its
duties hereunder, including, but not limited to, reasonable attorney's fees,
costs and 

expenses, except to the extent such loss, liability, damage, cost or expense
shall have been finally adjudicated by a court of competent jurisdiction to
have resulted from the Indemnified Party\'s own gross negligence, fraud or
willful misconduct. The foregoing indemnification and agreement to hold
harmless shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the resignation
or removal of the Escrow Agent. Although certain of the Interested Parties'
obligations pursuant to this Section 7(c) are joint and several, the
Interested Parties agree that as between the Interested Parties, such
obligations shall be apportioned pro-rata in accordance with their relative
obligation in accordance with the following sentence. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary herein, the Interested Parties agree, solely as between
themselves, that any obligation for indemnification under this Section 7(c)
(or for Indemnified Taxes or reasonable fees and expenses of the Escrow Agent
described in Section 8) shall be borne by the party or parties determined by a
court of competent jurisdiction to be responsible for causing the loss,
damage, liability, cost or expense against which the Escrow Agent is entitled
to indemnification or, if no such determination is made, then one-half by
Buyer and one-half by Sellers' Representative. This Section 7(c) shall not
apply to claims for indemnification in respect of taxes.

8. Dispute Resolution.

In the event of any disagreement among any of the Interested Parties to this
Agreement, or between any of them and any other person, resulting in adverse
claims or demands being made with respect to the subject matter of this
Agreement, or in the event that the Escrow Agent, in good faith, is in doubt
as to any action it should take hereunder, the Escrow Agent may, at its
option, refuse to comply with any claims or demands and refuse to take any
other action hereunder, so long as such disagreement continues or such doubt
exists, and in any such event, the Escrow Agent shall not be liable in any way
or to any person for its failure or refusal to act (except to the extent of
the Escrow Agent's gross negligence, fraud or willful misconduct), and the
Escrow Agent shall be entitled to continue to so refuse to act and refrain
from acting until the Escrow Agent shall have received (a) a Final Award or
(b) a written agreement executed by each of the Interested Parties involved in
such disagreement, in which case the Escrow Agent shall be authorized to
disburse the Escrow Property in accordance with such Final Award or fully
executed agreement. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to receive (from and at
the expense of the presenting party) an opinion of counsel to the effect that
any Final Award is final and not subject to appeal. The Escrow Agent shall
have the option, after thirty (30) calendar days' notice to the Interested
Parties of its intention to do so, to petition (by means of filing an action
in interpleader or any other appropriate method) any court of competent
jurisdiction, for instructions with respect to any dispute or uncertainty, and
to the extent required or permitted by law, pay into such court the Escrow
Property for holding and disposition in accordance with the instructions of
such court. The actual, out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable
attorneys' fees and expenses) incurred by the Escrow Agent in connection with
such proceeding shall be paid by, and be the joint and several obligation of,
the Interested Parties.

9. Entire Agreement; Exclusive Benefit; Assignment.

This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement among the Interested Parties
and the Escrow Agent and sets forth in its entirety the obligations and duties
of the Escrow Agent with respect to the Escrow Property. As between Buyer and
Sellers' Representative, nothing in this Agreement shall override or amend any
provision of the Purchase Agreement and, to the extent there is a 

conflict between the terms of this Agreement and the Purchase Agreement, the
Purchase Agreement shall control. This Agreement is for the exclusive benefit
of the parties to this Agreement and their respective permitted successors,
and shall not be deemed to give, either expressly or implicitly, any legal or
equitable right, remedy, or claim to any other entity or person whatsoever. No
party may assign any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement without
the prior written consent of the other parties (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, (i) the Sellers' Representative may assign this Agreement and all of
its rights and obligations hereunder to any successor Sellers' Representative
appointed in accordance with Section 11.15(c) of the Purchase Agreement,
provided, however, that, such assignment shall be subject to completion by the
Escrow Agent to its satisfaction of its "Know Your Customer" review of such
assignee and (ii) the Buyer may transfer and assign its rights and obligations
under this Agreement without the prior written consent of the Sellers'
Representative by way of collateral assignment to any bank, financing
institution or other lender providing financing to Buyer now or in the future
or to an affiliate of Buyer or to any successor to Buyer by merger,
consolidation or reorganization, provided, that, such successor will own all
or substantially all of the assets of Buyer, provided, further, however, that,
such assignment shall be subject to (x) completion by the Escrow Agent to its
satisfaction of its "Know Your Customer" review of such assignee and (y) the
Escrow Agent's satisfaction with the indemnity provided by such assignee to
the Escrow Agent.

Resignation and Removal. 

(a) The Interested Parties may remove the Escrow Agent at any time by giving
to the Escrow Agent thirty (30) calendar days' prior written notice of removal
signed by an Authorized Person of each of the Interested Parties. The Escrow
Agent may resign at any time by giving to each of the Interested Parties
thirty (30) calendar days' prior written notice of resignation.

(b) Within thirty (30) calendar days after giving the foregoing notice of
removal to the Escrow Agent or within thirty (30) calendar days after
receiving the foregoing notice of resignation from the Escrow Agent, the
Interested Parties shall appoint a successor escrow agent and give notice of
such successor escrow agent to the Escrow Agent. If a successor escrow agent
has not accepted such appointment by the end of such thirty (30)-day period,
the Escrow Agent may either (i) safe keep the Escrow Property until a
successor escrow agent is appointed, without any obligation to invest the same
or continue to perform under this Agreement (other than the obligation to
retain and safeguard the Escrow Property), or (ii) apply to a court of
competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor escrow agent or for
other appropriate relief.

(c) Upon receipt of notice of the identity of the successor escrow agent
signed by an Authorized Person of each of the Interested Parties, the Escrow
Agent shall either deliver the Escrow Property then held hereunder to the
successor escrow agent, less the Escrow Agent's fees, costs and expenses, or
hold such Escrow Property (or any portion thereof) pending distribution, until
all such fees, costs and expenses are paid to it. Upon delivery of the Escrow
Property to the successor escrow agent in accordance herewith, the Escrow
Agent shall have no further duties, responsibilities or obligations hereunder. 

11. Security Procedure. 

In the event Escrow Fund transfer instructions are given by or on behalf of an
Interested Party, whether in writing, or otherwise, Escrow Agent shall seek
confirmation of such instructions by telephone call-back to the person or
persons designated on Schedule B or C hereto as applicable, and Escrow Agent
may rely upon the confirmation of anyone purporting to be the person or
persons so designated. The persons and telephone numbers for call-backs may be
changed only in a writing actually received and acknowledged by Escrow Agent.

terms and provisions of the Purchase Agreement (a "Transfer Tax
Indemnification Amount") out of the Escrow Property by delivering written
notice containing the information set forth below to the Escrow Agent with a
copy to Sellers' Representative (the "Transfer Tax Indemnification Notice").
Each Transfer Tax Indemnification Notice must (A) state the actual or

Amount"). The Escrow Agent shall not inquire into or consider whether a
Transfer Tax Claim complies with the requirements of the Purchase Agreement.

(ii) If, prior to 5:00 p.m., Eastern Time on the thirtieth (30th) day after
Sellers' Representative's receipt of a Transfer Tax Indemnification Notice,
Sellers' Representative does not deliver a Counter Indemnification Notice with

Sellers' Representative's receipt of a Transfer Tax Indemnification Notice,
Sellers' Representative delivers a Counter Indemnification Notice with respect
to such Transfer Tax Indemnification Notice to the Escrow Agent and Buyer,
then Buyer may thereafter deliver an Uncontested Direction to the Escrow
Agent, with a copy to Sellers' Representative, instructing the Escrow Agent to
disburse an amount, if any, equal to the Transfer Tax Indemnification Amount
set forth in such Transfer Tax Indemnification Notice minus the Contested

Escrow Property to Buyer. Upon receipt by the Escrow Agent of such Uncontested
Direction, the Escrow Agent shall promptly, and in any event within two (2)
Business Days after receipt of such Uncontested Direction, disburse all or a
portion of the Escrow Property strictly in accordance with such Uncontested
Direction. Thereafter, the Escrow Agent shall continue to hold and shall make
disbursement of Escrow Property with respect to such Contested Amount only in
accordance with (A) a Joint Direction or (B) a Final Award Direction (resolved
as between Buyer and Sellers in accordance with the terms of the Purchase
Agreement). Upon receipt of a Joint Direction or Final Award Direction as

after the Transfer Tax Escrow Release Date (as defined below), Sellers'
Representative shall have the right to seek payment of the amount to which
Sellers are entitled under Section 7.3(f) or Section 9.5(b)(ii) of the
Purchase Agreement, as applicable, out of the Escrow Property by delivering
notice containing the information set forth below to the Escrow Agent with a
copy to Buyer (the "Release Notice"). Each Release Notice must (A) state the
dollar amount sought to be paid from the Escrow Property and include a
certification that such amount represents Sellers' Representative's good faith
estimate of the amount to which the Sellers are entitled pursuant to Section
7.3(f) or Section 9.5(b)(ii) of the Purchase Agreement, as applicable, (such
amount, the "Released Amount") and (B) include the Sellers' Representative's
basis for calculating the Released Amount in accordance with Section

whole or in part (any disputed amount, the "Contested Released Amount"). The

complies with the requirements of the Purchase Agreement. The "Transfer Tax
Escrow Release Date" means the date that is forty-eight (48) months after the
Effective Date.

(ii) If, prior to 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on the tenth (10th) Business Day
after Buyer's receipt of a Release Notice, Buyer does not deliver a Counter

Direction") instructing the Escrow Agent to disburse the Released Amount set

by the Escrow Agent of such Uncontested Release Direction, the Escrow Agent

Representative, then Sellers' Representative may thereafter deliver an
Uncontested Release Direction to the Escrow Agent, with a copy to Buyer,
instructing the Escrow Agent to disburse an amount, if any, equal to the
Release Amount set forth in such Release Notice minus the Contested Release
Amount with respect to such Release Notice from the Escrow Property 

to Sellers. Upon receipt by the Escrow Agent of such Uncontested Release
Direction, the Escrow Agent shall promptly, and in any event within two (2)
Business Days after receipt of such Uncontested Release Direction, disburse
all or a portion of the Escrow Property strictly in accordance with such
Uncontested Release Direction. Thereafter, the Escrow Agent shall continue to
hold and shall make disbursement of Escrow Property with respect to such
Contested Release Amount only in accordance with (A) a Joint Direction or (B)
a Final Award Direction (resolved as between Buyer and Sellers in accordance
with the terms of the Purchase Agreement). Upon receipt of a Joint Direction
or Final Award Direction as specified in the preceding sentence, the Escrow
Agent shall disburse to Sellers the dollar amount specified in the Joint
Direction or Final Award Direction, in accordance with Section 3(a) or Section
3 (b), as applicable.

(f) No Obligation to Replenish. With respect to any distributions by the
Escrow Agent to an Interested Party, such distributions shall reduce the
amount of the Escrow Property, and no Interested Party shall be obligated to
replenish such distributed amounts.

4. Investment of Funds.

(a) Unless otherwise instructed in writing by the Parties, the Escrow Agent
shall invest the Escrow Funds in an interest-bearing deposit obligation of
Citibank N.A. insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC") to
the applicable limits. The Interested Parties acknowledge that the initial
interest rate is subject to change from time to time and shall be reflected in
the monthly statement provided to the Parties. The Escrow Funds shall at all
times remain available for distribution in accordance with Section 3 above.
The Escrow Agent shall invest the Escrow Deposit on the date of deposit,
provided that it is received on or before 11:00 a.m. New York City time. Any
Escrow Deposit received by the Escrow Agent after 11:00 a.m. New York City
time shall be treated as if received on the following Business Day. For
purposes of this Agreement, "Business Day" shall mean any day that the Escrow
Agent is open for business.



(b) The Escrow Agent shall send an account statement to each of the Interested
Parties on a monthly basis reflecting activity in the Escrow Account for the
preceding month.

(c) The Escrow Agent is hereby authorized and directed to sell or redeem any
such investments as it deems necessary to make any payments or distributions
required under this Agreement. The Escrow Agent shall have no responsibility
or liability for any loss in the value of any investment made pursuant to this
Agreement, or for any loss, cost or penalty resulting from any sale or
liquidation of the Escrow Property, except in the event of gross negligence,
fraud or willful misconduct. The Escrow Agent is hereby authorized to execute
purchases and sales of investments through the facilities of its own trading
or capital markets operations or those of any affiliated entity. The Escrow
Agent does not have a duty nor will it undertake any duty to provide
investment advice.

(d) The Escrow Agent shall disburse all investment income on an annual basis
to each Seller in accordance with the allocation set forth on Schedule D. 

5. Tax Matters.

(a) The Interested Parties agree that any earnings or proceeds received on or
distributions of earnings or proceeds from the Escrow Property during a
calendar year period shall be treated as the income of each Seller in
accordance with the allocation set forth on Schedule D and shall be reported
on an annual basis by the Escrow Agent on the appropriate United States
Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") Form 1099 (or IRS Form 1042-S), as required
pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and
the regulations thereunder. The Interested Parties and the Escrow Agent agree
that the Escrow Agent will not be responsible for providing tax reporting and
withholding for payments which are for compensation for services performed by
an employee or independent contractor.

(b) If IRS imputed interest requirements apply, the Interested Parties are
solely responsible to inform the Escrow Agent, provide the Escrow Agent with
all imputed interest calculations, and the Escrow Agent shall rely solely on
such provided calculations and information and shall have no responsibility
for the accuracy or completeness of any such calculations or information or
for the failure of the Interested Parties to provide such calculations or
information.

(c) The Interested Parties shall each, upon the execution of this Agreement,
provide the Escrow Agent with a duly completed and properly executed IRS Form
W-9 or applicable IRS Form W-8, in the case of a non-U.S. person, for each
payee and each Seller together with any other documentation and information
reasonably requested by the Escrow Agent in connection with the Escrow Agent's
tax reporting obligations under the Code and the regulations thereunder. With
respect to the Escrow Agent's tax reporting obligations under the Code, the
Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act and the Foreign Investment in Real Property
Tax Act and any other applicable law or regulation, the Interested Parties
understand that, in the event valid U.S. tax forms or other required
supporting documentation are not provided to the Escrow Agent, the Escrow
Agent may be required to withhold tax from the Escrow Property and report
account information on any earnings, proceeds or distributions from the Escrow
Property.

(d) Should the Escrow Agent become liable for the payment of taxes other than
taxes imposed on or with respect to the income or profits of the Escrow Agent,
including withholding taxes relating to any funds, including interest and
penalties thereon, held by it pursuant to this Agreement or any payment made
hereunder (any such taxes ("Indemnified Taxes"), the Escrow Agent shall
satisfy such liability to the extent possible from the Escrow Property. The
Interested Parties agree, jointly and severally, to indemnify and hold the
Escrow Agent harmless pursuant to Section 7(c) hereof from any liability or
obligation on account of Indemnified Taxes that may be assessed or asserted
against the Escrow Agent.

(e) The Escrow Agent's rights under this Section 5 shall survive the
termination of this Agreement or the resignation or removal of the Escrow
Agent. 

6. Concerning the Escrow Agent.

(a) Escrow Agent Duties. Each Interested Party acknowledges and agrees that
(i) the duties, responsibilities and obligations of the Escrow Agent shall be
limited to those expressly set forth in this Agreement, each of which is
administrative or ministerial (and shall not be construed to be fiduciary) in
nature, and no duties, responsibilities or obligations shall be inferred or
implied, (ii) the Escrow Agent shall not be responsible for any of the
agreements referred to or described herein (including, without limitation, the
Purchase Agreement), or for determining or compelling compliance therewith,
and shall not otherwise be bound thereby, and (iii) the Escrow Agent shall not
be required to expend or risk any of its own funds to satisfy payments from
the Escrow Property hereunder.

(b) Liability of Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent shall not be liable for any
damage, loss or injury resulting from any action taken or omitted in the
absence of gross negligence, fraud or willful misconduct (as finally
adjudicated by a court of competent jurisdiction). In no event shall the
Escrow Agent be liable for indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive or
special losses or damages (including, but not limited to, lost profits),
regardless of the form of action and whether or not any such losses or damages
were foreseeable or contemplated. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely
upon any instruction, notice, request or other instrument delivered to it and
believed by the Escrow Agent, acting in good faith, to be genuine and what it
purports to be without being required to investigate the authenticity or
validity thereof, or the truth or accuracy of any information stated therein.
The Escrow Agent may act in reliance upon any signature believed by it, acting
in good faith, to be genuine and may assume that any person that is designated
as an Authorized Person purporting to make any statement, execute any
document, or send any instruction in connection with the provisions hereof has
been duly authorized to do so. The Escrow Agent may consult with counsel
satisfactory to it (provided that such counsel is selected with reasonable
care), and the opinion or advice of such counsel shall be full and complete
authorization and protection in respect of any action taken, suffered or
omitted by it in good faith and in accordance with the opinion and advice of
such counsel in the absence of gross negligence, bad faith, fraud or willful
misconduct (as finally adjudicated by a court of competent jurisdiction). The
Escrow Agent may perform any and all of its duties through its agents,
representatives, attorneys, custodians and/or nominees. The Escrow Agent shall
not incur any liability for not performing any act or fulfilling any
obligation hereunder by reason of any occurrence beyond its reasonable control
(including, without limitation, any provision of any present or future law or
regulation or any act of any governmental authority, any act of God or war or
terrorism, or the unavailability of the Federal Reserve Bank wire services or
any electronic communication facility); provided that the Escrow Agent shall
use its best efforts to avoid and mitigate the adverse impacts of such
occurrence and remedy the same as promptly as possible to resume performance.

(c) Reliance on Orders. The Escrow Agent is authorized to comply with Final
Awards with respect to the Escrow Property, without determination by the
Escrow Agent of such court\'s jurisdiction in the matter. If any portion of
the Escrow Property is at any time attached, garnished or levied upon under
any Final Award, or in case the payment, 

assignment, transfer, conveyance or delivery of any such property shall be
stayed or enjoined by any Final Award, or in case any Final Award shall be
made or entered by any court affecting such property or any part thereof, then
and in any such event, the Escrow Agent is authorized to rely upon and comply
with any such Final Award which it is advised is binding upon it without the
need for appeal or other action; and if the Escrow Agent complies with any
such Final Award, it shall not be liable to any of the Interested Parties or
to any other person or entity by reason of such compliance even though such
Final Award may be subsequently reversed, modified, annulled, set aside or
vacated.

(d) Inspection. All funds or other property held as part of the Escrow
Property shall at all times be clearly identified as being held by the Escrow
Agent hereunder.

(e) Accounting. The Escrow Agent shall keep accurate and detailed records of
all investments, receipts, disbursements, and all other transactions with
respect to the Escrow Property. The Escrow Agent will send monthly statements
to Buyer and Sellers' Representative. Within fifteen (15) days following the
close of each month and within five (5) Business Days after the removal or
resignation of the Escrow Agent, the Escrow Agent shall deliver to Buyer and
Sellers' Representative a written account of its administration of the Escrow
Account during such month or during the period from the close of the last
preceding month to the date of such removal or resignation, setting forth all
receipts, disbursements and other transactions with respect to the Escrow
Property effected by it, and showing all cash, securities and other property
held in the Escrow Account within the terms hereof at the end of such month or
as of the date of such removal or resignation, as the case may be.

7. Compensation, Expense Reimbursement and Indemnification.

(a) Compensation. Each of the Interested Parties covenants and agrees to pay
one half of the Escrow Agent's compensation specified in Schedule A. Each of
the Interested Parties covenants and agrees to pay to the Escrow Agent one
half of all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses actually incurred by the Escrow
Agent in the performance of its role under this Agreement (including, but not
limited to, any reasonable attorney's fees incurred in connection with the
preparation and negotiation of this Agreement, which shall be due and payable
upon the execution of this Agreement).

(b) Security and Offset. The Interested Parties hereby grant to the Escrow
Agent a first lien upon, and right of offset against, the Escrow Property with
respect to any fees or expenses due to the Escrow Agent hereunder (including
any claim for indemnification hereunder). In the event that any fees or
expenses, or any other obligations owed to the Escrow Agent (or its counsel)
are not paid to the Escrow Agent within thirty (30) calendar days following
the presentment of an invoice for the payment of such fees and expenses or the
demand for such payment, then the Escrow Agent shall provide notice thereof to
Sellers' Representative and Buyer and if such invoice is not paid by the
Interested Parties within ten (10) days after receipt of such notice, the
Escrow Agent may, without further action or notice, pay such fees and expenses
from the Escrow Property and may sell, convey or otherwise dispose of any
Escrow Property for such purpose. 

(c) Indemnification. Each of the Interested Parties covenants and agrees,
jointly and severally, to indemnify the Escrow Agent and its employees,
officers, directors, affiliates, and agents (each, an "Indemnified Party")
for, hold each Indemnified Party harmless from, and defend each Indemnified
Party against, any and all claims, losses, actions, liabilities, costs,
damages and expenses of any nature incurred by any Indemnified Party, arising
out of or in connection with this Agreement or with the administration of its
duties hereunder, including, but not limited to, reasonable attorney's fees,
costs and expenses, except to the extent such loss, liability, damage, cost or
expense shall have been finally adjudicated by a court of competent
jurisdiction to have resulted from the Indemnified Party\'s own gross
negligence, fraud or willful misconduct. The foregoing indemnification and
agreement to hold harmless shall survive the termination of this Agreement and
the resignation or removal of the Escrow Agent. Although certain of the
Interested Parties' obligations pursuant to this Section 7(c) are joint and
several, the Interested Parties agree that as between the Interested Parties,
such obligations shall be apportioned pro-rata in accordance with their
relative obligation in accordance with the following sentence. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, the Interested Parties agree, solely as
between themselves, that any obligation for indemnification under this Section
7(c) (or for Indemnified Taxes or reasonable fees and expenses of the Escrow
Agent described in Section 8) shall be borne by the party or parties
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be responsible for causing
the loss, damage, liability, cost or expense against which the Escrow Agent is
entitled to indemnification or, if no such determination is made, then one-
half by Buyer and one-half by Sellers' Representative. This Section 7(c) shall
not apply to claims for indemnification in respect of taxes.

8. Dispute Resolution.

In the event of any disagreement among any of the Interested Parties to this
Agreement, or between any of them and any other person, resulting in adverse
claims or demands being made with respect to the subject matter of this
Agreement, or in the event that the Escrow Agent, in good faith, is in doubt
as to any action it should take hereunder, the Escrow Agent may, at its
option, refuse to comply with any claims or demands and refuse to take any
other action hereunder, so long as such disagreement continues or such doubt
exists, and in any such event, the Escrow Agent shall not be liable in any way
or to any person for its failure or refusal to act (except to the extent of
the Escrow Agent's gross negligence, fraud or willful misconduct), and the
Escrow Agent shall be entitled to continue to so refuse to act and refrain
from acting until the Escrow Agent shall have received (a) a Final Award or
(b) a written agreement executed by each of the Interested Parties involved in
such disagreement, in which case the Escrow Agent shall be authorized to
disburse the Escrow Property in accordance with such Final Award or fully
executed agreement. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to receive (from and at
the expense of the presenting party) an opinion of counsel to the effect that
any Final Award is final and not subject to appeal. The Escrow Agent shall
have the option, after thirty (30) calendar days' notice to the Interested
Parties of its intention to do so, to petition (by means of filing an action
in interpleader or any other appropriate method) any court of competent
jurisdiction, for instructions with respect to any dispute or uncertainty, and
to the extent required or permitted by law, pay into such court the Escrow
Property for holding and disposition in accordance with the instructions of
such court. The actual, out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable 

attorneys' fees and expenses) incurred by the Escrow Agent in connection with
such proceeding shall be paid by, and be the joint and several obligation of,
the Interested Parties.

9. Entire Agreement; Exclusive Benefit; Assignment.

This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement among the Interested Parties
and the Escrow Agent and sets forth in its entirety the obligations and duties
of the Escrow Agent with respect to the Escrow Property. As between Buyer and
Sellers' Representative, nothing in this Agreement shall override or amend any
provision of the Purchase Agreement and, to the extent there is a conflict
between the terms of this Agreement and the Purchase Agreement, the Purchase
Agreement shall control. This Agreement is for the exclusive benefit of the
parties to this Agreement and their respective permitted successors, and shall
not be deemed to give, either expressly or implicitly, any legal or equitable
right, remedy, or claim to any other entity or person whatsoever. No party may
assign any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior
written consent of the other parties (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, (i) the
Sellers' Representative may assign this Agreement and all of its rights and
obligations hereunder to any successor Sellers' Representative appointed in
accordance with Section 11.15(c) of the Purchase Agreement, provided, however,
that, such assignment shall be subject to completion by the Escrow Agent to
its satisfaction of its "Know Your Customer" review of such assignee and (ii)
the Buyer may transfer and assign its rights and obligations under this
Agreement without the prior written consent of the Sellers' Representative by
way of collateral assignment to any bank, financing institution or other
lender providing financing to Buyer now or in the future or to an affiliate of
Buyer or to any successor to Buyer by merger, consolidation or reorganization,
provided, that, such successor will own all or substantially all of the assets
of Buyer, provided, further, however, that, such assignment shall be subject
to (x) completion by the Escrow Agent to its satisfaction of its "Know Your
Customer" review of such assignee and (y) the Escrow Agent's satisfaction with
the indemnity provided by such assignee to the Escrow Agent.

removal to the Escrow Agent or within thirty (30) calendar days after

Interested Parties shall appoint a successor escrow agent and give notice of
such successor escrow agent to the Escrow Agent. If a successor escrow agent
has not accepted such appointment by the end of such thirty (30)-day period,
the Escrow Agent may either (i) safe keep the Escrow Property until a
successor escrow agent is appointed, without any obligation to invest the same
or continue to perform under this Agreement (other than the obligation to
retain and safeguard the Escrow Property), or (ii) apply to a court of
competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor escrow agent or for
other appropriate relief. 

(c) Upon receipt of notice of the identity of the successor escrow agent
signed by an Authorized Person of each of the Interested Parties, the Escrow
Agent shall either deliver the Escrow Property then held hereunder to the
successor escrow agent, less the Escrow Agent's fees, costs and expenses, or
hold such Escrow Property (or any portion thereof) pending distribution, until
all such fees, costs and expenses are paid to it. Upon delivery of the Escrow
Property to the successor escrow agent in accordance herewith, the Escrow
Agent shall have no further duties, responsibilities or obligations hereunder.

11. Security Procedure. 

In the event Escrow Fund transfer instructions are given by or on behalf of an
Interested Party, whether in writing, or otherwise, Escrow Agent shall seek
confirmation of such instructions by telephone call-back to the person or
persons designated on Schedule B or C hereto as applicable, and Escrow Agent
may rely upon the confirmation of anyone purporting to be the person or
persons so designated. The persons and telephone numbers for call-backs may be
changed only in a writing actually received and acknowledged by Escrow Agent.

Exhibit C



GUARANTY



THIS GUARANTY (this "Guaranty"), dated as of September 29, 2019 (the
"Effective Date"), is made by NEXTERA ENERGY PARTNERS, LP, a Delaware limited
partnership ("Guarantor"), in favor of EIF MEADE HOLDINGS, LLC, a Delaware
limited liability company ("EIF"), VED NPI II, LLC, a Delaware limited
liability company ("VED II"), COG HOLDINGS LLC, a Delaware limited liability
company ("COG"), WGL MIDSTREAM MP, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company
("WGLM"), and VED NPI I, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("VED I",
and together with EIF, VED II, COG and WGLM each a "Counterparty" and
collectively, the "Counterparties").

RECITALS:



A.WHEREAS, Counterparties and Guarantor's affiliate, Meade Pipeline
Investment, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("Obligor"),
concurrently with the execution hereof, are entering into that certain
Purchase and Sale Agreement, dated as of the Effective Date, by and among
Obligor and the Counterparties (the "Agreement"); and



| 
---|--- 

B.

|

WHEREAS, Guarantor will directly or indirectly benefit from the Agreement
between Obligor and Counterparties. 

 

NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises and as an inducement
for Counterparties' execution, delivery and performance of the Agreement, and
for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of
which is hereby acknowledged, Guarantor hereby agrees for the benefit of
Counterparties as follows: 1. GUARANTY. Subject to the terms and provisions hereof, Guarantor, as primary obligor and not merely as surety, hereby absolutely and irrevocably guarantees the timely payment when due of all obligations owing by Obligor to Counterparties arising pursuant to the Agreement on or after the Effective Date (the "Obligations"). This Guaranty shall constitute a guarantee of payment and not of collection. The liability of Guarantor under this Guaranty shall be subject to the following limitations:



(a) Notwithstanding anything herein or in the Agreement to the contrary, the
maximum aggregate obligation and liability of Guarantor under this Guaranty,
and the maximum recovery from Guarantor under this Guaranty, shall in no event
exceed ONE BILLION TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY MILLION

U.S. DOLLARS (U.S. $1,280,000,000) (the "Maximum Recovery Amount").



(b) The obligation and liability of Guarantor under this Guaranty is
specifically limited to payments expressly required to be made or otherwise
owed under the Agreement, as well as costs of collection and enforcement of
this Guaranty (including, without limitation, attorney's fees) to the extent
reasonably and actually incurred by the Counterparties. In no event, however,
shall Guarantor be liable for or obligated to pay any Non-Reimbursable Damages
(as defined in the Agreement) unless and except to the extent that such
damages are required to be paid by Obligor to a Counterparty pursuant to the
Agreement.



2\. DEMANDS AND PAYMENT.



| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

If Obligor fails to pay any Obligation to Counterparties when such Obligation
is due and owing under the Agreement (an "Overdue Obligation"), Counterparties
may present a written demand to Guarantor calling for Guarantor's payment of
such Overdue Obligation pursuant to this Guaranty (a "Payment Demand"). 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

Guarantor's obligation hereunder to pay any particular Overdue Obligation(s)
to Counterparties is conditioned upon Guarantor's receipt of a Payment Demand
from Counterparties satisfying the following requirements: (i) such Payment
Demand must identify the specific Overdue Obligation(s) covered by such
demand, the specific date(s) upon which such Overdue Obligation(s) became due
and owing under the Agreement, and the specific provision(s) of the Agreement
pursuant to which such Overdue Obligation(s) became due and owing; (ii) such
Payment Demand must be delivered to Guarantor in accordance with Section 9
below; and (iii) the specific Overdue Obligation(s) addressed by such Payment
Demand must remain due and unpaid at the time of such delivery to Guarantor. 

 

| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

After issuing a Payment Demand in accordance with the requirements specified
in Section 2(b) above, Counterparties shall not be required to issue any
further notices or make any further demands with respect to the Overdue
Obligation(s) specified in that Payment Demand, and Guarantor shall be
required to make payment with respect to the Overdue Obligation(s) specified
in that Payment Demand within five (5) Business Days after Guarantor receives
such demand. As used herein, the term "Business Day" shall mean all weekdays
(i.e., Monday through Friday) other than any weekdays during which commercial
banks or financial institutions are authorized to be closed to the public in
the State of Florida or the State of New York. 

 

| 
---|--- 

(d)

|

All payments made hereunder shall be made in U.S. Dollars and be made free,
without set-off, and clear of, and without deduction for or on account of any
present or future stamp or other taxes, levies, imposts, duties, charges,
fees, deductions or withholdings of any nature now or hereafter applicable by
payment to the account of a Counterparty or as such Counterparty may direct.
All amounts due under this Guaranty shall bear interest from the date that
such amount first became due and payable under the terms of this Guaranty
until the date that it is paid at a rate equal to LIBOR plus two percent (2%). 

 

3. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. Guarantor represents and warrants that:



| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

it is a limited partnership duly organized and validly existing under the laws
of the State of Delaware and has the requisite limited partnership power and
authority to execute, deliver and carry out the terms and provisions of the
Guaranty; 

 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

no authorization, approval, consent or order of, or registration or filing
with, any court or other governmental body having jurisdiction over Guarantor
is required on the part of Guarantor for the execution and delivery of this
Guaranty; and 

 

| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

this Guaranty constitutes a valid and legally binding agreement of Guarantor,
enforceable against Guarantor in accordance with the terms hereof, except as
the enforceability thereof may be limited by the effect of any applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting
creditors\' rights generally and by general principles of equity. 

 

4. RESERVATION OF CERTAIN DEFENSES. Without limiting Guarantor's own defenses and rights hereunder, Guarantor reserves to itself all rights, setoffs, counterclaims and other defenses to which Obligor is or may be entitled arising from or out of the Agreement, except for defenses (if any) based upon the bankruptcy, insolvency, dissolution or liquidation of Obligor or any lack of power or authority of Obligor to enter into and/or perform the Agreement.



5. AMENDMENT OF GUARANTY. No term or provision of this Guaranty shall be amended, modified, altered, waived or supplemented except in a writing signed by Guarantor and Counterparties. 

6\. WAIVERS AND CONSENTS. Subject to and in accordance with the terms and
provisions of this Guaranty:



| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

Except as required in Section 2 above, Guarantor hereby waives (i) notice of
acceptance of this Guaranty; (ii) presentment and demand concerning the
liabilities of Guarantor; (iii) any right to require that any action or
proceeding be brought against Obligor or any other person, or to require that
Counterparties seek enforcement of any performance against Obligor or any
other person, prior to any action against Guarantor under the terms hereof; or
(iv) any requirement that Counterparties protect, secure or perfect any
security interest. 

 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

No delay by Counterparties in the exercise of (or failure by Counterparties to
exercise) any rights hereunder or under the Agreement shall operate as a
waiver of such rights, a waiver of any other rights or a release of Guarantor
from its obligations hereunder (with the understanding, however, that the
foregoing shall not be deemed to constitute a waiver by Guarantor of any
rights or defenses which Guarantor may at any time have pursuant to or in
connection with any applicable statutes of limitation). No waiver of any
single breach or default under this Guaranty shall be deemed a waiver of any
other breach or default. 

 

| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

Without notice to or the consent of Guarantor, and without impairing or
releasing Guarantor's obligations under this Guaranty, Counterparties may: (i)
change the manner, time, place or terms for payment of all or any of the
Obligations (including, without limitation, renewals, extensions or other
alterations of the Obligations); (ii) release any person (other than Obligor
or Guarantor) from liability for payment of all or any of the Obligations;
(iii) amend or modify the Agreement; or (iv) receive, substitute, surrender,
exchange or release any collateral or other security for any or all of the
Obligations. 

 

| 
---|--- 

(d)

|

Guarantor hereby irrevocably and absolutely waives any and all right of
subrogation, contribution, indemnification, reimbursement or similar rights
against Obligor with respect to this Guaranty, whether such rights arise under
an express or implied contract or by operation of law, it being the intention
of Guarantor and the Counterparties that Guarantor shall not be deemed to be a
"creditor" (as defined in Section 101 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or any other
applicable law) of Obligor by reason of the existence of this Guaranty in the
event that Obligor becomes a debtor in any proceeding under the U.S.
Bankruptcy Code or any other applicable law. In addition, Guarantor shall not
exercise any rights which it may acquire by way of subrogation under this
Guaranty by any payment made hereunder or otherwise, until all of the
liabilities of Obligor to Counterparties under the Agreement have been paid in
full. If any amount shall be paid to Guarantor on account of such subrogation
rights at any time when all such liabilities and obligations have not been
indefeasible paid in full, such amount shall be held in trust for the benefit
of the Counterparties and shall forthwith be paid to the Counterparties and
applied to such liabilities and obligations, whether matured or unmatured. 

 

7. REINSTATEMENT. Guarantor agrees that this Guaranty shall continue to be effective or shall be reinstated, as the case may be, if all or any part of any payment made hereunder is at any time avoided or rescinded or must otherwise be restored or repaid by Counterparties as a result of the bankruptcy or insolvency of Obligor, all as though such payments had not been made.



8. TERMINATION. Subject to Section 7 above, this Guaranty and the Guarantor's obligations hereunder will terminate automatically and immediately upon the earlier of (i) the termination of the Agreement, unless the Agreement is terminated as a result of Obligor's intentional and material breach of the Agreement, or (ii) immediately after the Closing (as such term is defined in the Agreement); provided, 

however, that no such termination shall affect Guarantor\'s liability with
respect to any Obligation incurred prior to the time the termination is
effective, which Obligation shall remain subject to this Guaranty.



9. NOTICE. Any Payment Demand, notice, request, instruction, correspondence or other document to be given hereunder (herein collectively called "Notice") by Counterparties to Guarantor, or by Guarantor to Counterparties, as applicable, shall be in writing and may be delivered either by (i) U.S. certified mail with postage prepaid and return receipt requested, or (ii) recognized nationwide courier service with delivery receipt requested, in either case to be delivered to the following address (or to such other U.S. address as may be specified via Notice provided by Guarantor or Counterparties, as applicable, to the other in accordance with the requirements of this Section 9):

III. EXCLUSIONS



No Insurer shall be liable to make any payment for that portion of Loss:



| 
---|--- 

A.

|

proximately related to the substantive content of a material inaccuracy in a
No Claims Declaration (but only to the extent the Insurers are actually
prejudiced by such material inaccuracy, with for the avoidance of doubt the
Insurers bearing the burden of proving such prejudice); 

 

| 
---|--- 

B.

|

arising out of or resulting from any (x) Breach of which any of the Deal Team
Members had Actual Knowledge prior to Inception or (y) Interim Breach; 

 

|

any Subsidiary of the Acquired Companies, or any Seller is unfunded or
underfunded; 

 

| 
---|--- 

E.

|

arising out of or resulting from any environmental spills or environmental
contamination, other than any Covered Environmental Claims; 

 

| 
---|---

| 
---|---

to the extent actually taken into account pursuant to the Purchase Price
Adjustment Provision (with the intent of this exclusion merely to be to avoid
"double counting" and not to limit any right to recover for Loss that arises
out of or results from any Breach in excess of the amount of such Loss taken
into account under the Purchase Price Adjustment Provision). 

 

Subject to all of the other terms and conditions of this Policy, if only part
of a Loss is excluded under this Section III, the Insurer shall remain liable
for that part of the total Loss that is not so excluded.



IV. LIABILITY UNDER THIS POLICY; RETENTION; CALCULATION OF LOSS



A. Liability under this Policy. 





(i) The Limit of Liability set forth in Item 3 of the Declarations is the
maximum aggregate liability of the Insurers under this Policy. Defense Costs
and Prosecution Costs are part of, and not in addition to, the Limit of
Liability. Loss incurred within the Retention shall not erode the Limit of
Liability.



(ii) The liability of each Insurer is several and not joint with any other
Insurer. The obligations of each Insurer are limited to the extent of its
Quota Share Percentage of Loss up to its Quota Share Limit of Liability set
forth in Item 8 of the Declarations. No Insurer shall be liable for the Quota
Share Percentage of Loss of any other Insurer or otherwise responsible for the
liability of any other Insurer, including as a result of the receivership,
insolvency, liquidation, rehabilitation, bankruptcy, inability, refusal or
failure for any other reason of any other Insurer to pay any Loss.



B. Retention.



| 
---|--- 

(i)

|

The Insurers shall only be liable for Loss (or the aggregate of all individual
Losses) covered hereunder in excess of the Retention set forth in Item 4 of
the Declarations. Such Retention is an aggregate one and shall only be eroded
by Loss (or the aggregate of all individual Losses) for which the Insurers
would be liable under this Policy but for the Retention ("Retained Losses"). 

 

| 
---|--- 

(ii)

|

If on or prior to the Retention Dropdown Date the Underwriting Representative
has been notified by the Named Insured pursuant to this Policy of, or any
Specified Person has Actual Knowledge of, any (a) Breach or matter under
active investigation by any Specified Person that would reasonably be expected
to give rise to a Breach, (b) Third Party Claim and/or (c) Loss, then the
Retention shall not be reduced pursuant to the second paragraph of Item 4 of
the Declarations solely with respect to any such Loss or any Loss that arises
out of, relates to or results from such Breach, matter or Third Party Claim. 

 

| 
---|--- 

(iii)

|

Any Retained Losses recovered by the Insureds from the Seller pursuant to the
Acquisition Agreement for amounts up to and including the amount of the
Retention shall erode the Retention and shall not reduce the amount of Loss in
excess of the Retention or be subject to reimbursement for purposes of this
Policy. 

 

| 
---|--- 

(iv)

|

Loss (or the aggregate of all individual Losses) shall erode the Retention
and/or be recoverable as Loss under this Policy, as applicable, prior to and
not conditioned upon obtaining recovery from or taking any action against the
Seller with respect to any Loss. 

 

| 
---|---

Recovered Amounts. Loss shall be reduced by any Recovered Amounts. For the
avoidance of doubt, to the extent any Recovered Amount is received or realized
after payment by the Insurer hereunder, such Recovered Amount shall be applied
in the following order: first, to reimburse the Insureds for any Loss borne by
them in excess of the Limit of Liability; second, to reduce any Loss incurred
by the Insureds which is covered by this Policy; and third, to reimburse the
Insureds in respect of any Retained Loss. 

 

V. REPORTING 

A. The Named Insured shall deliver a notice (a "Claim Notice") to the
Underwriting Representative as soon as reasonably practicable after any
Specified Person acquires Actual Knowledge of any Breach, Third Party Claim or
Loss, or any matter under investigation by any Specified Person that would
reasonably be expected to give rise to a Breach, Third Party Claim or Loss.
The Claim Notice shall reference this Policy and shall include, in reasonable
detail (in light of the information then reasonably available) and to the
extent a Specified Person has Actual Knowledge, a description of the facts,
matters or circumstances leading up to the delivery of the Claim Notice,
including a specific reference to the implicated representations and/or
warranties at issue. The Insureds shall have the right to amend and supplement
the Claim Notice, including when additional facts and information become
available, pursuant to the other terms and conditions of this Section V.



B. The information provided in or pursuant to any Claim Notice shall be
provided solely for the purpose of making a claim under this Policy. In
disclosing such information, the Insureds expressly do not waive any attorney-
client privilege associated with such information or any protection afforded
by the work-product doctrine or other privilege with respect to any of the
matters disclosed or discussed therein. No information contained in any Claim
Notice shall be deemed to be an admission by any Insured to any third party of
any matter whatsoever (including any violation of law or breach of contract).



C. In no event may a Claim Notice be delivered to the Underwriting
Representative later than 45 days after the Policy Term. If a Claim Notice is
provided to the Underwriting Representative during the Policy Term or the
45-day period immediately following the Policy Term, then any subsequent Loss
arising out of or resulting from the Breach, Third Party Claim, Loss, or
matter under investigation by any Specified Person that would reasonably be
expected to give rise to a Breach, Third Party Claim or Loss identified in the
Claim Notice shall be deemed reported at the time such Claim Notice was
received by the Underwriting Representative.



D. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Underwriting Representative
receives a Claim Notice (and in any event within 60 days of receipt), the
Underwriting Representative shall respond with the coverage position of the
Insurers (including reasons if the Insurers dispute coverage for the claimed
Loss or dispute that the claimed Loss erodes the Retention). If the
Underwriting Representative is not in a position to determine the coverage
position based on the information provided in the Claim Notice, then the
Underwriting Representative's response shall state why it is unable to do so
and request such additional information as it may reasonably require from the
Insureds in order to make a coverage determination, and following receipt of
which the 60 day time limitation set forth in this Section V.D shall apply.
The Underwriting Representative shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
respond to any Claim Notice in a manner which provides the Insureds sufficient
time to satisfy any litigation deadlines or similar deadlines of which the
Underwriting Representative is made aware that relate to the subject matter of
the Claim Notice. 

E. The Insureds shall not be required to notify the Insurers directly of any
Claim or any matters pertaining to any Claim so long as the Insureds have
delivered to the Underwriting Representative a Claim Notice with respect to
such Claim. No Insurer shall be released from its obligations under the Policy
based upon its failure to receive notice of the Underwriting Representative's
receipt of a Claim Notice.



VI. CORRESPONDENCE; COOPERATION; MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS



| 
---|--- 

A.

|

Correspondence. The Insureds shall, at the written request of the Underwriting
Representative and to the extent reasonably practicable, provide to the
Underwriting Representative copies of any formal and written correspondence,
pleadings or other material documents relating to such Claim Notice that are
delivered or filed by or on behalf of the Insureds, their representatives or
any other or entity, in each case, to the extent in the Insureds' possession
or reasonably available to the Insureds. 

 

| 
---|--- 

B.

|

Cooperation. The Insureds shall use commercially reasonable efforts, at the
Insurers' sole cost, to provide the Underwriting Representative with any
information, assistance and cooperation reasonably requested in writing by the
Underwriting Representative in connection with a Claim Notice or other matter
relating to this Policy. Such cooperation shall include, at the Insurers' sole
cost (which shall not reduce the Limit of Liability hereunder) and to the
extent reasonably practicable: 

 

| 
---|--- 

(i)

|

permitting the Underwriting Representative and its representatives to examine,
photocopy and take extracts from the books, data, files, records and
information of the Insureds to the extent reasonably related to any Claim
Notice and only during normal business hours, at reasonable locations, in a
manner that is not disruptive to the business of the Insureds and upon
reasonable prior written notice to the Insureds; and 

 

| 
---|--- 

(ii)

|

access to the Insureds' representatives for interviews and depositions during
normal business hours, at reasonable locations, in a manner that is not
disruptive to the business of the Insureds' representatives, and only upon
reasonable advance notice to the Insureds. 

 

The provision of such information shall be subject to existing confidentiality
agreements by and between the Insureds and the Underwriting Representative.



C. Maintenance of Records. Until the later of 45 days after the expiration of
the Policy Term or the final resolution of all claims or disputes relating to
this Policy, the Insureds shall, to the extent within their control and in
accordance with their respective record retention policies, use commercially
reasonable efforts to maintain any documentation in their possession relating
to the negotiation of the Acquisition Agreement and due diligence conducted in
connection with the transactions contemplated thereby; provided that the
Insureds may destroy documents in the ordinary course of the Insureds'
business consistent with any past practices and their document retention
guidelines so long as such destruction is not done with the intent to harm the
Insurers. 

D. Privilege; Fifth Amendment Protection. With respect to any documents or
information referenced in this Section VI that are protected by attorney-
client privilege, work product doctrine or other privileges, the Insurers
shall cooperate in good faith with the Insureds and use commercially
reasonable efforts to preserve the privileged status of any such document or
information (including by entering into a joint defense or similar agreement
acceptable to the Underwriting Representative and the Named Insured). Nothing
in this Policy shall be construed to require the waiver of any Fifth Amendment
or similar protection or require the Insureds to take any action that would
result in the loss of the protections of the attorney- client privilege, work-
product doctrine or any similar privileges or protections.



VII. DEFENSE; SETTLEMENT; PAYMENT OF LOSS



| 
---|--- 

A.

|

Third Party Claim and Claims Participation. The Underwriting Representative
and the Insurers do not assume any duty to defend the Insureds with respect to
any Third Party Claim. The Insureds shall defend and contest any Third Party
Claim with counsel consented to by the Underwriting Representative in writing
(such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed);
provided that such consent shall not be required for any representation of the
Insureds by Locke Lord LLP or Morgan, Lewis and Bockius LLP. With respect to any
Third Party Claim, the Insureds shall not knowingly take any action or omit to
take any action that, at the time of such action or omission, would reasonably
be expected to actually prejudice the Insurers' position or its potential or
actual rights of recovery. The Underwriting Representative shall have the
right, at its sole cost and expense (which shall not reduce the Limit of
Liability hereunder), to effectively associate in the investigation, defense
and settlement of any Third Party Claim or other matter reasonably likely to
be covered under this Policy; provided that, subject to the consent rights
expressly given to the Insurers in this Section VII.A and Section VII.B of
this Policy, the Insureds shall control all decisions with respect to the
investigation, defense, prosecution, negotiation and settlement of any Third
Party Claim. 

 

| 
---|--- 

B.

|

Settlements and Judgments. With respect to any settlements of or stipulated
judgments in a Third Party Claim, only Loss (other than Defense Costs or
Prosecution Costs) resulting from settlements or stipulated judgments
consented to by the Underwriting Representative in writing (such consent not
to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) or resulting from a final
judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction or arbitral panel shall erode
the Retention or be recoverable as Loss; provided that with respect to any
settlement or stipulated judgment that is solely within the Retention, the
consent of the Underwriting Representative shall not be required until (x) the
amount of such settlement or stipulated judgment, (y) the aggregate amount of
any Losses reasonably anticipated in respect of any pending claims, and (z)
any paid or incurred Defense Costs and Prosecution Costs relating to such
settlement or stipulated judgment exceed 40% of the then-remaining Retention;
and provided further the Insurer shall not use as the sole basis for denying
its consent to such settlement or stipulated judgment the granting by the
Insureds of an irrevocable and unconditional full and complete waiver and
release to any person. 

 

| 
---|--- 

C.

|

Defense Costs and Prosecution Costs. With respect to Defense Costs and
Prosecution Costs covered hereunder, the Insurers shall reimburse the Insureds
on a quarterly basis following the Underwriting Representative's receipt of an
invoice for such Defense Costs or Prosecution Costs. The Insureds shall
provide such information as reasonably requested by the 

Underwriting Representative to determine the applicability of coverage of such
Defense Costs or Prosecution Costs under this Policy in accordance with the
time limitation set forth in Section V.D., provided that once the Insureds
have provided reasonable support for their Defense Costs or Prosecution Costs,
the burden shall be on the Underwriting Representative to demonstrate that
such costs are not covered hereunder. The Underwriting Representative and the
Insurers agree that Locke Lord LLP or Morgan, Lewis and Bockius LLP may
represent the Insureds in matters related to this Policy and acknowledge that
the then prevailing hourly billing rates of Locke Lord LLP and Morgan, Lewis and
Bockius LLP to the Insureds are deemed reasonable.



D. Payment of Loss. Payment of any covered Loss by the Insurers shall be made
to the Named Insured as representative of all of the Insureds or to such
person or entity as the Named Insured instructs the Underwriting
Representative pursuant to Section IX of this Policy.



E. Territory. This Policy extends to Breaches and Losses taking place or being
incurred, as applicable, anywhere in the world.



VIII. MITIGATION; SUBROGATION; REIMBURSEMENT; OTHER INSURANCE



A. Mitigation.



| 
---|--- 

(i)

|

To the extent required by applicable law, the Insureds shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to mitigate any Loss or potential Loss after any Specified
Person has Actual Knowledge of any matter that would reasonably be expected to
give rise to any Loss; provided that the failure of any Insured to so mitigate
shall only reduce the rights of the Insureds to recover for Loss under this
Policy to the extent of the Loss that would have been avoided by such
mitigation, and the burden of proving such amount shall be on the Insurers and
shall not otherwise diminish or delay coverage or payment hereunder. If the
Insurers believe the Insureds should take any additional actions in order to
comply with their obligations pursuant to this paragraph, they shall request
such actions promptly in writing. 

 

| 
---|--- 

(ii)

|

In connection with the determination of the Final Purchase Price, the Insureds
shall use good faith efforts to take into account, and to recover any amounts
in respect of, Loss in accordance with the Purchase Price Adjustment
Provision. 

 

| 
---|--- 

(iii)

|

Notwithstanding Section VIII.A(i), the Insureds shall not be obligated to
pursue any rights of recovery against any third party with respect to which
any Insured has a business relationship (each such third party a "Commercial
Counterparty") until the aggregate amount of all such Losses for which
recovery against such Commercial Counterparty is sought exceeds $500,000. If
both (i) Losses related to any Insureds' rights of recovery against any
Commercial Counterparty exceed $500,000 and (ii) the Underwriting
Representative requests in writing actions against such Commercial
Counterparty, then the Underwriting Representative shall discuss in good faith
with the Insureds any potential adverse impact that such action may have on
any Insured and such impact shall be considered in determining whether the
Underwriting Representative shall require that the Insureds pursue such
action. 

 

B. Subrogation. 



(i) The Insureds shall use commercially reasonable efforts to preserve (a) any
indemnification or other rights against any other person or entity with
respect to any Loss, which rights would offset the Insurers' obligations
hereunder, and (b) the Insurers' subrogation rights with respect thereto.



(ii) In the event of any payment of Loss under this Policy, the Underwriting
Representative (on behalf of the Insurers) shall be subrogated to the extent
of such payment to, and the Insureds shall assign to the Underwriting
Representative, all of the Insureds' rights of recovery with respect to such
Loss; provided that the Underwriting Representative and the Insurers hereby
waive and release any right of subrogation and shall not be entitled to
subrogate against (x) any Insured or any, direct or indirect, parent,
Subsidiary, affiliate, shareholder, member, director, officer, employee or
partner (or the functional equivalent of any such position) of any of the
foregoing (except if associated with the acquired business prior to Closing
(but without limiting clause (y)), (y) the Acquired Companies or the acquired
business and (z) each of the Sellers pursuant to rights under the Acquisition
Agreement except in cases of Fraud. At the sole cost and expense of the
Insurers (which shall not reduce the Limit of Liability hereunder) and to the
extent consistent with the subrogation permitted hereunder, the Insureds shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to execute all papers reasonably required
and take all steps reasonably requested by the Insurer to secure and further
such subrogation. In no event shall the Insureds knowingly and intentionally
waive any rights in a manner that would reasonably be expected to actually
prejudice any such subrogation or assignment right.



(iii) With respect to subrogation claims against customers, clients or
suppliers of any person or entity described in clauses (x) - (z) of Section
VIII.B(ii) above, the Insurers shall not be entitled to subrogate without the
prior written consent of the Named Insured (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) until the aggregate amount of
all such Losses for which recovery would be available against any such
customer, client or supplier exceeds $500,000 (the "Subrogation Threshold").
After such Losses exceed the Subrogation Threshold, the Insurers may subrogate
against such customers, clients and suppliers without the consent of the Named
Insured, and the Insurers shall only be required to provide advance written
notice to the Named Insured of their intent to institute such subrogation
claim. Upon the request of the Named Insured, the Insurer shall provide
reasonable updates with respect to the status of and circumstances relating to
such claim.



(iv) The Insurers shall bear all costs incurred in connection with any
subrogation or assignment efforts or actions taken by or on behalf of the
Insurers or the Underwriting Representative (including any defense costs or
liability of the Insured related to any counterclaim or third party demand
asserted in connection with any such subrogation or assignment efforts to the
extent arising out of, resulting from or related to the same or similar facts,
circumstances, matters or allegations out of which such subrogation or
assignment efforts arose) and shall promptly reimburse the Insureds for any
reasonable costs and expenses incurred in connection with any subrogation or
assignment efforts in connection with Section VIII.B of this Policy, which
shall not reduce the Limit of Liability hereunder. 

(v) Any amounts recovered by the Insurers or Underwriting Representative
through subrogation or assignment of rights or recoupment hereunder shall be
applied in the following order: (a) first, to reimburse the Underwriting
Representative, the Insurers and the Insureds for any reasonable costs and
expenses incurred in connection with such recovery (allocated pro rata based
on the total amount of such costs and expenses incurred by the Underwriting
Representative, the Insurers and the Insureds); (b) second, to reimburse the
Insureds for any Loss borne in excess of the Limit of Liability (only to the
extent of such excess); (c) third, to reimburse the Insurers in respect of any
Loss paid under this Policy and for which subrogation rights were assigned
hereunder; and (d) fourth, to reimburse the Insureds in respect of any Loss
which the Insureds have retained by reason of the Retention. Any amounts
recovered by the Insurers pursuant to clause (c) shall serve to replenish the
Limit of Liability.



C. Reimbursement. Until the later of (x) the one year anniversary of the
Expiration Date and (y) the final resolution of all claims or disputes
relating to this Policy:



(i) The Insureds shall reimburse the Underwriting Representative (on behalf of
the Insurers) for any amount paid by the Insurers under this Policy if it is
determined pursuant to the procedures set forth in Section XI of this Policy
that such paid amount did not constitute Loss covered hereunder.



(ii) If any Recovered Amounts are actually received or realized by the
Insureds after the Insurers have made a payment to the Insureds with respect
to Loss covered hereunder, the Insureds shall:



(a) notify the Underwriting Representative in writing within 60 days of such
recovery; and



(b) to the extent such Recovered Amounts would reduce any Loss incurred by the
Insureds which is covered by this Policy pursuant to the second clause of
Section IV.C, reimburse the Underwriting Representative (on behalf of the
Insurers) to the extent of such amount.



Any reimbursement under this Section VIII.C. shall be made within 60 days
after such determination or recovery. Without duplication of any amounts taken
into account in the definition of Recovered Amounts, the amount of such
reimbursement shall be net of any increase in premiums and reasonable costs
and expenses incurred by the Insureds in connection with obtaining any such
amount. The Limit of Liability shall be reinstated immediately by an amount
equal to any such reimbursement received or otherwise recovered by the
Insurers or the Underwriting Representative pursuant to this Section VIII.C.



D. Other Insurance.



(i) The coverage provided under this Policy shall be excess to any other valid
and collectible insurance coverage. The Named Insured shall (i) at the
Underwriting Representative's reasonable request, discuss with the
Underwriting Representative whether any preexisting bond, indemnity or other
insurance policy is applicable or available with respect to the matters
described in any Claim Notice and (ii) if any such bond, indemnity 

or other insurance policy is applicable and available, utilize good faith
efforts to collect thereunder; provided that any dispute as to the
applicability of, or delay in obtaining, such coverage shall not be a basis
for delay or refusal of payment hereunder; provided further, that it is
understood that the foregoing shall not limit the Insurers' rights of
subrogation against other insurance policies, other sources or recovery or the
Seller to the extent provided for in Section VIII of this Policy. The Insureds
shall not be obligated to first pursue claims for any Breach or Loss against
any other insurance policy or any other source of recovery referred to in this
Section VIII.D prior to being eligible for any payment under this Policy and
if there is a dispute as to whether the coverage under this Policy shall be
excess of other coverage or if other coverage shall be excess of the coverage
under this Policy, the Insureds shall be entitled to recover under this Policy
and the Insurers shall be subrogated to the extent provided in Section VIII of
this Policy to the Insureds' rights to such other coverage. For the avoidance
of doubt, to the extent any deductible borne or paid by the Insureds under any
other insurance policy would constitute Loss under this Policy, such
deductible borne or paid shall apply to erode the Retention, subject to the
terms and conditions of this Policy.



(ii) Section VIII(D)(i) of this Policy shall not apply with respect to the
Environmental Policy. It is understood and agreed that the coverage provided
under this Policy for Covered Environmental Claims shall be specifically
excess of coverage provided under the Environmental Policy. No coverage will
be available under this Policy for Covered Environmental Claims (and the
Retention shall not be eroded hereunder) unless and until the following
conditions have been met: (a) the retention of the Environmental Policy has
been fully eroded pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Environmental
Policy and (b) the limit of liability of the Environmental Policy shall have
been completely exhausted through the payment of Loss by the insurer
thereunder or by or on behalf of the Insured, or by any other source. If the
Environmental Policy has (i) ceased to be in full force and effect due to any
act or omission of any Insured (including any failure to renew such policy,
unless replaced with a policy in accordance with the definition of
Environmental Policy) or (ii) been modified or amended in a manner that does
not satisfy clause (ii) of the definition of Environmental Policy, in each
case, such that the Insurers are adversely affected thereby with respect to
Covered Environmental Claims, then this Policy shall continue to cover Covered
Environmental Claims, but the Insureds, or an insurer providing replacement
coverage (if such replacement coverage is obtained), shall be liable for the
amount of the underlying limits of liability and retentions of such ceased,
modified or amended (as applicable) Environmental Policy, and the Insurers
shall be liable for Covered Environmental Claims only to the extent that it
would have been liable had the Environmental Policy not ceased or been
modified or amended.

X. AUTHORIZATION



A. Authorization of Named Insured. By accepting this Policy, the Named Insured
acknowledges and agrees that the Underwriting Representative and the Insurers
shall be entitled to rely exclusively upon any written notice given by the
Named Insured and that the Underwriting Representative and the Insurers shall
not be liable in any manner for any action taken or not taken in reliance upon
any notice given by the Named Insured.



B. Authorization of Underwriting Representative. The Underwriting
Representative is authorized to act on behalf of the Insurers with respect to
all matters relating to this Policy, including the negotiation and acceptance
of any terms and conditions of this Policy (including any Endorsements
hereunder), the giving and receipt of any notices and consents to or from the

The Insureds may rely on communications made by the Underwriting
Representative as the authorized representative for all Insurers for any claim
reported under this Policy. Notwithstanding the foregoing in this Section X.B,
and for the avoidance of doubt, all duties and obligations of the Insureds in
this Policy are owed to the Insurers and the Insurers shall derive all rights
under this Policy including, without limitation, those related to such duties
and obligations and under Section VIII of this Policy. An Insurer may revoke
the authorization set forth in this Section X.B only with written notice to
the Named Insured. 

C. The Underwriting Representative is not an Insurer and shall not be liable
for any Loss or claim whatsoever.



XI. GOVERNING LAW; ARBITRATION



A. Choice of Law. Except to the extent the law of any Most Favorable
Jurisdiction other than the State of New York may apply to coverage for that
portion of any Loss that constitutes punitive or exemplary damages, fines or
penalties, the construction, validity and performance of this Policy shall be
interpreted under the laws of the State of New York, without reference to
conflict-of-law and choice-of-law principles that would require or allow the
application of the law of any other jurisdiction. For the purposes of this
Policy, the Acquisition Agreement shall be interpreted under the laws of the
jurisdiction chosen therein, and where no jurisdiction is chosen, the
Acquisition Agreement shall be interpreted by the laws of the State of New
York, without reference to conflict-of-law principles that would require or
allow the application of the law of any other jurisdiction.



B. Dispute Resolution. All disputes or disagreements with respect to this
Policy (including with regard to whether this Policy is void or voidable),
whether arising before or after the termination of this Policy, and whether
arising in connection with this Policy or the interpretation thereof shall be
submitted to arbitration in accordance with Section XI.C of this Policy. 

C. Arbitration. In the event arbitration is elected, such arbitration shall be
submitted before a panel of three arbitrators consisting of two party
nominated arbitrators and a third arbitrator (hereinafter "umpire") as the
sole and exclusive remedy in accordance with the procedures set forth in this
Section XI.C. The party desiring arbitration of a dispute shall serve on the
other party a demand for arbitration, which demand shall include the name,
address and occupation of the arbitrator nominated by the demanding party. The
other party shall, within 30 days following receipt of the demand, notify in
writing the demanding party of the name, address and occupation of the
arbitrator nominated by it. The two arbitrators so selected shall, within 30
days of the appointment of the second arbitrator, select an umpire. If the
arbitrators are unable to agree upon an umpire, the selection of the umpire
shall be made by the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services ("JAMS") in
accordance with Rule 15 (as may be amended from time to time) of the JAMS
Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures for the selection of a
tripartite panel. Except as otherwise provided herein, the arbitration shall
be conducted pursuant to the American Arbitration Association's ("AAA")
Commercial Arbitration Rules and Mediation Procedures, but the arbitration
shall be administered by JAMS and not by the AAA. The decision of at least two
of the three panel members shall be binding and final and not subject to
appeal except that neither party waives its rights to seek vacatur of the
award pursuant to any applicable state or federal statute. The party whose
proposed settlement offer amount is awarded by the arbitrators shall be
considered the "prevailing party" under the arbitration. The fees and expenses
of the arbitration panel shall be allocated to the Insureds and the Insurers
as determined by the arbitration panel based upon the relative success (in
terms of percentages) of each party's claims. For example, if the final
determination reflects a 60-40 compromise of the parties' claims, the
arbitration panel would allocate expenses 40% to the party whose claims were
determined to be 60% successful and 60% to the party whose claims were
determined to be 40% successful. A judgment may be entered on the award by any
court of competent jurisdiction and the parties hereby consent to the
jurisdiction of any state or federal court in the county of New York, state of
New York and irrevocably waive any challenge to the jurisdiction or
appropriateness of the venue of such a court including any challenge based on
convenience of the forum.



D. Cap on Fees and Costs of Counsel, Expert Witnesses and Any Arbitration
Panel. In any arbitration arising out of or related to this Policy, the
arbitration panel shall award to the prevailing party, if any, the costs and
attorneys' fees reasonably incurred by the prevailing party in connection with
the arbitration and the enforcement of its rights under this Policy. If the
arbitration panel determines a party to be the prevailing party under
circumstances where the prevailing party won on some but not all of the claims
and counterclaims, the arbitration panel may award the prevailing party an
appropriate percentage of the costs and attorneys' fees and expenses
reasonably incurred by the prevailing party in connection with the arbitration
and the enforcement of its rights under this Policy. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Section XI(D), in no event shall either party be
required to pay any fees and expenses pursuant to this Section XI(D) in excess
of the lesser of (a) $1,000,000 and (b) an amount equal to the remaining Limit
of Liability as of the date of such arbitral determination less the amount of
any Loss that the Insureds have alleged in any pending claims are payable by
the Insurers pursuant to any claims that are outstanding and have not been
fully resolved as of such date (including the claim that was the subject of
such arbitration).



E. Other Dispute Resolution Rules. The Named Insured or its assign shall act
on behalf of each and every Insured under this Section XI.

right of a Loss Payee to receive any such proceeds payable under this Policy,
no Loss Payee shall have any rights or obligations under this Policy or be
deemed to be an Insured under this Policy, and the Underwriting Representative
and the Insurers shall owe no duties to any such Loss Payee in connection with
this Policy. 

 

| 
---|--- 

G.

|

Benefit. This Policy shall inure only to the benefit of the Underwriting
Representative, Insurers and Insureds and the respective successors and
assigns of the foregoing, and no other person or entity shall have any legal
or equitable right, remedy or claim under or in respect of this Policy (except
as set forth in Section VIII of this Policy with respect to the Insurers'
subrogation rights against the Seller). 

XIII. ACQUISITION AGREEMENT



The Insureds shall not (x) amend, supplement or rescind the Acquisition
Agreement, (y) give any consent or waiver under the Acquisition Agreement or
(z) grant any authority to do any of the foregoing, in each case, without the
prior written consent of the Underwriting Representative (such consent not to
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), if such amendment,
supplement, rescission, consent or waiver would reasonably be expected to
actually prejudice the Insurers' rights or liabilities under this Policy (with
the Insurers bearing the burden of proving such prejudice). The foregoing
shall not restrict the Insureds from controlling their defense to the extent
permitted by Section VII of this Policy or agreeing to settlements and
judgments to the extent permitted by Section VII(B) of this Policy.



XIV. FAILURE TO COMPLY



Any failure of the Insureds to comply with any of the provisions of Sections V
through VIII of this Policy shall not relieve the Insurers of their
obligations under this Policy except to the extent the Insurers are actually
prejudiced thereby (with the Insurers having the burden of proving such
prejudice); provided, however, that (x) the Insureds' obligations under
Section VII.B of this Policy shall not be affected by the foregoing and (y) in
no event may a Claim Notice be delivered to the Underwriting Representative
later than the 45th day following the Policy Term.



XV. TRADE SANCTIONS



This insurance coverage does not apply to the extent that trade or economic
sanctions of any country prohibit the Insurers or any member of any respective
Insurer's group (including any parent company or controlling entity) from
providing insurance coverage hereunder. Whenever coverage provided by this
Policy would be in violation of any U.S. economic or trade sanctions such as,
but not limited to, those sanctions administered and enforced by the U.S.
Treasury Department\'s Office of Foreign Assets Control ("OFAC"), such
coverage shall be null and void.



XVI. PREMIUM REFUNDS AND CANCELLATION



This Policy is non-cancelable and non-renewable, and the Premium hereunder is
earned fully on the

Closing Date.
