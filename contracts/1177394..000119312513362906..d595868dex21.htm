_Agreement_ "), by and among INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINES CORPORATION, a
New York corporation (" _Seller_ "), and SYNNEX CORPORATION, a Delaware
corporation (" _Purchaser_ ").

 

 _W_ _I_ _T_ _N_ _E_ _S_ _S_ _E_ _T_ _H_ : 

WHEREAS, Purchaser and the Purchasing Subsidiaries intend to purchase from
Seller and the Selling Subsidiaries, and Seller and the Selling Subsidiaries
intend to sell to Purchaser and the Purchasing Subsidiaries, the Transferred
Assets upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement; and

 

WHEREAS, Purchaser and the Purchasing Subsidiaries intend to assume from
Seller and the Selling Subsidiaries, and Seller and the Selling Subsidiaries
intend to assign to Purchaser and the Purchasing Subsidiaries, the Assumed
Liabilities upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement;

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises set forth above and the
respective covenants, agreements, representations and warranties hereinafter
set forth, the Parties hereby agree as follows:

ARTICLE I _Definitions and Documentary Conventions_  

SECTION 1.01. _Definitions and Documentary Conventions_. The defined terms set
forth in Article I of Annex 1 hereto, when used in this Agreement and each
other Transaction Agreement (unless otherwise expressly provided herein or in
such other Transaction Agreement), shall have the meanings ascribed thereto in
such Annex 1\. This Agreement and each other Transaction Agreement (unless
otherwise expressly provided herein or in such other Transaction Agreement)
shall be subject to and incorporate the Documentary Conventions set forth in
Article II of Annex 1 hereto.

 

ARTICLE II _Purchase and Sale of Transferred Assets_

 

SECTION 2.01. _Transferred Assets_. __

 

(a) _Transfers_.

 

(i) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, on the
applicable Closing Date, Seller shall, or shall cause the Selling
Subsidiaries to, Transfer to Purchaser or, subject to clause (ii) below, such
direct or indirect Subsidiaries of Purchaser as Purchaser may designate (any
such designated Subsidiaries, the " _Purchasing Subsidiaries_ "), and
Purchaser shall, or shall cause the Purchasing Subsidiaries to, purchase from
Seller or the Selling Subsidiaries, as applicable, all right, title and
interest of Seller and such Selling Subsidiaries in and to the Transferred
Assets and assume the Assumed Liabilities; (ii) Purchaser shall not designate any of its Subsidiaries as a Purchasing
Subsidiary pursuant to clause (i) above to the extent that such designation
(and the Transfer of the relevant Transferred Assets to, and the assumption of
the relevant Assumed Liabilities by, such Subsidiary hereunder) will result
in the failure of any closing condition set forth in Articles VIII and IX that
would be satisfied absent such designation.

 

(b) _Local Acquisition Agreements_. Any assumption of the Assumed
Liabilities and any Transfer of the Transferred Assets and, where required by
Applicable Law, the Covered Employees in each territory set forth on Schedule
2.01(b)

 



2  (which schedule may be amended as mutually agreed by Seller and Purchaser
based on the territories in which Transferred Assets and Covered Employees are
located) (each, a " _Covered Territory_ ") will be effected pursuant to
short-form acquisition agreements (the " _Local Acquisition Agreements_ ") on
a Covered Territory-by-Covered Territory basis. Each Local Acquisition
Agreement shall be in substantially the form attached as Exhibit A to this
Agreement, except, in each case, for (i) the deletion of provisions as may be
reasonably agreed by Seller and Purchaser which are inapplicable to a
particular Covered Territory, (ii) such changes as may be reasonably agreed
by Seller and Purchaser to be necessary or advisable to satisfy the
requirements of applicable local law, (iii) such changes as may be reasonably
agreed upon by Seller and Purchaser regarding employees and employee benefits
matters in order to adapt such agreement to the particular circumstances of
the relevant Covered Territory; _provided_ that such changes shall be
consistent with the principles underlying the corresponding provisions of this
Agreement, the Employee Matters Agreement, the Real Estate Agreements and the
IP Agreements; and (iv) such other changes as may be agreed upon be Seller and
Purchaser. At the applicable Closing, each Party shall execute and deliver, or
shall cause its Subsidiaries, as applicable, to execute and deliver, the
Local Acquisition Agreements pertaining to each applicable Covered Territory.

 

SECTION 2.02. _Excluded Assets_. Notwithstanding anything in the Transaction
Agreements to the contrary, any assets which are not Transferred Assets shall
not be Transferred to Purchaser or any of the Purchasing Subsidiaries pursuant
to this Agreement, and shall be retained by Seller and the Selling
Subsidiaries, including the following (collectively, the " _Excluded Assets_
"):

(a) any interests of Seller or any other Selling Company in, to or under
any of its owned real property or any lease of real property or in, to or
under any other interest in real property (except as provided in the Real
Estate Agreements and the Transferred Subsidiary Leases);

 

(b) all Excluded A/R and all cash and cash equivalents;

 

(c) any interest of Seller or any other Selling Company in any contract
entered into prior to the applicable Closing Date providing for the provision
of Customer Care Services to Seller or any of its Subsidiaries;

(d) all interests in any Shared Customer Care Split Contracts (that are
not Customer Care Split Interests), Shared GPS Split Contracts (that are not
GPS Split Interests) and Shared Other Contracts (subject to Section 5.01(e));

 

(e) all Intellectual Property Rights other than Intellectual Property
Rights conveyed pursuant to the IP Agreements; 

(f) all rights, claims, credits and causes of action of Seller or any of
the other Selling Companies arising under or relating to any Transferred
Asset to the extent they relate to periods prior to the applicable Closing
Date (except to the extent they relate to any Assumed Liabilities);

 



3 (g) all files, documents, books and records of Seller or any other
Selling Company, other than the Acquired Books and Records;

(h) all records prepared in connection with the Transfer of the
Transferred Assets and Assumed Liabilities and the negotiation of the
Transaction Agreements;

(i) all rights of Seller and its Subsidiaries under this Agreement and the
other Transaction Agreements;

(j) any equity interest or security in or of any Person, other than the
Transferred Subsidiary Interests;

(k) except as otherwise specifically provided in the Employee Matters
Agreement or in a Local Acquisition Agreement, all the assets of and all the
assets relating to the Seller Benefit Plans and the Required Benefit Plans;

 

(l) any and all Tax assets, including any Tax refunds, credits or claims,
attributable in each case to any Pre-Closing Tax Period (except to the extent
they relate to any Assumed Liabilities); and

(m) all assets required by Seller and its Subsidiaries solely to provide
the services to the Customer Care Business under the Transaction Agreements
with respect to the Transferred Assets to be transferred in a Subsequent
Closing, except to the extent that any such assets will be Transferred upon
the expiration or termination of the applicable Transaction Agreement in
accordance with the terms thereof.

All intellectual property matters, including the Transfer or licensing of
intellectual property constituting Transferred Assets and any representations
and warranties relating thereto, are addressed exclusively in the IP
Agreements (except for Article X to the extent it applies to matters
addressed in the IP Agreements). Except as otherwise expressly provided in
this Agreement or the other Transaction Agreements, neither Purchaser nor any
Purchasing Subsidiary shall have any proprietary or other ownership
interest or claim with respect to any assets relating to or underlying any
Transferred Contract, including intellectual property.

SECTION 2.03.  _Consideration_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
of this Agreement, as consideration for the transactions contemplated herein:

 

(a) Purchaser and the Purchasing Subsidiaries will assume the Assumed
Liabilities in the manner set forth in Section 2.04; and

(b) Purchaser will (i) issue and deliver to Seller (and/or any Selling
Subsidiaries as are designated pursuant to Section 3.01(b)(i)) a number of
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of Purchasers common
stock, par value $0.001 per share (the " _Purchaser Common Stock_ "), equal
to the lesser of (x) the quotient, rounded down to the nearest whole number,
obtained by dividing (1) $75,000,000.00 by (2) the Average Purchaser Trading
Price and (y) the maximum number of shares of Purchaser

 



4  Common Stock that would represent less than 5% of the aggregate issued and
outstanding shares of Purchaser Common Stock as of the Initial Closing Date
(after giving effect to the shares of Purchaser Common Stock issued to Seller
under this Agreement) (such lesser number of shares of Purchaser Common Stock,
the " _Stock Consideration_ ") and (ii) pay to Seller (and/or any Selling
Subsidiaries as are designated pursuant to Section 3.01(b)(i)) an amount in
cash in U.S. dollars equal to (1) $430,000,000.00 plus (2) the excess, if any,
of (A) $75,000,000.00 over (B) the product of the number of shares of
Purchaser Common Stock constituting the Stock Consideration and the Average
Purchaser Trading Price (such cash amount, the " _Cash Consideration_ ", and
together with the Stock Consideration, the " _Consideration_ "). For the
avoidance of doubt, the aggregate value of the Consideration (based on the
Average Purchaser Trading Price) shall not exceed an aggregate of
$505,000,000.00 (excluding any adjustments to the Consideration in this
Agreement).

 

SECTION 2.04. _Assumed Liabilities_.

 

(a) On the applicable Closing Date, Seller shall, or shall cause the
Selling Subsidiaries to, Transfer to Purchaser or the Purchasing
Subsidiaries, and Purchaser shall, or shall cause the Purchasing Subsidiaries
to, assume the Assumed Liabilities.

 

(b) Except as otherwise expressly set forth in the Transaction Agreements,
Purchaser and the Purchasing Subsidiaries shall not assume any liabilities of
Seller or the Selling Subsidiaries (whether accrued, absolute or contingent,
recorded or unrecorded or otherwise) other than the Assumed Liabilities, and
Seller or the Selling Subsidiaries shall be responsible for all liabilities
which are not Assumed Liabilities, including the following (collectively, the
" _Excluded Liabilities_ "):

 

(i) all Excluded A/P;

 

(ii) all Excluded Taxes;

 

(iii) all indebtedness for borrowed money owed by Seller or a Selling
Subsidiary;

 

(iv) all liabilities under Sellers Pension Plans except as otherwise
specifically provided in the Employee Matters Agreement or as may transfer
automatically to Purchaser or a Purchasing Subsidiary under Applicable Law;

 

(v) all Pre-Closing Environmental Liabilities;

 

(vi) the liabilities set forth on Section 2.04(b) of the Seller Disclosure
Letter; and

 

(vii) all liabilities and obligations (other than liabilities and
obligations relating to Environmental Laws, which are addressed in clause
(v)), including accrued expenses, to the extent relating to the Transferred
Assets for the period prior to the Initial Closing Date;

 



5 _provided_ , _however_ , that any deferred revenue liability attributable to
the Customer Care Business as of the Initial Closing Date and any liabilities
associated with ownership of the Transferred Subsidiary Interests post-closing
shall not constitute Excluded Liabilities. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each
Transferred Subsidiary shall remain liable for any of its liabilities in the
categories set forth in clauses (i), (iii), (iv), (v) and (vii) above.

 

(c) This Section 2.04 shall not affect the timing of the assumption by
Purchaser or a Purchasing Subsidiary of any Assumed Liabilities relating to
employees, the timing of which is specifically set forth in the Employee
Matters Agreement.

SECTION 2.05. _Net Tangible Assets Adjustment_.

(a) Within 90 days after the Initial Closing Date, Seller shall prepare
and deliver to Purchaser a statement setting forth (i) its calculation of Net
Tangible Assets as of the Initial Closing Date and (ii) a balance sheet of the
Customer Care Business as of the Initial Closing Date showing the basis
of such calculation (the " _Initial Balance Sheet_ "). The Initial Balance
Sheet shall be in substantially the same form as the Sample Statement and
prepared (w) as of the close of business on the Initial Closing Date, (x) on
a basis consistent with the principles, assumptions, policies, practices and
methodologies applied in preparing the Sample Statement, (y) to the extent
consistent with the basis set forth in clause (x), in accordance with Sellers
Accounting Policies and Practices and (z) to the extent consistent with the
bases set forth in clauses (x) and (y), in accordance with U.S. GAAP using the
same methodologies, principles, policies and procedures as were used to
prepare the Sample Statement. The Final Balance Sheet shall be consistent
with the foregoing principles. Each Party shall reasonably cooperate with the
other and its accounting advisors to provide them with any information
relevant to the Initial Balance Sheet that is reasonably requested (including
copies of documents and access to individuals to the extent reasonable) for
purposes of Sellers preparation or Purchasers review, as applicable, of the
Initial Balance Sheet.

 

(b) If Purchaser objects to the Initial Balance Sheet, Purchaser shall
deliver to Seller, no later than 90 days following receipt of the Initial
Balance Sheet, a notice setting forth in reasonable detail such objections (an
" _NTA Objection Notice_ "), together with reasonable supporting documentation
or an identification (to the extent actually known) of any necessary
documentation that has not yet been provided by Seller. If Purchaser does not
timely deliver an NTA Objection Notice to Seller or if Purchaser notifies
Seller that it has no objections, the Initial Balance Sheet shall be final
and binding on the Parties for purposes of this Section 2.05 and shall be
deemed the " _Final Balance Sheet_ ".

 

(c) If Purchaser timely delivers an NTA Objection Notice to Seller,
Purchaser and Seller shall attempt in good faith to resolve such matters
within 45 days after receipt of the same by Seller (the " _NTA 45-Day Period_
"), and if unable to do so, Purchaser and Seller shall refer all remaining
disputes (the " _NTA Disputed Items_ ") to an independent public accounting
firm mutually acceptable to Seller and Purchaser (the " _NTA Dispute
Accounting Firm_ ") promptly upon the expiration of the NTA 45-Day Period,
which shall be instructed to arbitrate and resolve such disputes within 45
Business

 



6  Days of the referral. The NTA Dispute Accounting Firm shall have authority
hereunder to interpret this Section 2.05 and other provisions of this
Agreement only to the extent necessary to resolve disputes under this Section
2.05. Purchaser and Seller shall have the right to meet jointly but not
separately with the NTA Dispute Accounting Firm during this period and to
present their respective positions. No ex parte communications with the NTA
Dispute Accounting Firm shall be permitted. Each of Seller and Purchaser shall
furnish or cause to be furnished to the NTA Dispute Accounting Firm only the
data, correspondence and other materials it presented to or received from
the other Party pursuant to this Section 2.05, and no other materials. The
determination by the NTA Dispute Accounting Firm for each NTA Disputed Item
shall be equal to one of the values, or within the range between the values,
assigned to such NTA Disputed Item by the Parties as presented by Seller in
the Initial Balance Sheet delivered pursuant to Section 2.05(a) and by
Purchaser in the NTA Objection Notice delivered pursuant to Section 2.05(b).
The resolution of disputes by the NTA Dispute Accounting Firm will be set
forth in writing, will be deemed an award in arbitration and will be final and
binding upon the Parties for purposes of this Section 2.05, upon the date of
such resolution, and such resolution shall be deemed the " _Final Balance
Sheet_ ".

(d) In making its determination, the NTA Dispute Accounting Firm shall
consider only those items that Seller and Purchaser have referred to the NTA
Dispute Accounting Firm, and the NTA Dispute Accounting Firm shall be bound by
the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including the definition of
Net Tangible Assets and the terms of this Section 2.05. Seller, on the one
hand, and Purchaser, on the other hand, will each pay its own fees and
expenses (including any fees and expenses of its accountants and other
Representatives) in connection with the resolution of any dispute under this
Section 2.05 (excluding the fees and expenses of the NTA Dispute Accounting
Firm). The fees and expenses of the NTA Dispute Accounting Firm incurred
pursuant to this Section 2.05 shall be borne equally by Purchaser and Seller
on a one-half basis.

(e) Within 30 days after the Final Balance Sheet becomes final and binding
for purposes of this Section 2.05:

(i) if the Final Net Tangible Assets Amount is greater than the Target
Closing Net Tangible Assets Amount, Purchaser shall, or shall cause the
Purchasing Subsidiaries to, pay an amount in cash in U.S. dollars equal to
such difference to Seller or as otherwise designated by Seller; or 

(ii) if the Final Net Tangible Assets Amount is less than the Target
Closing Net Tangible Assets Amount, Seller shall pay an amount in cash in
U.S. dollars equal to such difference to Purchaser or as otherwise designated
by Purchaser.

 

(f) All payments made pursuant to Section 2.05(e) or 2.05(g)(ii) hereof
shall be treated as an adjustment to the Cash Consideration for Tax purposes
unless there is no reasonable basis for doing so under the relevant Tax law.

 



7 (g) If any additional Transferred Assets are identified (including
as mutually agreed by Seller and Purchaser pursuant to clause (xii) of the
definition of "Transferred Assets") after the preparation of the Initial
Balance Sheet or Final Balance Sheet but prior to the Final Transfer Date,
which additional Transferred Assets should have been but were not included in
the calculation of Net Tangible Assets set forth in the Initial Balance Sheet
or Final Balance Sheet, then (i) if the Final Balance Sheet has not become
final and binding for the purposes of this Section 2.05 by the time such
additional Transferred Assets are identified, the calculation of Net Tangible
Assets on the Initial Balance Sheet shall be increased by the value of such
additional Transferred Assets (as determined in accordance with the
definition of "Net Tangible Assets" and the Sample Statement) or (ii) if the
Final Balance Sheet has become final and binding for the purposes of this
Section 2.05 by the time such additional Transferred Assets are identified,
Purchaser shall pay or return, or cause to be paid or returned, to Seller an
amount in cash in U.S. dollars equal to the value of the additional
Transferred Assets (as determined as of the end of the accounting month most
recently ended prior to the date such Transferred Assets are delivered to
Purchaser and otherwise in accordance with the definition of "Net Tangible
Assets" and the Sample Statement).

 

SECTION 2.06. _Audit Adjustment_.

 

(a) Seller shall deliver to Purchaser the 2012 Audited Financial Statements
and, to the extent required pursuant to Rule 3-05 of Regulation S-X for
Purchaser to meet its external financial reporting obligations under the
Exchange Act, (i) the audited balance sheet of the Customer Care Business as
of December 31, 2013 and (ii) the audited statements of income and cash flows
of the Customer Care Business for the year ended December 31, 2013 (the "
_2013 Audited Financial Statements_ "). Seller shall prepare a statement (the
" _Initial 2012 Audit Adjustment Statement_ ") setting forth (x) the 2012
Audited Income which shall be prepared in the same manner (including by using
the same methodologies, principles, policies and procedures) as the 2012
Unaudited Income was prepared in Section 7.06 of the Seller Disclosure
Letter, and (y) the Audit Adjustment Amount, and deliver such Initial 2012
Audit Adjustment Statement along with the 2012 Audited Financial Statements to
Purchaser.

 

(b) If Purchaser objects to the Initial 2012 Audit Adjustment Statement,
Purchaser shall deliver to Seller, as soon as reasonably practicable and in
no event later than 15 Business Days following receipt of the Initial 2012
Audit Adjustment Statement, a notice setting forth in reasonable detail such
objections (an " _Audit Objection Notice_ "), together with reasonable
supporting documentation. If Purchaser does not timely deliver an Audit
Objection Notice to Seller or if Purchaser notifies Seller that it has no
objections, the Initial 2012 Audit Adjustment Statement shall be final and
binding on the Parties for purposes of this Section 2.06 and shall be deemed
the " _Final 2012 Audit Adjustment Statement_ ".

 

(c) If Purchaser timely delivers an Audit Objection Notice to Seller,
Purchaser and Seller shall attempt in good faith to resolve such matters
within 10 days after receipt of the same by Seller (the " _Audit 10-Day
Period_ "), and if unable to do so, Purchaser and Seller shall refer all
remaining disputes (the " _Audit Disputed Items_ ") to an

 



8  independent public accounting firm mutually acceptable to Seller and
Purchaser (the " _Audit Dispute Accounting Firm_ ") promptly upon the
expiration of the Audit 10-Day Period, which shall be instructed to arbitrate
and resolve such disputes within 20 Business Days of the referral. The Audit
Dispute Accounting Firm shall have authority hereunder to interpret this
Section 2.06 and other provisions of this Agreement only to the extent
necessary to resolve disputes under this Section 2.06. Purchaser and Seller
shall have the right to meet jointly but not separately with the Audit Dispute
Accounting Firm during this period and to present their respective positions.
No ex parte communications with the Audit Dispute Accounting Firm shall be
permitted. Each of Seller and Purchaser shall furnish or cause to be furnished
to the Audit Dispute Accounting Firm only the data, correspondence and
other materials it presented to or received from the other Party pursuant to
this Section 2.06, and no other materials. The determination by the Audit
Dispute Accounting Firm for each Audit Disputed Item shall be equal to one of
the values, or within the range between the values, assigned to such Audit
Disputed Item by the Parties as presented by Seller in the Initial 2012 Audit
Adjustment Statement delivered pursuant to Section 2.06(a) and by Purchaser in
the Audit Objection Notice delivered pursuant to Section 2.06(b). The
resolution of disputes by the Audit Dispute Accounting Firm will be set forth
in writing, will be deemed an award in arbitration and will be final and
binding upon the Parties for purposes of this Section 2.06, upon the date of
such resolution, and such resolution shall be deemed the " _Final 2012 Audit
Adjustment Statement_ ".

 

(d) In making its determination, the Audit Dispute Accounting Firm shall
consider only those items that Seller and Purchaser have referred to the
Audit Dispute Accounting Firm, and the Audit Dispute Accounting Firm shall be
bound by the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including the terms of
this Section 2.06. Seller, on the one hand, and Purchaser, on the other hand,
will each pay its own fees and expenses (including any fees and expenses of
its accountants and other Representatives) in connection with the resolution
of any dispute under this Section 2.06 (excluding the fees and expenses of
the Audit Dispute Accounting Firm). The fees and expenses of the Audit Dispute
Accounting Firm incurred pursuant to this Section 2.06 shall be borne equally
by Purchaser and Seller on a one-half basis.

 

(e) If the Final 2012 Audit Adjustment Statement becomes final and binding
for purposes of this Section 2.06 at least two Business Days before the
Initial Closing Date, then, if the Audit Adjustment Amount is negative, the
Initial Cash Consideration paid on the Initial Closing Date shall be decreased
by the absolute value of the Audit Adjustment Amount.

 

(f) If the Final 2012 Audit Adjustment Statement becomes final and binding
for purposes of this Section 2.06 after the date that is two Business Days
before the Initial Closing Date, then, if the Audit Adjustment Amount is
negative, within 30 days after the Final 2012 Audit Adjustment Statement
becomes final and binding, Seller shall pay an amount in cash in U.S. dollars
equal to the absolute value of the Audit Adjustment Amount to Purchaser or as
otherwise designated by Purchaser.

 



9 (g) All payments made pursuant to Section 2.06(f) hereof shall be treated
as an adjustment to the Cash Consideration for Tax purposes unless there is no
reasonable basis for doing so under the relevant Tax law.

 

(h) The Net Tangible Assets adjustment contemplated in Section 2.05 and the
audited income adjustment contemplated in this Section 2.06 shall be
independent adjustments to the Cash Consideration. On the date that is the
later of (i) the date the Final Balance Sheet becomes final and binding on
both Parties pursuant to Section 2.05 and (ii) the date the Final 2012 Audit
Adjustment Statement becomes final and binding on both Parties pursuant to
this Section 2.06, the Cash Consideration shall be deemed adjusted based on
the net impact of both adjustments.

 

SECTION 2.07. _Withholding_.

 

(a) Each Party shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts
payable pursuant to this Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements such
amounts as are required to be deducted and withheld under Applicable Law (such
Party that deducts and withholds, the " _Withholding Party_ "). The
Withholding Party shall timely pay the full amount so deducted or withheld to
the relevant Governmental Authority, in accordance with Applicable Law. As
soon as practicable after any such payment, the Withholding Party shall
deliver to the other Party the original or a certified copy of a
receipt issued by the relevant Governmental Authority evidencing such
payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such
payment reasonably satisfactory to the other Party.

 

(b) If Purchaser or any Purchasing Subsidiary deducts or withholds any
Indemnified Withholding Tax (or, if Seller or any Selling Subsidiary becomes
liable for any Indemnified Withholding Tax), then Purchaser or such Purchasing
Subsidiary shall remit to Seller or the applicable Selling Subsidiary an
additional amount sufficient to place Seller or such Selling Subsidiary in
the same after-Tax position as it would have been in had Purchaser or the
applicable Purchasing Subsidiary been organized or resident for Tax purposes
in the same jurisdiction as Seller or the applicable Selling Subsidiary in
respect of which the applicable payment was made.

(c) Seller and its Affiliates and Purchaser and its Affiliates
shall cooperate in good faith to minimize any withholding that may be applied
to any payments described in this Section 2.07.

 

(d) To the extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld under this
Section 2.07, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements as having been paid by the
Withholding Party to the other Party to the extent so paid to the appropriate
Governmental Authority.

defense of such Tax Contest Claim is prejudiced thereby. Unless the Tax
Contest Claim is in respect of either (x) a Straddle Period Return or (y) a

Purchaser, but in each case only to the extent relating to Excluded Taxes or
Taxes for which Seller would be required to indemnify Purchaser under Section
10.01, (ii) Seller shall be entitled to participate in any such Tax Contest
Claim, including having an opportunity to comment on any written materials
prepared in connection with any such Tax Contest Claim and attending any

ARTICLE V _Additional Agreements_

 

SECTION 5.01. _Consents, Novations and Subcontracted Work_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, this
Agreement shall not constitute an agreement to Transfer any Transferred Asset
or any claim, right or benefit arising under or resulting from such
Transferred Asset if and for so long as a Transfer thereof, without the
consent of a third party, under Applicable Law or the express terms of
the applicable Transferred Contract, would constitute a breach or other
contravention of the rights of such third party, would be ineffective with
respect to any party to an agreement concerning such Transferred Asset, or
would in any material way adversely affect the rights of Seller or its
Affiliates or, upon Transfer, of Purchaser or its Affiliates with respect to
such Transferred Asset (such assets being collectively referred to herein as "
_Restricted Assets_ "). Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement

 



18  to the contrary, unless and until any such consent with respect to any
Restricted Asset, as appropriate, is obtained, such Restricted Asset shall not
constitute a Transferred Asset, and any liability arising out of, or related
to, such Restricted Asset shall not constitute an Assumed Liability for any
purpose under this Agreement until such time as any required consent to
Transfer shall have been obtained. This Section 5.01(a) does not relate to
Shared Customer Care Split Contracts or Shared GPS Split Contracts, which are
addressed in Section 5.01(c).

 

(b) Seller shall, and shall cause the Selling Subsidiaries to, use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, prior to the applicable Closing
Date, all requisite consents to Transfer to Purchaser or a Purchasing
Subsidiary all of the Restricted Assets on the applicable Closing Date.
Purchaser shall, and shall cause the Purchasing Subsidiaries to, cooperate and
use commercially reasonable efforts to assist the Selling Companies in
obtaining such consents (and, without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, with respect to any Restricted Asset for which a consent or other
approval is required from a Governmental Authority, Purchaser shall, and
shall cause the Purchasing Subsidiaries to, use commercially reasonable
efforts to apply for and obtain any and all of such consents or approvals as
soon as reasonably practicable). Nothing in this Section 5.01(b) shall
require Purchaser, Seller or any of their Subsidiaries to grant any guarantee
or other additional consideration to any third party or (except to the extent
incurred in performing the actions and procedures set forth in Schedule
5.01(f)) incur additional costs or expenses in order to obtain any such
consent. In the event that Seller determines to seek novation with respect to
any Transferred Contract, Purchaser shall cooperate with, and shall cause
the Purchasing Subsidiaries to cooperate with, Seller and the Selling
Subsidiaries (including, where necessary, entering into appropriate
instruments of assumption) to cause such novation to be obtained and to have
Seller and the Selling Subsidiaries released from all liability to third
parties with respect to such Transferred Contract to the extent consistent
with the terms of this Agreement. With respect to any Assumed Liabilities for
which Seller or any Selling Subsidiary has any secondary liability to third
parties, Purchaser shall provide, and shall cause the Purchasing Subsidiaries
to provide, Seller and the Selling Subsidiaries reasonable access and
information in order for Seller or any Selling Subsidiary to ascertain
continuing compliance by Purchaser and the Purchasing Subsidiaries with all
material contract terms and conditions applicable thereto.

 

(c) Seller shall, and shall cause the Selling Subsidiaries to, use
commercially reasonable efforts to (x) separate the rights and obligations
under each Shared Customer Care Split Contract relating exclusively to the
provision of Customer Care Services and Transfer to Purchaser or a Purchasing
Subsidiary any transferable interest in each such Shared Customer Care Split
Contract that relates exclusively to the provision of Customer Care Services
(a " _Customer Care Split Interest_ ") and (y) separate the rights and
obligations under each Shared GPS Split Contract relating exclusively to the
provision of GPS Services and Transfer to Purchaser or a Purchasing Subsidiary
any transferable interest in each such Shared GPS Split Contract that relates
exclusively to the provision of GPS Services (a " _GPS Split Interest_ "). If
an attempted Transfer of a Customer Care Split Interest or a GPS Split
Interest, without the consent of a third party (under Applicable Law or the
express terms of the applicable Shared Split Contract), 

 



19  would constitute a breach or other contravention of the rights of such third
party, would be ineffective with respect to any party to an agreement
concerning the applicable Shared Split Contract, or would in any way
adversely affect the rights of Seller or its Affiliates with respect to such
Shared Split Contract or, upon Transfer, of Purchaser or its Affiliates with
respect to such Customer Care Split Interest or GPS Split Interest,
as applicable (each, a " _Restricted Interest_ "), then (i) Seller shall, and
shall cause the Selling Subsidiaries to, use commercially reasonable efforts
to obtain, prior to the applicable Closing Date, all requisite consents
to Transfer such Restricted Interest on the applicable Closing Date and (ii)
Purchaser shall, and shall cause the Purchasing Subsidiaries to, cooperate and
use commercially reasonable efforts to assist the Selling Companies in
obtaining such consents (and, without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, with respect to any Restricted Interest for which a consent or
other approval is required from a Governmental Authority, Purchaser shall, and
shall cause the Purchasing Subsidiaries to, use commercially reasonable
efforts to apply for and obtain any and all of such consents or approvals as
soon as reasonably practicable); _provided_ that nothing in this Section
5.01(c) shall require Purchaser, Seller or any of their Subsidiaries to grant
any guarantee or other additional consideration to any third party or (except
to the extent incurred in performing the actions and procedures set forth in
Schedule 5.01(f)) incur additional costs or expenses in order to obtain any
such consent. Once consent is obtained for the Transfer of a Restricted
Interest, such Restricted Interest shall be Transferred to Purchaser or a
Purchasing Subsidiary (but not before), and such Restricted Interest shall be
deemed to be a Transferred Asset for purposes of this Agreement.

(d) If any required consent to Transfer a Restricted Asset or a Restricted
Interest is not obtained on or prior to the applicable Closing Date, the
Parties hereby agree to implement such arrangements with respect to the
underlying rights and obligations to the extent practicable as shall permit
Purchaser or a Purchasing Subsidiary, on and following the applicable Closing
Date, to enjoy the benefits of the applicable Restricted Asset or Restricted
Interest and to perform (and Purchaser or the applicable Purchasing Subsidiary
shall agree to perform) the obligations of Seller or any applicable Selling
Subsidiary thereunder (to the extent they would otherwise constitute Assumed
Liabilities), as a subcontractor, vendor or otherwise (for no additional
consideration), and Purchaser or the applicable Purchasing Subsidiary to
assume the obligations of and obtain the net economic benefit thereof (the "
_Subcontracted Restricted Work_ "), until the earlier of (i) such time as such
consent shall have been obtained and (ii) in the case of a Restricted Asset
that is a contract or a Restricted Interest, such time as such contract shall
have lapsed, expired or not have been renewed in accordance with its terms.
Purchaser agrees to diligently perform and discharge, and shall cause the
Purchasing Subsidiaries to diligently perform and discharge, the obligations
of Seller and the Selling Subsidiaries in connection with the Subcontracted
Restricted Work, directly or indirectly, as applicable, through Seller or the
Selling Subsidiaries; and to the extent that consents to Transfer with
respect to a particular Restricted Asset or Restricted Interest are obtained
after the applicable Closing Date, the Parties agree that such obligations
will no longer be considered to be Subcontracted Restricted Work at such
time, but will instead be deemed to be Assumed Liabilities for all purposes of
this Agreement. The Parties shall enter such reasonable arrangements with
respect to Covered Employees performing services under any Restricted Asset
or Restricted Interest as are necessary and appropriate to give effect to the
arrangements provided for under this Section 5.01(d).

 



20 (e) The Parties hereby agree to, on the Initial Closing Date, execute
the Bilateral Subcontracting Agreement with respect to each Shared Customer
Care Contract and each Shared Other Contract in order to implement
subcontracting arrangements pursuant to the economic and other terms set forth
in the Bilateral Subcontracting Agreement (and the applicable transaction
document executed thereunder relating to such Shared Customer Care Contract or
Shared Other Contract), whereby (i) Seller subcontracts to Purchaser (or a
Purchasing Subsidiary) the provision of Customer Care Services (or, with
respect to the Shared Other Contracts set forth on Schedule 5.01(e), the
provision of GPS Services) under each Shared Other Contract (the "
_Subcontracted Customer Care Work_ "), and (ii) Purchaser subcontracts to
Seller (or a Selling Subsidiary) the provision of Other Services under each
Shared Customer Care Contract (the " _Subcontracted Other Work_ "), in the
case of each of clause (i) and (ii), until such time as such Shared Customer
Care Contract or Shared Other Contract, as applicable, shall have lapsed,
expired or not have been renewed in accordance with its terms. Purchaser
agrees to diligently perform and discharge, and shall cause the
Purchasing Subsidiaries to diligently perform and discharge, the
Subcontracted Customer Care Work in accordance with the terms of the Bilateral
Subcontracting Agreement. Seller agrees to diligently perform and discharge,
and shall cause the Selling Subsidiaries to diligently perform and discharge,
the Subcontracted Other Work in accordance with the terms of the Bilateral
Subcontracting Agreement.

 

(f) In furtherance of the foregoing Sections 5.01(a), 5.01(b), 5.01(c),
5.01(d) and 5.01(e), the Parties agree that the procedures and actions set
forth in Schedule 5.01(f) shall apply with respect to the Transferred Assets,
the Assumed Liabilities, the Shared Split Contracts, the Customer Care Split
Interests, the GPS Split Interests, the Shared Customer Care Contracts and
the Shared Other Contracts.

(g) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, but
subject to Purchasers rights under Sections 5.17 and 8.01(e), the failure to
obtain any consent or the termination (or notice thereof) with respect to any
Transferred Contract or any circumstances resulting from any of
the foregoing, shall not, individually or in the aggregate, constitute a
Seller Material Adverse Effect or a breach by Seller or any Selling Subsidiary
of any representation or warranty under any of the Transaction Agreements or a
failure of any condition under any of the Transaction Agreements, including
those in Article VIII.

SECTION 5.02. _Subsequent Covered Territories; P andL Amount_.

(a) From and after the Initial Closing until the applicable
Subsequent Closing Date, and subject to and as permitted by Applicable Law,
including the Transfer Regulations and other laws necessary to accomplish
mandatory transfers of employment, as applicable, Seller shall operate the
Customer Care Business in each Subsequent Covered Territory for the benefit
of Purchaser and the Purchasing Subsidiaries, as further provided in Section
5.02(b) below; _provided_ , _however_ , that Seller shall provide Purchaser 

 



21  access to the Customer Care Business in each Subsequent Covered Territory as
may be reasonably requested by Purchaser in accordance with Section 5.11(a).
In furtherance of the foregoing, Seller and Purchaser shall, at the
reasonable request of the other Party, agree, among other things, to enter
into secondment or services agreements where appropriate, in efforts to avoid
a disruption to the operation of the Customer Care Business in each of the
Subsequent Covered Territories.

(b) With respect to each Subsequent Covered Territory, Seller
shall calculate an amount (the " _P andL Amount_") for each Subsequent Covered
Territory (i) each month and deliver a monthly statement (prepared on a basis
consistent with the preparation of the PandL Amount Statement) to
Purchaser within 15 Business Days following the end of each month (which
calculation and monthly statement, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not
include the PandL Amount of any Subsequent Covered Territory that closed before
the start of such month);  _provided_ that the monthly statement for the last
month in each fiscal quarter of Purchaser shall be delivered within 15
calendar days following the end of such fiscal quarter ( _provided_ that if
the fifteenth calendar day falls on a Saturday, then such statement shall be
delivered on the immediately preceding Friday) and (ii) as and when required
pursuant to Section 5.02(c). The PandL Amount for any Subsequent Covered
Territory shall be equal to the income or loss, in each case before taking
into account income Taxes, attributable to the Customer Care Business in the
Subsequent Covered Territory from the Initial Closing Date to the applicable
Subsequent Closing Date (or, in the case of the calculation of the PandL Amount
for the monthly statement delivered pursuant to clause (i) of the preceding
sentence, the end of the applicable month), and shall include the revenue,
costs and expenses of the relevant Transferred Assets and Assumed
Liabilities (including costs and expenses related to employees) during such
period. In calculating the PandL Amount with respect to a Subsequent Covered
Territory, all corporate allocations will be discontinued and instead the PandL
Amount shall include as an expense the charges that would have been incurred
under the Master Transition Services Agreement, the IP Agreements or the Real
Estate Agreements, as applicable, with respect to such Subsequent Covered
Territory as if closing of the Transfer of the Transferred Assets and the
Assumed Liabilities in such Subsequent Covered Territory had occurred on the
Initial Closing Date. The PandL Amount shall be calculated in accordance with
Sellers Accounting Policies and Practices. Upon confirmation of the Final
PandL Amount in accordance with this Section 5.02, Seller shall pay to Purchaser
any positive Final PandL Amount, and Purchaser shall pay to Seller any negative
Final PandL Amount.

 

(c) Within 60 days after the Closing of a Subsequent Covered Territory that
occurs after the Initial Closing Date (but, with respect to a Subsequent
Covered Territory that closes at the end of a fiscal quarter of Purchaser, no
later than 15 calendar days after such fiscal quarter end), Seller shall
prepare its calculation of the PandL Amount with respect to such Subsequent
Covered Territory, and shall deliver to Purchaser a statement including such
calculation (each, a " _P andL Amount Statement_"), together with a profit and
loss statement showing the basis of such calculation. Each Party shall
reasonably cooperate with the other and its accounting advisors to provide
them with any information used in or relevant to the preparation of the PandL
Amount Statement that is reasonably requested (including copies of documents
and access to individuals to the extent reasonable) for purposes of Sellers
preparation or Purchasers review, as applicable, of the PandL Amount Statement.

 



22 (d) If Purchaser objects to the PandL Amount Statement, Purchaser
shall deliver to Seller, no later than 45 days following receipt of the PandL
Amount Statement, a notice setting forth in reasonable detail such objections
(a " _P andL Objection Notice_"), together with reasonable
supporting documentation or an identification (to the extent actually known)
of any necessary documentation that has not yet been provided by Seller. If
Purchaser does not timely deliver a PandL Objection Notice to Seller or if
Purchaser notifies Seller that it has no objections, the PandL Amount Statement
shall be final and binding on the Parties for purposes of this Section 5.02
and shall be deemed the "Final PandL Amount Statement" with respect to such
Subsequent Covered Territory. 

(e) If Purchaser timely delivers a PandL Objection Notice to Seller,
Purchaser and Seller shall attempt in good faith to resolve such matters
within 45 days after receipt of the same by Seller, and if unable to do so,
Purchaser and Seller shall refer all remaining disputes (the " _P andL Disputed
Items_") to an independent public accounting firm mutually acceptable to
Seller and Purchaser (the " _P andL Dispute Accounting Firm_"), which shall be
instructed to arbitrate and resolve such disputes within 45 Business Days of
the referral. The PandL Dispute Accounting Firm shall have authority hereunder
to interpret this Section 5.02 and other provisions of this Agreement only to
the extent necessary to resolve disputes under this Section 5.02. Purchaser
and Seller shall have the right to meet jointly but not separately with the
PandL Dispute Accounting Firm during this period and to present their respective
positions. No ex parte communications with the PandL Dispute Accounting Firm
shall be permitted. Each of Seller and Purchaser shall furnish or cause to be
furnished to the PandL Dispute Accounting Firm only the data, correspondence and
other materials it presented to or received from the other Party pursuant to
this Section 5.02, and no other materials. The determination by the PandL
Dispute Accounting Firm for each PandL Disputed Item shall be equal to one of
the values, or within the range between the values, assigned to such PandL
Disputed Item by the Parties as presented by Seller in the initial PandL
Amount Statement delivered pursuant to Section 5.02(c) and by Purchaser in
the PandL Objection Notice delivered pursuant to Section 5.02(d). The resolution
of disputes by the PandL Dispute Accounting Firm will be set forth in writing,
will be deemed an award in arbitration and will be final and binding upon the
Parties for purposes of this Section 5.02 upon the date of such resolution,
and such resolution shall be deemed the "Final PandL Amount Statement" with
respect to such Subsequent Covered Territory.

(f) In making its determination, the PandL Dispute Accounting Firm
shall consider only those items that Seller and Purchaser have referred to
the PandL Dispute Accounting Firm, and the PandL Dispute Accounting Firm shall be
bound by the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including the provisions
in Section 5.02(b) governing the calculation of PandL Amounts hereunder, and
the other terms of this Section 5.02. Seller, on the one hand, and Purchaser,
on the other hand, will each pay its own fees and expenses (including any fees
and expenses of its accountants and other Representatives) in connection with
the resolution of any dispute under this Section 5.02 (excluding the fees and
expenses of the PandL Dispute Accounting Firm). The fees and expenses of the
PandL Dispute Accounting Firm incurred pursuant to this Section 5.02 shall be
borne equally by Purchaser and Seller on a one-half basis.

 



23 (g) Seller or Purchaser, as applicable, shall pay the applicable Final PandL
Amount no later than 30 days after the date on which the applicable Final PandL
Amount Statement with respect thereto becomes final and binding upon the
Parties as provided in this Section 5.02. Such payment, by Seller or
Purchaser, shall be paid by Seller or Purchaser, as applicable, in cash in
U.S. dollars.

SECTION 5.03. _Commercially Reasonable Efforts_.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement,
including Section 5.01, each of Seller and Purchaser shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the Initial Closing to occur by the Target Initial
Closing Date and the Subsequent Closings to occur as soon as reasonably
possible thereafter, including using commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain all consents, permits, authorizations and approvals of, and to make all
filings, notifications or registrations with, all Governmental Authorities and
other Persons which are necessary for the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by the Transaction Agreements; _provided_ that, without limiting
any other provision of this Agreement, neither Purchaser nor Seller shall be
required to grant any additional consideration to any third party in
connection therewith (other than filing or application fees). For the
avoidance of doubt, Purchaser agrees that it may not elect to receive any Non-
Closed Subsequent Covered Territory Payment or retain any portion of the
Initial Holdback Amount or the India Holdback Amount in lieu of performing
its obligations under this Section 5.03, and the availability to Purchaser of
any Non-Closed Subsequent Covered Territory Payment, the Initial Holdback
Amount or the India Holdback Amount shall not be taken into account when
determining the efforts required by Purchaser hereunder.

 

(b) Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain as
promptly as practicable all Permits required by Applicable Law for Purchaser
or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates to own the Transferred Assets and
assume the Assumed Liabilities; _provided_ that, without limiting any other
provision of this Agreement, neither Purchaser nor Seller shall be required
to expend any material sum or agree to a material concession to any
Governmental Authority to obtain any such Permits. Purchaser acknowledges that
no Permits are being Transferred pursuant to this Agreement or the other
Transaction Agreements to the extent such Transfer is prohibited or
restricted or would be invalid or ineffective. During the period between the
date of this Agreement and each applicable Closing, Purchaser and Seller shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate to identify the material
Permits that are required to operate the Customer Care Business (excluding
general business Permits not specifically required by the operation of the
Customer Care Business). Purchaser acknowledges that Seller makes no
representation or warranty with respect to Permits that may be required to be
held by Purchaser or the Purchasing Subsidiaries to operate the Customer Care
Business after the applicable Closing.

 

SECTION 5.04. _Regulatory Matters_.

 



24 (a) Without limiting the generality of Section 5.03, each of Seller and
Purchaser shall, or shall cause their respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates
to, use commercially reasonable efforts (i) as promptly as practicable, to
make any filing with the FTC and the DOJ required under the HSR Act with
respect to the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreements, (ii)
as promptly as practicable, to take all actions necessary to submit a
notification within the meaning of Article 4(1) of the EC Merger Regulation in
respect of the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreements, (iii)
as promptly as practicable, to make, or cause its Subsidiaries and Affiliates
to make, any filing or notice required or advisable under any other antitrust,
trade regulation, competition, communications, foreign investment or other
law or regulation applicable to the Transaction Agreements or the transactions
contemplated thereby and (iv) to provide any supplemental information
requested in connection with such filings made under the HSR Act, the EC
Merger Regulation or such other Applicable Law as promptly as practicable
after such request is made. Each of Seller and Purchaser shall, and shall
cause their respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates to, furnish to the
other such information and assistance as the other may reasonably request in
connection with its preparation of any filing or submission which is necessary
or appropriate under the HSR Act, the EC Merger Regulation or such other
Applicable Law or which is otherwise requested by the FTC, the DOJ, the
European Commission or any other Governmental Authority in the course of any
review of the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreements. Seller
and Purchaser shall keep each other apprised of the status of any
communications with, and inquiries or requests for additional information
from, the FTC, the DOJ, the European Commission or any other Governmental
Authority.

 

(b) Without limiting the generality of Section 5.03, promptly following the
execution and delivery by the Parties of this Agreement, the Parties shall,
to the extent necessary or advisable, enter into discussions with the
Governmental Authorities from whom consents or non-actions are or may be
required to be obtained in connection with the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreements and use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all such required consents or non-
actions from such Governmental Authorities, in each case with respect to the
transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreements, so as to enable the
Initial Closing to occur by the Target Initial Closing Date and the Subsequent
Closings to occur as soon as reasonably possible thereafter.

 

(c) Without limiting the generality of Section 5.03, to the extent
necessary in order to accomplish the foregoing, Purchaser shall propose,
negotiate, agree or commit to and effect, by mitigation agreement, consent
decree, hold separate order or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or disposition
of, or prohibition or limitation on the ownership or operation by it or any
of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates of, any portion of the business, properties
or assets of Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates or the
Transferred Assets; _provided_ , _however_ , that Purchaser shall not be
required pursuant to this Section 5.04 to (i) propose, commit to or effect
any action that is not conditioned upon the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by the Transaction Agreements, (ii) commit to or effect any sale,
divestiture or disposition of, or prohibition or limitation with respect to
the ownership or operation by it or any of its Affiliates of, any material

 



25  portion of (x) the Transferred Assets or the Customer Care Business, (y) the
properties or assets of Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, or (z) the global business services business of Purchaser and its
Subsidiaries, or (iii) commit to or effect any such sale, divestiture,
disposition or prohibition or limitation on its ownership or conduct as
contemplated by this Section before Seller substantially complies with a
Request for Additional Information issued by the FTC or DOJ pursuant to the
regulations adopted under the HSR Act.

 

(d) Purchaser shall, to the extent not prohibited by Applicable Law or the
relevant Governmental Authority, (1) seek prior consultation with Seller
regarding any proposals it, or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates, intends
to make to any Governmental Authority in order to obtain the satisfaction of
the conditions set forth in Section 8.01(b), 8.02, 9.01(b) or 9.02 and (2)
offer to include Seller and its external legal counsel at meetings (including
scheduled telephone calls) with any Governmental Authority relating to the
Transaction Agreements or the transactions contemplated by the Transaction
Agreements. Each Party shall, to the extent not prohibited by Applicable Law
or the relevant Governmental Authority, (i) give the other Party reasonable
advance notice of all meetings (which includes scheduled telephone
calls) with any Governmental Authority relating to the HSR Act, the EC Merger
Regulation or any other antitrust, trade regulation, competition,
communications, foreign investment or other Applicable Law applicable to the
Transaction Agreements or the transactions contemplated thereby (" _Relevant
Matters_ "), (ii) not participate independently in any meeting (which includes
scheduled telephone calls) with any Governmental Authority relating to
Relevant Matters without first giving the other Party (and the other Partys
external legal counsel) an opportunity to attend and participate in such
meeting, (iii) to the extent practicable, give the other Party reasonable
advance notice of all oral communications (other than scheduled telephone
calls, which are dealt with in (i) and (ii) above) with any Governmental
Authority relating to Relevant Matters and give the other Party (and its
external legal counsel) an opportunity to participate in such communications,
(iv) if any Governmental Authority initiates an oral communication relating to
Relevant Matters or to the extent it is not practicable to give the other
Party advance notice of any oral communication (other than
scheduled telephone calls, which are dealt with in (i) and (ii) above) in
accordance with (iii) above, promptly notify the other Party of the substance
of such communication, (v) provide the other Party (and its external legal
counsel) with a reasonable advance opportunity to review and comment upon and
consider in good faith all written communications (including any analyses,
presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals) to be
made or submitted by or on behalf of the other Party to any Governmental
Authority relating to Relevant Matters and (vi) promptly provide the other
Party with copies of all written communications to or from any Governmental
Authority relating to Relevant Matters;  _provided_ that each Party shall not
be obligated to disclose competitively sensitive material to the other Party
and may, as it deems advisable or necessary, withhold or redact such
competitively sensitive material, and such material shall only be provided on
an outside counsel basis. Each of Seller and Purchaser shall not, and shall
cause their respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates not to, (I) extend any
waiting period or agree to refile under the HSR Act or the EC
Merger Regulation (except with the prior written consent of the other Party,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed),
(II) enter into any agreement with

 



26  the FTC, the DOJ or the European Commission agreeing not to consummate the
transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreements (except with the prior
written consent of the other Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), or (III) otherwise willfully delay or
obstruct the procedures under the HSR Act or the EC Merger Regulation, or fail
to take any action necessary for obtaining clearance or approval from the
FTC, the DOJ or the European Commission (except with the prior written consent
of the other Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed).

 

(e) Each of Seller and Purchaser shall not take, or omit to take, any
action if such action or omission is reasonably likely to materially
interfere with or materially delay the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by the Transaction Agreements or the satisfaction of any
condition thereto.

 

(f) Each of Seller and Purchaser, and their respective Subsidiaries and
Affiliates, will coordinate and cooperate fully with each other in developing
information with respect to regulatory issues and providing such assistance as
the other Party may reasonably request in connection with regulatory reviews.
Each Party will consult and cooperate with the other Party and will consider
in good faith the views of the other Party in connection with any filing,
analysis, appearance, presentation, memorandum, brief, argument, opinion or
proposal made or submitted in connection with this Agreement.

 

SECTION 5.05. _Further Action_. From time to time after the Initial Closing,
Purchaser and Seller agree to execute and deliver, and to cause their
respective Subsidiaries to execute and deliver, at no further consideration,
such other documents, certificates, agreements and other writings and to take
such other actions as may be necessary or desirable in order to consummate or
implement expeditiously the transactions contemplated by the Transaction
Agreements, including, with respect to any Transferred Assets identified by
Seller after the Initial Closing Date, the delivery of all bills of sale,
assignments and other instruments of Transfer as may be required under
Applicable Law to Transfer to Purchaser or the relevant Purchasing Subsidiary
such Transferred Assets. To facilitate the efficient Transfer of the
Transferred Assets and Assumed Liabilities, Purchaser shall establish and
designate as Purchasing Subsidiaries entities organized within, or having
branch offices within, the same Covered Territory as the Selling Company that
holds, and Transfers to the applicable Purchasing Subsidiary,
such Transferred Assets and Assumed Liabilities.

SECTION 5.06. _Other Transaction Agreements_.

Equivalents_.

 

(a) The Parties recognize that the proceeds of certain Excluded A/R may be

Purchaser and Seller agree to cooperate, and to cause their respective
Subsidiaries to cooperate, in identifying and reporting to each other each of
the foregoing

 



28  occurrences during the 90-day period following the applicable Closing Date
(and for additional periods thereafter as may be reasonably requested by
either Party) and to take such actions as are necessary to ensure that (i)
the benefits relating to any Excluded A/R are received by Seller or a

with the intent of causing, or through negligence likely to cause, damage
to the business or reputation of Seller or the Customer Care Business, as

actions taken by a Representative of Seller.

 

SECTION 5.10. _Ordinary Conduct_.

 

(a) Except as otherwise contemplated or permitted by the Transaction

dispose of, or enter into any agreement to sell or dispose of, any of the
Transferred Assets (other than the sale or disposition of obsolete
Transferred Assets), (ii) take any affirmative action to terminate any
Transferred Contract (other than terminations as a result of breach or non-
performance by the counterparty to such contract;  _provided_ that prior to
taking any such affirmative action, Seller shall notify Purchaser of, and
consult

 



29  with Purchaser, regarding such termination), (iii) take any affirmative
action to waive or amend any material term of any Transferred Contract or (iv)
breach any term of a Transferred Contract that would give the counterparty to
such contract a right of termination, acceleration of terms or material
penalties due to such breach, except, in the case of each of clauses (i)
through (iv), for such actions in the ordinary course of business for the
Customer Care Business; _provided_ that any such actions in clauses (i)
through (iv) taken in the ordinary course of business that affect Excluded
Assets as well as the Customer Care Business are not permitted if such
actions are material and disproportionately detrimental to the Customer Care
Business. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchaser acknowledges and agrees
that Seller (A) shall cause each Transferred Subsidiary to distribute or
otherwise Transfer its cash and cash equivalents and other assets not
constituting Transferred Assets to Seller or an Affiliate of Seller, (B) may
Transfer any Transferred Asset to newly formed Subsidiaries of Seller to

pay or otherwise grant any material benefit (including any equity or equity-
based award) to, any Covered Employee, in each of clauses (i) and (ii), except
(A) to the extent required by Applicable Law, (B) as may be required under
the terms and conditions of any Seller Benefit Plan, Required Benefit Plan,
Seller Benefit Agreement, Required Benefit Agreement or Employee
Representative Agreement, as in effect on the date hereof, (C) as effected in
the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice (which, for the
avoidance of doubt, shall not include broad-based equity or equity-based
awards similar to the Centennial restricted stock unit grant in 2011), (D) as
expressly provided for in this Agreement or the Employee Matters Agreement,
(E) as would relate to a substantial number of similarly situated employees of
Seller or its Subsidiaries generally within the applicable Covered Territory
or (F) for which Seller or its Subsidiaries shall be solely liable and which
shall not affect in any way the obligations of Purchaser under this Agreement
or the Employee Matters Agreement or, following the applicable Closing Date,
result in any other obligations of Purchaser (whether legal, contractual or
otherwise) in addition to those Purchaser would otherwise have had but for
this clause (F).

of which is legally or contractually prohibited and (C) such portions of
documents or information which are subject to attorney-client privilege and

disrupt the normal operations of Seller or its Subsidiaries in any material
respect.

until the date that is five years after the Initial Closing, upon reasonable
notice and subject to Section 2.4 of Annex 1, (i) Purchaser shall provide to

shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to arrange face-to-face or

this Agreement by Seller or its Subsidiaries, and _provided further_ that
such Competitive Activities shall be performed solely for the benefit of
Purchaser or the Purchasing

 



32  Subsidiaries (other than with respect to contracts and arrangements that

acquisition (whether by merger or otherwise) and operation by Seller or any
of its Subsidiaries of a Person, or the entering into of a Joint Venture by

Subsidiaries shall not be restricted under this Section 5.15 from offering or

Seller or any of its Subsidiaries (other than the Transferred Subsidiaries),
on the other hand, shall be terminated and be of no further force or effect
and all obligations thereunder shall be satisfied and extinguished,

provide them with any information used in or relevant to the preparation of
the Initial Transferred Contract Adjustment Amount Statement that is
reasonably requested for purposes of Sellers preparation or Purchasers
review, as applicable, of the Initial Transferred Contract Adjustment Amount
Statement.

Amount Statement, Purchaser shall deliver to Seller, no later than 60 days
following receipt of the Initial Transferred Contract Adjustment Amount
Statement, a notice setting forth in reasonable detail such objections (a "
_Transferred Contract Adjustment Amount Objection Notice_ "), together with
reasonable supporting documentation. If Purchaser does not timely deliver a
Transferred Contract Adjustment Amount Objection Notice to Seller or if
Purchaser notifies Seller that it has no objections, the Initial Transferred
Contract Adjustment Amount Statement shall be final and binding on the Parties
for purposes of this Section 5.17 and shall be deemed the " _Final
Transferred Contract Adjustment Amount Statement_ ".

(c) If Purchaser timely delivers a Transferred Contract Adjustment Amount
Objection Notice to Seller, Purchaser and Seller shall attempt in good faith
to resolve such matters within 45 days after receipt of the same by Seller
(the " _Transferred Contract Adjustment Amount 45-Day Period_ "), and if
unable to do so, Purchaser and Seller shall refer all remaining disputes (the
" _Transferred Contract Adjustment Amount Disputed Items_ ") to an independent
public accounting firm mutually acceptable to Seller and Purchaser (the "
_Transferred Contract Adjustment Amount Dispute Accounting Firm_ ") within 30
days of the expiration of the Transferred Contract Adjustment Amount 45-Day
Period, which firm shall be instructed to arbitrate and resolve such disputes
within 45 Business Days of the referral. The Transferred Contract Adjustment
Amount Dispute Accounting Firm shall have authority hereunder to interpret
this Section 5.17 and other provisions of this Agreement only to the extent
necessary to resolve disputes under this Section 5.17. Purchaser and Seller
shall have the right to meet jointly but not separately with the Transferred

to present their respective positions. No ex parte communications with the
Transferred Contract Adjustment Amount Dispute Accounting Firm shall be
permitted. Each of Seller and Purchaser shall furnish or cause to be furnished
to the Transferred Contract Adjustment Amount Dispute Accounting Firm only
the data, correspondence and other materials it presented to or received from
the other Party

 



35  pursuant to this Section 5.17, and no other materials. The determination by
the Transferred Contract Adjustment Amount Dispute Accounting Firm for each
Transferred Contract Adjustment Amount Disputed Item shall be equal to one of
the values, or within the range between the values, assigned to such
Transferred Contract Adjustment Amount Disputed Item by the Parties as
presented by Seller in the Initial Transferred Contract Adjustment Amount
Statement delivered pursuant to Section 5.17(a) and by Purchaser in the
Transferred Contract Adjustment Amount Objection Notice delivered pursuant to
Section 5.17(b). The resolution of disputes by the Transferred Contract
Adjustment Amount Dispute Accounting Firm will be set forth in writing, will
be deemed an award in arbitration and will be final and binding upon the
Parties for purposes of this Section 5.17, upon the date of such resolution,
and such resolution shall be deemed the " _Final Transferred Contract
Adjustment Amount Statement_ ".

(d) Seller shall pay Purchaser the Transferred Contract Adjustment Amount,
if any, set forth on the Final Transferred Contract Adjustment Amount
Statement contemporaneously with payments made under Section 3.02(c);
_provided_ that such payments shall be paid no earlier than thirty (30) days
after the date on which the applicable Final Transferred Contract Adjustment
Amount Statement becomes final and binding upon the Parties as provided in
this Section 5.17. Such payment shall be paid by Seller in cash in U.S.
dollars.

(e) All payments made pursuant to Section 5.17(d) shall be treated as
an adjustment to the Cash Consideration for Tax purposes unless there is no
reasonable basis for doing so under the relevant Tax law.

 

SECTION 5.18. _Identification of Additional Transferred Assets_. Following the
date hereof and until the Final Subsequent Closing Date or, if the Final
Subsequent Closing Date does not occur on or prior to June 30, 2015, June 30,
2015 (the "Final Transfer Date"), Seller will use commercially reasonable
efforts to (i) identify additional tangible assets owned by the Selling
Companies and used in and necessary for the conduct of the Customer Care
Business as conducted on the date hereof and (ii) to the extent the usage of
any such assets by the Customer Care Business can be reallocated to
segregated assets not used by Sellers businesses (other than the Customer
Care Business) and such segregated assets may be separated and Transferred to
Purchaser, in each case, on a commercially reasonable basis, Transfer
such assets to Purchaser as a "Transferred Asset". Seller will consider in
good faith whether any assets identified by Purchaser prior to the Final
Transfer Date meet the criteria set forth in the foregoing sentence. To the
extent any such tangible assets identified prior to the Final Transfer Date
cannot be segregated, and Purchaser reasonably demonstrates it is unable to
replace the functionality of such identified assets with existing or acquired
resources, Seller shall take one of the following actions (as determined by
Seller in its sole discretion) with respect to each such tangible asset
identified prior to the Final Transfer Date: (i) provide Purchaser
functionality reasonably equivalent to such asset for an amount equal to
Sellers cost, for three (3) years from the Initial Closing Date or such
shorter period as is determined by Purchaser in its sole discretion or (ii)
provide Purchaser with existing or acquired asset or assets
with functionality reasonably equivalent to such asset.

 



36 ARTICLE VI _Representations and Warranties of Purchaser_

 

Except as set forth in the disclosure letter delivered by Purchaser to Seller
on the date hereof (collectively, the " _Purchaser Disclosure Letter_ ")
(with the disclosure in any section or subsection of the Purchaser Disclosure
Letter being deemed to qualify or apply to other sections and subsections of
this Article VI to the extent that it is reasonably apparent from the face of
such disclosure that such disclosure should qualify or apply to such other
sections and subsections), Purchaser hereby represents and warrants to Seller

respects as it is currently conducted, and to acquire and own those
Transferred Assets as are to be acquired by it, and to conduct such of the
Customer Care Business as is to be acquired by it, and each is duly qualified

Subsidiaries has all requisite corporate or similar power and authority to
execute and deliver each of the Transaction Agreements to which it is a party

as the case may be, and, assuming each of the Transaction Agreements is a
legal, valid and binding obligation of each of Seller or the
applicable Selling Subsidiaries, constitutes the legal, valid and binding
obligation of Purchaser or the applicable Purchasing Subsidiary, as the case
may be, enforceable against Purchaser or the applicable Purchasing Subsidiary,

the Transaction Agreements is a legal, valid and binding obligation of each of
Seller or the applicable Selling Subsidiaries, will constitute the legal,

Subsidiary, as the case may be, enforceable against Purchaser or the
applicable Purchasing Subsidiary, as the case may be, in accordance with its
terms.

sheet (including the notes thereto) of the Customer Care Business as of

Assumed Benefit Agreement.

violation of any Applicable Law with respect to any such Assumed Benefit Plan
or Assumed Benefit Agreement, except for any suit, action, dispute,

expiration of the applicable period, made a specific claim by delivering to
the party claimed to be providing the indemnification a notice of such claim
pursuant to Section 10.04 stating in reasonable detail the basis of such
claim.

SECTION 10.05. _Procedures Relating to Indemnification_.

(a) In order for a Purchaser Indemnified Party or a Seller Indemnified
Party (in each case, as applicable, the " _Indemnified Party_ ") to be
entitled to any indemnification pursuant to this Article X in respect of,
arising out of or involving a claim or demand made by any Person against the
Indemnified Party (a " _Third Party Claim_ "), such Indemnified Party must
notify the Person from which such Indemnified Party is claiming
indemnification (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") in writing of (and in
reasonable detail regarding) the Third Party Claim promptly, and in any event
within 10 Business Days, after receipt by such Indemnified Party of notice of
the Third Party Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that failure to give such
notification shall not affect the indemnification provided under this
Agreement except to the extent the Indemnifying Party shall have been actually
prejudiced as a result of such failure. Thereafter, the Indemnified Party
shall deliver to the Indemnifying Party promptly, and in any event within 10
Business Days, after the Indemnified Partys receipt thereof, copies of all
notices and documents (including court papers) received by the Indemnified
Party relating to the Third Party Claim.

 



58 (b) If a Third Party Claim is made against an Indemnified Party,
the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense
thereof and, if it so chooses, to assume and control the defense thereof with
counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party. Should the Indemnifying Party so
elect to assume the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party
shall not be liable to the Indemnified Party for legal expenses subsequently
incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with the defense thereof,
except as provided below. If the Indemnifying Party assumes such defense, the
Indemnified Party shall have the right to participate in the defense thereof
and to employ at its own expense counsel not reasonably objected to by the
Indemnifying Party separate from the counsel employed by the Indemnifying
Party, it being understood that the Indemnifying Party shall control such
defense and shall be empowered to make any settlement with respect to such
Third Party Claim, subject to the terms of this Section 10.05(b). The
Indemnifying Party shall be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of
counsel employed by the Indemnified Party for any period during which the
Indemnifying Party has not assumed the defense thereof. If the Indemnifying
Party chooses to defend or prosecute any Third Party Claim, all the Parties
hereto shall cooperate and shall cause their Affiliates to cooperate in the
defense or prosecution (or settlement) thereof. Such cooperation shall include
the retention and (upon the Indemnifying Partys request) the provision to
the Indemnifying Party of records and information that are reasonably relevant
to such Third Party Claim (subject to the Indemnifying Partys agreement to
appropriate confidentiality undertakings), and making employees available on
any basis reasonably requested by the Indemnifying Party to provide additional
information and explanation of any material provided hereunder or otherwise
relating to the Third Party Claim. Whether or not the Indemnifying Party
assumes the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall not
admit any liability with respect to, or settle, compromise or discharge, such
Third Party Claim without the Indemnifying Partys prior written consent
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld) unless the Indemnified
Party irrevocably waives its right to indemnification under this Article X
with respect to such Third Party Claim. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the
defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall agree to any
settlement, compromise or discharge of such Third Party Claim that the
Indemnifying Party may recommend and that by its terms (or pursuant to a
binding commitment of the Indemnifying Party) obligates the Indemnifying
Party to pay the full amount of the liability in connection with such Third
Party Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that such settlement, compromise or
discharge (i) requires only payment of monetary damages by the Indemnified
Party and (ii) provides for an unconditional release of the Indemnified Party
in respect of such Third Party Claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to assume the defense of any Third
Party Claim (and shall be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of
counsel incurred by the Indemnified Party in defending such Third Party Claim)
if: (x) the Third Party Claim seeks an order, injunction or other equitable
relief or relief for other than money damages against the Indemnified Party
that the Indemnified Party reasonably determines, after conferring with its
outside counsel, cannot be separated from any related claim for money damages;
(y) the Indemnifying Party is also a party to such Third Party Claim, and in
the

 



59  opinion of the Indemnified Partys outside counsel, a conflict exists
between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party (or there are
defenses available to the Indemnified Party that are unavailable to the
Indemnifying Party); or (z) the Indemnified Party is the only Person with
actual or potential liability with respect to the Third Party Claim and the
Indemnified Party irrevocably waives its right to indemnification under this
Article X with respect to such Third Party Claim. If such equitable relief or
other relief portion of the Third Party Claim can be so separated from that
for money damages, the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to assume the
defense of the portion relating to money damages.

(c) In the event any Indemnified Party should have an indemnification
claim against any Indemnifying Party under this Article X that does not
involve a Third Party Claim being asserted against or sought to be collected
from such Indemnified Party, the Indemnified Party shall deliver notice of
such claim with reasonable promptness to the Indemnifying Party. The failure
by any Indemnified Party to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve
the Indemnifying Party from any liability that it may have to such Indemnified
Party, except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party has been actually
prejudiced by such failure. If the Indemnifying Party disputes its liability
with respect to such claim, the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party

Parties.

 

SECTION 11.02. _Frustration of Closing Conditions_. Neither Purchaser nor

its obligations under Section 5.03 or 5.04.

fulfillment and shall not have been waived in writing by the other Party; or

 

(v) by either Purchaser or Seller upon written notice to the other Party if
the Initial Closing does not occur on or prior to June 30, 2014 (the "

clause (ii), (iii), (iv) or (v) is not then in breach in any material respect
of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained
in the Transaction Agreements.

 

(b) In the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to this Section
11.03, the transactions contemplated by each of the Transaction Agreements
shall be terminated, without further action by any Party, and each of
Purchaser and Seller shall immediately enter into, or cause its relevant
Affiliates to enter into, written consents to terminate each of the other
Transaction Agreements.

 



62 (c) Furthermore, in the event that this Agreement is terminated
as provided herein:

associated with the Master Transition Services Agreement if such termination
is a result of Purchasers breach of this Agreement.

associated with the Master Transition Services Agreement if this Agreement is

Agreement shall become void and of no further force and effect, except for the
provisions of (i) Sections 6.06 and 7.05 relating to brokers, (ii) this
Article XI and (iii) Article II of Annex 1. Nothing in this Section 11.03
shall be deemed to release either Party from any liability for any intentional
breach of any obligation hereunder or to impair the right of any Party to
compel specific performance by any other Party of its obligations under this
Agreement.

SECTION 11.04. _Bulk Sales_. Purchaser hereby waives, and shall cause each of
the Purchasing Subsidiaries to waive, compliance by the Selling Companies with

invalid, contrary to Applicable Law or inequitable for any reason;

(c) that each Party hereby waives any and all defenses it may have to such
an injunction or other equitable relief; and

(d) that the right of specific enforcement is an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and without that right, neither

ARTICLE II

 

 _Documentary Conventions and Related Matters_

 

SECTION 2.1. _Assignment; Successors._ None of the Transaction Agreements nor
any rights or obligations thereunder may be assigned or otherwise Transferred
by any party (including by operation of law) without the prior written consent
of the other parties thereto, and any assignment or Transfer without such
consent shall be null and void and of no effect. Subject to the
preceding sentence, the Transaction Agreements will be binding upon, inure to
the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the Parties and their respective
successors and permitted assigns.

 

SECTION 2.2. _No Third Party Beneficiaries._ Each Transaction Agreement is for
the sole benefit of the parties thereto and their permitted assigns, and
nothing therein expressed or implied shall give or be construed to give to any
Person, other than the parties thereto and such permitted assigns, any legal
or equitable rights thereunder, whether as third party beneficiaries or
otherwise, except as otherwise set forth in the indemnification provisions of
the Transaction Agreements to the extent that the indemnitee is not a party to
the Transaction Agreements. This Section 2.2 may only be amended or modified
by a writing signed by the applicable parties that (a) specifically cites
this Section 2.2 and (b) expressly provides that Section 2.2 is being amended
or modified by the operative provision in the applicable Transaction
Agreement. 

SECTION 2.3. _Costs._ Each Party shall be responsible for the costs and
expenses incurred by it in the negotiation, execution and delivery of the
Transaction Agreements and, except as otherwise provided elsewhere in such
agreements, the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby.
Purchaser shall pay any filing fee required under the HSR Act, the EC Merger
Regulation and all other antitrust, trade regulation, competition,
communications or other law or regulation applicable to the Transaction
Agreements or the transactions contemplated thereby.

 

SECTION 2.4. _Public Announcements; Confidentiality._ The Confidentiality
Agreement continues to apply, and the Transaction Agreements and the
transactions contemplated thereby are subject to and shall be kept
confidential under the

 



Annex 1-23  Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that if any of the
Transaction Agreements contain confidentiality provisions, then, to the extent
there is inconsistency between the Confidentiality Agreement and such
confidentiality provisions, the confidentiality provisions of such Transaction
Agreements shall supersede the inconsistent provisions of the Confidentiality
Agreement. For three months after the Initial Closing, all public
announcements relating to any Transaction Agreement or the transactions
contemplated thereby shall be made only after consultation between the
Parties, except for disclosures by either Party that in the opinion of counsel
for such Party are required by Applicable Law (or by the applicable rules of
any stock exchange on which the Party lists its securities). Notwithstanding
the foregoing, either Party shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to
make such disclosures as it may deem necessary or advisable to any
Governmental Authority.

SECTION 2.5. _Amendments._ No amendment to any Transaction Agreement shall be
effective unless it shall be in writing and signed by each party thereto, it
shall specifically reference this Section 2.5 and it shall expressly provide
that such Transaction Agreement is being amended.

 

SECTION 2.6. _Modification and Waivers._ No modification or waiver of any
provision of any of the Transaction Agreements and no consent by either Party
to any departure therefrom shall be effective unless in a writing referencing
the particular section of such Transaction Agreement to be modified or waived
and signed by a duly authorized signatory of each Party, and the same
will only then be effective for the period and on the conditions and for the
specific instances and purposes specified in such writing. No failure or delay
of any party in exercising any right or remedy under any Transaction Agreement
shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise
of any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to
enforce such right or power, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or
the exercise of any other right or power. Subject to Section 10.07 of the
Agreement, the rights and remedies of the parties under the Transaction
Agreements are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies
which they would otherwise have thereunder or at law or in equity.

SECTION 2.7. _Notices._ (a) All notices or other communications required
or permitted to be given under any Transaction Agreement shall, except as set
forth in Section 2.7(b), be in writing and shall be delivered by hand or sent
by facsimile or sent, postage prepaid, by registered, certified or express
mail or reputable overnight courier service, in each case, to the applicable
Person specified in such Transaction Agreement, and shall be deemed given when
so delivered by hand or facsimile, or if mailed, three days after mailing (one
Business Day in the case of express mail or overnight courier service).

(b) With respect to the Acquisition Agreements, each party may communicate
with the other by electronic means, and such communication is acceptable as a
signed writing to the extent permissible under Applicable Law. Each party
agrees that for all electronic communications, an identification code (called
a " _user ID_ ") contained in an electronic document is sufficient to verify
the senders identity and the documents authenticity. The Parties agree that
electronic communications cannot be used to amend, modify or waive any
Transaction Agreement.

 



Annex 1-24 SECTION 2.8. _Exhibits, Schedules, Annexes and Attachments; Interpretation._
The recitals and headings contained in the Transaction Agreements or in any
Exhibit, Schedule, Annex or Attachment thereto and in the table of contents to
any such Transaction Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not
affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of such Transaction
Agreement. All Exhibits, Schedules and Annexes attached to or referred to in
any Transaction Agreement are hereby incorporated in and made a part of such
Transaction Agreement as if set forth in full therein. Each capitalized term
used in any Schedule, Exhibit or Annex but not otherwise defined therein has
the meaning specified in the applicable Transaction Agreement or this Annex
1\. When a reference is made in any Transaction Agreement to a Section,
Subsection, Article, Exhibit, Schedule or Annex, such reference shall be to a
Section, Subsection or Article of, or an Exhibit, Schedule or Annex to, such
Transaction Agreement unless otherwise indicated. For all purposes under
the Transaction Agreements, (a) definitions of terms shall apply equally to
the singular and plural forms of the terms defined, (b) whenever the context
may require, any pronoun shall include the corresponding masculine, feminine
and neuter forms, (c) the terms "include", "includes" and "including" shall
be deemed followed by the words "without limitation", (d) the words "hereof",
"herein" and "hereunder" and words of similar import shall refer to the
applicable Transaction Agreement as a whole and not to any particular
provision of such Transaction Agreement and (e) the word "extent" in the
phrase "to the extent" shall mean the degree to which a subject or other
thing extends, and shall not simply mean "if". The symbol "$" shall mean
lawful money of the United States of America. Any reference to a closing date
or time set forth in any Transaction Agreement with respect to the Customer
Care Business or portion thereof shall be a reference to the local time at the
contemplated place of the closing. In the event of any conflict between the
Agreement and any other Transaction Agreement, the terms of the Agreement
shall control unless otherwise specified in the Agreement. If a conflict
exists between the terms of any Transaction Agreement and the terms included
in Article II of this Annex 1, the terms of this Annex 1 shall control,
unless the applicable Transaction Agreement specifically references this
Section 2.8 and expressly provides that the terms of such Transaction
Agreement shall control.

 

The Parties have participated jointly in the negotiating and drafting of each
Transaction Agreement. If an ambiguity or a question of intent or
interpretation arises, each Transaction Agreement shall be construed as if
drafted jointly by the parties thereto, and no presumption or burden of proof
shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of
any provisions of any Transaction Agreement. The Transaction Agreements are
in the English language only, which shall be controlling in all respects. No
translation, if any, of the Transaction Agreements into any other language
shall be of any force or effect in the interpretation of such Transaction
Agreement or in a determination of the intent of any party thereto.

SECTION 2.9.  _Counterparts._ Each Transaction Agreement may be executed in
one or more counterparts, all of which, when taken together, shall be

 



Annex 1-25  considered one and the same agreement, and shall become effective when one
or more such counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and
delivered to the other parties. Each party to a Transaction Agreement need
not sign the same counterpart. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a
signature page to a Transaction Agreement by facsimile or electronic
transmission shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart
of such Transaction Agreement. Once any Transaction Agreement is signed, any
reproduction of such Transaction Agreement made by reliable means (for
example, photocopy or facsimile) is considered an original, to the extent
permissible under Applicable Law, and all products and services referred to
therein are subject thereto.

SECTION 2.10. _Entire Agreement._ The Transaction Agreements, including the
Schedules, Exhibits, Annexes and Attachments thereto, together with the
Confidentiality Agreement, contain the entire agreement and understanding
between the parties thereto with respect to the subject matter thereof
and supersede all prior agreements and understandings relating to such
subject matter.

SECTION 2.11. _Severability._ If any provision of any Transaction Agreement
or the application of any such provision to any Person or circumstance shall
be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect by a court of
competent jurisdiction, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law,
such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other
provision thereof. Upon such determination that any term or other provision of
a Transaction Agreement is invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the parties to
such Transaction Agreement shall negotiate in good faith to modify such
Transaction Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as
closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that transactions
contemplated thereby are fulfilled to the extent possible.

SECTION 2.12. _Consent to Jurisdiction._ Unless otherwise specifically
provided in the applicable Transaction Agreement, each Transaction Agreement
has been delivered at and shall be deemed to have been made in the County of
Westchester, in the State of New York, and all matters arising from or
relating in any manner to the subject matter of any Transaction Agreement
shall be interpreted, and the rights and liabilities of the parties to a
Transaction Agreement determined, in accordance with the laws of the State of
New York applicable to agreements executed, delivered and performed within
such State, without regard to the principles of conflicts of laws thereof. As
part of the consideration for value received, unless otherwise specifically
provided in the applicable Transaction Agreement, each of the parties to a
Transaction Agreement hereby consents to the exclusive jurisdiction of any
state or Federal court located within the County of Westchester or New York in
the State of New York with respect to all matters arising from or relating in
any manner to the subject matter of a Transaction Agreement. Unless otherwise
specifically provided in the applicable Transaction Agreement, each party to a
Transaction Agreement further agrees that service of any process, summons,
notice or document by U.S. registered mail to such persons respective
address set forth in the applicable Transaction Agreement shall be effective
service of process for any action, suit or proceeding in New York with respect
to any matters to which it has submitted to jurisdiction as set forth in the
immediately preceding sentence. Unless otherwise specifically provided in the
applicable Transaction Agreement, each party to a

 



Annex 1-26  Transaction Agreement (x) irrevocably and unconditionally waives (and agrees
not to plead or claim) any objection (i) to the laying of venue of any action,
suit or proceeding arising out of the Transaction Agreements or the
transactions contemplated thereby in any state or Federal court located within
the County of Westchester or New York in the State of New York or (ii) that
any such action, suit or proceeding brought in any such court has been
brought in an inconvenient forum and (y) consents to the granting of such
legal or equitable relief as is deemed appropriate by any aforementioned court
in connection with such action, suit or proceeding.

 

SECTION 2.13. _GOVERNING LAW._ UNLESS OTHERWISE SPECIFIED THEREIN, EACH
TRANSACTION AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH,
THE INTERNAL LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK APPLICABLE TO AGREEMENTS MADE AND
TO BE PERFORMED ENTIRELY WITHIN SUCH STATE, WITHOUT REGARD TO THE PRINCIPLES
OF CONFLICTS OF LAWS THEREOF.

 

SECTION 2.14. _Waiver of Jury Trial._ Each party to a Transaction Agreement
hereby waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, any right
it may have to a trial by jury in respect of any litigation directly or
indirectly arising out of, under or in connection with any of the Transaction
Agreements. Each party to a Transaction Agreement (i) certifies that
no Representative of any other party has represented, expressly or otherwise,
that such other party would not, in the event of litigation, seek to enforce
the foregoing waiver and (ii) acknowledges that it and the other parties
thereto have been induced to enter into the Transaction Agreements by, among
other things, the mutual waivers and certifications in this Section 2.14.

 

SECTION 2.15. _Dispute Resolution._ Except for (i) a dispute related to claims
subject to an indemnification claim pursuant to the applicable Transaction
Agreement, (ii) a dispute with respect to the determination of the Final Net
Tangible Asset Amount, the Audit Adjustment Amount, any Final PandL Amount or
the Transferred Contract Adjustment Amount, which shall be conducted in
accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 2.05, 2.06, 5.02 or 5.17,
as applicable, or (iii) as otherwise provided in this Section 2.15, neither
party to a Transaction Agreement shall resort to legal remedies or commence
any formal proceedings to resolve a dispute under such Transaction Agreement
until the parties have attempted to resolve the dispute through the escalation
process described in this Section 2.15. The party raising a dispute
shall submit to the other party a written notice and supporting material
describing all issues and circumstances related to the dispute (a " _Dispute
Notice_ "). The designated primary representative of each party (as specified
in such Transaction Agreement) shall together attempt to resolve the dispute.
If the parties primary representatives fail to resolve the dispute within 30
days from receipt of a Dispute Notice, a Corporate Vice President (or higher-
level officer) of each party shall attempt to resolve it. If the Corporate
Vice Presidents (or higher-level officers) of the parties are unable to
resolve the dispute within 60 days from receipt of the Dispute Notice, either
party may commence formal legal proceedings to resolve the dispute. This
Section 2.15 shall not be construed to prevent a party from instituting formal
proceedings earlier than indicated in this Section 2.15 to: (A) avoid the
expiration of any applicable statute of limitations period, (B) preserve a
superior creditor position, or (C) seek injunctive relief to prevent an
irreparable harm.

 



Annex 1-27 SECTION 2.16. _Mutual Responsibilities._ The Parties agree that with respect
to each Operating Agreement, except as otherwise specified therein:

(a) the relationship created by any Operating Agreement is not a partnership
(and accordingly, for example, no party thereto is responsible for debts
incurred by the other as a partner), and, except as set forth in any Operating
Agreement, no party thereto is an employee or franchisee of the other, nor
does any Operating Agreement create a joint venture or any fiduciary
relationships or responsibilities between any such parties, and all such
parties are independent contractors;

 

(b) each party thereto will comply with all Applicable Law (such as those
governing consumer transactions and exports);

 

(c) no party thereto will assume or create any obligations on behalf of any
other party thereto or make any representations or warranties about any other
party thereto;

(d) each party thereto will allow a breaching party a reasonable opportunity
to remedy any breach under any such Operating Agreement before pursuing any
available remedy; and

(e) no party thereto will bring a legal action against any other party for
claims under any Operating Agreement more than two years after the later of
the date the cause of action arose or the date the party first knew or should
have known of the facts giving rise to the cause of action, unless otherwise
provided by Applicable Law without the possibility of contractual waiver.
