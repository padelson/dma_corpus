SECTION  1.03. _Purchase Price  Adjustment_. (a) In order to calculate the
Initial  Payment, not later than two business days prior to the Closing Date,
Seller  Parent will prepare and deliver to Purchaser (i) an estimated
unaudited  consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of the close of
business on  the  business day immediately preceding the Closing Date,
prepared in accordance  with  United States generally accepted accounting
principles (" _GAAP_ "), applied  in all respects consistently with the
audited balance sheet of the Company  as at  February 3, 2007 (the "
_Estimated Closing Statement_ "), and (ii) a  certificate signed on behalf of
Seller Parent by an authorized officer of  Seller  Parent certifying that
the balance sheet set forth in the Estimated Closing  Statement was prepared
on the basis described in clause (i) above and  setting forth (A) the
estimated amount of the Net Working  Capital derived from the Estimated
Closing Statement (the " _Estimated Closing  Net Working Capital_ "), (B) an
estimate of the Actual Capital  Expenditures (the " _Estimated Actual Capital
Expenditures_ "), and  (C) the amount of the Initial Payment. " _Net
Working  Capital_ " shall mean the excess of (a) the consolidated Current
Assets  of the Company as of the close of business on the business day
immediately  preceding the Closing Date, _over_ (b) the consolidated
Current  Liabilities of the Company as of such date. " _Current Assets_
" means all categories of current assets set forth as line items on  the
Estimated  Closing Statement, as determined in accordance with Section
1.03(a) of the  Company Disclosure Letter, specifically including all cash
and cash equivalents  and excluding fair market value of derivatives and
intercompany/affiliate  balances and deferred tax assets. " _Current
Liabilities_ " means  all

categories  of current liabilities set forth as line items on the Estimated
Closing  Statement, as determined in accordance with Section 1.03(a) of the
Company  Disclosure Letter, specifically excluding all debt, fair market
value of  derivatives, accrued interest, intercompany/affiliate payables and
accrued  income Taxes. " _Actual Capital Expenditures_ " shall mean the
gross  capital expenditures (excluding all tenant allowances or similar
lease  incentives which offset gross capital expenditures) paid in cash from
May  6,  2007 through the close of business on the last business day
immediately prior  to  the Closing Date. " _Target Capital Expenditures_ "
shall mean the gross  capital expenditures (excluding all tenant allowances
or similar lease  incentives which offset gross capital expenditures), the
payment of which  is  provided for in the Company's capital expenditure plan
set forth in Section  1.03(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter (the " _CapEx
Plan_ "), from May 6,  2007 through the fiscal month ending immediately prior
to the Closing Date  _plus_ an amount equal to (A) the amount of the gross
capital expenditures  (excluding all tenant allowances or similar lease
incentives which offset  gross  capital expenditures), the payment of which
is provided for in the CapEx  Plan,  for the fiscal month in which the
Closing Date occurs _multiplied_ by (B)  the number of days elapsed in the
fiscal month up through and including the  last  business day immediately
prior to the Closing Date _divided_ by (C) the  number of days in such fiscal
month. Set forth on Section 1.03(a) of  the Company Disclosure Letter is an
example showing how the Initial Payment  would be adjusted and Final
Adjustment would be calculated based on certain  stated assumptions relating
to the capital expenditure adjustment described  below. Such assumptions are
provided solely for the purpose of  illustrating these calculations.

 

 

(b) The  Initial Payment shall be an amount equal to the Base Purchase Price
adjusted  as  follows:

 

 

(i) if  the Estimated Closing Net Working Capital is less than $108,000,000
(the  " _Target Net Working Capital_ "), an amount equal to the excess of
the  Target Net Working Capital over the Estimated Closing Net Working
Capital  shall  be deducted in calculating the Initial Payment;

 

 

(ii) if  the Target Net Working Capital is less than the Estimated Closing
Net Working  Capital, an amount equal to the excess of the Estimated Closing
Net Working  Capital over the Target Net Working Capital shall be added in
calculating  the  Initial Payment;

 

 

(iii) if  the Estimated Actual Capital Expenditures are less than Target
Capital  Expenditures, an amount equal to the excess of the Target Capital
Expenditures  over the Estimated Actual Capital Expenditures shall be
deducted in calculating  the Initial Payment; and

 

 

(iv) if  the Target Capital Expenditures are less than the Estimated Actual
Capital  Expenditures, an amount equal to the excess of the Estimated Actual
Capital  Expenditures over the Target Capital Expenditures shall be added in
calculating  the Initial Payment;

 

 

_provided_   that if after giving effect to the  adjustments in clauses (i)
through (iv) above, the Initial Payment would  exceed  $840,000,000, then
such excess amount (the " _Excess  Amount_ ")  shall be payable if and to
the extent required by Section 1.04 and the Initial  Payment shall be equal
to $840,000,000.

(c) (i) Within  45 days after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall prepare and
deliver to  Seller Parent a consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of
the close  of  business on the business day immediately preceding the
Closing Date prepared  in  accordance with GAAP, applied in all respects
consistently with the audited  balance sheet of the Company as at February 3,
2007 (the " _Final Closing  Statement_ ").

 

 

 

(ii) When  Purchaser delivers the Final Closing Statement, Purchaser shall
also deliver  to  Seller Parent a certificate signed on behalf of Purchaser
by an authorized  officer of Purchaser, certifying that the balance sheet set
forth in the  Final  Closing Statement was prepared on the basis described
in Section 1.03(c)(i)  above and setting forth Purchaser's calculations,
based on the Final Closing  Statement (" _Purchaser 's Proposed
Calculations_"), of (A) the amount  of Net Working Capital (the " _Final
Closing Net Working Capital_ "),  (B) the amount of the Actual Capital
Expenditures (the " _Final Actual  Capital Expenditures_ ") and (C) the
amount of the Final  Adjustment.

 

 

(d) During  the 30-day period following receipt by Seller Parent of the Final
Closing  Statement, Seller Parent, any of its directors or officers,
Employees or  any  investment banker, financial advisor, attorney,
accountant, lender, agent  or  other representative (collectively, "
_Representatives_ ") retained by it or  any of its Subsidiaries shall be
permitted to review information of Purchaser  and its Representatives
relating to the Final Closing Statement. The  Final Closing Statement shall
become final and binding upon the parties on  the  30th day following
delivery thereof, unless Seller Parent gives written notice  of its
disagreement with the Final Closing Statement or with the accuracy  of any 
of Purchaser's Proposed Calculations (the " _Notice of Disagreement_ ") to 
Purchaser prior to such date, which shall specify the nature of any
disagreement  so asserted. If a Notice of Disagreement is given by Seller
Parent in  a timely manner, then the Final Closing Statement (as revised in
accordance  with  this sentence) shall become final and binding upon Seller
Parent and Purchaser  on the earlier of (i) the date Seller Parent and
Purchaser resolve in  writing any differences they have with respect to the
matters specified in  the  Notice of Disagreement and (ii) the date any
disputed matters specified in  the Notice of Disagreement are finally
resolved in writing by a nationally  recognized independent public accounting
firm as shall be agreed upon by  the  parties hereto in writing, which shall
not be Purchaser's or Seller Parent's or  any of their respective Affiliates'
independent accountants, and which the  parties currently expect will be
Deloitte and Touche (the " _Accounting Firm_ "). During the 15-day period
following the  delivery of a Notice of Disagreement, Seller Parent and
Purchaser shall seek  in  good faith to resolve in writing any differences
that they may have with  respect  to the matters specified in the Notice of
Disagreement. If, at the  end of such 15-day period, Seller Parent and
Purchaser are unable to so resolve  any such differences, Seller Parent and
Purchaser shall submit to the Accounting  Firm for resolution any and all
matters that remain in dispute and that were  included in the Notice of
Disagreement. The Accounting Firm, acting  as experts and not as arbitrators,
shall be instructed to render its  determination of all matters submitted to
it within 15 days following  submission. Purchaser and Seller Parent agree
that they shall be  bound by the determination of the Accounting Firm.
Judgment may be  entered upon the determination of the Accounting Firm in any
court having  jurisdiction over the party against which such determination is
to be  enforced. The Accounting Firm shall not be authorized or permitted
to  make any determination as to the accuracy of Section 2.07 or any other 
representation or warranty in this Agreement or as to compliance by the
Company,  Seller Parent or Seller with any of their covenants in this
Agreement (other  than in Sections 1.03 and 1.04). Any determinations by
the  Accounting Firm, and any work or analyses performed by the Accounting
Firm,  in  connection with its resolution of any dispute under Sections 1.03
and 1.04  shall not be admissible in evidence in any suit, action or
proceeding between  the parties, other than to the extent necessary to
enforce payment obligations  under Section 1.04. The fees and expenses of the
Accounting Firm  incurred pursuant to this Section 1.03 shall be borne 50% by
Seller Parent  and 50% by Purchaser. The fees and disbursements of Seller
Parent's  advisors incurred in connection with the Final Closing Statement
and any  Notice  of Disagreement shall be borne by Seller Parent, and the
fees and expenses  of  Purchaser's advisors incurred in connection with the
Final Closing Statement and  any Notice of Disagreement shall be borne by
Purchaser.

account of  all such  payments) and, if there was an Excess Amount pursuant
to Section 1.03(b),  such  net payment shall be subject to the following
adjustments:

licensing necessary, other than in such jurisdictions  where the failure to
be so qualified or licensed individually or in the  aggregate has not had and

purposes of this Agreement, " _Material Adverse  Effect_ " shall mean any
state of facts, circumstance, event, change,  development, effect or
occurrence (any such item, an " _Effect_ ") (i) that  is materially adverse

financial condition of the Company and its Subsidiaries  taken as a whole or
(ii) that impairs in any material respect the ability  of  either Selling
Party or the Company to perform its obligations under this  Agreement or
prevents or materially impedes, interferes with, hinders or  delays  the
consummation of the Acquisition or any of the other transactions 
contemplated hereby, except, in the case of clause (i) above, for any  Effect
to the extent such Effect results from or is attributable to (A) any  change
in conditions in the United States, foreign or global economy or  capital 
or financial markets generally, including any change in interest or exchange 
rates, (B) any change in conditions (including any change in general legal, 
regulatory, political, economic or business conditions or any change in 
GAAP)  in, or otherwise generally affecting, the industry in which the
Company  and its  Subsidiaries conduct business, (C) the negotiation,
execution, announcement  or pendency of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby,  including any impact thereof on relationships,
contractual or otherwise,  with  any customers, suppliers, distributors,

pending or declared), (E) any  action taken by the Company or any of its

 

 

Subsidiaries  with the written consent of either of the Purchasing Parties or
(F) any  failure by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to meet
projections (it  being  understood that, without limiting the applicability
of the provisions contained  in clause (A) or (B) above, the cause or causes
of any such failure  may be deemed either alone or in combination with other
events to constitute  a  Material Adverse Effect and may be taken into
account in determining whether  a  Material Adverse Effect has occurred);
except in the case of clause (A),  (B) or (D), to the extent such Effect has
a disproportionate effect on the  Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, when compared to other companies  operating in the same industry in
which the Company and its Subsidiaries  conduct  business; it being
understood and agreed that for purposes of  Section 2.04(b), the definition
of the term "Material Adverse Effect" shall  not include the exception set
forth in the preceding  clause (C). The Company has made available to the
Purchasing  Parties true and complete copies of the certificate of

profit sharing, deferred  compensation, incentive compensation, stock
ownership, stock purchase,  stock  option, phantom stock or other equity-

obligated  to  contribute or under which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries has any  Liability (including a Liability arising out of an

respect to any current or former  Employee, officer or director of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries  or any  beneficiary or dependent
thereof, other than Multiemployer Plans and CBAs  (the " _Company  Plans_
"). None of the Company Plans provides for post-employment  life or health
insurance benefits or coverage for any participant or any  beneficiary of a

any intent or commitment to create or implement any additional employee 
benefit  plan or to amend, modify or terminate any Company Plan. Each
Company  Plan that is an employee welfare benefit plan may by its terms be
amended  or  terminated on and after the Closing Date without the incurrence
of any  material  cost or Liability by the Company or its Subsidiaries (it
being understood  that  the obligations of Purchaser pursuant to Section

maintained or  contributed to by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or
to which the  Company or any of its Subsidiaries is obligated to contribute
or has any  Liability (a " _Multiemployer Plan_ "). For purposes of this 
Agreement, the term "Multiemployer Plan" shall be deemed to include the
Barneys  Retail/Employees Union Health Fund. Neither the Company nor any of 
its Subsidiaries has (i) incurred, or is reasonably likely to incur,
a "complete withdrawal" or a "partial withdrawal" (as such terms are defined
in  Sections 4203 and 4205, respectively, of ERISA) with respect to any 
Multiemployer Plan or (ii) received any notice, as of the date of this 
Agreement, or otherwise reasonably expects that any Multiemployer Plan  is
or  will be "insolvent" or in "reorganization" (within the meaning of 
Sections 4241 and 4245, respectively, of ERISA). The Company has  provided
the Purchasing Parties with the most recent estimates requested  by the 
Company (it being understood that no such estimates were requested by the 
Company in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated 
hereby) of the potential withdrawal liability to which the Company or any 
Subsidiary would be subject if the Company or any Subsidiary were to
withdraw  from each Multiemployer Plan.

the Code  or (y) any "multiple employer plan" within the meaning of 
Sections 4063/4064 of ERISA or Section 413(c) of the Code or  (ii) has
incurred or, to the Knowledge of the Selling Parties, is  reasonably likely
to incur, any Liability pursuant to Section 412 of the  Code or Title I or
Title IV of ERISA (other than Liability for premiums to  the  Pension
Benefit Guaranty Corporation arising in the ordinary course of  business).
Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has, in  the past five years,
engaged in any transaction described in Section 4069  or 4212(c) of ERISA
that would reasonably be expected to result in the  incurrence of a Liability
by the Company or its Subsidiaries on or after  the  Closing.

(f) Each  Company Plan has been maintained in all material respects in
accordance  with its  terms and in compliance in all material respects with
all provisions of  ERISA,  the Code (including in each case rules and
regulations thereunder) and  other  applicable Laws with respect to such
Company Plan. Other than routine  claims for benefits, there is no pending
or, to the Knowledge of the Selling  Parties, threatened material audit or
material Proceeding relating to any  Company Plan. With respect to each
Company Plan for which financial statements  are required by ERISA, to the
Knowledge of the Selling Parties, there has  been  no material adverse
change in the financial status of such Company Plan  since  the date of the
most recent such statements provided to the Purchasing  Parties  by the
Company. To the Knowledge of the Selling Parties, no "prohibited
transaction," breach of fiduciary duty or similar action or omission  has
resulted in or is reasonably likely to result in the imposition of  any 
material Liability, Tax or penalty on the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries,  or  in any requirement for the posting of security with
respect to a Company  Plan or  imposition of any Lien on the assets of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries  with respect to a Company Plan, under
ERISA, the Code or other applicable  Law.

 

 

(g) Each  Company Plan that is intended to qualify under Section 401 of the
Code has  been given a favorable determination letter from the IRS with
respect to  such  qualification, and, to the Knowledge of the Selling
Parties, nothing has  occurred with respect to the operation of the Company
Plans that has caused  or  is reasonably likely to cause the loss of such
qualification or exemption  or the  imposition of any material Liability,
penalty or Tax under ERISA or the  Code.

 

 

(h) Except  for failures to make contributions that individually or in the
aggregate  would  not reasonably be expected to result in material Liability
to the Company  or any  of its Subsidiaries, all contributions (including
all employer contributions  and  employee salary reduction contributions)
required to have been made by  the  Company or its Subsidiaries under any of
the Company Plans (or in the case  of  any Multiemployer Plan, the
applicable CBA or other governing Contract)  or by  Law to any funds or
trusts established under a Company Plan or Multiemployer  Plan or in
connection therewith have been made by the due date thereof  (including any
valid extensions) and any payments not yet due have been  accurately
reflected in the consolidated balance sheet included in the  Financial 
Statements.

 

 

 

(i) Neither  the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the
consummation of the  Acquisition or any other transaction contemplated by
this Agreement will  (i) entitle any Employee or any director or independent
contractor of the  Company or any of its Subsidiaries to, or increase any,
severance, change  in  control, termination or other compensation or
benefits; (ii) increase the  amount or value of any benefit or compensation
otherwise payable or required  to  be provided to any such Employee,
director or independent contractor;  (iii) accelerate the time of payment or
vesting or trigger any payment or  funding (through a grantor trust or
otherwise) of any such compensation or  benefits under, or trigger any other
material obligation pursuant to any  Company  Plan; or (iv) result in any
amount failing to be deductible by reason of  Section 280G of the Code.

from  alternative sources in an amount sufficient to consummate the
transactions  contemplated by this Agreement on terms and conditions that are
not materially  less beneficial to the Purchasing Parties than those
contained in the Financing  Commitments as in effect on the date of this
Agreement as determined in the  reasonable good faith judgment of the
Purchasing Parties and consistent with  the  Financing Modification
Requirements (any such alternative financing actually  obtained by the
Purchasing Parties, " _Alternative Financing_ ") as promptly  as practicable
following the occurrence of such event but no later than the  last  day of
the Marketing Period. Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit  the
Purchasing Parties from entering into agreements relating to the Financing 
or the operation of the Purchasing Parties, including adding other equity 
providers or operating partners, subject in each case to the Financing 
Modification Requirements. The Purchasing Parties shall have the  right to

with such Debt Financing shall be updated as reasonably requested  to 
ensure that the Required Information does not contain any untrue statement

forth  in  Section 7.01 and Section 7.02 to fail to be satisfied, assuming
the  Closing were to be scheduled for any time during such 30 consecutive 
calendar day period, and (ii) at the end of which the conditions set forth

documents related to the Debt Financing as Seller Parent reasonably
requests;  _provided_ that the Purchasing Parties may redact in such
documents the fee  amounts payable to their financing sources under the

Purchasing  Parties' or their Affiliates' existing business or operations).

 

 

SECTION  5.07. _Public Announcements_. The  Purchasing Parties and Seller
Parent shall consult with each other before  issuing, and give each other the
opportunity to review and comment upon,  any  press release or other public
statements with respect to this Agreement,  the  Acquisition and the other

SECTION  5.08. _Employee  Matters_. (a) During the period beginning on the 
Closing Date and ending on December 31, 2008, Employees who continue their 
employment with Purchaser or its Affiliates (including the Company after 
the  Closing Date) after the Closing Date (" _Affected Employees_ ") shall
receive  compensation and employee benefits that are no less favorable in the
aggregate  than the compensation and benefits such Affected Employees
received immediately  prior to the Closing, other than equity-based
compensation. Without  limiting the foregoing, during the period beginning on
the Closing Date  and  ending on December 31, 2008, Purchaser shall, or
shall cause the Company  to,  maintain the Company Severance Plans or a
severance plan or plans of Purchaser  providing substantially the same
benefits to Affected Employees as would  have  been provided to such
Affected Employees under the Company Severance Plans  in  which they
participated immediately prior to the Closing (or, to the extent  that 
Affected Employees participated in the Jones Severance Plan immediately 
prior to  the Closing, a severance plan or plans of Purchaser providing
substantially  the  same benefits payable under substantially the same
circumstances to Affected  Employees as would have been provided to such
Affected Employees under  the Jones  Severance Plan), and shall not amend or
permit the amendment of any such  plans  in a manner that is adverse to any
Affected Employee.

(b) From  and after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall, or shall cause its
Affiliates  (including the Company after the Closing) to, (i) honor, in
accordance with  their terms, all Company Plans, all existing Contracts with
Company or its  Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any Affected Employee, on
the other hand,  and  all obligations, including any rights or benefits
arising as a result of  the  Acquisition (either alone or in combination
with any other event), other  than  with respect to equity-based
compensation, (ii) recognize all the Affected  Employees' accrued and unused
vacation and other paid time-off benefits  consistent with the terms of the
vacation or similar policies of the Company  and  any of its Subsidiaries as
in effect immediately prior to the Closing,  (iii) pay all annual bonuses
that are payable to Affected Employees under  the annual bonus plans
applicable to the Affected Employees, including the  annual bonus plans as in
effect as of immediately prior to the Closing, with  respect to the fiscal
year in which the Closing occurs, including bonuses  accrued before the
Closing Date under such annual bonus plans to the extent  that  such
accruals are accurately reflected in the Final Closing Statement and  (iv)
with respect to any Affected Employee whose employment with Purchaser  or its
Affiliates is terminated by the Company without cause prior to the  payment
of the annual bonuses in clause (iii), pay such Affected Employees  a pro
rated target bonus under such annual bonus plans, such pro ration to  be 
based on the number of days that have elapsed prior to such termination in 
the  fiscal year in which the Closing occurs ( _provided_ that with respect
to  each Affected Employee such payment shall be offset by any duplicative
benefit  in the nature of bonus pay provided to such Affected Employee by the
Company  pursuant to any severance plan, employment agreement or other
arrangement  then  in effect and _provided_ , _further_ that the foregoing
is intended to  apply solely with respect to duplicative payments in the
nature of bonus  pay and  that nothing in this sentence is intended or shall
be construed or applied  to  restrict Purchaser's obligation to provide or
cause to be provided, as the case  may be, both (x) severance benefits that
are not in the nature of bonus pay  and (y) pro rated target bonuses, as
required pursuant to  Section 5.08(a) and this Section 5.08(b),
respectively).

 

 

(c) For  purposes of each employee benefit plan of Purchaser or its
Affiliates in  which  any Affected Employee is eligible to participate after
the Closing, including  for purposes of eligibility, vesting and benefit
levels and accruals, Purchaser  shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to,
treat the service of such Affected  Employee with the Company and any of its
Subsidiaries (or any predecessor  employer) prior to the Closing as service
with Purchaser and its  Affiliates. Purchaser shall, or shall cause its
Affiliates to, waive  any pre-existing condition exclusions, evidence of
insurability provisions,  waiting period requirements or any similar
provision under any of the welfare  plans maintained by Purchaser or any of
its  

Affiliates  in which Affected Employees participate following the Closing
Date to the  extent  such limitations and restrictions were waived or
satisfied under the applicable  Company Plan immediately prior to the Closing
Date. In addition,  Affected Employees shall receive credit for any co-
payments, deductibles  and  annual out-of-pocket expenses incurred under the
welfare plans of the Company  or  any of its Affiliates during the calendar
year in which the Closing Date  occurs,  but prior to the Closing Date, for
purposes of the corresponding co-payments,  deductibles and annual out-of-
pocket expenses under welfare plans of Purchaser  or any of its Affiliates
for the calendar year in which the Closing Date  occurs.

(d) The  Purchasing Parties agree that any agreement they have entered into
or may  enter  into prior to Closing with any director, officer or Employee
of the Company  or  its Subsidiaries or the Creative Director of the Company
will not become  effective until the Closing.

 

 

 

(e) The  Company shall promptly notify the Purchasing Parties of any entry
into,  termination of, adoption of, material amendment of or material
increase of  the  benefits under the Multiemployer Plans referenced in

SECTION  5.09. _Letters of Credit and Hedging  Contracts_. (a) Section 5.09
of the Company  Disclosure Letter contains a complete and accurate list of
all letters of  credit  and hedging contracts to which the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries is  a party  as of the date of this Agreement, which shall
be updated in writing by Seller  Parent prior to Closing. On or before the
Closing Date, Purchaser  shall, or shall cause a Subsidiary of Purchaser to,
provide the Selling Parties  with a stand-by letter of credit issued by a
bank reasonably acceptable to  the  Selling Parties against any loss,
payment or reimbursement obligation arising  from any outstanding letter of
credit issued for the benefit of the Company  or a  Subsidiary of the
Company or any foreign exchange hedging contract of the  Company or its
Subsidiaries that is guaranteed by Seller Parent or its  Subsidiaries (other
than the Company and its Subsidiaries). The  Purchasing Parties shall
indemnify the Selling Parties and their Subsidiaries  against all claims and
Liabilities arising under any such letter of credit  or  hedging contract
from and after the Closing Date.

 

 

(b) For  so long as Purchaser is in compliance with its obligations under 
Section 5.09(a), each Selling Party shall, and shall cause their respective 
Affiliates to, maintain in full force and effect and perform its obligations 
under each letter of credit that is issued for the benefit of the Company  or
a  Subsidiary of the Company and each guarantee by Seller Parent or its
Affiliate  of a foreign exchange hedging contract of the Company or its
Subsidiary  following the Closing until such letter of credit or hedging
contract expires  or  is terminated by (i) such Selling Party at the request
of Purchaser or  (ii) the counterparty thereto. At the time of Closing,
Seller  Parent and its Subsidiaries (other than the Company and its
Subsidiaries)  may  remove the Company and its Subsidiaries from its letter
of credit facility  and  terminate any arrangements to provide credit
support to the Company and its  Subsidiaries under any letters of credit or
guarantees and the Company and  its  Subsidiaries will cooperate in
terminating such credit  support. Following the Closing, Seller Parent and
its Subsidiaries  shall no longer provide any credit support to the Company,
other than any  outstanding letters of credit and hedging arrangements
required to be maintained  pursuant to this Section 5.09(b) (so long as the
Purchasing Parties are in  compliance with their obligations under Section
5.09(a)).

 

 

 

SECTION  5.10. _Release of Lease  Guarantees_. On or before the Closing
Date, (i) Purchaser  shall use reasonable best efforts to arrange, at its
sole cost and expense,  for replacement arrangements, effective as of the
Closing Date, for all  lease  guarantees provided by the Selling Parties or
any of their Subsidiaries  (other  than the Company and its Subsidiaries)
for the benefit of the Company or  any of  its Subsidiaries with respect to
any Leased Property, which guarantees  are  listed in Section 5.10 of the
Company Disclosure Letter, including such  reasonable and customary
replacement guarantees or letters of credit, as  the  applicable landlord
shall require and (ii) Purchaser shall use reasonable  best efforts to obtain
releases from the applicable landlords indicating  that  the Selling Parties
and their Subsidiaries shall have no Liability with  respect  to such lease
guarantee effective as of the Closing Date, in each case  reasonably
satisfactory to the Selling Parties. The Purchasing  Parties shall indemnify
the Selling Parties and their Subsidiaries against  all  claims,
Liabilities, damages, Liens, judgments, and expenses arising out  of, 
involving, or in connection with any such lease guarantee from and after 
the  Closing Date.

SECTION  5.11. _Further Assurances_. From  time to time, as and when
requested by any party, each party shall execute  and  deliver, or cause to
be executed and delivered, all such documents and  instruments and shall
take, or cause to be taken, all such further or other  actions (subject to
Section 5.06), as such other party may reasonably deem  necessary or
desirable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this  Agreement,
including, in the case of the Selling Parties, executing and  delivering to
the Purchasing Parties such assignments, deeds, bills of sale,  consents and
other instruments as the Purchasing Parties or their counsel  may 
reasonably request as necessary or desirable for such purpose.

 

 

SECTION  5.12. _Intercompany  Arrangements_. The Selling Parties and the
Purchasing Parties  acknowledge and agree that, as of the Closing, any
contract, lease, license,  commitment, account or arrangement (other than
those entered pursuant to  the  terms of this Agreement) between the Company
or its Subsidiaries, on the  one  hand, and the Selling Parties or any of
their Subsidiaries (exclusive of  the  Company and its Subsidiaries as of
the Closing), on the other hand, shall  be  terminated and be of no further
force or effect, notwithstanding any terms  thereof to the contrary, other
than accounts payable relating to purchases  by  the Company or its
Subsidiaries of goods for resale from Seller Parent or  its  Subsidiaries
pursuant to agreements or arrangements disclosed in Section  5.12 of  the
Company Disclosure Letter, to the extent reflected (along with the related 
inventory) in determining Net Working Capital. The Selling Parties  and their
Affiliates shall retain, satisfy, terminate and/or convert to equity  all
pre-Closing intercompany payables, receivables, obligations, Contracts  or 
other Liabilities, other than accounts payable relating to purchases by the 
Company or its Subsidiaries of goods for resale from Seller Parent or its 
Subsidiaries.

 

 

SECTION  5.13. _No  Solicitation_. (a) The parties hereto shall not, and 
shall cause their Subsidiaries (including, in the case of the Selling
Parties,  the Company) and their respective Representatives and Subsidiaries
not to  (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage any inquiries or the
making of  any offer or proposal regarding any Alternative Transaction or
(ii) enter  into, continue or participate in any discussions or negotiations
regarding,  or  furnish to any person any nonpublic information relating to
the Company in  connection with, or otherwise cooperate with a person or
group making any  offer  or proposal regarding any Alternative Transaction
or (iii) execute or enter  into any letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding, agreement in principle,  merger agreement, acquisition
agreement, option agreement, joint venture  agreement, partnership agreement
or other similar Contract constituting,  providing for or related to any
Alternative Transaction other than, in the  case  of the Selling Parties, in
connection with the termination of this Agreement  as  provided for in
Section 8.01(g).

 

 

 

(b) Notwithstanding  the provisions of Section 5.13(a), in response to a bona
fide inquiry,  proposal or offer relating to any Alternative Transaction
received after  the  date of this Agreement and prior to July 22, 2007 (the
" _Initial Window  Termination Date_ "), and such bona fide inquiry, proposal
or offer was  unsolicited after the date of this Agreement, the Selling
Parties may furnish  information relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries

substantially in the form of, and with  terms no less favorable to the
Selling Parties than, the Confidentiality  Agreement, (ii) the Selling
Parties and their Subsidiaries have theretofore  complied with this Section

determines in good faith (after consultation with  its  outside financial

proposal or offer constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to  a 
Superior Transaction and (iv) the Selling Parties have provided the 
Purchasing Parties with prior written notice (any such notice, a "
_Potential  Superior Transaction Notice_ ") (A) that any information is
requested or  any discussions or negotiations are sought to be initiated
relating to an  Alternative Transaction, (B) of the identity of the Potential
Acquirer and  any other terms of such request, inquiry or Alternative
Transaction (which  notice shall include any written materials containing

to, a Potential  Acquirer, the Selling Parties will keep the Purchasing
Parties advised on  a  substantially current basis of any material
developments with respect  thereto.

 

 

(d) The  Selling Parties shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates
and their  respective Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be
terminated  any  existing activities, discussions, or negotiations with any
persons other  than  the Purchasing Parties and their Affiliates conducted

liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction directly  or  indirectly

determined in its good faith judgment (after consultation with its outside

from  a financial point of view than this Agreement and (iii) which the Board
of  Directors of Seller Parent has determined in good faith (after
consultation  with  its outside financial advisor and outside counsel) is
reasonably capable  of  being consummated.

(i) Notwithstanding  anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in no event
shall the Selling  Parties be required to close the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement  prior to the Initial Window Termination Date (or, if a
Potential Superior  Transaction Notice or Parent Acquisition Transaction
Notice has been given  to  Buyer in accordance with Section 5.13(b) or (h),

_Tax  Matters_

 

 

SECTION  6.01. _Tax  Indemnification_. (a) Seller Parent and Seller shall
be  jointly and severally responsible for and shall pay, and shall jointly 
and  severally indemnify and hold the Purchasing Parties, the Company and
their  respective Subsidiaries (each a " _Tax Indemnitee_ ") harmless from,
any and  all Taxes levied or imposed on the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries in  respect  of its income, business, property or operations or
for which the Company  or any  of its Subsidiaries may otherwise be liable
(i) that are allocated to  Seller Parent and Seller pursuant to Section 6.02;
(ii) for which the  Company or any of its Subsidiaries may otherwise be
liable as a result  of being  included in a consolidated group of which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries  was a member prior to the Closing Date
pursuant to Treasury Regulations  Section 1.1502-6 or any analogous provision
of state, local or foreign Tax  Law; (iii) that arise from or relate to the
breach by the Selling Parties  of Section 2.15(k); or (iv) that are
attributable to the failure to  pay any real estate transfer taxes in any
period prior to the Closing Date  or to  any breach of Section 5.01(b)(iii).

(b) Amounts  payable pursuant to this Section 6.01 shall be determined so as
to hold the  Tax Indemnitee harmless on an after-tax basis. For this purpose,
any tax  benefits shall be computed based on the amount of any benefit
actually realized;  _provided_ , _however_ , that if a Tax benefit
attributable to an amount  paid pursuant to this Section 6.01 is actually
realized after the payment  date of such amount paid, the party realizing
such Tax benefit shall promptly  pay it to the other party.

 

 

(c) Any  indemnity payment required to be made by Seller Parent or Seller
pursuant  to  this Article VI shall be paid to the Purchasing Parties no
later than five  business days prior to the date on which Tax with respect to
such item would  be  due.

 

 

SECTION  6.02. _Apportionment of  Taxes_. (a) In order to apportion
appropriately any  Taxes relating to a period that includes the Closing Date,
Seller Parent,  Seller  and Purchaser shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, elect with  the  relevant Taxing authority to treat for all
purposes the Closing Date as the  last  day of a taxable period of the
Company, and such period shall be treated  as a  period ending prior to or
on the Closing Date for purposes of this  Agreement.

 

 

(b) Seller  Parent and Seller shall be liable for any Pre-Closing Period 
Taxes. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Pre-Closing Period  Taxes_ " means,
except to the extent reflected in the determination of Net  Working Capital:

 

 

(i) with  respect to Taxes imposed upon the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries with  respect to taxable periods ending prior to or on the
Closing Date, all Taxes  due  for such taxable period (regardless of whether
such Taxes are due and payable  at  Closing); and

 

 

(ii) with  respect to Taxes imposed upon the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries with  respect to taxable periods beginning before and ending
after the Closing  Date  (each, a " _Straddle Period_ "), the portion of any
such Taxes that is  allocable to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on
the Closing Date  (such  Taxes, the " _Pre-Closing Straddle Taxes_ "),
determined in accordance with  the following:

 

 

 

(A) In  the case of Taxes that are either (1) based upon or related to
income,  receipts or shareholders' equity or (2) imposed in connection with
any  sale, transfer or assignment or any deemed sale, transfer or
assignment  of  property (real or personal, tangible or intangible),
including any transaction  contemplated by this Agreement (regardless of
whether such transaction  occurs  before or after the Closing Date) or
undertaken to implement this Agreement,  Pre-Closing Period Straddle Taxes
shall be deemed equal to the amount that  would  be payable if the Tax year
ended on the Closing Date. For purposes of  this clause (A), any exemption,
deduction, credit or other item that is  calculated on an annual basis shall
be allocated to the portion of the  Straddle  Period ending on the Closing
Date on a _pro rata_ basis determined by  multiplying the entire amount of
such item allocated to the Straddle Period  by a  fraction, the numerator of
which is the number of calendar days in the  portion  of the Straddle Period
ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of  which  is the number of
calendar days in the entire Straddle Period.

(B) In  the case of Taxes (other than those described in clause (A) above)
imposed  on a periodic basis with respect to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries  or  otherwise measured by the level of any item, Pre-Closing
Straddle Taxes shall  be  deemed to equal (1) the aggregate amount of such
Taxes for the entire  Straddle Period (or, in the case of Taxes determined on
an arrears basis,  the  amount of such Taxes for the immediately preceding
Tax period) _multiplied  by_ (2) a fraction, the numerator of which is the
number of calendar  days in the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the
Closing Date and  the  denominator of which is the number of calendar days
in the entire Straddle  Period.

 

 

SECTION  6.03. _Tax  Returns_. (a) (i) Seller Parent and Seller shall  be
responsible for the timely filing (taking into account any extensions 
received from the relevant tax authorities) of all Tax Returns required by 
Law  (A) to be filed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries on or prior
to  the Closing Date, or (B) to include the Company and its Subsidiaries in
a  consolidated, combined or unitary Tax Return filed by Seller Parent,
Seller  or  any Affiliate (other than any Tax Indemnitee) with respect to
any taxable  period  ending prior to or including the Closing Date; (ii)
such Tax Returns shall  be  true, correct and complete in all material
respects; and (iii) to the extent  any  Taxes indicated as due and payable
on such Tax Returns constitute Pre-Closing  Period Taxes or are the
responsibility of the Seller Parent and Seller pursuant  to this Agreement,
such Taxes shall be paid or will be paid by the Seller  Parent  and Seller
as and when required by Law. Unless a different treatment  of any item is
required by an intervening change in applicable Law, (x) such  Tax  Returns
shall be prepared on a basis consistent with those prepared for prior 
taxable periods on the Closing Date and (y) no Tax Returns with respect to 
pre-Closing period Taxes shall be amended if such amendment could adversely 
affect the Purchasing Parties or the Company or any of their respective 
Subsidiaries in any taxable period ending after the Closing  Date.

 

 

(b) The  Company, or, where applicable, its Subsidiaries, shall be
responsible for  the  timely filing (taking into account any extensions
received from the relevant  tax  authorities) of Tax Returns which are
required by Law to be filed by any  the  Company or its Subsidiaries after
the Closing Date.

 

 

 

SECTION  6.04. _Survival_. All obligations and  representations under this
Article VI and Section 2.15(k) shall  survive the Closing hereunder and
continue until 30 days following the  expiration of the statute of
limitations, including any applicable extensions  or  waivers thereof, on
assessment of the relevant Tax.

 

 

SECTION  6.05. _Contest_. (a) For  purposes of this Agreement, a " _Contest_
" is any audit, Proceeding or other  dispute with respect to any Tax matter
that affects the Company or any  of its  Subsidiaries. Unless Purchaser has
previously received written notice  from Seller Parent of the existence of
such Contest, Purchaser shall promptly  give written notice to Seller Parent
of the existence of any Contest relating  to  a Tax matter that is or may be
Seller Parent's, Seller's or their Affiliate's  full or shared responsibility
under this Agreement, but no failure to give  such  notice shall relieve
Seller Parent, Seller or such Affiliate of any Liability  hereunder except to
the extent, if any, that the rights of Seller Parent,  Seller  or such
Affiliate with respect to such claim are actually  prejudiced. Unless Seller
Parent has previously received written  notice from Purchaser of the
existence of such Contest, Seller Parent shall  promptly give written notice
to Purchaser of the existence of any  Contest.

(b) Purchaser,  on the one hand, Seller Parent on the other, agrees, in each
case at no cost  to  the other party, to cooperate with the other and the
other's representatives in  a prompt and timely manner in connection with any
Contest. Such  cooperation shall include, but not be limited to, making
available to the  other  party, during normal business hours, all books,
records, returns, documents,  files, other information (including, without
limitation, working papers and  schedules), officers or employees (without
substantial interruption of  employment) or other relevant information
necessary or useful in connection  with  any Contest requiring any such
books, records and files.

 

 

(c) In  the case of any Contest relating to a Tax matter arising in a period

Purchasing Parties  of  their obligation to effect the Closing (including
consummating the Acquisition  and paying the Closing Date Amount) and (ii)

Purchasing Parties shall pay to Seller Parent,  within five business days

(d) The  parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this Section
8.05 are  an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and that,  without these agreements, neither party would have entered into
this  Agreement. Accordingly, in the event Purchaser shall fail to pay the 
Purchaser Termination Fee when due or Seller Parent shall fail to pay the 
Seller  Parent Termination Fee when due, and in order to obtain such payment,
Seller  Parent or Purchaser, as the case may be, commences a Proceeding which
results  in  a judgment or similar award against the other party for such

SECTION  8.06. _Maximum  Recovery_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary

specific performance in Section 10.09. None of  the Purchasing Parties or any
of their respective former, current and future  direct or indirect equity
holders, controlling persons, stockholders, directors,  officers, employees,

assignees shall have any further Liability or obligation relating  to  or
arising out of the Acquisition, this Agreement, any Related Document or 
the  other transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, except as expressly
provided  herein, including the right to specific performance in Section 
10.09. Notwithstanding the foregoing, following the Closing the

monetary damages and the foregoing limitations on damages shall not  apply.
Each party hereto hereby agrees and acknowledges that it  specifically
intends that the other parties hereto will have the right to  specifically

indemnification  hereunder).

 

 

SECTION  9.04. _Notice of Claim;  Defense_. (a) If (i) any third party
institutes or  asserts any Proceeding that may give rise to Losses for which
a person (an  " _Indemnifying Party_ ") may be liable for indemnification
under  Article VI or this Article IX (a " _Third Party Claim_ ") or  (ii)
any person entitled to indemnification under this Agreement (an "
_Indemnified Party_ ") shall have a claim to be indemnified by an 
Indemnifying Party that does not involve a Third Party Claim (a " _Direct 
Claim_ "), then, in case of clause (i) or (ii), the Indemnified Party shall 
promptly send to the Indemnifying Party a written notice specifying the
nature  of such claim and, to the extent then known, the amount of all
related  Liabilities (a " _Claim Notice_ "). In the event an Indemnified 
Party fails to provide a timely and adequate Claim Notice, the Indemnifying 
Party shall be relieved of its indemnification obligations under Article VI 
or this Article IX as a result of such failure, only to the extent that it 
is prejudiced by such failure.

 

 

(b) In  the event of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party may elect to
retain  counsel of its choice, reasonably acceptable to the relevant
Indemnified  Parties, to represent such Indemnified Parties in connection
with such  Proceeding and shall pay the fees, charges and disbursements of
such counsel  and  other defense costs. The Indemnified Parties may
participate, at  their own expense and through legal counsel of their choice,
in any such  Proceeding; _provided_ that (i) the Indemnifying Party shall
have the  right to defend such Third Party Claim by all appropriate
proceedings and,  so  long as it diligently pursues such defense, shall have
full control of such  defense and such proceedings, and (ii) the Indemnified
Parties and their  counsel shall cooperate with the Indemnifying Party and
its counsel in  connection with such Proceeding. The Indemnifying Party shall
not  settle any such Proceeding without the relevant Indemnified Parties'
prior  written consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed),
unless  the terms of such settlement contain a complete and unconditional
release  of the  Indemnified Party of any Liability related to such
Proceeding.

(c) Notwithstanding  the foregoing, if (i) the Indemnifying Party elects not
to assume control  of such defense, (ii) both the Indemnifying Party and any
Indemnified Party  are parties to or subjects of such Proceeding and
conflicts of interests  exist  between the Indemnifying Party and such
Indemnified Party, or (iii) the  Proceeding is reasonably likely to establish
a precedential custom or practice  that is materially detrimental to the
continuing business interests of the  Indemnified Party, then the Indemnified
Parties may retain counsel reasonably  acceptable to the Indemnifying Party
in connection with such Proceeding and  assume control of the defense in
connection with such Proceeding and the  fees,  charges and disbursements of
no more than one such counsel per jurisdiction  selected by the Indemnified
Parties shall be reimbursed by the Indemnifying  Party. Under no
circumstances will the Indemnifying Party have any  Liability in connection
with any settlement of any Proceeding that is entered  into without its prior
written consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld  or delayed).

 

 

(d) From  and after the delivery of a Claim Notice, at the reasonable request
of the  Indemnifying Party, each Indemnified Party shall grant the
Indemnifying Party  and its counsel, experts and representatives reasonable
access, during normal  business hours, to the books, records, personnel and
properties of the  Indemnified Party to the extent reasonably related to the
Claim Notice at  no  cost to the Indemnifying Party (other than for
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses  of the Indemnified Parties).

 

 

(e) If  there is a Proceeding at any time that concerns the business or
operations  of  the Company and its Subsidiaries before the Closing Date and
a Claim Notice  is  not submitted with respect to such Proceeding, then, at
the reasonable request  of any of the Purchasing Parties, on the one hand, or
any of the Selling  Parties  or the Company, on the other hand, Seller
Parent and Seller shall make those  persons who at the relevant times were
employees of the Selling Parties and  the  Company and its Subsidiaries, or
Purchaser shall make those persons who at  the  relevant times were
Employees, as the case may be, available to cooperate  with  the requesting
party and its Affiliates (including by making such employees  available to
provide information, discovery and testimony), to the extent  reasonable and
without interrupting the business or operations of the party  receiving such
request and of its Affiliates, in each case solely for purposes  of
permitting the preparation for, defense of and participation in such 
litigation or Proceeding by any of the requesting party, its Affiliates or 
their  respective agents, directors, officers and employees; _provided_ that
the  requesting party shall reimburse all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses
incurred  by the party receiving such request, its Affiliates and their
respective  agents,  directors, officers and employees in complying with
this undertaking and,  since  such payments, if any, will not be made
pursuant to an indemnity claim, such  payments shall not be taken into
account for purposes of the limitations  set  forth in Section 9.02(b) or
9.03(b).

 

 

 

SECTION  9.05. _Potential Contributors_. If an  Indemnified Party receives
any payment from an Indemnifying Party in respect  of  Losses and the
Indemnified Party could have recovered all or a part of  such  Losses from a
third party (including any insurer) based on the underlying  claim  or
demand asserted against such Indemnifying Party, then such Indemnified 
Party  shall transfer such of its rights to proceed against such third party
as  are  necessary to permit such Indemnifying Party to recover from such
third  party the  amount of such payment.

SECTION  9.06. _Mitigation_. Any Indemnified  Party and Indemnifying Party
shall cooperate with respect to mitigating and  resolving any claims or
liability with respect to which an Indemnifying Party  is  obligated to
indemnify an Indemnified Party hereunder, including by using  reasonable best
efforts to mitigate or resolve any such claim or  liability.

 

 

SECTION  9.07. _Survival of Indemnity_. Any  matter as to which a Claim
Notice has been submitted in the manner provided  by  Section 9.04 within
the applicable survival period specified in  Section 9.01 that is pending or
unresolved at the end of such applicable  survival period shall continue to
be covered by this Article IX,  notwithstanding the expiration of the
applicable survival period specified  in  Section 9.01 until such matter is
finally terminated or otherwise resolved  under this Agreement or by an
arbitral tribunal or court of competent  jurisdiction and any amounts payable
hereunder are finally determined and  paid.

 

 

SECTION  9.08. _No Duplication; Exclusive  Remedy_. (a) From and after the
Closing, any Liability  for indemnification hereunder shall be determined
without duplication of  recovery by reason of the state of facts giving rise
to such Liability  constituting a breach of more than one representation,
warranty, covenant  or  agreement.

 

 

(b) Except  as provided in Section 1.03, Article VI or Article IX, from and 
after the Closing, the exclusive remedy of the Parties in connection with 
this  Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be as provided
in  Article VI or this Article IX; _provided_ , that this exclusive  remedy
for damages does not preclude a party from bringing an action  (i) for fraud,
(ii) pursuant to Section 1.03 or (iii) for  specific performance, injunctive
relief or any other equitable remedy to  require  any other party to perform
its obligations under this Agreement.

Purchasing Parties may transfer any of their  respective rights or
obligations to any Affiliate of the Purchasing Parties  and  (b) the
Purchasing Parties may make a collateral assignment of any proceeds 
receivable by them under this Agreement to any of their lenders, but no 
assignment pursuant to clauses (a) or (b) of this proviso shall relieve the 
Purchasing Parties of their obligations hereunder. For the avoidance  of
doubt, no lender shall be entitled to make a claim under this Agreement  or 
enforce any provision of this Agreement as a result of an assignment of
proceeds  pursuant to clause (b) of the foregoing sentence. Subject to the 
preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the
benefit  of, and be enforceable by, the parties and their respective
successors and  assigns.

 

 

SECTION  10.08. _Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury  Trial_. (a) The Purchasing
Parties irrevocably submit, and the  Selling Parties and the Company
irrevocably submit, to the exclusive  jurisdiction of the Chancery Court of
the State of Delaware, for the purposes  of  any suit, action or other
Proceeding arising out of this Agreement or any  transaction contemplated
hereby (and each agrees that no such action, suit  or  Proceeding relating
to this Agreement shall be brought by it or any of its  Affiliates except in
such court). The Purchasing Parties further  agree, and the Selling Parties
and the Company further agree, that service  of  any process, summons,
notice or document by U.S. registered mail to such  person's respective
address set forth above (as modified as set forth above)  shall be effective
service of process for any action, suit or Proceeding  in  Delaware with
respect to any matters to which it has submitted to jurisdiction  as set
forth above in the immediately preceding sentence. The  Purchasing Parties
irrevocably and unconditionally waive (and agree not to  plead  or claim),
and the Selling Parties and the Company irrevocably and  unconditionally
waive (and agree not to plead or claim), any objection to  the  laying of
venue of any action, suit or Proceeding arising out of this Agreement  or the
transactions contemplated hereby in the Chancery Court of the State  of 
Delaware or that any such action, suit or Proceeding brought in any such 
court  has been brought in an inconvenient forum. This Section 10.08(a) 
shall not apply to any dispute under Section 1.03 that is required to be 
decided by the Accounting Firm.

EXTENT  PERMITTED  BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY AND ALL RIGHTS IT MAY HAVE TO
TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY  CLAIM,  SUIT, ACTION OR OTHER PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF,  UNDER OR  RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY
HERETO HEREBY  (I) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY
OTHER PARTY  HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH PARTY WOULD
NOT, IN  THE EVENT  OF ANY CLAIM, ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING, SEEK TO
ENFORCE THE FOREGOING  WAIVER  AND (II) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER
PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN  INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT, BY, AMONG
OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL  WAIVER  AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 10.08.

 

 

SECTION  10.09. _Specific Performance_. The  parties agree that irreparable
damage would occur in the event that any  of the  provisions of this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with their  specific terms or were
otherwise breached and therefore that, prior to  the  termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Article VIII, (a) the  Purchasing Parties shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to  prevent  breaches of and to
enforce specifically the performance of the terms hereof,  in  addition to
any other remedy they may have at law or in equity and

(b) the  Selling Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to
prevent  breaches of and to enforce specifically the Purchasing Parties'
performance of  their obligations (x) under Sections 5.04, 5.06 and 5.13
hereof and  (y) hereunder to consummate the Acquisition if, in the case of
this  clause (y), the conditions set forth in Sections 7.01 and 7.02 hereof 
shall be satisfied or waived by the Purchasing Parties (other than those 
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing Date, 
which  shall be capable of being satisfied on the Closing Date) and the
Financing  Commitments or any Alternative Financing are available to be drawn
down by  the  Purchasing Parties pursuant to the terms of the applicable
agreements but  are  not so drawn down solely as a result of the Purchasing
Parties refusing to  do so  in breach of this Agreement, in each case in
addition to any other remedy  they  may have at law or in equity.
Notwithstanding the first sentence of  this Section 10.09, the parties
acknowledge that the Selling Parties shall  not have the right to
specifically enforce the provisions of this Agreement  except to the extent
set forth in clause (b) of the preceding  sentence. For the avoidance of
doubt, whether or not a party is  entitled to seek injunctions or specific

SECTION  10.11. _Severability_. If any term  or other provision of this
Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of  being  enforced by any rule
