Assets and whether existing on the Closing Date or arising thereafter,
including on the basis of any Law imposing successor or transferee liability
or otherwise by operation of Law or by Contract, other than the Assumed

(d) all Liabilities, including any Legal Proceedings, relating to any

2.5 _Cure Amounts_. At the Closing and pursuant to Section 365 of the
Bankruptcy Code, Sellers will assume the Purchased Contracts (to the extent
not previously assumed) and, subject to the terms herein, assign the Purchased
Contracts to Purchaser, and Purchaser, subject to the terms herein, will
assume the Purchased Contracts. All Cure Costs with respect to the Purchased
Contracts (the " _Assumed Cure Costs_ ") will be paid by Purchaser (to the
extent not paid by Sellers prior to Closing), as and when finally determined
by the Bankruptcy Court or as agreed between the Purchaser and the non-debtor
counterparty to the Purchased Contract, pursuant to the procedures set forth
in the Approval Order, and not by Sellers, and Sellers will have no liability
for any Assumed Cure Costs. Sellers agree that they will, as promptly as
practicable, take such actions as are reasonably necessary to obtain an Order
of the Bankruptcy Court providing for the assumption and assignment of the
Purchased Contracts. Sellers will serve on all non-Seller counterparties to
all Contracts set forth on _Schedule 5.6(a)_ a notice stating that Sellers
are or may (as applicable) be seeking the assumption and assignment of such
Contracts and the proposed Cure Costs amount for each Contract, and will
notify such non-Seller counterparties of the deadline for objecting to the
Cure Costs relating to such Contracts, if any,

 



     

 

 



 

which deadline will be not less than three Business Days prior to the sale
hearing date designated in the Bidding Procedures Order.

 



 

2.6 _Non-Assignment of Assets_.

 



 

(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
this Agreement will not constitute an agreement to assign or transfer and will
not effect the assignment or transfer of any Purchased Asset (including any
Purchased Contract) if (i) (A) prohibited by applicable Law, (B) an attempted
assignment or transfer thereof would reasonably likely to subject Purchaser,
its Affiliates or any of its or their respective Representatives to civil or
criminal Liability or (C) an attempted assignment or transfer thereof, without
the approval, authorization or consent of, or granting or issuance of any
license or permit by, any Person (including, without limitation, expiration or
early termination of the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act), would
constitute a breach, default or violation thereof or of any Law or Order (each
such action, a " _Necessary Consent_ "), or in any way adversely affect the
rights of Purchaser thereunder or (ii) the Bankruptcy Court has not entered an
Order (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Approval Order) approving
such assignment or transfer. In such event, such assignment or transfer is
subject to such Necessary Consent being obtained and Sellers and Purchaser
will use their respective reasonable best efforts to obtain the Necessary
Consents with respect to any such Purchased Asset (including any Purchased
Contract) or any claim or right or any benefit arising thereunder for the
assignment or transfer thereof to Purchaser as Purchaser may reasonably
request; _provided_ , _however_ , that Sellers will not be obligated to pay
any consideration therefor to any third party from whom consent or approval is
requested or to initiate any litigation or Legal Proceedings to obtain any
such consent or approval. If such Necessary Consent is not obtained, or if an
attempted assignment or transfer thereof would give rise to any of the
circumstances described in clauses (i) or (ii) of the first sentence of this
_Section 2.6(a)_, be ineffective or would adversely affect the rights of
Purchaser to such Purchased Asset following the Closing, (x) Sellers and
Purchaser will, and will cause their respective Affiliates to, (1) use
reasonable best efforts (including cooperating with one another to obtain such
Necessary Consents, to the extent feasible) as may be necessary so that
Purchaser would obtain the benefits and assume the obligations thereunder in
accordance with this Agreement, (2) complete any such assignments or transfers
as soon as reasonably practicable, and (3) upon receipt of any applicable
Necessary Consents, to transfer or assign the applicable Purchased Asset to
Purchaser, and (y) Sellers will, and will cause their respective Affiliates
to, cooperate with Purchaser in good faith without further consideration in
any arrangement reasonably acceptable to Purchaser and Sellers intended to
provide Purchaser with the benefit of any such Purchased Assets.

 



 

(b) Subject to _Section 2.6(a)_, if after the Closing (i) Purchaser or its
designee holds any Excluded Assets or Excluded Liabilities or (ii) any Seller
holds any Purchased Assets or Assumed Liabilities, Purchaser or the applicable
Seller will promptly transfer (or cause to be transferred) such assets or
assume (or cause to be assumed) such Liabilities to or from (as the case may
be) the other Party. Prior to any such transfer, the Party receiving or
possessing any such asset will hold it in trust for such other Party. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event that any Seller
receives any payment from a third party after the Closing Date pursuant to any
of the Purchased Contracts (or with respect to the operation by Purchaser of
the Acquired Business or any Purchased Asset during the post-Closing period)
and to the extent

 



     

 

 



 

such payment is not in respect of an Excluded Asset or a Excluded Liability,
Sellers will forward such payment, as promptly as practicable but in any event
within 30 days after such receipt, to Purchaser and notify such third party to
remit all future payments (in each case, to the extent such payment is in
respect of any post-Closing period with respect to the Acquired Business and
is not in respect of an Excluded Asset or an Excluded Liability) pursuant to
the Purchased Contracts to Purchaser. Similarly, in the event that Purchaser
receives any payment from a third party after the Closing on account of, or in
connection with, any Excluded Asset, Purchaser will forward such payment, as
promptly as practicable but in any event within 30 days after such receipt, to
Sellers and notify such third party to remit all future payments on account of
or in connection with the Excluded Assets to Sellers.

 



 

(c) _Excluding or Adding Purchased Contracts_. Purchaser will have the
exclusive right to notify Sellers in writing of (i) any Purchased Contract
that it does not wish to assume, or (ii) any Contract to which any Seller is a
party and that is (A) related to the license or use by a third party, or
rights of any third party with respect to, the Purchased Intellectual
Property, or (B) related primarily to the Acquired Business (and in each case
has not been rejected by any Seller) that Purchaser wishes to add as an
Purchased Contract, in each case, up to three Business Days prior to the
Closing. Any such previously considered Purchased Contracts that Purchaser no
longer wishes to assume will be automatically deemed to be removed from the
Schedules related to Purchased Contracts and automatically deemed not to be
Purchased Contracts, in each case, without any adjustment to the Purchase
Price, and to be an Excluded Asset, and any such previously considered
Contracts that Purchaser wishes to assume as Purchased Contracts will be
automatically deemed to be, and to be added to the Schedules related to,
Purchased Contracts, and assumed by Sellers to sell and assign to Purchaser,
without any adjustment to the Purchase Price. If any Contract that may be
assigned by a Seller to Purchaser pursuant to Sections 363 and 365 of the
Bankruptcy Code is added to the list of Purchased Contracts in accordance with
this _Section 2.6(c)_, then the applicable Seller will take such steps as are
reasonably necessary to cause such Contract to be assumed and assigned to
Purchaser as promptly as possible at or following the Closing, subject to
provision by Purchaser of adequate assurance as may be required under Section
365 of the Bankruptcy Code and payment by Purchaser of the Assumed Cure Costs
in respect of such Purchased Contracts, pursuant to and in accordance with
Section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code and the Approval Order. Sellers will not
reject or seek to reject any Contract that is a Purchased Contract without the
consent of Purchaser.

 



 

2.7 _Further Conveyances and Assumptions_. From time to time following the
Closing, Sellers and Purchaser will, and will cause their respective
Affiliates to, execute, acknowledge and deliver all such further conveyances,
notices, assumptions, assignments, releases and other instruments, and will
take such further actions, as may be reasonably necessary or appropriate to
assure fully to Purchaser and its respective successors or assigns, all of the
properties, rights, titles, interests, estates, remedies, powers and
privileges intended to be conveyed to Purchaser under this Agreement and to
assure fully to each Seller and its Affiliates and their respective successors
and assigns, the assumption of the liabilities and obligations assumed by
Purchaser under this Agreement, and to otherwise make effective the
Transactions; _provided_ , that nothing in this _Section 2.7_ will require
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates to assume any Liabilities other than the
Assumed Liabilities.

 



     

 

 



 

 **III.** **CONSIDERATION; ADJUSTMENT**

 



 

3.1 _Consideration_. The aggregate consideration for the Purchased Assets (the
" _Purchase Price_ "), as adjusted pursuant to and in accordance with _Section
3.4_, will be: (a) $95,000,000 in cash (the " _Cash Amount_ "); _plus_ (b) the
assumption of the Assumed Liabilities.

 



 

3.2 _Purchase Price Deposit_. Sellers and Purchaser will negotiate and execute
the form of Escrow Agreement within five Business Days following the Effective
Date. On the first Business Day after opening of the Escrow Account, Purchaser
will deposit a sum of $9,500,000 (the " _Deposit Amount_ ") into the Escrow
Account, which will be held in the Escrow Account and will be either delivered
to Purchaser or paid to the Company as follows: (a) if the Closing occurs, the
Deposit Amount, less the Adjustment Escrow Amount, will be applied towards the
Cash Amount payable by Purchaser pursuant to _Section 3.3_, (b) if this
Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to _Section 4.4(d)_, then the
Deposit Amount will promptly be released to the Company (and such Deposit
Amount will be deemed fully earned by the Company as compensation and
consideration for entering into this Agreement), or (c) if this Agreement is
terminated for any reason other than by Sellers pursuant to _Section 4.4(d)_,
then the Deposit Amount will promptly be released to Purchaser.

 



 

3.3 _Pre-Closing Statement; Payment of Purchase Price_.

 



 

(a) The Company will prepare and deliver to Purchaser not less than five
Business Days prior to the Closing Date a statement (the " _Closing Statement_
") setting forth the Companys good faith estimate of Net Working Capital ("
_Estimated Net Working Capital_ "), which will be calculated in accordance
with and using the methodologies set forth on _Schedule 1_. Sellers agree to
provide reasonable access to accounting records, systems and personnel and
Purchaser agrees to coordinate with Sellers to minimize disruptions to the
operations.

 



 

(b) At the Closing, (i) Purchaser will pay to Sellers, in immediately
available funds to the account or accounts designated by the Company, (A) the
Cash Amount _plus_ (B) the amount, if any, by which Estimated Net Working
Capital exceeds the Target Net Working Capital, _less_ (C) the amount, if any,
by which Estimated Net Working Capital is less than the Target Net Working
Capital, _less_ (D) the Deposit Amount (the " _Closing Payment_ ") and (ii)
the Deposit Amount, less the Adjustment Escrow Amount, will be released to
Sellers. Sellers and Purchaser will execute and deliver to U.S. Bank a joint
instruction directing (i) payment to Sellers of an amount equal to the Deposit
Amount less the Adjustment Escrow Amount and (ii) transfer to the Escrow
Account a portion of the Deposit Amount equal to the Adjustment Escrow Amount.

 



 

3.4 _Post-Closing Adjustment_.

 



 

(a) As promptly as practicable, but in no event later than 60 days after the
Closing Date, Purchaser will prepare and deliver to Sellers a statement (the "
_Post-Closing Statement_ ") setting forth Purchasers calculation of Net
Working Capital. The Post-Closing Statement will be prepared in accordance
with and using the methodologies set forth on _Schedule 1_. The Post-Closing
Statement will also set forth in reasonable detail the basis for such
determination as well as Purchasers calculation of the amount required to be
paid pursuant to

 



     

 

 



 

 _Section 3.4(d)_. Purchaser will provide to Sellers such additional back-up
or supporting data relating to the preparation of the Post-Closing Statement
and the calculation of Net Working Capital as Sellers may reasonably request
and Sellers and their Representatives will be permitted to review Purchasers
work papers and will have reasonable access to Purchasers personnel and
relevant Representatives in connection with the preparation of the Post-
Closing Statement and Purchasers calculation of Net Working Capital. The
Parties will not introduce different judgments, accounting methods, policies,
principles, practices, procedures, classifications or estimation methodologies
for the purpose of determining the Net Working Capital under this paragraph
from those used in _Schedule 1_ and the calculation of Estimated Net Working
Capital. Without limiting the foregoing, the Net Working Capital as calculated
in the Post-Closing Statement will not contain any categories or types of
assets or liabilities or other accounts, reserves or line items not reflected
in the calculations of Net Working Capital as set forth on _Schedule 1_ or the
Estimated Net Working Capital, respectively. If Purchaser fails to deliver the
Post-Closing Statement within 60 days following the Closing Date, then the
Estimated Net Working Capital will be final, not subject to further adjustment
and will be final and binding on the Parties.

 



 

(b) Sellers may, within 30 days following receipt of the Post-Closing
Statement, provide Purchaser with written notice (a " _Dispute Notice_ ") of
their disagreement with the calculation of Net Working Capital reflected on
the Post-Closing Statement. If no such notice is delivered to Purchaser by
Sellers within such period, the Post-Closing Statement and the calculation of
Net Working Capital reflected thereon will be deemed final and binding on the
Parties. A Dispute Notice will set forth Sellers determination of Net Working
Capital in reasonable detail and the basis for such determination. Purchaser
and Sellers will endeavor in good faith to resolve any such disagreement
within 15 days following the delivery by Sellers of such Dispute Notice. Any
resolution (including any partial resolution) of such a disagreement will be
set forth in a writing executed by Purchaser and Sellers, and any such
resolution will be final and binding on the Parties.

 



 

(c) If Purchaser and Sellers are unable to completely resolve any such
disagreement within the 15-day period referred to in _Section 3.4(b)_, the
unresolved issues (and only such unresolved issues) (such unresolved issues
collectively, the " _Dispute_ ") will be promptly submitted for resolution to
BDO USA, LLP, or, if BDO USA, LLP is unwilling or unable to act, a
recognizable, reputable and impartial certified public accounting firm that is
mutually acceptable to Purchaser and Sellers (BDO USA, LLP or such other
accounting firm, as applicable, the " _Neutral Firm_ "). The Neutral Firm will
be instructed to resolve any outstanding Dispute; _provided_ , that the
Neutral Firms determination of any amount subject to the Dispute will be no
(x) less than the lesser of the amounts claimed by Purchaser and Sellers,
respectively, or (y) greater than the greater of the amounts claimed by
Purchaser and Sellers, respectively. The Parties will instruct the Neutral
Firm to render its determination with respect to the entire Dispute within 30
days of the referral of the Dispute thereto, and the determination of the
Neutral Firm will be final and binding upon the Parties. The fees and expenses
of the Neutral Firm will be borne by Purchaser, on the one hand, and Sellers,
on the other hand, in the same proportion that the dollar amount subject to
Dispute which is not resolved in favor of Purchaser and Sellers, as
applicable, bears to the total dollar amount subject to the Dispute resolved
by the Neutral Firm. For illustration purposes only, if the total amount of
the Dispute is $100,000, and Sellers

 



     

 

 



 

are awarded $75,000 by the Neutral Firm, Sellers will bear 25% and Purchaser
will bear 75% of the Neutral Firms fees and expenses.

 



 

(d) Within two Business Days after the date on which Net Working Capital is
finally determined pursuant to _Section 3.4(b)_ or _3.4(c)_ , as the case may
be (" _Final Net Working Capital_ "), Purchaser and the Company will jointly
determine the amount of the Closing Payment had the Final Net Working Capital
been used to calculate the Closing Payment pursuant to _Section 3.3(b)_ (the
result of such adjustments being the " _Final Cash Purchase Price_ ").

 



 

(e) If the Final Cash Purchase Price is less than the Closing Payment (the "
_Purchaser Adjustment Amount_ "), within two Business Days of the date on
which the Final Cash Purchase Price is so determined, (i) Purchaser and
Sellers will deliver joint instructions to U.S. Bank to deliver to Purchaser
from the Escrow Account the Purchaser Adjustment Amount in cash by wire
transfer of immediately available funds, (ii) if the Purchaser Adjustment
Amount is more than the Adjustment Escrow Amount, then Sellers will pay
Purchaser the amount of such excess in cash by wire transfer of immediately
available funds, and (iii) if the Purchaser Adjustment Amount is less than the
Adjustment Escrow Amount, then Purchaser and Sellers will deliver joint
instructions to U.S. Bank to deliver to Seller the difference in cash by wire
transfer of immediately available funds.

 



 

(f) If the Closing Payment is less than the Final Cash Purchase Price (the "
_Sellers Adjustment Amount_ "), within two Business Days of the date on which
the Final Cash Purchase Price is so determined, (i) Purchaser and Sellers will
execute joint instructions to U.S. Bank to deliver to Sellers the Escrow
Account in cash by wire transfer of immediately available funds, and (ii)
Purchaser will pay Sellers the Sellers Adjustment Amount by wire transfer of
immediately available funds.

 



 

(g) Any payment pursuant to _Section 3.4(e)_ or _Section 3.4(f)_ will be
treated for all Tax purposes as a purchase price adjustment, unless otherwise
required by applicable Law.

 



 

(h) Neither any Seller nor Purchaser will take (and each will cause its
Affiliates not to take) any action with respect to the accounting books and
records of the Acquired Business, or the items reflected thereon, on which the
Post-Closing Statement is to be based, that would frustrate the review and
adjustment procedure set forth in this _Section 3.4_.

 



 

3.5 _Withholding_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
Purchaser and its agents and designees will be entitled to withhold and deduct
from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such
amounts as any of Purchaser or its designees or agents, as applicable, are
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under any provision of Tax Law; _provided_ , that Purchaser will use
commercially reasonable efforts to notify the recipient of the withholding
obligation (other than with respect to any withholding pursuant to Section
1445 of the Code) and the amount to be withheld at least five days prior to
the date such amount is payable under this Agreement and provide the recipient
with a reasonable opportunity to provide any forms or documentation necessary
to avoid or minimize withholding. To the extent that amounts are so withheld
and paid over to the appropriate Tax Authority, such amounts will be treated
for all purposes of this

 



     

 

 



 

Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction
and withholding were made.

 



 

 **IV.** **CLOSING AND TERMINATION**

_Sections 9.1_, _9.2_ and _9.3_ hereof (or the waiver thereof by the Party

(i) the Closing has not occurred by 5:00 p.m. Central time on August 26, 2019
(the " _Termination Date_ "), which date may be extended pursuant to _Sections

or by which any of the Purchased Assets or the Assumed Liabilities is subject,
except, in the case of _clauses (b)_ and _(c)_ , for any such violation,

events that would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Seller Material Adverse Effect.

 **VI.** **REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PURCHASER**

 



 

Except as set forth in the Schedules from Purchaser, dated as of the date
hereof, Purchaser hereby represents and warrants to Sellers that:

 



 

6.1 _Organization and Good Standing_. Purchaser is a limited liability company
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the State
of Delaware and has all requisite limited liability company power and
authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its
business as now being conducted, except where the failure to be so organized,
existing and in good standing or to have such power and authority would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a material
adverse effect on the ability of Purchaser to consummate the Transactions.
Purchaser is not in violation of its organizational or governing documents.

 



 

6.2 _Authorization of Agreement_. Purchaser has all necessary limited
liability company power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement
and to perform its obligations hereunder. The execution, delivery and
performance by Purchaser of this Agreement, and the consummation by it of the
Transactions, have been duly and validly authorized by the board of directors
of Purchaser, and no other action on the part of Purchaser is necessary to
authorize the execution, delivery and performance by Purchaser of this
Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions. This Agreement has been
duly executed and delivered by Purchaser and, assuming due and valid
authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement by Sellers, is a valid
and binding obligation of Purchaser enforceable against Purchaser in
accordance with its terms, subject to equitable principles of general
applicability (whether considered in a proceeding at law or in equity).

 



 

6.3 _Consents and Approvals; No Violations_.

 



 

(a) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by Purchaser and
the consummation Purchaser of the Transactions do not and will not (i)
conflict with or violate the certificate of incorporation or bylaws (or
similar organizational documents) of Purchaser, (ii) assuming that all
consents, approvals and authorizations contemplated by _clauses (i)_ through
(iii) of _subsection (b)_ of this Section have been obtained, and all filings
described in such clauses have been made, conflict with or violate any Law or
Order applicable Purchaser or by which Purchaser or any of its respective
properties are bound, or (iii) result in any breach or violation of or
constitute a default (or an event which with notice or lapse of time or both
would become a default) or result in the loss of a benefit under, or give rise
to any right of termination, cancellation, amendment or acceleration of, any
Contracts to which Purchaser is a party or by which Purchaser or any of its
respective properties are bound, except, in the case of _clauses (ii)_ and
_(iii)_ , for any such conflict, violation, breach, default, acceleration,
loss, right or other occurrence which would not prevent or materially impair
the ability of Purchaser to consummate the Transactions.

 



 

(b) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by Purchaser and
the consummation by Purchaser of the Transactions do not and will not require
any consent, approval, authorization or permit of, action by, filing with or
notification to, any Governmental Body, except for (i) the applicable
requirements, if any, of the Exchange Act and state securities,

 



     

 

 



 

takeover and "blue sky" Laws, (ii) the applicable requirements of the HSR Act
and any foreign antitrust Laws, if applicable, and (iii) any such consent,
approval, authorization, permit, action, filing or notification the failure of
which to make or obtain would not impair the ability of Purchaser to
consummate the Transactions.

 



 

6.4 _Financial Capability_. As of the Closing, Purchaser will have sufficient
funds available to it in cash to pay or cause to be paid the Purchase Price
and the fees and expenses required to be paid by Purchaser in connection with
the Transactions, and to effect the Transactions. Upon the consummation of the
Transactions, (a) Purchaser will not be insolvent as defined in Section 101 of
the Bankruptcy Code, (b) Purchaser will not be left with unreasonably small
capital, (c) Purchaser will not have incurred debts beyond its ability to pay
such debts as they mature, and (d) the capital of Purchaser will not be
impaired.

 



 

6.5 _Condition of the Purchased Assets_. Notwithstanding anything contained in
this Agreement to the contrary, Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that Sellers
are not making any representations or warranties whatsoever, express or
implied, beyond those expressly given by Sellers in _Article V_ (as modified
by the Schedules hereto), and Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that, except
for the representations and warranties contained therein, the Purchased Assets
are being transferred on a "where is" and, as to condition, "as is" basis.
Purchaser acknowledges that it has conducted to its satisfaction its own
independent investigation of the Purchased Assets and, in making the
determination to proceed with the Transactions, Purchaser has relied on the
results of its own independent investigation.

 



 

6.6 _Exclusivity of Representations and Warranties_. Purchaser acknowledges
that except for the representations and warranties made by Sellers in _Article
V_, none of Sellers make (and neither Purchaser or any other Person has relied
upon) any representations or warranties on behalf of Sellers. Purchaser
further agrees that neither Sellers nor any other Person will have or be
subject to any liability or indemnification obligation to Purchaser or any
other Person resulting from the distribution to Purchaser, Purchasers use of,
any such information, including any information, documents, projections,
forecasts or other material made available to Purchaser in certain "data
rooms" or management presentations in expectation of the Transactions. For the
avoidance of doubt, Purchaser acknowledges that neither Sellers nor any of
their Representatives make any express or implied representation or warranty
with respect to "Confidential Information" as defined in the Confidentiality
Agreement. Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that it (a) has had an
opportunity to discuss the business of Sellers with the management of Sellers,
(b) has had sufficient access to (i) the books and records of Sellers and (ii)
the electronic data room maintained by Sellers for purposes of the
Transactions, (c) has been afforded the opportunity to ask questions of and
receive answers from officers and other key employees of Sellers and (d) has
conducted its own independent investigation of the Acquired Business and the
Transactions, and has not relied on any representation, warranty or other
statement by any Person on behalf of Sellers, other than the representations
and warranties of Sellers expressly contained in _Article V_, and that all
other representations and warranties are specifically disclaimed. In
connection with any investigation by Purchaser of Sellers or the Acquired
Business, Purchaser has received or may receive from Sellers or its other
Representatives on behalf of Sellers certain projections, forward-looking
statements and other forecasts and certain business plan information in
written or verbal communications. Purchaser acknowledges that there are
uncertainties inherent in attempting to make such estimates, projections and
other forecasts and

 



     

 

 



 

plans, that Purchaser is familiar with such uncertainties, that Purchaser is
taking full responsibility for making its own evaluation of the adequacy and
accuracy of all estimates, projections and other forecasts and plans so
furnished to Purchaser (including the reasonableness of the assumptions
underlying such estimates, projections, forecasts or plans), and that
Purchaser will have no claim against Sellers or any other Person with respect
thereto. Accordingly, Purchaser acknowledges that neither Sellers nor any
other Person on behalf of the Sellers make (and neither Purchaser or any other
Person has relied upon) any representation or warranty with respect to such
estimates, projections, forecasts or plans (including the reasonableness of
the assumptions underlying such estimates, projections, forecasts or plans).
Nothing contained in this Agreement shall limit Purchasers ability to rely on
the representations and warranties made by Sellers in _Article V_ and to
bring a claim for fraud by Sellers against the Purchaser.

 



 

 **VII.** **BANKRUPTCY COURT MATTERS**

 



 

7.1 _Submission for Bankruptcy Court Approval_. As promptly as practicable
after the execution of this Agreement, Sellers will file with the Bankruptcy
Court a motion (the " _Sale Motion_ ") seeking (a) entry of an Order
authorizing the observance and performance of the terms of _Sections 4.6(b)_ ,
_4.6(c)_ , _4.6(d)_ and _4.6(e)_ by Sellers and Purchaser (the " _Stalking
Horse Order_ ") and (b) the Approval Order, including the approval of this
Agreement and the sale of the Purchased Assets to Purchaser on the terms and
conditions hereof if determined to be the "highest or otherwise best offer" in
accordance with the Bidding Procedures Order. Such motion must be reasonably
acceptable to Purchaser.

 



 

7.2 _Bankruptcy Process_.

 



 

(a) Sellers and Purchaser acknowledge and agree that this Agreement, the sale
of the Purchased Assets and the Transactions are subject to higher or
otherwise better bids (in accordance with the Bidding Procedures Order) and
Bankruptcy Court approval. Purchaser and Sellers acknowledge that Sellers must
take reasonable steps to demonstrate that they have sought to obtain the
highest or otherwise best offer for the Purchased Assets, including giving
notice thereof to the creditors of Sellers and other interested parties,
providing information about Sellers business to prospective bidders,
entertaining higher or otherwise better offers from such prospective bidders,
and, in the event that additional qualified prospective bidders desire to bid
for the Purchased Assets, conducting an auction in accordance with the Bidding
Procedures Order.

 



 

(b) The bidding procedures to be employed with respect to this Agreement and
any auction will be those reflected in the Bidding Procedures Order. Purchaser
agrees and acknowledges that (i) prior to the entry of the Bidding Procedures
Order, Sellers and their Affiliates will be permitted, and will be permitted
to cause their Representatives, to initiate contact with, solicit or encourage
submission of any inquiries, proposals or offers by, respond to any
unsolicited inquiries, proposals or offers submitted by, supply information
relating to the Business and the Purchased Assets to prospective bidders, and
enter into any discussions or negotiations regarding any of the foregoing
with, any Person (in addition to Purchaser and its Affiliates, agents and
Representatives); and (ii) following the Bankruptcy Courts approval of the
Bidding Procedures Order, the marketing activities described in the preceding
sentence shall all occur in accordance with the bidding procedures set forth
in the Bidding Procedures Order.

 



     

 

 



 

(c) Purchaser will provide adequate evidence and assurance under the
Bankruptcy Code of the future performance by Purchaser of each Purchased
Contract. Purchaser will, and will cause its Affiliates to, reasonably
promptly take all actions reasonably required to assist in obtaining a
Bankruptcy Court finding that there has been an adequate demonstration of
adequate assurance of future performance under the Purchased Contracts, such
as furnishing affidavits, non-confidential financial information and other
documents or information for filing with the Bankruptcy Court and making
Purchasers Representatives available to testify before the Bankruptcy Court.

 



 

(d) If this Agreement and the sale of the Purchased Assets to Purchaser on the
terms and conditions hereof are determined to be the "highest or otherwise
best offer" in accordance with the Bidding Procedures Order, Purchaser and
Sellers agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Bankruptcy
Court to enter the Approval Order.

 



 

(e) Sellers covenant and agree that if the Approval Order is entered, the
terms of any plan submitted by Sellers to the Bankruptcy Court for
confirmation will not conflict with, supersede, abrogate, nullify, modify or
restrict the terms of this Agreement and the rights of Purchaser hereunder, or
in any way prevent or interfere with the consummation or performance of the
Transactions including any transaction that is contemplated by or approved
pursuant to the Approval Order.

 



 

(f) If the Approval Order or any other orders of the Bankruptcy Court relating
to this Agreement are appealed or petition for certiorari or motion for
rehearing or reargument is filed with respect thereto, Sellers agree to take
all action as may be commercially reasonable and appropriate to defend against
such appeal, petition or motion and Purchaser agrees to cooperate in such
efforts and each Party agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain an expedited resolution of such appeal; _provided_ , that the absence
of an appeal of the Approval Order will not be a condition to any Partys
obligation to consummate the Transactions at the Closing.

 



 

(g) For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Agreement will restrict
Sellers or their Affiliates from selling, disposing of or otherwise
transferring any Excluded Assets or from settling, delegating or otherwise
transferring any Excluded Liabilities, or from entering into discussions or
agreements with respect to the foregoing.

 



 

7.3 _Additional Bankruptcy Matters_. From and after the date of this Agreement
and until the Closing Date (or any earlier date from and after any deadline
for other potential purchasers to submit bids for the Purchased Assets if this
Agreement is determined not to be the "highest or otherwise best offer" in
accordance with the Bidding Procedures Order), to the extent reasonably
practicable, Sellers will deliver to Purchaser drafts of any and all material
pleadings, motions, notices, statements, applications, schedules, reports and
other papers to be filed or submitted by Sellers in connection with this
Agreement for Purchasers prior review. Sellers will make reasonable efforts
to consult and cooperate with Purchaser regarding (a) any such pleadings,
motions, notices, statements, applications, schedules, reports or other
papers, (b) any discovery taken in connection with the motions seeking
approval of the Bidding Procedures Order, Stalking Horse Order or Approval
Order (including, without limitation, any depositions) and (c) any hearing
relating to the Stalking Horse Order, the Bidding Procedures Order or

 



     

 

 



 

Approval Order, including, without limitation, the submission of any evidence,
including witnesses testimony, in connection with such hearing.

 



 

 **VIII.** **COVENANTS**

 



 

8.1 _Access to Information_. From the Effective Date through the Closing Date,
Purchaser will be entitled, through its Representatives, to make such
investigation of the Purchased Assets and the Assumed Liabilities as it
reasonably requests. Any such investigation and examination will be conducted
upon reasonable advance notice and under reasonable circumstances, will occur
only during normal business hours and will be subject to restrictions under
applicable Law. Sellers will direct their respective Representatives to
cooperate with Purchaser and Purchasers Representatives in connection with
such investigation and examination, and Purchaser and its Representatives will
cooperate with Sellers and their Representatives. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, no such investigation or examination will be permitted
to the extent that it would require Sellers to disclose information that would
cause material competitive harm to a Seller or would violate attorney-client
privilege. No investigation by Purchaser will affect or be deemed to modify
any of the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of Sellers
contained in this Agreement.

 



 

8.2 _Actions Pending the Closing_. Except (a) as required by applicable Law or
by order of the Bankruptcy Court, (b) as otherwise expressly contemplated by
this Agreement, or (c) with the prior written consent of Purchaser, during the
period from the Effective Date to and through the Closing Date, Sellers will
(taking into account the commencement of the Bankruptcy Cases, the anticipated
sale, liquidation and shut-down of operations of Sellers other than the
Acquired Business and other changes, facts and circumstances that customarily
result from the events leading up to and following the commencement of
bankruptcy proceedings) operate the Acquired Business in the Ordinary Course
of Business. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Sellers will:
(i) use reasonable best efforts, in consultation with Purchaser and its
advisors, to maintain and preserve the relationships of the Acquired Business
with the members of the Florist Network, vendors, suppliers, and others having
material business relationships with the Acquired Business, (ii) maintain the
Purchased Assets in their current condition, ordinary wear and tear excepted
(and excluding sales of inventory in the Ordinary Course of Business); (iii)
not materially amend, modify, terminate, let lapse (other than the expiration
of a contract pursuant to its terms) or waive any rights under, or create any
Lien with respect to, any of the Purchased Contracts; (iv) use reasonable best
efforts, in consultation with Purchaser and its advisors, to defend and
protect the Purchased Assets from deterioration; (v) comply with applicable
Laws with respect to the Purchased Assets in all material respects; (vi)
enforce contractual obligations under the Purchased Contracts, and not
voluntarily amend or terminate any Purchased Contract, (vii) not waive,
release, assign, settle or compromise any material claim, litigation or
arbitration to the extent relating to the Acquired Business that will bind
Purchaser after the Closing Date; (viii) not make any loans or material
advances related to the Acquired Business that would be Assumed Liabilities;
(ix) not enter into any Contract that limits or restricts the conduct or
operations of the Acquired Business; and (x) not enter into any agreement or
commitment to take any action prohibited by this _Section 8.2_.

 



 

8.3 _Payables_. The Sellers shall make all payments in respect of payables of
the Acquired Business (including rent payments, sales Taxes, payments to
Business Employees and payments to the Florist Network) due or arising after
the Effective Date and through the Closing

 



     

 

 



 

Date in all material respects on a timely basis and will otherwise manage the
accounts payable of the Acquired Business in accordance with the Sellers cash
management policies and practices (as in effect prior to the commencement of
the Bankruptcy Case) in the Ordinary Course of Business. The Sellers shall
deliver to Purchaser all budget reports delivered to the lenders under
Sellers debtor-in-possession financing facility with respect to the Acquired
Business substantially concurrently with their delivery to such lenders.

 



 

8.4 _Consents_. Sellers and Purchaser will use their reasonable best efforts
to obtain at the earliest practicable date all consents and approvals
contemplated by this Agreement, including the consents and approvals referred
to in _Section 5.4_ and the Necessary Consents; _provided_ , _however_ , that
none of Sellers or Purchaser (other than with respect to Assumed Cure Costs)
will be obligated to pay any consideration therefor to any third party from
whom consent or approval is requested or to initiate any litigation or
proceedings to obtain any such consent or approval. For the avoidance of
doubt, the Parties acknowledge and agree that obtaining any such
authorizations, consents and approvals, giving such notices and making such
filings will not be a condition to Closing.

 



 

8.5 _Reasonable Best Efforts; Consents to Assignment_.

 



 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, each of
the Parties will use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable under applicable Laws to consummate and make effective the
Transactions as promptly as practicable and in no event later than the
Termination Date, including the prompt preparation and filing of all forms,
registrations and notices required to be filed to consummate the Transactions
and the taking of such actions as are necessary to obtain any requisite
approvals, consents, orders, exemptions or waivers by any Governmental Body or
any other Person, including filings pursuant to the Hart-Scott-Rodino
Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the " _HSR Act_ "), and any
actions necessary to cause the expiration of the notice periods under the HSR
Act. Each Party will promptly consult with the others with respect to, provide
any necessary information with respect to, and provide the other Parties (or
their counsel) copies of, all filings made by such Party with any Governmental
Body or any other Person or any other information supplied by such Party to a
Governmental Body or any other Person in connection with this Agreement and
the Transactions. Purchaser and Sellers will make all filings under the HSR
Act as promptly as practicable, and no later than 10 Business Days, following
the date the Stalking Horse Order is entered. Purchaser will be responsible
for all filing fees under the HSR Act or any other competition Laws applicable
to Purchaser.

 



 

(b) Each Party will promptly inform the others of any communication from any
Governmental Body regarding any of the Transactions and promptly provide the
others with copies of all related correspondence or filings. If any Party or
Affiliate thereof receives a request for additional information or documentary
material from any such Governmental Body with respect to the Transactions,
then such Party will endeavor in good faith to make, or cause to be made, as
soon as reasonably practicable and after consultation with the other Party, an
appropriate response in compliance with such request. Each Party will provide
any necessary information and reasonable assistance as the others may request
in connection with its

 



     

 

 



 

preparation of any additional necessary filings or submissions to any
Governmental Body, including any additional filings necessary under the HSR
Act.

 



 

(c) Neither Sellers nor Purchaser will independently participate in any
meeting with any Governmental Body (other than the Bankruptcy Court or the
Office of the United States Trustee) in respect of any findings or inquiry in
connection with the Transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other
agreements, documents or instruments contemplated hereby without giving, in
the case of Sellers, Purchaser, and in the case of Purchaser, Sellers, prior
notice of the meeting and, to the extent reasonably practicable and not
prohibited by the applicable Governmental Body, the opportunity to attend
and/or participate in such meeting.

 



 

(d) Each Party will use its reasonable best efforts to resolve objections, if
any, as may be asserted by any Governmental Body with respect to the
Transactions, including under the HSR Act. In connection therewith, if any
administrative or judicial action or proceeding is instituted (or threatened
to be instituted) challenging any Transaction as violative of the HSR Act,
each of the Parties will cooperate and use its reasonable best efforts to
contest and resist any such action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted,
reversed, or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order,
whether temporary, preliminary or permanent that is in effect and that
prohibits, prevents, or restricts consummation of the Transactions, unless
Sellers and Purchaser agree in writing that litigation is not in their
respective best interests.

 



 

8.6 _Publicity_. With the exception of press releases issued by Sellers and
Purchaser on the Effective Date and the Closing Date in forms mutually
agreeable to the Company and Purchaser, Purchaser and Sellers will not issue
any press release or public announcement concerning this Agreement or the
Transactions without obtaining the prior written approval of the other
Parties, which approval may not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed, except that such consent will not be required if disclosure is
otherwise required by applicable Law or by the Bankruptcy Court; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (a) Purchaser or Sellers, as applicable, will use its or
their commercially reasonable efforts consistent with such applicable Law or
Bankruptcy Court requirement to consult with the other Parties with respect to
the text of any such required disclosure; and (b) Sellers will make such
announcements to vendors of the Acquired Business and members of the Florist
Network as are reasonably requested by Purchaser from time to time.

 



 

8.7 _Confidentiality_. Purchaser acknowledges that Confidential Information
(as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement) has been, and in the future will
be, provided to it in connection with this Agreement, including under _Section
8.1_, and is subject to the terms of the confidentiality agreement dated March
29, 2019, between FTD Companies, Inc. and Purchaser (the " _Confidentiality
Agreement_ "), the terms of which are incorporated herein by reference.
Purchaser acknowledges and understands that this Agreement and related
documents may be publicly filed in the Bankruptcy Court and further made
available by Sellers to prospective bidders or contract counterparties and
that, such disclosure will not be deemed to violate any confidentiality
obligations owing to Purchaser, whether pursuant to this Agreement, the
Confidentiality Agreement or otherwise. Sellers acknowledge that from and
after the Closing, all non-public information relating to the Purchased Assets
and the Assumed Liabilities will be valuable and proprietary to Purchaser and
its Affiliates. Sellers agree that, from and after the

 



      

 

 



 

Closing, no Seller will disclose to any Person any information relating to
Purchaser and its Affiliates, the Purchased Assets or the Assumed Liabilities,
except as required by Law or as otherwise becomes available in the public
domain other than through any action by any Seller in violation of its
obligations under this _Section 8.7_. Sellers acknowledge and agree that the
remedies at law for any breach or threatened breach of this _Section 8.7_ by
any Seller are inadequate to protect Purchaser and its Affiliates and that the
damages resulting from any such breach are not readily susceptible to being
measured in monetary terms. Accordingly, without prejudice to any other rights
or remedies otherwise available to Purchaser or its Affiliates, each Party
acknowledges and agrees that upon any breach or threatened breach by a Seller
of the terms and conditions of this _Section 8.7_, Purchaser and its
Affiliates, as applicable will be entitled to injunctive relief and to seek an
order restraining any threatened or future breach from any court of competent
jurisdiction without proof of actual damages or posting of any bond in
connection with any such remedy. The provisions of this _Section 8.7_ will
survive the Closing.

 



 

8.8 _Post-Closing Access and Information_.

 



 

(a) For a period of three years following the Closing Date, Purchaser will use
commercially reasonable efforts to provide Sellers, through their respective
Representatives, with reasonable access during normal business hours and upon
reasonable advance notice, to Purchasers or the Acquired Business officers,
employees, accountants, properties, offices and assets, and to books, records,
work papers and other documents and information, in each case, to the extent
related to the Acquired Business, in each case, to the extent related to
administration of the Bankruptcy Case and to permit Sellers to wind down and
liquidate the Sellers Bankruptcy estates following the Closing.

 



 

(b) For a period of three years following the Closing Date, Sellers will use
commercially reasonable efforts to provide Purchaser, through its
Representatives, with reasonable access during normal business hours and upon
reasonable advance notice, to Sellers officers, employees, accountants,
properties, offices and assets, and to books, records, work papers and other
documents and information, in each case, to the extent related to the Acquired
Business, as is reasonably required to enable Purchaser to conduct the
Acquired Business in the Ordinary Course of Business following the Closing and
to prepare financial statements with respect to the Acquired Business.

 



 

8.9 _Employee Matters_.

 



 

(a) Sellers will, from time to time prior to the Closing Date, update the list
of Business Employees on _Schedule 1.1(a)_ to reflect employment terminations
and new hires. Prior to the Closing Date, Purchaser will, or will cause one of
its Affiliates to, offer employment to the Business Employees, such employment
to commence immediately following the Closing. Sellers and their Affiliates
will cooperate with and use their commercially reasonable efforts to assist
Purchaser and its Affiliates in their efforts to secure the satisfactory
transition of the Business Employees to Purchaser. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, Sellers and their Affiliates will provide all
relevant information in their possession necessary to the hiring and transfer
of the Transferred Employees, including all relevant payroll, compensation,
benefits participation and withholding tax information with respect to the
Transferred Employees; _provided_ , that Purchaser will not have access to
personnel records of any Seller the disclosure of

 



     

 

 



 

which is prohibited by applicable Law. Business Employees who accept offers of
employment from Purchaser or an Affiliate of Purchaser are referred to as "
_Transferred Employees_ ". Seller and its Affiliates will terminate the
employment of all Business Employees who agree to become Transferred
Employees, effective immediately prior to the Closing; _provided_ , _however_
, that the Parties intend and will take commercially reasonable steps to
ensure that the Transferred Employees have continuous employment through the
Closing. Purchaser agrees, to the extent permissible under Purchasers benefit
plans, to provide credit to the Transferred Employees for all periods of
service with Seller and their Affiliates upon commencing their employment with
Purchaser for purposes of eligibility for and calculation of benefits,
vacation, paid time off and participation under any benefit plans maintained
by Purchaser, but not for purposes of calculating any severance amount.
Subject to _Schedule 8.9(a)_ , for a 12-month period following the Closing,
Purchaser will provide each Transferred Employee with (i) a base salary or
standard hourly wage rate that is no less favorable to the Transferred
Employees than that provided by Seller at the time of the Closing; and (ii)
employee health and welfare benefits, viewed as a whole on an aggregate basis,
that are no less favorable to Transferred Employees than under Sellers
Benefit Plans in effect at the time of the Closing.

 



 

(b) Sellers will, to the extent reasonably requested by Purchaser, use
commercially reasonable efforts to make each Business Employee reasonably
available to Purchaser for the purpose of facilitating the transition of such
Business Employee to Purchaser. Sellers will not, without Purchasers consent,
knowingly interfere with any negotiations by Purchaser to employ or retain the
services of any Business Employee; _provided_ , _however_ , that Sellers will
not be prohibited from negotiating and entering into an agreement for the sale
of any Retained Business where such agreement permits a purchaser or its
affiliates to offer employment to the Business Employees who are Shared
Employees.

 



 

(c) Sellers hereby waive, either directly or by causing their Affiliates to
waive, for the benefit of Purchaser and its Affiliates, any and all
restrictions, if any, in any Benefit Plan or Contract relating to (i)
noncompetition with Sellers or any of their Affiliates relating to the
Acquired Business or (ii) maintenance of confidentiality of any information
relating to the Acquired Business for the benefit of any Seller or any of its
Affiliates, in each case, with or covering any Business Employee who becomes a
director, employee, consultant or independent contractor of Purchaser or its
Affiliates in connection with the Acquired Business.

 



 

(d) Sellers will be responsible for any notices required to be given under and
will otherwise comply with all Liabilities arising under the WARN Act relating
to any acts or omissions on or prior to the Closing, including as a result of
the Transactions; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the event that Purchaser
decides not to hire a sufficient number of Business Employees such that it
would trigger a "plant closing" or "mass layoff" within the meaning of the
WARN Act, Purchaser will provide notice of its decision to Sellers in
sufficient time for Sellers to comply with the WARN Acts notice requirements
prior to the Closing Date. If Purchaser does not provide sufficient time for
Sellers to so comply, Purchaser agrees to indemnify Sellers against and agrees
to hold each of them harmless from any and all losses incurred or suffered by
Sellers with respect to WARN Act Liabilities arising solely as a result
thereof. Subject to the foregoing and _Section 5.10(a)(iii)_, Purchaser will
be responsible for any notices required to be given under and will otherwise
comply with all Liabilities arising under the WARN Act relating to any acts or
omissions after the Closing.

 



     

 

 



 

(e) Purchasers employment of the Transferred Employees will be "at will" and
may be terminated by Purchaser and/or any of its Affiliates at any time for
any reason; _provided_ , _however_ , that for the 12-month period following
the Closing, to the extent that the employment of any Transferred Employee is
involuntarily terminated by Purchaser, Purchaser will pay, or will cause to be
paid to such Transferred Employee the separation pay pursuant to the severance
plan agreed to by Sellers and Purchaser in good faith as set forth on
_Schedule 8.9(e)_. Nothing in this Agreement will create any third-party
rights in any Transferred Employees or any current or former employees or
other service providers of any Seller or any Seller Affiliate (or any
beneficiaries or dependents of the foregoing) or in any other person. Nothing
contained herein will constitute an amendment to any Benefit Plan.

 



 

8.10 _Transition Services_. After the Closing, Purchaser will and will cause
its Affiliates to provide certain transition services to Sellers Affiliates
or the Retained Business, such transition services to be agreed to between
Seller and Sellers Affiliates and Purchaser. The Parties will negotiate in
good faith, prior to the Closing, a definitive transition services agreement
reflecting such terms, with the definitive agreement to be in a form (i)
customary for transactions of the type contemplated by this Agreement and (ii)
reasonably acceptable to the Company and Purchaser, in their respective
reasonable discretion. The transition services agreement will include access
to books and records, and use of office space and office support for employees
of Sellers or the Retained Business, as is reasonably necessary or appropriate
in connection with the administration of the Bankruptcy Case and to permit
Sellers to wind-down and liquidate the Sellers bankruptcy estates following
the Closing and/or the divestiture of any of the Retained Business or the
assets thereof. Sellers shall cause the terms of the transition services
agreement to be binding on any acquiror or operator of any Retained Business.

 



 

8.11 _Bulk Transfer Laws_. The Parties intend that pursuant to Section 363(f)
of the Bankruptcy Code, the transfer of the Purchased Assets will be free and
clear of any Liens in the Purchased Assets, including any Liens or claims
arising out of the bulk transfer Laws, and the Parties will take such steps as
may be necessary or appropriate to so provide in the Approval Order. In
furtherance of the foregoing, each Party hereby waives compliance by the
Parties with the "bulk sales," "bulk transfers" or similar Law in all
applicable jurisdictions in respect of the Transactions (including under the
applicable Tax Laws).

 



 

8.12 _Transferred Employee Non-Solicit_. For the period commencing as of the
Closing Date and expiring on the two-year anniversary of the Closing Date,
Sellers will not, and will cause their Subsidiaries not to (including through
Representatives) solicit for employment (as an employee or independent
contractor or otherwise) any Transferred Employees. The restrictions of this
_Section 8.12_ will not apply to (a) the placement of any general
solicitation or advertisement or the use of general search firm services that
are not targeted, directly or indirectly, at any Transferred Employees or (b)
any Transferred Employee who has been involuntarily terminated by Purchaser or
any of its Affiliates.

 



 

8.13 _Use of Names_. As promptly as practicable following the Closing, but in
any event within 15 days following the Closing, Sellers will deliver to
Purchaser duly adopted and executed amendments and other name change documents
to their and their Affiliates respective organizational documents relative to
the change of Sellers and their Affiliates names to some other names which
are dissimilar to, and cannot be confused with, "FTD", "ProFlowers" or

 



     

 

 



 

"roses.com" (along with all variations thereof, collectively, the " _Protected
Names_ ") and which will be reasonably acceptable to Purchaser. As promptly as
practicable following the Closing, but in any event within 15 days following
the Closing, Sellers will cease and desist and will cause their Affiliates to
cease and desist from the use of the Protected Names, including but not
limited to the use of stationery, business cards, marketing materials, e-mail
domains, and websites; _provided_ , that Sellers will be permitted to use the
Protected Names solely for purposes of transitioning the Acquired Business to
Purchaser.

 



 

8.14 _POS System Upgrade_. Sellers will use commercially reasonable efforts to
enter into a Contract with a mutually agreed upon vendor to implement the
upgrade to the POS system for the Florist Network previously described to
Purchaser.

a certificate signed by an authorized officer of Purchaser on behalf of
Purchaser, dated the Closing Date, to the foregoing effect;

 **X.** **TAXES**

 



 

10.1 _Transfer Taxes_. All documentary, stamp, transfer, motor vehicle
registration, sales, use, value added, excise and other similar non-income
Taxes and all filing and recording fees (and any penalties and interest
associated with such Taxes and fees) arising from or relating to the
consummation of the Transactions (collectively, " _Transfer Taxes_ ") will be
borne exclusively by Purchaser to the extent such Transfer Taxes are set forth
on _Schedule 2.3(j)_ , and will be borne equally by Purchaser and Sellers with
respect to any other Transfer Taxes, in each case, regardless of the Party on
whom liability is imposed under the provisions of the Laws relating to such
Transfer Taxes. Sellers and Purchaser will consult and cooperate in timely
preparing and making all filings, Tax Returns, reports and forms as may be
required to comply with the provisions of the Laws relating to such Transfer
Taxes and will cooperate and otherwise take commercially reasonable efforts to
(a) obtain any available refunds for or exemptions from, or (b) otherwise
reduce, such Transfer Taxes, including preparing exemption certificates and
other instruments as are applicable to claim available exemptions from the
payment of Transfer Taxes under applicable Law and executing and delivering
such affidavits and forms as are reasonably requested by the other Party.

 



 

10.2 _Purchase Price Allocation_.

 



 

(a) As promptly as practicable after the Closing Date, but no later than 90
days thereafter, Purchaser will prepare and deliver to Sellers, an allocation
schedule setting forth the amounts to be allocated among Sellers and among the
Purchased Assets of each Seller, pursuant to (and to the extent necessary to
comply with) Section 1060 of the Code and the applicable regulations
promulgated thereunder (or, if applicable, any similar provision under state,
local or foreign Law or regulation) (the " _Proposed Allocation Statement_ ").
Sellers will have 20 Business Days following delivery of the Proposed
Allocation Statement during which to notify Purchaser in writing (an "
_Allocation Notice of Objection_ ") of any objections to the Proposed
Allocation Statement, setting forth in reasonable detail the basis of their
objections. If Sellers fail to deliver an Allocation Notice of Objection in
accordance with this _Section 10.2(a)_, the Proposed Allocation Statement
will be conclusive and binding on all Parties and will become the " _Final
Allocation Statement_." If Sellers submit an Allocation Notice of Objection,
then for 20 Business Days after the date Purchaser receives the Allocation
Notice of Objection, Purchaser and Sellers will use their commercially
reasonable efforts to agree on the allocations. Failing such agreement within
20 Business Days of such notice, the unresolved allocations will be submitted
to the Neutral Firm for resolution in accordance with _Section 3.4_, which
will apply _mutatis mutandis_ to such disagreement. For the avoidance of
doubt, in administering any Legal Proceeding, the Bankruptcy Court will not be
required to apply the Final Allocation Statement in

 



     

 

 



 

determining the manner in which the Purchase Price should be allocated as
between Sellers and their respective estates.

 



 

(b) Sellers and Purchaser and their respective Affiliates will report, act,
and file Tax Returns (including, but not limited to IRS Form 8594) in all
respects and for all purposes consistent with the Final Allocation Statement.
Neither Sellers nor Purchaser will take any position (whether in audits, Tax
Returns, or otherwise) that is inconsistent with the Final Allocation
Statement unless required to do so by applicable Law.

 



 

10.3 _Cooperation and Audits_. Purchaser, Sellers and their respective
Affiliates will cooperate fully with each other regarding Tax matters and will
make available to the other as reasonably requested all information, records
and documents relating to Taxes governed by this Agreement until the
expiration of the applicable statute of limitations or extension thereof or
the conclusion of all audits, appeals or litigation with respect to such
Taxes.

 



 

10.4 _Tax Returns_. From and after the Closing, with respect to the Acquired
Business and/or the Purchased Assets, Sellers, at their sole cost and expense,
will file (or cause to be filed) all Tax Returns that relate to any Retained
Tax, and Purchaser, at its sole cost and expense, will file (or caused to be
filed) all other Tax Returns. For the avoidance of doubt, to the extent any
Tax Return relates solely to the Purchased Assets or the Acquired Business and
is in respect of a Straddle Period, Purchaser will file (or caused to be
filed) such Tax Return, at its sole cost and expense. All Tax Returns that a
Seller is required to file or cause to be filed in accordance with this
_Section 10.4_ will be prepared and filed in a manner consistent with past
practice and, on such Tax Returns, no position will be taken, election made or
method adopted that is inconsistent in any material respect with positions
taken, elections made or methods used in preparing and filing similar Tax
Returns in prior periods (including positions, elections or methods that would
have the effect of deferring gain or income to periods ending after the
Closing Date or accelerating credits or deductions to periods ending on or
before the Closing Date).

 



 

 **XI.** **GENERAL GOVERNING PROVISIONS**

 



 

11.1 _No Survival of Representations and Warranties_. The Parties agree that
the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement will not
survive the Closing hereunder, and none of the Parties will have any Liability
to each other after the Closing for any breach thereof. The Parties agree that
the covenants contained in this Agreement to be performed at or after the
Closing will survive the Closing hereunder until the expiration of the
applicable statute of limitations or for such shorter period explicitly
specified therein, and each Party will be liable to the other after the
Closing for any breach thereof.

 



 

11.2 _Expenses_. Except for the Expense Reimbursement Amount (exclusively from
and after the Bankruptcy Courts approval thereof) or as otherwise expressly
provided in this Agreement, whether or not the Transactions are consummated,
each of Sellers, on the one hand, and Purchaser, on the other hand, will bear
its own expenses incurred in connection with the negotiation and execution of
this Agreement and each other agreement, document and instrument contemplated
by this Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions and all proceedings
incident thereto.

 



     

 

 



 

11.3 _Injunctive Relief_.

 



 

(a) The Parties agree that irreparable damages would occur in the event that
any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached, and that damages at law may
be an inadequate remedy for the breach of any of the covenants, promises and
agreements contained in this Agreement, and, accordingly, any Party will be
entitled to injunctive relief to prevent any such breach, and to specifically
enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, including
without limitation specific performance of such covenants, promises or
agreements or an Order enjoining a Party from any threatened, or from the
continuation of any actual, breach of the covenants, promises or agreements
contained in this Agreement. The rights set forth in this _Section 11.3_ will
be in addition to any other rights which a Party may have at law or in equity
pursuant to this Agreement.

 



 

(b) The Parties hereby agree not to raise any objections to the availability
of the equitable remedy of specific performance to prevent or restrain
breaches of this Agreement by Purchaser or Sellers, as applicable, and to
specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent
breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the
respective covenants and obligations of Purchaser or Sellers, as applicable,
under this Agreement all in accordance with the terms of this _Section 11.3_.

 



 

11.4 _Submission to Jurisdiction; Consent to Service of Process_.

 



 

(a) Without limiting any Partys right to appeal any Order of the Bankruptcy
Court, (i) the Bankruptcy Court will retain exclusive jurisdiction to enforce
the terms of this Agreement and to decide any claims or disputes which may
arise or result from, or be connected with, this Agreement, any breach or
default hereunder, or the Transactions, and (ii) any and all proceedings
related to the foregoing will be filed and maintained only in the Bankruptcy
Court, and the Parties hereby consent to and submit to the jurisdiction and
venue of the Bankruptcy Court for such purposes and will receive notices at
such locations as indicated in _Section 11.8_; _provided_ , _however_ , that
if the Bankruptcy Cases have been closed pursuant to Section 350 of the
Bankruptcy Code, the Parties agree to unconditionally and irrevocably submit
to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of Chancery and any state
appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (or in the event (but
only in the event) that such court does not have subject matter jurisdiction
over such Legal Proceeding in the United States District Court for the
District of Delaware) and any appellate court from any thereof, for the
resolution of any such claim or dispute. The Parties hereby irrevocably waive,
to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any objection which they
may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any such dispute brought
in such court or any defense of inconvenient forum for the maintenance of such
dispute. Each of the Parties agrees that a judgment in any such dispute may be
enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner
provided by Law.

 



 

(b) Each of the Parties hereby consents to process being served by any other
Party in any suit, action or proceeding by delivery of a copy thereof in
accordance with the provisions of _Section 11.8_; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that such service will not be effective until the actual receipt thereof by
the Party being served.

 



     

 

 



 

11.5 _Waiver of Right to Trial by Jury_. Each Party to this Agreement waives
any right to trial by jury in any action, matter or proceeding regarding this
Agreement or any provision hereof.

 



 

11.6 _Entire Agreement; Amendments and Waivers_. This Agreement represents the
entire understanding and agreement between the Parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior discussions and agreements
between the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement
can be amended, supplemented or changed, and any provision hereof can be
waived, only by written instrument making specific reference to this Agreement
signed by the Party against whom enforcement of any such amendment,
supplement, modification or waiver is sought. No action taken pursuant to this
Agreement, including any investigation by or on behalf of any Party, will be
deemed to constitute a waiver by the Party taking such action of compliance
with any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained herein. The
waiver by any Party of a breach of any provision of this Agreement will not
operate or be construed as a further or continuing waiver of such breach or as
a waiver of any other or subsequent breach. No failure on the part of any
Party to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right, power or remedy
hereunder will operate as a waiver thereof, nor will any single or partial
exercise of such right, power or remedy by such Party preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or remedy.
All remedies hereunder are cumulative and are not exclusive of any other
remedies provided by Law.

 



 

11.7 _Governing Law_. This Agreement will be governed by and construed in
accordance with federal bankruptcy Law, to the extent applicable, other
federal Law, where applicable, and, where state Law is implicated, the Laws of
the State of Delaware applicable to contracts made and performed in such
State.

 



 

11.8 _Notices_. All notices and other communications under this Agreement will
be in writing and will be deemed given (i) when delivered personally by hand,

11.9 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced by any Law or public policy,
all other terms or provisions of this Agreement will nevertheless remain in
full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the
Transactions is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any Party.
Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal,
or incapable of being enforced, the Parties will negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as
closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the Transactions are
consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible.

 



 

11.10 _Assignment_. This Agreement will be binding upon and inure to the
benefit of the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns.
Nothing in this Agreement will create or be deemed to create any third party
beneficiary rights in any Person or entity not a party to this Agreement. No
assignment of this Agreement or of any rights or obligations hereunder may be
made by either Sellers or Purchaser (by operation of law or otherwise) without
the prior written consent of the other Parties and any attempted assignment
without the required consents will be void; _provided_ , _however_ , that (a)
Purchaser may assign some or all of its rights or delegate some or all of its
obligations hereunder to one or more Affiliates and (b) Sellers may assign
some or all of their rights or delegate some or all of their obligations
hereunder to

 



      

 

 



 

successor entities (including any liquidating trust) pursuant to a chapter 11
plan confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court, in the case of each clause (a) and (b)
without any other Partys consent. No assignment of any obligations hereunder
will relieve the Parties of any such obligations. Upon any such permitted
assignment, the references in this Agreement to Sellers or Purchaser will also
apply to any such assignee unless the context otherwise requires.

 



 

11.11 _Non-Recourse_. Any claim or cause of action based upon, arising out of,
or related to this Agreement or any agreement, document or instrument
contemplated hereby may only be brought against Persons that are expressly
named as Parties or thereto, and then only with respect to the specific
obligations set forth herein or therein. Other than the Parties, no other
party will have any Liability or obligation for any of the representations,
warranties, covenants, agreements, obligations or Liabilities of any Party
under this Agreement or the agreements, documents or instruments contemplated
hereby or of or for any Legal Proceeding based on, in respect of, or by reason
of, Transactions (including the breach, termination or failure to consummate
such transactions), in each case whether based on contract, tort, fraud,
strict liability, other Laws or otherwise and whether by piercing the
corporate veil, by a claim by or on behalf of a Party or another Person or
otherwise. In no event will any Person be liable to another Person for any
remote, speculative or punitive damages with respect to the Transactions.

 



 

11.12 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of
which will be deemed to be an original copy of this Agreement and all of
which, when taken together, will be deemed to constitute one and the same
agreement.
