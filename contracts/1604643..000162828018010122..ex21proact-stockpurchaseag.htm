the Adjustment Items described in clause (ii) above (the "Proposed Final
Adjusted Purchase Price").

(b) The Sellers' Representative shall have thirty (30) days from the date the
Buyer delivers the Closing Statement (such period, the "Dispute Period") to
notify the Buyer, in writing, as to whether the Sellers' Representative agrees
or disagrees with the Closing Statement, the calculation of the Adjustment
Items set forth therein and the calculation of the Proposed Final Adjusted
Purchase Price (such written notice, the "Dispute Notice"). During the Dispute
Period, the Sellers' Representative and its accountants shall be permitted to
review (during regular business hours and upon reasonable prior notice) the
working papers of the Buyer and (where applicable) the Buyer's accountants and
the financial information and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries, in
each case relating to the matters set forth in the Closing Statement.

(c) If the Sellers' Representative either (i) notifies the Buyer that it
agrees with the Buyer's calculation of the Proposed Final Adjusted Purchase
Price, or (ii) does not deliver a Dispute Notice to the Buyer prior to the
expiration of the Dispute Period, then (y) the Buyer's calculation of the
Adjustment Items and the Adjusted Purchase Price shall be deemed to be final,
conclusive and correct and shall be binding upon each of the parties hereto,
and (z) the Proposed Final Adjusted Purchase Price shall become the Final
Adjusted Purchase Price.

(d) If the Sellers' Representative delivers a Dispute Notice to the Buyer
during the Dispute Period, then the Sellers' Representative and the Buyer
shall, for a period of thirty (30) days from the date the Dispute Notice is
delivered to the Buyer (such period, the "Resolution Period"), use
commercially reasonable efforts to amicably resolve the items in dispute. Any
items so resolved by the parties shall be deemed to be final, conclusive and
correct as so resolved and shall be binding upon each of the parties hereto.
In the event the Buyer and the Sellers' Representative are able to resolve all
of the items in dispute, the calculation of the Adjusted Purchase Price as so
agreed in writing by the Buyer and the Sellers' Representative shall become
the Final Adjusted Purchase Price.

(e) If the Sellers' Representative and the Buyer are unable to resolve all of
the items in dispute during the Resolution Period (the items that have been
resolved by written agreement of the Buyer and the Sellers' Representative, if
any, the "Resolved Items" and the items that have not been so resolved, the
"Disputed Items"), then either the Buyer (on the one hand) or the Sellers'
Representative (on the other hand) may refer the Disputed Items to BDO USA
LLP, or if BDO USA LLP is unwilling or unable to act in such capacity, such
other independent accounting firm of recognized national standing and
reasonably and mutually acceptable to the Buyer and the Sellers'
Representative (the "Independent Accountants"), who, acting as experts and not
arbitrators, shall resolve the Disputed Items. Such referral of the Disputed
Items shall be made in writing to the Independent Accountants, copies of which
shall concurrently be delivered to the non-referring party hereto. The
referring party shall furnish the Independent Accountants, at the time of such
referral, with the Closing Statement, the Dispute Notice, the Disputed Items
and the parties' written agreements concerning all Resolved Items, if any. The
parties shall also furnish the Independent Accountants with such other
information and documents as the Independent Accountants may reasonably
request in order for them to resolve the Disputed Items. The parties hereto
shall also, within ten (10) days of the date the items in dispute are referred
to the Independent Accountants, provide the Independent Accountants with a
written statement (a "Position Statement") describing in reasonable detail
their respective positions on the Disputed Items (copies of which will
concurrently be delivered to the other parties hereto). If any party fails to
timely deliver its Position Statement to the Independent Accountants, the
Independent Accountants shall resolve the Disputed Items solely upon the basis
of the information otherwise provided to them. The Independent Accountants
shall resolve all Disputed Items, without regard to materiality, in a written
determination (the "Final Calculation Statement") to be delivered to each of
the parties hereto within forty-five (45) days after such matter is referred
to them; provided, however, that any delay in delivering the Final Calculation
Statement shall not invalidate the determination of the Disputed Items or
deprive the Independent Accountants of jurisdiction to resolve the Disputed
Items. In no event shall the Independent Accountants assign a value to any
Disputed Item that is greater than the highest or less than the lowest
calculation thereof proposed by the Buyer and the Sellers' Representative. The
decision of the Independent Accountants as to the Disputed Items shall be
final and binding upon the parties hereto and shall not be subject to judicial
review. The Final Calculation Statement shall include a calculation of the
Adjusted Purchase Price taking into account all Resolved Items and the
Independent Accountants' determination of all Disputed Items and such
calculation of the Independent Accountants shall be final and binding on the
parties hereto and shall become the Final Adjusted Purchase Price. The fees
and expenses of the Independent Accountants incurred in the resolution of any
items in dispute shall be determined by the Independent Accountants and set
forth on the Final Calculation Statement and shall be allocated and paid by
the party (either the Buyer, on the one hand, or the Sellers in accordance
with their respective Applicable Total Percentages, on the other hand) whose
calculation of the Disputed Items in dispute is furthest from the Independent
Accountant's determination of the Disputed Items, determined in the aggregate.

assets or properties (other than sales of inventory in the ordinary course of

regulations promulgated thereunder (the "280G Shareholder Vote"), and shall
use its best efforts to cause its executives to waive any payments in respect
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement that would not be
deductible pursuant to Section 280G of the Code if the 280G Shareholder Vote
fails the requisite approval. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement
to the contrary, if the 280G Shareholder Vote fails to achieve the requisite
approval in respect of any executive, the Company shall provide to the Buyer
the name of such executives and amounts waived, and no amount so waived shall
be paid to any such executive.

including the delivery of financial information, the making of its executive
officers available for meetings and presentations during regular business
hours and on advance notice and assisting in the preparation of appropriate
documents reasonably required in connection with such debt financing;
provided, however, that in no event shall the Company be obligated to disclose

FURTHER ASSURANCES 

If any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of
this Agreement, each of the parties hereto will use commercially reasonable

requesting party is entitled to indemnification therefor under Article X
below).

SECTION 8.04.

|

RECORD RETENTION AND ACCESS 

(a) Taft Stettinius and Hollister LLP ("Sellers' Counsel") has acted as counsel
for the Sellers and their Affiliates, including the Company and its
Subsidiaries (the "Clients") in connection with the negotiation, preparation,
execution, delivery and Closing under this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (the "Pre-Closing Engagements") and in that
connection not as counsel for any other Person, including the Buyer or its
Affiliates. Only the Clients will be considered clients of Sellers' Counsel in
the Pre-Closing Engagements. Accordingly, notwithstanding that the Clients are
or were clients in the Pre-Closing Engagements, upon and after the Closing,
all communications between any of the Clients and Sellers' Counsel in the
course of the Pre-Closing Engagements will be deemed to be attorney-client
confidences that belong solely to the Sellers and not to the Buyer or any of
its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries), in each case so long as such communications would be subject to
a privilege or protection if they were being requested in Litigation by an
unrelated third party. The Buyer and its Affiliates (including, after the
Closing, the Company and its Subsidiaries) will not have access to any such
communications, or to the files of Sellers' Counsel relating to the Pre-
Closing Engagements, whether or not the Closing will have occurred. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, notwithstanding that the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries is or was a client in the Pre-Closing Engagements,
upon and after the Closing except with respect to any communications that
would not be subject to a privilege or protection if they were being requested
in Litigation by an unrelated third party: (i) the Sellers and their
Affiliates will be the sole holders of the attorney-client privilege with
respect to the Pre-Closing Engagements, and none of the Company, its
Subsidiaries, the Buyer or any of their respective Affiliates will be a holder
thereof; (ii) to the extent that files of Sellers' Counsel in respect of the
Pre-Closing Engagements constitute property of the Clients (including the
Company and its Subsidiaries), only the Sellers and their Affiliates will hold
such property rights; and (iii) Sellers' Counsel will have no duty whatsoever
to reveal or disclose any such attorney-client communications or files to the
Company, its Subsidiaries, the Buyer or any of their respective Affiliates by
reason of any attorney-client relationship between Sellers' Counsel and the
Company or its Subsidiaries or otherwise. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, the parties recognize that it would be impracticable to try to
purge all Client-privileged communications regarding the Pre-Closing
Engagements from the Company's and its Subsidiaries' files and computer
systems prior to the Closing, and so the parties agree that no waiver is
intended by leaving such documents where then located and the Buyer and its
Affiliates will not be permitted to review any such documents, and the Buyer
agrees that it and its Affiliates will not be permitted to use any such
documents in a manner adverse to the Sellers or the Sellers' Representative in
any indemnity or other dispute following the Closing.

(b) In order to facilitate the resolution of any claims made against or
incurred by the Sellers arising in connection with the Pre-Closing
Engagements, or for any other reasonable purpose (including the preparation
and defense of financial statements and Tax Returns), for a period of seven
(7) years after the Closing, the Buyer and the Company shall (and shall cause
the Subsidiaries to):

(i) retain their respective documents, books and records (including personnel
files) relating to periods prior to the Closing in a manner reasonably
consistent with their prior practices; and

(ii) upon reasonable notice, afford the Sellers and their Representatives
reasonable access to (including the right to make, at the Sellers' expense,
photocopies of), during normal business hours, such documents, books and
records.

SECTION 8.05.

INSURANCE TAIL COVERAGE 

(a) For a period of six (6) years following the Closing, all rights to
indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation by the Company and
each of its Subsidiaries now existing in favor of each Person who is now, or
has been at any time prior to the date hereof or who becomes prior to the
Closing Date, an officer, director, manager, employee or other individual with
similar authority of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, as provided in
its respective Governing Documents, in each case as in effect on the date of
this Agreement, or pursuant to any other agreements in effect on the date
hereof, shall survive the Closing Date and shall continue in full force and
effect in accordance with their respective terms.

(b) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries shall, as of the Closing Date,
obtain "tail" insurance policies with a claims period of at least six (6)
years from the Closing Date with at least the same coverage and amounts, and
containing terms and conditions that are not less advantageous to the
directors, officers, managers, employees and other individuals covered
thereby, in each case with respect to claims arising out of or relating to
events which occurred on or prior to the Closing Date (including in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) (the "DandO Tail Policy").

(c) The obligations of the Buyer, the Company and each of its Subsidiaries
under this Section 8.05 shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner
as to adversely affect any director, officer, manager, employee or other
individual with similar authority to whom this Section 8.05 applies without
the consent of such affected individual (it being expressly agreed that the
individuals to whom this Section 8.05 applies shall be third-party
beneficiaries of this Section 8.05, each of whom may enforce the provisions of
this Section 8.05).

(d) In the event the Buyer, the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of
their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates or combines with any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity in such consolidation or combination, or (ii) transfers all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
either such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns in such transaction shall assume all of the obligations set forth in
this Section 8.05.

Agreement); and (v) at or before such time as required by the Binder
Agreement, cause Willis of New York, Inc. to execute and deliver to the
Insurer the broker's Surplus Lines License (as defined in, and required by
Section 14(h) of, the Binder Agreement). Parent shall promptly provide the
Sellers' Representative with copies of all deliveries made by Buyer to the
Insurer as required by this Section 8.06(b).

(c) Unless otherwise required by applicable Law, the Buyer shall not (and
shall not permit any of its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the
Company and its Subsidiaries) to) take any action with the intention of
causing the RandW Insurance Policy or the Binder Agreement or the rights of any
party thereunder to be terminated, cancelled or waived in a manner that would
have an adverse impact on the Sellers or any of their Affiliates. Further, the
Buyer shall not amend the subrogation or third party beneficiary provisions
contained in the RandW Insurance Policy benefiting the Sellers or their
Affiliates or otherwise amend or modify the RandW Insurance Policy in a manner
adverse to the Sellers or any of their Affiliates.

SECTION 8.07.

ANTITRUST FILINGS 

(a) Without limiting the obligations of the parties under Section 8.01(b) and
Section 8.02(b), each party hereto agrees to use commercially reasonable
efforts to: (i) make an appropriate filing pursuant to the HSR Act with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement within three (3)
Business Days after the date hereof; (ii) make an appropriate filing pursuant
to any legal requirements of any foreign Governmental Authority having
jurisdiction over antitrust or competition matters with respect to the
transaction contemplated by this Agreement as soon as practicable after the
date hereof; and (iii) supply as promptly as practicable to the appropriate
Governmental Authority any additional information and documentary material
that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act or any legal requirements of any
foreign Governmental Authority. All analyses, appearances, meetings,
discussions, presentations, memoranda, briefs, filings, arguments, and
proposals made by or on behalf of either party before any Governmental
Authority or the staff or regulators of any Governmental Authority, in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (but, for the
avoidance of doubt, not including: (x) any interactions between the Sellers or
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with Governmental Authorities in the
ordinary course of business; (y) any disclosure which is not permitted by Law;
or (z) any disclosure containing confidential information) shall be disclosed
to the other party hereunder in advance of any filing, submission or
attendance, it being the intent that the parties will consult and cooperate
with one another, and consider in good faith the views of one another, in
connection with any such analyses, appearances, meetings, discussions,
presentations, memoranda, briefs, filings, arguments, and proposals. Each
party shall give notice to the other parties with respect to any meeting,
discussion, appearance or contact with any Governmental Authority or the staff
or regulators of any Governmental Authority, with such notice being sufficient
to provide the other parties with the opportunity to attend and participate in
such meeting, discussion, appearance or contact.

(b) None of the Sellers will extend any waiting period or comparable period
under the HSR Act or any similar foreign legal requirements or enter into any
agreement with any Governmental Authority not to consummate the transaction
contemplated by this Agreement, except with the prior written consent of the
Buyer. Nothing in this Agreement shall (i) require the Buyer to, or permit the
Sellers to, (A) propose or accept the sale, divestiture, disposition or
holding separate of any assets or businesses of itself or any of its
Affiliates (or otherwise take any action that limits the freedom of action
with respect to, or its ability to retain, any of its businesses, product
lines, or assets or those of its Affiliates) in order to avoid the entry of or
to effect the dissolution of any injunction or other order (whether temporary,
preliminary or permanent), which would otherwise have the effect of preventing
or delaying the consummation of the transaction contemplated by this
Agreement, or (B) propose or accept the impositions of conditions that are
reasonably likely to have a material and adverse impact on the business of the
Buyer or the Company and its Subsidiaries following the Closing; or (ii)
require the Buyer to (A) expend money to a third party in exchange for any
consent of any Governmental Authority, or (B) initiate or defend any

SECTION 8.08.

|

RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS 

(a) From and after the Closing, each Seller shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates to, hold in confidence any and all information, whether written or
oral, concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries, except to the extent that
such information: (i) is generally available to and known by the public
through no fault of such Seller or any of its Affiliates; or (ii) is lawfully
acquired by Seller, any of its Affiliates from and after the Closing from
sources which are not prohibited from disclosing such information by a legal,
contractual or fiduciary obligation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any
Seller or any of its Affiliates are compelled to disclose any such information
by judicial or administrative process or by other requirements of Law, such
Seller shall promptly notify the Buyer in writing and shall disclose only that
portion of such information which such Seller is advised by its counsel in
writing is legally required to be disclosed; provided, that such Seller shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain an appropriate protective order
or other reasonable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded
such information.

(b) During the applicable Restricted Period, no Restricted Seller shall, nor
shall any Restricted Seller permit any of his, her or its Representatives or
Affiliates to, directly or indirectly: (i) engage in the Restricted Business
in the Territory; or (ii) have an interest in any Person that engages in the
Restricted Business in the Territory, including as a partner, shareholder,
member, employee, principal, agent, trustee or consultant. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, each Restricted Seller may own, directly or indirectly, solely as
an investment, securities of any Person traded on any national securities
exchange if no Restricted Seller is a controlling Person of, or a member of a
group which controls, such Person and such Persons collectively do not,
directly or indirectly, own 5% or more of any class of securities of such
Person.

(c) During the applicable Restricted Period, no Restricted Seller shall, nor
shall any Restricted Seller permit any of his, her or its Representatives or
Affiliates to, directly or indirectly: (i) solicit or encourage any employees
or independent contractors to leave his or her employment with the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, except pursuant to a general solicitation which is
not directed specifically to any such employees or independent contractors; or
(ii) solicit or entice any clients, customers, distributors, suppliers,
vendors, service providers or others having business relations with the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries for purposes of diverting their business or
services from the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

(d) During the three (3) year period following the Closing Date, no HKW Party
shall, for its own account or that of another Person, directly or indirectly,
solicit or encourage any member of the Management Team to leave his employment
with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, except pursuant to a general
solicitation which is not directed specifically to any such Management Team
member.

(e) Each Restricted Seller and HKW Party acknowledges that a breach or
threatened breach of this Section 8.08 would give rise to irreparable harm to
the Buyer, for which monetary damages would not be an adequate remedy, and
hereby agrees that in the event of a breach or a threatened breach by such
Restricted Seller or HKW Party of any such obligations, the Buyer shall, in
addition to any and all other rights and remedies that may be available to it
in respect of such breach, be entitled to seek equitable relief, including a
temporary restraining order, an injunction, specific performance and any other
relief that may be available from a court of competent jurisdiction (without
any requirement to post bond).

(f) Each Restricted Seller and HKW Party acknowledges that the restrictions
contained in this Section 8.08 are reasonable and necessary to protect the
legitimate interests of the Buyer and constitute a material inducement to the
Buyer to enter into this Agreement and consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. In the event that any covenant contained in
this Section 8.08 should ever be adjudicated to exceed the time, geographic,
product or service, or other limitations permitted by applicable Law in any
jurisdiction, then any court is expressly empowered to reform such covenant,
and such covenant shall be deemed reformed, in such jurisdiction to the
maximum time, geographic, product or service, or other limitations permitted
by applicable Law. The covenants contained in this Section 8.08 and each
provision hereof are severable and distinct covenants and provisions. The
invalidity or unenforceability of any such covenant or provision as written
shall not invalidate or render unenforceable the remaining covenants or
provisions hereof, and any such invalidity or unenforceability in any
jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such covenant or
provision in any other jurisdiction.

LIMITATIONS ON INDEMNITY FOR BREACHES OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES AND
TAX MATTERS; ULTIMATE PURCHASE PRICE CAP 

(a) Except for claims for Losses based on fraud of the Sellers or the Company,
the Buyer Indemnified Persons may not assert any General Claim against the
Sellers, and the Sellers shall not be liable for any General Claim Losses, in
respect of any individual claim or series of claims having the same nature or
origin where the Losses relating thereto are less than $50,000, and such
Losses will not be aggregated or considered for purposes of calculating
whether the Indemnity Basket has been exceeded under clause (b) below.

(b) Except for claims for Losses based on fraud of the Sellers or the Company,
the Buyer Indemnified Persons may not assert any General Claim against the
Sellers, and the Sellers shall not be liable for any General Claims or General
Claim Losses, unless and until the aggregate amount of all General Claim
Losses exceeds the Indemnity Basket. If the aggregate amount of all General
Claim Losses exceeds the Indemnity Basket, the Buyer Indemnified Persons may
recover General Claim Losses from the Sellers to the extent, and only to the
extent, the aggregate amount of all General Claim Losses exceeds the Indemnity
Basket, and then from, and only to the extent of, the Indemnity Escrow Balance
(if any). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, and for
the avoidance of doubt, except for claims for Losses based on fraud of the
Sellers or the Company: (i) in no event shall the Sellers have any liability
or obligation for General Claims or General Claim Losses beyond the Indemnity
Escrow Balance, if any; and (ii) the sole recourse of the Buyer Indemnified
Persons for General Claims and General Claim Losses shall be limited to (A)
recovery from the Indemnity Escrow Balance, if any, and (B) recovery from the
RandW Insurance Policy (subject to the terms thereof, including all exclusions,
retentions and policy limits).

(c) Except for claims for Losses based on fraud of the Sellers or the Company,
the Buyer Indemnified Persons may not assert any Fundamental Claim against the
Sellers, and the Sellers shall not be liable for any Fundamental Claims or
Fundamental Claim Losses, to the extent the sum of all General Claim Losses
and all Fundamental Claim Losses exceeds the then current retention under the
RandW Insurance Policy. Subject to the preceding sentence, in the event the
Buyer Indemnified Persons have Fundamental Claims, such Fundamental Claims and
the Fundamental Claim Losses relating thereto shall be satisfied as follows:

(i) in the case of Fundamental Claims and Fundamental Claim Losses relating to
Section 10.01(a)(i), by the applicable Seller, severally; and

(ii) in the case of Fundamental Claims and Fundamental Claim Losses relating
to Section 10.01(b)(i) and/or Section 10.01(b)(iii):

(A) first, from and to the extent of the Indemnity Escrow Balance, if any; and

(B) second, by the Sellers, pro-rata in accordance with their respective
Applicable Total Percentages;

in each case, until the aggregate amount of all General Claim Losses and all
Fundamental Claim Losses equals the then current retention under the RandW
Insurance Policy.

(d) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and notwithstanding
anything to the contrary set forth herein, in no event shall the Sellers be
liable to the Buyer Indemnified Persons for Losses under this Article X to the
extent such Losses are greater than the proceeds of the Purchase Price
received by all Sellers. In no event shall any individual Seller be liable to
the Buyer Indemnified Persons for Losses under this Article X to the extent
such Losses are greater than the portion of the Purchase Price actually
received by such Seller.

SECTION 10.04.

|

MITIGATION OF LOSSES 

The Buyer Indemnified Persons shall (and, after the Closing, the Company shall
and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) use commercially reasonable efforts to

claims against third parties, by qualifying for a benefit that may reduce or
eliminate an indemnified matter, or otherwise.

Payments by any Seller pursuant to this Article X in respect of any Loss shall
be limited to the amount of any liability or damage that remains after
deducting therefrom any insurance proceeds and any indemnity, contribution or
other similar payment actually received by the Buyer Indemnified Persons or
any of their respective Affiliates in respect of any such Loss; provided, that
the amount of such proceeds or payment actually received shall be net of: (a)
any deductibles for the applicable insurance policies; (b) any increase in the
premium for the applicable insurance policies arising from such Losses; and
(c) any other reasonable, documented costs incurred in connection with
collecting such proceeds or payment.

| 
---|--- 

SECTION 10.06.

|

TAX BENEFITS 

Payments by any Seller pursuant to this Article X in respect of any Loss shall
be reduced by an amount equal to any net Tax benefit actually realized as a
result of such Loss in the year such Loss was incurred by the Buyer
Indemnified Persons or any of their respective Affiliates in respect of any
such Loss.

| 
---|--- 

SECTION 10.07.

|

INDEMNITY AS SOLE RECOURSE 

The sole recourse and exclusive remedy of the Buyer Indemnified Persons for
breaches of or inaccuracies in any representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements contained in this Agreement, or in any certificate delivered in
connection herewith, shall be indemnification under this Article X and the
Buyer Indemnified Persons may not bring any other claim whatsoever in
connection therewith. The foregoing provisions of this Section 10.07 shall
not: (a) preclude the Buyer Indemnified Persons from (i) asserting other
remedies in connection with claims based on fraud, (ii) seeking injunctive or
other equitable relief, (iii) exercising their rights under or pursuant to
Section 14.10, or (iv) asserting claims against the RandW Insurance Policy; or
(b) supersede the dispute resolution procedures set forth in Section 2.04 or
Section 11.01.

| 
---|--- 

SECTION 10.08.

|

NO DUPLICATION OF RECOVERY 

In no event shall any Buyer Indemnified Person have any right to
indemnification, or otherwise, from any Seller under this Article X to the
extent any of the facts or circumstances relating to such claim for
indemnification have been finally resolved pursuant to Section 2.04 above
(whether as a result of the agreement of the parties, the failure of a party
to timely notify the other of a dispute, or resolution of the Independent
Accountants). Any liability for indemnification under this Agreement shall be
determined without duplication of recovery by reason of the state of facts
giving rise to such liability constituting a breach of more than one
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement.

| 
---|--- 

SECTION 10.09.

|

THIRD-PARTY CLAIMS 

(a) Promptly after receipt by an Indemnified Person of notice of the assertion
of a claim against it by a third party (i.e., a Person that is not a Buyer
Indemnified Person or a Seller Indemnified Person, or one of their respective
Affiliates) for which the Indemnified Person is entitled to indemnity
hereunder (a "Third-Party Claim"), the Indemnified Person shall give notice to
the Indemnifying Person of the assertion of such Third-Party Claim; provided,
however, that the failure to promptly notify the Indemnifying Person will not
relieve the Indemnifying Person of any liability that it may have to any
Indemnified Person, except to the extent that the Indemnifying Person
demonstrates that the defense of such Third-Party Claim is prejudiced by the
Indemnified Person's failure to give such notice. Such notice by the
Indemnified Person shall: (i) describe the Third-Party Claim in reasonable
detail; (ii) include copies of all material written evidence thereof; and
(iii) indicate the estimated amount, if reasonably practicable, of the Loss
that has been or may be sustained by the Indemnified Person.

(b) If an Indemnified Person gives notice to the Indemnifying Person pursuant
to Section 10.09(a) of the assertion of a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying
Person shall be entitled to participate in the defense of such Third-Party
Claim at its sole cost and expense and, to the extent that it wishes, to
assume the defense of such Third-Party Claim with counsel satisfactory to the
Indemnifying Person. After notice from the Indemnifying Person to the
Indemnified Person of its election to assume the defense of such Third-Party
Claim, the Indemnifying Person shall not, so long as it diligently conducts
such defense, be liable to the Indemnified Person under this Article X for any
fees or costs of other counsel or any other expenses with respect to the
defense of such Third-Party Claim, in each case subsequently incurred by the
Indemnified Person in connection with the defense of such Third-Party Claim.

(c) The Indemnified Person shall have the right, at its own cost and expense,
to participate in the defense of any Third-Party Claim with counsel selected
by it subject to the Indemnifying Person's right to control the defense
thereof. If the Indemnifying Person elects not to compromise or defend such
Third-Party Claim or fails to notify the Indemnified Person in writing of its
election to defend as provided in this Agreement, the Indemnified Person may,
subject to Section 10.09(d), pay, compromise or defend such Third-Party Claim
and seek indemnification for any and all Losses based upon, arising from or
relating to such Third-Party Claim (subject to the limitations on
indemnification and the recovery of Losses provided herein). The parties
hereto shall (and shall cause their respective Affiliates and Representatives
to) cooperate with each other in all reasonable respects in connection with
the defense of any Third-Party Claim, including making available records
relating to such Third-Party Claim and, without expense (other than
reimbursement of actual out-of-pocket expenses) to the defending party,
management employees of the non-defending party as may be reasonably necessary
for the preparation of the defense of such Third-Party Claim.

(d) In the event the Indemnifying Person assumes the defense of any Third-
Party Claim, the Indemnifying Person shall not enter into settlement of any
Third-Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Person
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed),
unless: (i) there is no finding or admission of any violation of Law by the
Indemnified Person in such settlement; (ii) the sole relief provided in such
settlement is monetary damages that are paid in full by the Indemnifying
Person; and (iii) such settlement provides, in customary form, for the release
of the Indemnified Person from all liabilities and obligations in connection
with such Third-Party Claim. If, however, the Indemnifying Person does not
assume the defense of the Third-Party Claim, the Indemnified Person shall not
agree to any settlement thereof without the written consent of the
Indemnifying Person (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), unless: (x) there is no finding or admission of any
violation of Law by the Indemnifying Person in such settlement; (y) the sole
relief provided in such settlement is monetary damages; and (z) such
settlement provides, in customary form, for the release of the Indemnifying
Person from all liabilities and obligations in connection with such Third-
Party Claim.

SECTION 10.10.

|

SUBROGATION 

If any Buyer Indemnified Person is indemnified for any Losses pursuant to this
Agreement with respect to any claim by a Person not party to this Agreement,
then the Sellers will be subrogated to all rights and remedies of the Buyer
Indemnified Person against such third party, and the Buyer will, and will
cause each of the other Buyer Indemnified Persons to, cooperate with and
assist the Sellers in asserting all such rights and remedies against such
third party; provided, however, that the Buyer agrees that the RandW Insurance
Policy shall provide that there shall be no subrogation against the Sellers or
any of their Affiliates for any claims made by the Buyer Indemnified Persons
under the RandW Insurance Policy, other than in connection with a claim against
the Sellers for fraud.

| 
---|--- 

SECTION 10.11.

|

ADJUSTMENTS TO THE PURCHASE PRICE 

The parties hereto shall treat any amounts payable under this Article X by the
Sellers as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes, unless
otherwise required by Law.

| 
---|--- 

SECTION 10.12.

|

TERMINATION UPON CHANGE IN CONTROL 

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, effective as of a
Change in Control: (a) the indemnification and other obligations of the
Sellers set forth in this Article X will terminate immediately and be of no
further force or effect; and (b) the Buyer Indemnified Persons, on behalf of
themselves and any Person claiming by, through or under them, whether
derivatively or otherwise (including, for the avoidance of doubt, each Person
included in the definition of Buyer Indemnified Persons), hereby irrevocably
and unconditionally releases, acquits and forever discharges the Sellers and
their respective Affiliates, Representatives, successors and assigns, and all
of their respective assets, tangible and intangible, real and personal, from
all liabilities, obligations, actions, causes of actions, suits, expenses,
costs, debts, sums of money, accounts and/or other claims or demands
whatsoever, in law, equity or otherwise, whether fixed or contingent, known or
unknown, which the Buyer Indemnified Persons ever had, now have or hereafter
may have, upon or by reason of, or arising out of, this Agreement or any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

ARTICLE XI 
TAX MATTERS

| 
---|--- 

SECTION 11.01.

|

PREPARATION OF TAX RETURNS 

The Buyer shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, all Tax Returns required to
be filed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries after the Closing Date with
respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period. All such Tax Returns shall be prepared
in a manner consistent with past practice (unless otherwise required by Law)
and without a change of any election or any accounting method and shall be
submitted by the Buyer to the Sellers' Representative (together with
schedules, statements and, to the extent requested by the Sellers'
Representative, supporting documentation) at least thirty (30) days prior to
the due date (including extensions) of such Tax Return. If the Sellers'
Representative objects to any item on any such Tax Return, it shall, within
ten (10) days after delivery of such Tax Return, notify the Buyer in writing
that it so objects, specifying with reasonable particularity any such item and
stating the specific factual or legal basis for any such objection. If a
notice of objection shall be duly delivered, the Buyer and the Sellers'
Representative shall negotiate in good faith and use commercially reasonable
efforts to resolve such items. If the Buyer and the Sellers' Representative
are unable to reach such agreement within ten (10) days after receipt by the
Buyer of such notice, the disputed items shall be resolved by the Independent
Accountants and any determination by the Independent Accountants shall be
final. If the Independent Accountants are unable to resolve any disputed items
before the due date for such Tax Return, the Tax Return shall be filed as
prepared by the Buyer and then amended to reflect the Independent Accountants'
resolution. The costs, fees and expenses of the Independent Accountants (and
the cost of so amending any such Tax Returns) shall be borne equally by the
Buyer, on the one hand, and the Sellers in proportion to their Applicable
Total Percentages, on the other hand. Except to the extent otherwise included
in the calculation of Closing Date Working Capital or Indebtedness (in each
case as finally determined pursuant to Section 2.04), pursuant to Section
10.01(b)(iii), the Sellers shall bear the responsibility (in proportion to
their Applicable Total Percentages) for the Taxes shown as due on all such Tax
Returns for all periods (or portions thereof allocated to the Sellers pursuant
to Section 11.09) through the end of the Closing Date. The preparation and
filing of any Tax Return of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that does
not relate to a Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be exclusively within the control
of the Buyer.

| 
---|--- 

SECTION 11.02.

|

BUYER TAX ACTS 

Without the prior written consent of the Sellers' Representative (which may
not be unreasonably conditioned, delayed or withheld) and except as otherwise
required by applicable Law, from and after the Closing, the Buyer, the Company
and its Subsidiaries shall not (each of the following, a "Buyer Tax Act"):

(a) make, change or rescind any Tax election, amend any Tax Return or take any
position on any Tax Return that would have the effect of materially increasing
the Tax liability or materially reducing any Tax asset of the Sellers, the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries in respect of any Pre-Closing Tax Period;

(b) agree with any Governmental Authority to extend the applicable statute of
limitations with respect to any Tax Returns of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries for any Pre-Closing Tax Period;

(c) initiate any voluntary contact with a Governmental Authority (including
any taxing authority) with respect to a Tax Return for a Pre-Closing Tax
Period;

(d) file a Tax Return for a Pre-Closing Tax Period in a jurisdiction in which
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries did not file such Tax Return prior to
the Closing; or

(e) take any action relating to Taxes that creates or that is reasonably
likely to create a material Tax liability on the Closing Date or for any Pre-
Closing Tax Period and that is outside the ordinary course of business,
including: (i) any transfer of equity securities; (ii) any merger,
amalgamation, conversion, reorganization or recapitalization; and (iii) any
amendment or restatement of the Governing Documents of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries with retroactive effect (in each case, for the avoidance of
doubt, to the extent such transfer, merger, amalgamation, conversion,
reorganization, recapitalization, amendment or restatement is reasonably
likely to create a material Tax liability on the Closing Date or for any Pre-
Closing Tax Period).

Any Taxes resulting from any Buyer Tax Act shall be borne solely by the Buyer.

| 
---|--- 

SECTION 11.03.

|

TAX BENEFITS OF PRE-CLOSING MATTERS 

The parties shall, and after the Closing the Buyer shall cause the Company and
its Subsidiaries to, include on the Tax Returns of the Company for the Pre-
Closing Tax Period that ends on the Closing Date, any Transaction Tax
Deductions applicable to the taxable year that includes the Closing Date,
unless otherwise required by Law, and all such Transaction Tax Deductions
shall be for the benefit of the Sellers. To the extent the Transaction Tax
Deductions (or any portion thereof) results in the Buyer, the Company, any of
its Subsidiaries or any of their Affiliates actually realizing a Tax benefit
after the Closing Date, the Buyer shall promptly so notify the Sellers'
Representative in writing, and such Tax benefit shall be treated as a Tax
Refund giving rise to a payment under Section 11.07. All Tax benefits
resulting from a Transaction Tax Deduction shall be computed assuming that the
Buyer and the Company and any of its Subsidiaries recognize all other current
and available items of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit, and, to the
extent not otherwise included in clause (b) of the definition of Transaction
Tax Deductions, use all net operating loss carryforwards (other than any that
may be created or increased as a result of the Transaction Tax Deductions)
whether now existing or hereafter available, before recognizing any Tax
benefit as a result of or attributable to any Transaction Tax Deductions, and
the amount of the Tax benefit shall be determined on a with and without basis.

| 
---|--- 

SECTION 11.04.

|

MUTUAL COOPERATION 

The parties shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested
by the other party, in connection with the filing of Tax Returns and any
audit, Litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation
shall include the retention (consistent with each party's document retention
policy) and (upon the other party's request) the provision of records and
information which are reasonably relevant to any such Tax Return, audit,
Litigation or other proceeding and making employees available on a mutually
convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any
material provided hereunder.

| 
---|--- 

SECTION 11.05.

|

WITHHOLDINGS 

Except to the extent provided in Article II above or as otherwise required by
applicable Law, neither the Buyer nor the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
shall withhold any amount of the Purchase Price paid to or on behalf of the
Sellers. The Buyer and the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to obtain any certificate or other document from any Governmental Authority or
any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax
that could be imposed with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

| 
---|--- 

SECTION 11.06.

|

AUDITS AND EXAMINATIONS 

After the Closing, the Buyer shall have the exclusive authority to control any
audit or examination of Taxes relating to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. Subject to the foregoing, the Buyer, the Company and its
Subsidiaries shall allow the Sellers' Representative, on behalf of the
Sellers, to participate at the Sellers' expense (in accordance with the
respective Applicable Total Percentages) in any audits or examinations of
Taxes to the extent that such audits or examinations could require any Seller
to make a payment under this Agreement. Neither the Buyer nor the Company
shall (nor shall they permit any Subsidiary to) settle any such audit or
examination in a manner which would adversely affect any Seller, or cause any
Seller to pay any amount under this Agreement, without the prior written
consent of the Sellers' Representative, which consent shall not unreasonably
be withheld, conditioned or delayed. So long as any Pre-Closing Tax Periods of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries remain open for an assessment of Tax,
the parties shall notify the other in writing within fifteen (15) Business
Days after receipt of written or oral notice of: (a) any pending or threatened
audit or assessment with respect to Taxes of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries relating to any Pre-Closing Tax Period; and (b) any pending or
threatened audit or assessment with respect to Taxes of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries that could reasonably be expected affect Tax liabilities for
any Pre-Closing Tax Period.

| 
---|--- 

SECTION 11.07.

|

TAX REFUNDS 

The Buyer and the Company shall (and they shall cause the Subsidiaries to)
file such amendments to Tax Returns and make such claims for refunds for Pre-
Closing Tax Periods as the Sellers' Representative may from time-to-time
reasonably request, at the cost and expense of the Sellers (in accordance with
their Applicable Total Percentages). Without duplication for any payments made
pursuant to Section 11.03, any Tax refunds (and interest thereon) that are
received by the Buyer, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and any credits
that actually reduce the Buyer's, the Company's or any of its Subsidiaries'
cash Tax liability, that relate to Taxes for any Pre-Closing Tax Period (in
each case other than refunds or credits (i) attributable to losses, deductions
or other Tax items carried back from a period after the Closing Date to a Pre-
Closing Tax Period (other than Transaction Tax Deductions for the avoidance of
doubt) or (ii) relating to Taxes that were not paid or deemed paid (including
by way of inclusion in the calculation of the Final Adjusted Purchase Price)
by the Sellers or, in a Pre-Closing Tax Period, by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries) (each, a "Tax Refund") shall be for the account of the Sellers
and shall be paid as provided below in this Section 11.07. To the extent an
accrual or reserve for a Tax included in the Closing Date Working Capital (as
finally determined pursuant to Section 2.04) exceeds the amount of Taxes
actually paid with respect to such item, the excess shall be treated as a Tax
Refund for the benefit of Sellers under this Section 11.07. For the avoidance
of doubt, any refund or credit resulting from or relating to any Tax asset or
Tax attribute (including without limitation Tax basis and net operating loss
carryovers, but excluding Transaction Tax Deductions) of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, whether or not arising in or from a Pre-Closing Tax Period,
shall not be a Tax Refund. Promptly but in no event later than twenty (20)
days of the date on which the Buyer, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
receives a Tax Refund: (a) the Buyer shall pay, or cause to be paid, to the
Sellers' Representative (for further payment as provided below) the amount of
such Tax Refund. Promptly, and in any event within two (2) Business Days,
after receipt of such Tax Refund, but subject to Section 13.02, the Sellers'
Representative shall pay each Seller an amount equal to such Seller's
Applicable Total Percentage of such Tax Refund (less any portion thereof that
the Company or its Subsidiaries are required to withhold under applicable Law,
which amounts the Sellers' Representative shall pay to the Company or its
Subsidiaries as applicable).

| 
---|--- 

SECTION 11.08.

|

TRANSFER TAXES 

All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other similar
Taxes and other governmental charges, and all conveyance fees, recording
charges and other similar fees and charges (including any penalties and
interest) incurred in connection with consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (collectively, "Transfer Taxes") shall be paid
by the Buyer. Each party hereto shall use its commercially reasonable efforts
to minimize the amount of such Transfer Taxes and to cooperate in the
preparation, execution and filing of all Tax Returns and other documents
required in connection with such Transfer Taxes.

| 
---|--- 

SECTION 11.09.

|

STRADDLE PERIODS 

For purposes of calculating the Tax liability of the Company and its
Subsidiaries for any taxable period beginning on or before the Closing Date
and ending after the Closing Date (a "Straddle Period"), the portion of any
Tax that is allocable to the portion of such Straddle Period ending at the
close of business on the Closing Date shall be: (a) in the case of real
property Taxes, personal property Taxes and similar ad valorem Taxes, deemed
to be an amount equal to the product of such Taxes for the entire Straddle
Period and a fraction the numerator of which is the number of calendar days in
the portion of such Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date and the
denominator of which is the number of calendar days in the entire Straddle
Period; and (b) in the case of Taxes other than those described in clause (a)
above, determined from the books and records of the Company or its
Subsidiaries, as applicable, as though the taxable year of such Persons
terminated at the close of business on the Closing Date. Consistent with the
foregoing, in the case of any items of income, gain, deduction, loss or credit
for federal and applicable state income tax purposes attributable to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries for a Straddle Period, the parties shall
cooperate to cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to allocate such items
based on its books and records as though its taxable year terminated at the
close of business on the Closing Date.

| 
---|--- 

SECTION 11.10.

|

TAXATION OF ESCROW AMOUNT 

For all relevant Tax purposes, the parties shall treat the Escrow Amount as an
asset of the Buyer until the release of such funds to the Sellers'
Representative (for the benefit of the Sellers) and the Buyer shall pay all
Taxes on any interest or other income earned with respect to such funds until
such funds are so released to the Sellers' Representative (for the benefit of
the Sellers).

| 
---|--- 

SECTION 11.11.

|

NO CODE SECTION 338 ELECTION 

Neither the Buyer, the Company nor any of their Affiliates will make (or
permit to be made) any election under Section 338 of the Code with respect to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

| 
---|--- 

SECTION 11.12.

|

OVERLAP 

To the extent that any obligation or responsibility pursuant to Article X
overlaps with an obligation or responsibility pursuant to this Article XI, the
provisions of this Article XI shall govern.

comply with its obligations under this Agreement) and the Buyer has not waived
such condition on or before such date;

forth in Section 9.02 (other than conditions that by their terms are to be

the Sellers' Representative, which such calculations shall be deemed final and
binding on such Seller, absent manifest error.

Representative shall have no authority to act as attorney-in-fact or otherwise
for any Seller: (a) with respect to any indemnity claim solely against such

Seller shall be entitled to resolve any and all Several Claims; or (b) without
the consent of the applicable Seller, in connection with an amendment or
modification of this Agreement that (i) results in any increase in liability
to such Seller from the liabilities described in this Agreement, (ii) results
in any reduction in compensation to be provided to such Seller, (iii)
adversely and disproportionately affects such Seller as compared to any other
Seller, or (iv) subjects such Seller to any restrictive covenants (e.g.,
covenants regarding non-competition, non-solicitation, non-disparagement or
confidentiality) beyond those restrictive covenants agreed to by such Seller
in connection with the Closing, other than (in the case of clauses (i) and

SECTION 13.05.

|

LIMITATIONS ON LIABILITY 

(a) The Sellers' Representative is acting solely in an agency capacity in
connection with this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement and will have no
personal liability to any Person for any action taken, or inaction, in its
capacity of the Sellers' Representative, except to the extent it is determined
by a court of competent jurisdiction, in a final non-appealable order, to have
resulted directly and solely from the gross negligence or willful misconduct
of the Sellers' Representative. WITHOUT LIMITING THE GENERALITY OF THE
FOREGOING, IN NO EVENT SHALL THE SELLERS' REPRESENTATIVE BE LIABLE TO ANY
SELLER FOR ANY SPECIAL, SPECULATIVE, REMOTE, EXEMPLARY, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,
TREBLE, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES.

(b) In connection with the exercise of its duties, the Sellers' Representative
will be entitled to consult with and rely upon legal counsel (including
Sellers' Counsel) and other professional advisors, with the costs thereof (and
all other out-of-pocket costs reasonably incurred by the Sellers'
Representative incident to discharging its duties under this Agreement) to be
allocated among the Sellers in accordance with their respective Applicable
Total Percentages (the amount of which may be withheld from any payment due to
such Seller hereunder).

(c) The Sellers' Representative shall be protected in acting upon any written
notice, consent, receipt or other paper or document furnished to it, not only
as to its due execution, validity and effectiveness, but also as to the truth
and accuracy of any information therein contained, without inquiry. The
Sellers' Representative shall not be liable for any error of judgment or for
any act done or step taken or omitted by it in good faith, or for any mistake
of fact or Law.

(d) The Sellers' Representative shall have no duties except those which are
expressly set forth herein.

(e) Each Seller, in accordance with such Seller's respective Applicable Total
Percentage, shall indemnify, defend and hold the Sellers' Representative
harmless from and against any and all claims, losses, liabilities, damages and
expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and costs) which the Sellers'
Representative may suffer or sustain as a result of any action taken, or not
taken, in good faith hereunder. In the event the Holdback Amount is not
sufficient to satisfy and pay in full all expenses and obligations of the
Sellers' Representative likely to be incurred by the Sellers' Representative
in fulfilling its obligations hereunder, the Sellers' Representative shall not
be obligated to take any action contemplated by this Agreement until the
Sellers shall have paid to the Sellers' Representative sufficient amounts to
pay in full all such expenses and obligations (which payment shall be made by
the Sellers in accordance with their respective Applicable Total Percentages).

---|--- 

SECTION 13.06.

|

INVESTMENT OF THE HOLDBACK AMOUNT 

The Sellers' Representative may hold, invest, reinvest and/or deposit the
Holdback Amount in: (a) direct obligations of, or obligations guaranteed by,
the United States of America; (b) certificates of deposit, checking, savings
or money market accounts of any bank or trust company organized under the Laws
of the United States of America, or any state; or (c) such other accounts or
investments as it reasonably determines (including non-interest bearing
accounts). The Sellers' Representative shall have no liability for investment
losses.

SECTION 13.07.

|

SUCCESSOR SELLERS' REPRESENTATIVES 

HKW may resign as the Sellers' Representative at any time upon no less than
thirty (30) days' written notice to the Sellers. Upon such resignation, the
Sellers shall appoint (by majority vote in accordance with their Applicable
Total Percentages) a successor Sellers' Representative to act hereunder.
Promptly following appointment of a successor Sellers' Representative, HKW
shall distribute the then remaining portion of the Holdback Amount to the
successor Sellers' Representative, less all costs, fees and expenses which it
reasonably believes it may be obligated to pay thereafter in connection this
Agreement. If within thirty (30) days after the effective date of the
resignation of HKW as the Sellers' Representative hereunder a successor has
not been appointed as provided above, HKW may apply to a court of competent
jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Sellers' Representative and
the costs, expenses and attorneys' fees which are incurred in connection with
such a proceeding shall be paid from the Holdback Amount (with any excess paid
by the Sellers in accordance with their respective Applicable Total
Percentages). Upon delivery of the then remaining portion of the Holdback
Amount as provided above, HKW shall be discharged of all further obligations
hereunder.

| 
---|--- 

SECTION 13.08.

|

DISTRIBUTION OF THE HOLDBACK AMOUNT 

(a) The Holdback Amount shall be held and disbursed by the Sellers'
Representative as provided in this Section 13.08. The Sellers' Representative
may use all or any portion of the Holdback Amount to satisfy any future
obligations that may be owed by the Sellers, or any of them, under this
Agreement or otherwise in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (other than obligations relating to Several
Claims), or to satisfy any future costs, expenses, liabilities, Taxes or other
amounts that the Sellers' Representative may incur in connection with acting
in such capacity under this Agreement.

(b) Promptly following the date on which the Sellers' Representative
determines that all liabilities and obligations of the Sellers hereunder or
under the Escrow Agreement (other than obligations relating to Several Claims)
and all costs, expenses, liabilities, Taxes or other amounts that the Sellers'
Representative may incur in connection with acting in such capacity under this
Agreement have been satisfied, the Sellers' Representative shall disburse any
remaining portion of the Holdback Amount to the Sellers in proportion to their
respective Applicable Total Percentages, and at any time prior thereto the
Sellers' Representative may (in its sole and absolute discretion) distribute
any portion thereof in such proportion.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein contained, the Sellers'
Representative may distribute any amounts it receives hereunder (whether or
not a part of the Holdback Amount) among the Sellers in a proportion
reasonably determined by it to reflect the economic intent of this Agreement
with respect to the allocation of the consideration payable hereunder and the
intended proportional liabilities of the Sellers under this Agreement.
Sellers' sole and exclusive recourse for any claim of the misapplication of
any amounts by the Sellers' Representative shall be a right of contribution
from the remaining Sellers, other than for any claim against the Sellers'
Representative for gross negligence or willful misconduct in the application
of such amounts.

(d) All distributions from the Sellers' Representative to the Sellers shall be
made by wire transfer of immediately available funds (or by check, if
requested in writing by a Seller) to an account directed in writing by the
Seller. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein contained, in no event
shall the Sellers' Representative have any obligation to distribute funds to a
Seller until such Seller provides the Sellers' Representative with a written
payment direction for such distribution.

| 
---|--- 

SECTION 13.09.

|

Laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to such jurisdiction's conflict
of laws principles.

(b) Any controversy, claim or dispute arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or the breach, termination, enforceability or validity of this
Agreement, shall be brought only in the United States District Court for the

jurisdiction of each such court in any such matter, waives any objection it
may now or hereafter have to venue or to convenience of forum, agrees that all
claims in respect of the matter shall be heard and determined only in any such
court and agrees not to bring any such matter arising out of or relating to

| 
---|--- 

SECTION 14.05.

|

PARTIAL INVALIDITY 

In case any one or more of the provisions contained herein shall, for any
reason, be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such
invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other
provisions of this Agreement, but this Agreement shall be construed as if such
invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision or provisions had never been
contained herein. If the final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction
declares that any term or provision hereof is invalid or unenforceable, the
parties agree that the court making the determination of invalidity or
unenforceability shall have the power to reduce the scope, duration or area of
the term or provision, to delete specific words or phrases, or to replace any
invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a term or provision that is
valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of
the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this Agreement shall be
enforceable as so modified after the expiration of the time within which the
judgment may be appealed.

| 
---|--- 

SECTION 14.06.

|

EXECUTION IN COUNTERPARTS; FACSIMILE AND E-MAIL SIGNATURES 

This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which
shall be considered an original counterpart, and all of which shall be
considered to be but one agreement and shall become a binding agreement when
each party shall have executed one counterpart and delivered it to the other
party hereto. A signature affixed to a counterpart of this Agreement and
delivered by facsimile or electronic mail by any Person is intended to be its,
his or her signature and shall be valid, binding and enforceable against the
party on whose behalf it has been affixed.

| 
---|--- 

SECTION 14.07.

|

ENTIRE AGREEMENT; AMENDMENTS AND WAIVERS 

This Agreement (along with the Confidentiality Agreement and each other
agreement, certificate, document or instrument executed in connection
herewith) contains the entire understanding of the parties hereto with regard
to the subject matter contained in this Agreement and supersedes all prior
agreements or understandings of the parties. Subject to Section 8.01(e) and
Section 13.04, the parties may amend, modify and supplement this Agreement
only by the written agreement of the Buyer, on the one hand, and the Sellers'
Representative, on the other hand; provided, however, that nothing set forth
in Section 14.11 shall be amended or restated without the prior written
consent of Sellers' Counsel (who are, for the avoidance of doubt, expressly
made third-party beneficiaries of this Agreement). The failure of any party to
this Agreement to enforce at any time any provision of this Agreement shall
not be construed to be a waiver of such provision, nor in any way to affect
the validity of this Agreement or any part hereof or the right of such party
thereafter to enforce each and every such provision. No waiver of any breach
of this Agreement shall be held to constitute a waiver of any other or
subsequent breach.

| 
---|--- 

SECTION 14.08.

|

PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENTS 

The parties shall consult with each other before making or issuing, or causing
or permitting any Person to make or issue, any public statement or press
release with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. No party shall issue any press release or make any public
statement before obtaining the other parties' prior written approval, except
that no such approval shall be necessary to the extent disclosure may be
required by Law or stock exchange requirements (based upon the reasonable
advice of counsel), in which case the party issuing such press release or
making such public statement shall make reasonable efforts to notify the other
of the existence of such requirement prior to publication. The Buyer and the
Sellers' Representative will consult with each other concerning the means by
which employees, customers, suppliers and others having dealings with Company
or any of its Subsidiaries will be informed of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, if at all, and the Buyer will have the right to be present
for any such communication. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this
Section 14.08 shall limit or prohibit any private equity fund or sponsor
associated with the Buyer or any Seller from disclosing the financial terms
and conditions, or any other terms and conditions, of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement to limited partners and
Affiliates, or in connection with fund raising activities, provided that such
parties are appraised of the confidential, non-public nature of such
information and subject to confidentiality restrictions no less restrictive
than those set forth in the Confidentiality Agreement.

| 
---|--- 

SECTION 14.09.

|

NON-RECOURSE PARTIES 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, and for the
avoidance of doubt, in no event shall any Non-Recourse Party have any
liability or obligation whatsoever under this Agreement or in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Buyer (for itself and
each of the other Buyer Indemnified Persons) hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally waives, releases and forever discharges any right it now has,
has had or may hereafter have against any Non-Recourse Party in connection
with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The
Buyer shall not (and shall not permit any Person claiming through it to)
assert or bring any claim against any Non-Recourse Party in connection with
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

| 
---|--- 

SECTION 14.10.

|

SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE 

Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that the rights of each party to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby are unique and recognizes and
affirms that in the event of a breach of this Agreement by any such party,
money damages may be inadequate and the non-breaching party may have no
adequate remedy at Law. Accordingly, the parties hereto agree that such non-
breaching party shall have the right, in addition to any other rights and
remedies existing in its favor at Law or in equity, to seek to enforce its
rights and the other party's obligations hereunder not only by an action for
damages but also by an action, for specific performance, injunctive and/or
other equitable relief (without posting of bond or other security). Each of
the parties hereto agrees not to raise any objections to the availability of
the equitable remedy of specific performance to prevent or restrain breaches
of this Agreement by a Seller or the Company, on the one hand, and to prevent
or restrain breaches of this Agreement by Buyer, on the other hand, and to
specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent
breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the
covenants and obligations of the parties under this Agreement.

| 
---|--- 

SECTION 14.11.

|

FUTURE REPRESENTATION 

If any Seller or the Sellers' Representative so desires, and without the need
for any consent or waiver by Buyer, the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or
any other Seller, Sellers' Counsel is permitted to represent any Seller and/or
the Sellers' Representative after the Closing in connection with any matter
related to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (or any other
document, instrument or agreement enter into in connection herewith, including
the Escrow Agreement) or any disagreement or dispute relating thereto. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, after the Closing, Sellers' Counsel
is permitted to represent any Seller, the Sellers' Representative, any of
their agents and Affiliates, or any one or more of them, in connection with
any negotiation, transaction or dispute with the Buyer, the Company, any of
its Subsidiaries or any of their respective agents or Affiliates under or
relating to this Agreement, any transaction contemplated by this Agreement,
and any related matter, including as claims for indemnification and disputes
involving any other documents, instruments or agreements entered into in
connection with this Agreement. Each of the Buyer and the Company consents to
the disclosure by Sellers' Counsel to the Sellers and the Sellers'
Representative of any information learned by Sellers' Counsel in the course of
its representation of the Sellers, the Company or its Subsidiaries, regardless
of whether such information is subject to attorney-client privilege or
Sellers' Counsel's duty of confidentiality and whether or not such disclosure
is made before or after the Closing. From and after the Closing, the Company
and its Subsidiaries shall cease to have any attorney-client relationship with
Sellers' Counsel unless and to the extent Sellers' Counsel is specifically
engaged in writing by the Company or its Subsidiaries to represent the Company
or any such Subsidiary after the Closing and either: (a) such engagement
involves no conflict of interest with respect to the Sellers (including, for
the avoidance of doubt, the Sellers' Representative); or (b) the Sellers
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Sellers' Representative on their
behalf) consent in writing at the time to such engagement. Any such
representation of the Company or its Subsidiaries by Sellers' Counsel after
the Closing will not affect the foregoing provisions hereof. Furthermore,
Sellers' Counsel is permitted to withdraw from any representation of the
Company or its Subsidiaries in order to be able to represent or continue so
representing any Sellers (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Sellers'
Representative), even if such withdrawal causes the Company, its Subsidiaries
or the Buyer additional expense, delay or other prejudice.

| 
---|--- 

SECTION 14.12.

|

PARTIES IN INTEREST 

This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of each
party hereto and its successors and permitted assigns and, except as
specifically identified herein (including with respect to (a) the Buyer
Indemnified Persons and the Seller Indemnified Persons not parties hereto, (b)
the officers, directors, managers, employees and other individuals with
similar authority of the Company and its Subsidiaries as specifically
contemplated to be included in Section 8.05, (c) the Non-recourse Parties
under Section 14.09, and (d) Sellers' Counsel with respect to Section 14.11,
each of whom is expressly made a third-party beneficiary hereof), nothing in
this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any
other Person any rights, benefits or remedies of any nature whatsoever under
or by reason of this Agreement.
