thirty (30) days following the Closing Date, Sellers shall prepare and
deliver to Buyer a statement (the "Closing Inventory Statement") setting
forth the type and value, as of the Closing Date, of the Inventory
transferred to Buyer on the Closing Date pursuant to Sections 2.1 and 2.3(a),
which statement shall be derived from a physical taking of such Inventory as
of the Closing Date and shall be prepared in a manner consistent with the
standards (the "Inventory Standards") set forth on SCHEDULE 2.9(a). Buyer and
its representatives shall have such opportunity as Buyer reasonably deems
appropriate to observe the taking and reconciliation of such Inventory (which
may begin prior to the Closing Date) in connection with the preparation of
the Closing Inventory Statement. Buyer shall provide Sellers and
their accountants full access to the books and records, to any other
information, including working papers of its accountants, and to any
employees of Buyer, in each case as may be reasonably necessary for Sellers
to prepare the Closing Inventory Statement, to respond to the Buyer\'s
Objection (as defined herein) and to prepare materials for presentation to
the CPA Firm (as defined herein) in connection with the matters contemplated
by Section 2.9(c).   (b) Buyer shall, within thirty (30) days after
the delivery by Sellers of the Closing Inventory Statement, complete its
review thereof. After delivery of the Closing Inventory Statement, Sellers
shall provide Buyer and its accountants full access to all books and records,
to any other information, including working papers of its accountants, and to
any employees of Seller, in each case used in the preparation of the
Closing Inventory Statement or as may otherwise be reasonably necessary for
Buyer to prepare the Buyer\'s Objection and to prepare materials for
presentation to the CPA Firm in connection with the matters contemplated by
Section 2.9(c). The Closing Inventory Statement shall be binding and
conclusive upon, and deemed accepted by, Buyer unless Buyer shall have
notified Sellers in writing within thirty (30) days after delivery of the
Closing Inventory Statement of any objection thereto (the "Buyer\'s
Objection"). The Buyer\'s Objection shall set forth a description of the
basis of the Buyer\'s Objection and the adjustments to the value of Inventory
reflected on the Closing Inventory Statement that Buyer believes should be
made. Any items not disputed during the foregoing thirty (30) day period
shall be deemed to have been accepted by Buyer.   (c) If Sellers and Buyer
are unable to resolve all of their disputes with respect to the Closing
Inventory Statement within thirty (30) days following Sellers\' receipt of
the Buyer\'s Objection to such Closing Inventory Statement pursuant to
Section 2.9(b), they shall refer their remaining differences to Ernst and Young
or, if such firm declines to act or at such time has a significant ongoing
relationship with either Seller, Buyer or any of their respective Affiliates,
an internationally recognized firm of independent public accountants as to
which Sellers and Buyer mutually agree (the "CPA Firm") for decision, which
decision shall be made consistent with the Inventory Standards within forty-
five (45) days and shall be final and binding on the parties, PROVIDED that
the CPA Firm\'s determination as to any item set forth in Buyer\'s Objection
shall not be more beneficial to Sellers than the determination of that item
by Sellers in the Closing Inventory Statement or more beneficial to
Buyer than the determination of that item in Buyer\'s Objection. Any expenses
relating to the engagement of the CPA Firm shall be shared  
-25-   equally by Sellers, on one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand.
Sellers and Buyer shall each bear the fees of their respective auditors
incurred in connection with the determination and review of the Closing
Inventory Statement.   (d) The Closing Inventory Statement shall become
final and binding on the parties upon the earliest of (i) if no Buyer\'s
Objection has been given, the expiration of the period within which Buyer
must make its objection pursuant to Section 2.9(b) hereof, (ii) agreement in
writing by Sellers and Buyer that the Closing Inventory Statement, together
with any modifications thereto agreed to by Sellers and Buyer, shall be final
and binding and (iii) the date on which the CPA Firm shall issue its written
determination with respect to any dispute relating to such Closing Inventory
Statement. The Closing Inventory Statement, as submitted by Sellers if no
timely Buyer\'s Objection has been given or as adjusted pursuant to any
agreement between the parties or as determined pursuant to the decision of
the CPA Firm, when final and binding on all parties, is herein referred to as
the "Final Closing Inventory Statement."   (e) Within ten (10) Business
Days following issuance of the Final Closing Inventory Statement, the net
adjustment payment payable pursuant to this Section 2.9(e) (the "Adjustment
Payment") and interest thereon shall be paid by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to a bank account or bank accounts designated in writing by
Sellers or Buyer, as the case may be; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if the
Adjustment Payment shall be payable by Sellers to Buyer, in lieu of payment,
Sellers may elect to credit the Adjustment Payment against the initial
payments required to be made by Buyer under the Co-Pack Agreement; and
PROVIDED, FURTHER, that if the Adjustment Payment shall be payable by Buyer
to Sellers, in lieu of payment, Buyer may elect to add such payment to the
payments due to Seller under the Co-Pack Agreement as if an amount of
Inventory equal to the Adjustment Payment were sold pursuant to the Co-Pack
Agreement. The Adjustment Payment shall be the difference, if any, between
(x) the value of Inventory, as reflected on the Final Closing
Inventory Statement, minus (y) $51,500,000. The Adjustment Payment shall be
payable by Buyer to Sellers, if positive, and by Sellers (who shall be
jointly and severally so obligated) to Buyer, if negative. The Adjustment
Payment shall bear interest from the Closing Date to the date of payment at
the Closing Date Interest Rate, which interest shall be calculated on the
basis of a 365-day year and the actual number of days elapsed and such
interest shall be paid on the same date and in the same manner as such
Adjustment Payment, PROVIDED that such interest shall not be imposed on
Sellers if they elect to credit the Adjustment Payment against the Co-Pack
Agreement and shall not be imposed on Buyer if it elects to add the
Adjustment Payment to the Payments due under the Co-Pack Agreement.   2.10
CONVERSION DATE INVENTORY.   (a) On the Conversion Date, General Mills shall
sell, convey, transfer and assign to Buyer, or cause its Affiliates to sell,
convey, transfer and assign to Buyer, all inventory (including raw materials,
packaging and work-in-process) held by General Mills for use of the Business
(the "Conversion Date Inventory"). Within thirty (30) days following the
Conversion Date, General Mills, on behalf of Sellers, shall prepare and
deliver to Buyer a statement setting forth the type and value of such
Conversion Date Inventory, as of the Conversion Date, to be transferred and
assigned to Buyer on the Conversion Date, which statement shall be derived
from   -26-   a physical taking of such Conversion Date Inventory as of
the Conversion Date and shall be prepared in a manner consistent with the
Inventory Standards (the "Conversion Date Inventory Statement"). Buyer and
its representatives shall have such opportunity as Buyer reasonably deems
appropriate to observe the taking and reconciliation of such Conversion Date
Inventory (which may begin prior to the Conversion Date) in connection with
the preparation of the Conversion Date Inventory Statement. Buyer shall
provide General Mills and its accountants full access to the books and
records, to any other information, including work papers of its accountants,
and to any employees of Buyer, in each case as may be reasonably necessary
for General Mills to prepare the Conversion Date Inventory Statement, to
respond to the Buyer\'s Conversion Date Objection (as defined herein) and to
prepare materials for presentation to the CPA Firm in connection with the
matters contemplated by Section 2.10(c).   (b) Buyer shall, within thirty
(30) days after the delivery by General Mills of the Conversion Date
Inventory Statement, complete its review thereof. After delivery of the
Conversion Date Inventory Statement, General Mills shall maintain and provide
Buyer and its accountants full access to all books and records, to any other
information, including working papers of its accountants, and to any
employees of Sellers, in each case used in the preparation of the Conversion
Date Inventory Statement or as may otherwise be reasonably necessary for
Buyer to prepare the Buyer\'s Conversion Date Objection and to prepare
materials for presentation to the CPA Firm in connection with the matters
contemplated by Section 2.10(c). The Conversion Date Inventory
Statement shall be binding and conclusive upon, and deemed accepted by, Buyer
unless Buyer shall have notified General Mills in writing within thirty (30)
days after delivery of the Conversion Date Inventory Statement of any
objection thereto (the "Buyer\'s Conversion Date Objection"). The Buyer\'s
Conversion Date Objection shall set forth a description of the basis of the
Buyer\'s Conversion Date Objection and the adjustments to the value of such
Conversion Date Inventory reflected on the Conversion Date Inventory
Statement that Buyer believes should be made. Any items not disputed during
the foregoing thirty (30) day period shall be deemed to have been accepted by
Buyer.   (c) If General Mills and Buyer are unable to resolve all of their
disputes with respect to the Conversion Date Inventory Statement
within thirty (30) days following General Mills\' receipt of the Buyer\'s
Conversion Date Objection to such Conversion Date Inventory Statement
pursuant to Section 2.10(b), they shall refer their remaining differences to
the CPA Firm for decision, which decision shall be made consistent with the
Inventory Standards within forty-five (45) days and shall be final and
binding on the parties, PROVIDED that the CPA Firm\'s determination as to any
item set forth in Buyer\'s Conversion Date Objection shall not be more
beneficial to General Mills than the determination of that item by General
Mills in the Conversion Date Inventory Statement or more beneficial to Buyer
than the determination of that item in Buyer\'s Conversion Date Objection.
Any expenses relating to the engagement of the CPA Firm shall be shared
equally by General Mills, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand.
General Mills and Buyer shall each bear the fees of their respective auditors
incurred in connection with the determination and review of the Conversion
Date Inventory Statement.   (d) The Conversion Date Inventory Statement
shall become final and binding on the parties upon the earliest of (i) if no
Buyer\'s Conversion Date Objection has been given, the expiration of the
period within which Buyer must make its objection pursuant to Section 2.10(b)
hereof, (ii) agreement in writing by General Mills and Buyer that the
Conversion Date   -27-   Inventory Statement, together with any
modifications thereto agreed to by General Mills and Buyer, shall be final
and binding and (iii) the date on which the CPA Firm shall issue its written
determination with respect to any dispute relating to such Conversion Date
Inventory Statement. The Conversion Date Inventory Statement, as submitted by
General Mills if no timely Buyer\'s Conversion Date Objection has been given
or as adjusted pursuant to any agreement between the parties or as determined
pursuant to the decision of the CPA Firm, when final and binding on all
parties, is herein referred to as the "Final Conversion Date Inventory
Statement."   (e) Within ten (10) Business Days following issuance of the
Final Conversion Date Inventory Statement, the payment payable pursuant
to this Section 2.10(e) (the "Conversion Date Payment") and interest thereon
shall be paid by Buyer to General Mills by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to a bank account or bank accounts designated in writing by
General Mills. The Conversion Date Payment shall be equal to the value of the
Conversion Date Inventory as reflected on the Final Conversion Date Inventory
Statement. The Conversion Date Payment shall bear interest from the
Conversion Date to the date of payment at the Conversion Date Interest Rate,
which interest shall be calculated on the basis of a 365-day year and the
actual number of days elapsed and such interest shall be paid on the same
date and in the same manner as such Conversion Date Payment.   2.11
CONTRACT PERFORMANCE. With respect to any Assigned Contracts providing for
payments based upon performance over a time period that includes but does not
end on the Closing Date, such payments shall be prorated as between Sellers,
on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand, based on the number of days in
such period occurring on or prior to the Closing Date and the number of days
occurring after the Closing Date; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that in the event that
performance under any such Assigned Contracts is to be effected
disproportionately over the period including but not ending on the Closing
Date, payments with respect to such Assigned Contracts shall be prorated as
between Sellers, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand, based on the
expected portion of performance to be effected by Sellers, on the one hand,
and Buyer, on the other hand; PROVIDED, FURTHER, HOWEVER, that Sellers shall
be responsible for any payments for performance required to be performed as
of the Closing with respect to which Sellers shall have underperformed as of
Closing. The provisions of this Section 2.11 shall apply equally to any
Toledo Plant Assigned Contracts providing for payments based upon performance
over a time period that includes but does not end on the Toledo Plant Closing
Date except that, to the extent applied to Toledo Plant Assigned Contracts,
references in this Section 2.11 to the Assigned Contracts, Closing Date and
Closing shall instead be deemed references to the Toledo Plant Assigned
Contracts, Toledo Plant Closing Date and Toledo Plant Closing, respectively.
The provisions of this Section 2.11 shall apply equally to the portions of
the Dividable Contracts transferred to Buyer that provide for payments based
upon performance over a time period that includes but does not end on the
date of transfer of such portions to Buyer except that, to the extent applied
to such portions of such Dividable Contracts, references in this Section 2.11
to the Assigned Contracts, Closing Date and Closing shall be deemed
references to such portions of such Dividable Contracts, the date of transfer
of such portions to Buyer and the time of transfer of such portions to
Buyer, respectively. The provisions of this Section 2.11 shall apply equally
to the portions of the Toledo Plant Dividable Contracts transferred to Buyer
that provide for payments based upon performance over a time period that
includes but does not end on the date of transfer of such portions to Buyer
except that, to the extent applied to such portions of such Toledo Plant
Dividable Contracts, references in this Section 2.11 to the  
-28-   Assigned Contracts, Closing Date and Closing shall be deemed
references to such portions of such Toledo Plant Dividable Contracts, the
date of transfer of such portions to Buyer and the time of transfer of such
portions to Buyer, respectively.   2.12 NONASSIGNABILITY OF CONTRACTS.  
(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, to
the extent that the sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or delivery to
Buyer of any Assigned Contract or any claim or right or any benefit arising
thereunder or resulting therefrom is prohibited by applicable Law or would
require any governmental or third-party authorizations, approvals, consents
or waivers, and such authorizations, approvals, consents or waivers shall not
have been obtained prior to the Closing, the Closing shall (subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article 8,
if applicable) proceed without the sale, assignment, sublease, transfer,
conveyance or delivery of such Assigned Contract and this Agreement shall not
constitute a sale, assignment, sublease, transfer, conveyance or delivery of
such Assigned Contract or an attempt thereof. In the event that the Closing
proceeds without the transfer, sublease or assignment of such Assigned
Contract, then following the Closing, the parties shall use their reasonable
best efforts, and cooperate with each other, to obtain promptly such
authorizations, approvals, consents or waivers; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that
neither Sellers nor Buyer shall be required to pay any consideration for any
such authorization, approval, consent or waiver. Pending such authorization,
approval, consent or waiver, the parties shall cooperate with each other in
any mutually agreeable, reasonable and lawful arrangements (to the extent any
such arrangements are feasible) designed to provide to Buyer the benefits of
such Assigned Contract and to Sellers the benefits that they would have
obtained had the Assigned Contract been conveyed to Buyer at the Closing. To
the extent that Buyer is provided the benefits pursuant to this Section
2.12(a) of any Assigned Contract, Buyer shall perform for the benefit of the
other Persons that are parties thereto the obligations of Sellers thereunder
and any related liabilities that, but for the lack of an authorization,
approval, consent or waiver to assign such liabilities to Buyer, would be
Assumed Liabilities. Once authorization, approval, consent or waiver for the
sale, assignment, sublease, transfer, conveyance or delivery of any
such Assigned Contract not sold, assigned, subleased, transferred, conveyed
or delivered at the Closing is obtained, Sellers shall assign, transfer,
convey and deliver such Assigned Contract to Buyer at no additional cost to
Buyer. To the extent that any such Assigned Contract cannot be transferred
following the Closing pursuant to this Section 2.12(a), then Buyer and
Sellers shall cooperate reasonably in an effort to find and enter into
mutually agreeable arrangements (including subleasing, sublicensing or
subcontracting), if feasible, to provide the parties the economic (taking
into account Tax costs and benefits) and operational equivalent, to the
extent permitted, of obtaining such authorization, approval, consent or
waiver and the performance by Buyer of the obligations thereunder. Sellers
shall hold in trust for and pay to Buyer promptly upon receipt thereof, all
income, proceeds and other monies received by Sellers in respect of Buyer\'s
performance of any such Assigned Contract (net of any Taxes and any other
costs imposed upon Sellers) in connection with the arrangements under this
Section 2.12(a). Nothing stated in this Section 2.12 shall modify in any
respect the conditions set forth in Article 8.   (b) If any such Assigned
Contract is sold, assigned, transferred, conveyed to Buyer at or after the
Closing, Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts thereafter to assist
(including providing to Sellers access to any applicable information and
records) in the transfer   -29-   to Sellers of such portion, if any, of
any such Assigned Contract or of the benefits thereof, that does not relate
to the Business on terms that, taken as a whole, for all such transfers are
not materially less advantageous to Sellers than would exist if such
transferred portions were stand alone contracts. Upon any such transfer,
Sellers shall assume any liabilities and obligations related to the
transferred portion of such Assigned Contract.   (c) To the extent the
transfer to Sellers of such portion of any such Assigned Contract that does
not relate to the Business pursuant to Section 2.12(b) is prohibited by
applicable Law or would require any governmental or third-party
authorizations, approvals, consents or waivers, the parties shall use their
reasonable best efforts, and cooperate with each other, to obtain promptly
such authorizations, approvals, consents or waivers; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that
neither Sellers nor Buyer shall be required to pay any consideration for any
such authorization, approval, consent or waiver. Pending such authorization,
approval, consent or waiver, the parties shall cooperate with each other in
any mutually agreeable, reasonable and lawful arrangements (to the extent any
such arrangements are feasible) designed to provide to Sellers the benefits
of such portion of any such Assigned Contract that does not relate to the
Business. To the extent that Sellers are provided the benefits pursuant to
this Section 2.12(c) of any portion of any such Assigned Contract, Sellers
shall perform for the benefit of the other Persons that are parties thereto
the obligations of Buyer thereunder and any related liabilities that, but for
the lack of an authorization, approval, consent or waiver to assign
such liabilities to Sellers, would have become liabilities of Sellers by
virtue of the transfer of such portion of such Assigned Contract. Once
authorization, approval, consent or waiver for the transfer of any such
portion of any such Assigned Contract is obtained, Buyer shall transfer such
portion of any such Assigned Contract to Sellers at no additional cost to
Sellers. To the extent that any such portion of any such Assigned Contract
cannot be transferred pursuant to this Section 2.12(c) to Sellers, Buyer and
Sellers shall cooperate reasonably in an effort to find and enter into
mutually agreeable arrangements (including subleasing, sublicensing or
subcontracting), if feasible, to provide the parties the economic (taking
into account Tax costs and benefits) and operational equivalent, to the
extent permitted, of obtaining such authorization, approval, consent or
waiver and the performance by Sellers of the obligations thereunder. Buyer
shall hold in trust for and pay to Sellers promptly upon receipt thereof, all
income, proceeds and other monies received by Buyer in respect of Sellers\'
performance of any such portion of any such Assigned Contract (net of any
Taxes and any other costs imposed upon Buyer) in connection with the
arrangements under this Section 2.12(c).   (d) The provisions of this
Section 2.12 shall apply equally to the Toledo Plant Assigned Contracts
except that, to the extent applied to Toledo Plant Assigned Contracts,
references in this Section 2.12 to the Assigned Contracts, Closing Date,
Closing and Business shall instead be deemed references to the Toledo Plant
Assigned Contracts, Toledo Plant Closing Date, Toledo Plant Closing and
Toledo Plant, respectively.   2.13 DIVIDABLE CONTRACTS.   (a) Sellers
shall use their reasonable best efforts to assist in the transfer to Buyer of
such portion of each Dividable Contract or the benefits thereof that relates
to the Business on terms that, taken as a whole, for all such transfers are
not materially less advantageous to Buyer than would exist if such
transferred portions were stand alone contracts.   -30-   Upon such
transfer, Buyer shall assume any liabilities and obligations related to the
transferred portion of such Dividable Contract. Reasonable best efforts shall
include a written reasoned recommendation in favor of such transfer to the
customer or supplier that is the other party to such Dividable Contract, the
provision to Buyer of all information and records available to Sellers
relating to customers or suppliers, as the case may be, with respect to such
portion of such Dividable Contract, the provision to Buyer of available
customer or supplier contact data and information on the customer or supplier
decision maker(s) with respect to such portion of such Dividable Contract
and, if Buyer so requests in accordance with reasonable commercial practice,
the organization of joint visits with Buyer and Sellers to such customers or
suppliers, subject, in each case, to any applicable confidentiality
agreements or obligations of Sellers or any of their Affiliates.   (b)
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, to the
extent that the transfer to Buyer of the portion of any Dividable Contract
that relates to the Business or any claim or right or any benefit arising
thereunder or resulting therefrom, is prohibited by applicable Law or would
require any governmental or third-party authorizations, approvals, consents
or waivers, and such authorizations, approvals, consents or waivers shall not
have been obtained prior to the Closing, the Closing shall (subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article 8)
proceed without the transfer of any such portion of any such Dividable
Contract and this Agreement shall not constitute a transfer of such portion
of any such Dividable Contract or an attempt thereof. In the event that the
Closing proceeds without the transfer of any such portion of any such
Dividable Contract, then following the Closing, the parties shall use their
reasonable best efforts, and cooperate with each other, to obtain promptly
such authorizations, approvals, consents or waivers; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that
neither Sellers nor Buyer shall be required to pay any consideration for any
such authorization, approval, consent or waiver. Pending such authorization,
approval, consent or waiver, the parties shall cooperate with each other in
any mutually agreeable, reasonable and lawful arrangements (to the extent any
such arrangements are feasible) designed to provide to Buyer the benefits of
such portion of any such Dividable Contract, with respect to the portion of
such Dividable Contract applicable to the Business, and to Sellers the
benefits that they would have obtained had such portion of such Dividable
Contract been transferred to Buyer at the Closing. To the extent that Buyer
is provided the benefits pursuant to this Section 2.13 of any portion of any
such Dividable Contract, Buyer shall perform for the benefit of the other
Persons that are parties thereto the obligations of Sellers thereunder and
any related liabilities that, but for the lack of an authorization, approval,
consent or waiver to assign such liabilities to Buyer, would have become
liabilities of Buyer by virtue of the transfer of such portion of such
Dividable Contract. Once authorization, approval, consent or waiver for the
transfer of any such portion of any such Dividable Contract not
transferred at the Closing is obtained, Sellers shall transfer such portion
of any such Dividable Contract to Buyer at no additional cost to Buyer. To
the extent that any such portion of any such Dividable Contract cannot be
transferred following the Closing pursuant to this Section 2.13, then Buyer
and Sellers shall cooperate reasonably in an effort to find and enter into
mutually agreeable arrangements (including subleasing, sublicensing or
subcontracting), if feasible, to provide the parties the economic (taking
into account Tax costs and benefits) and operational equivalent, to the
extent permitted, of obtaining such authorization, approval, consent or
waiver and the performance by Buyer of the obligations thereunder. Sellers
shall hold in trust for and pay to Buyer promptly upon receipt thereof, all
income, proceeds and other monies received by Sellers in respect of Buyer\'s
performance of any such portion of any   -31-   such Dividable Contract
(net of any Taxes and any other costs imposed upon Sellers) in connection
with the arrangements under this Section 2.13. Nothing stated in this Section
2.13 shall modify in any respect the conditions set forth in Article 8.  
(c) The provisions of this Section 2.13 shall apply equally to the Toledo
Plant Dividable Contracts except that, to the extent applied to Toledo Plant
Dividable Contracts, references in this Section 2.13 to the Dividable
Contracts, Closing Date, Closing and Business shall instead be deemed
references to the Toledo Plant Dividable Contracts, Toledo Plant
Closing Date, Toledo Plant Closing and Toledo Plant, respectively.

provided to it by Buyer and its Affiliates as provided in the Collateral
Agreements, and shall not use for the benefit of others, and shall not
disclose, such information to anyone   -50-   outside of Buyer except

understands that Sellers shall maintain in effect any flexible spending plans
in which Business Employees maintain accounts until the close of the calendar

CONVERSION OF TOLEDO PLANT. Each Seller agrees to convert, at its sole
responsibility and expense, the dry-mix production portions of the
Toledo Plant described in the Conversion Plan Agreement (the "Converted
Portion") in accordance with the conversion plans and specifications set
forth in the Conversion Plan Agreement. Regarding the portions of the Toledo
Plant that are not included in the Converted Portion (the "Non-Converted
Portion"), prior to the Toledo Plant Closing Date (or, if General Mills shall
provide Buyer notice of its election to enter into a lease pursuant to
Section 8.4(d) hereof, then prior to the expiration of the term of such lease
as designated in such notice from General Mills with respect to the leased
premises), each Seller shall, at its sole cost and expense: (A) remove all of
the Excluded Toledo Assets therefrom, (B) repair any material damage caused
by the removal of the Excluded Toledo Assets, and (C) leave such portion of
the Toledo Plant in reasonably good condition and in compliance with all
applicable Laws, all in accordance with the terms of the Conversion Plan.
Without limiting the foregoing, each Seller, at its sole cost and expense,
shall be responsible for transferring to the Toledo Plant any Equipment
purchased pursuant hereto by Buyer and for installing and making operational
such Equipment in accordance with the Conversion Plan   -52-   Agreement.
The parties agree that, while title to the Equipment will pass to Buyer at
the Closing Date, each Seller shall continue to insure in accordance with its
standard practices all Equipment that remains in such Seller\'s possession
until the Conversion Date as if such Seller continued to own the Equipment.
Subject to Section 2(b) of the Co-Pack Agreement, Sellers jointly and
severally agree to indemnify and hold Buyer harmless from any loss, damage or
destruction to such Equipment prior to the Conversion Date. Each Seller
further agrees to consult with Buyer regarding the conversion and to take
such steps as Buyer may reasonably request to implement the Conversion Plan
in accordance with its terms. Sellers have delivered to Buyer a
title insurance commitment in respect of the Toledo Plant (issued by Chicago
Title Insurance Company, bearing NBU # 100109451 and having an effective date
of February 7, 2001) (the "Title Commitment"). At least ten (10) days prior
to the Closing, Sellers shall deliver to Buyer an updated title report
in respect of the Toledo Plant and a survey of the Toledo Plant.   5.10
NON-USE OF NAME. From and after the Closing, neither Seller shall use or
permit any Affiliate of such Seller to use the brand names set forth on
SCHEDULE 5.10 or any derivative form thereof, in any business conducted by
either Seller or any of its Affiliates, except pursuant to the Martha White
Trademark License Agreement or the Hungry Jack Trademark License Agreement;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that with respect to the brand names "Robin Hood," "Pet
Milk," "Farmhouse," "La Pina," "Red Band," and "Softasilk," such Seller and
its Affiliates may use such brand name or any derivative form thereof with
respect to inventory with respect to each Other Business necessary for
General Mills to fill purchase orders as set forth more fully in Section
7.13(a).   5.11 NON-INTERFERENCE. Except as otherwise expressly contemplated
by this Agreement or the Collateral Agreements, prior to the Closing,
neither Seller will take, and each Seller will use its reasonable best
efforts to cause its Subsidiaries not to take, any action that is intended to
discourage any customer, supplier or other business associate of such Seller
(or any of its applicable Subsidiaries) with respect to the Business from
maintaining substantially the same business relationships with Buyer with
respect to the Business after the Closing as it maintained with such Seller
(or any of its applicable Subsidiaries) prior to the Closing. With respect to
each Business Employee hired by Buyer, following such date of hire, such
Seller will not enforce any right under any confidentiality or other similar
agreement between such Seller and any Business Employee with respect to such
employee\'s ability to use, on behalf of Buyer, any know-how related to the
Business or to the Converted Portion of the Toledo Plant such employee gained
while employed by such Seller.   5.12 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. From and after
the date hereof, Sellers shall provide to Buyer, at such times as Buyer shall
reasonably request, such additional financial statements related to the
Pillsbury Retail Business and the Pillsbury Foodservice Business and the
Other Businesses and the assets to be sold hereunder by General Mills as
Buyer shall reasonably request in connection with Buyer\'s efforts to obtain,
or comply with its obligations pursuant to, the financing contemplated by the
Financing Commitment or in order for Buyer to comply with disclosure
requirements under federal securities Laws. Pillsbury, to the extent such
statements relate to Pillsbury, and General Mills, to the extent such
statements relate to General Mills, represent and warrant to Buyer that
all financial statements delivered to Buyer pursuant to this Section 5.12
shall (i) to the extent such financial statements are statements of net
assets that reflect the historical operations of the Pillsbury Foodservice
Business and the Pillsbury Retail   -53-   Business or any Other
Business, fairly present in all material respects the dedicated manufacturing
assets used in the Pillsbury Foodservice Business and the Pillsbury Retail
Business or such Other Business as of their dates, (ii) except to the extent
clause (i) above applies, fairly present in all material respects the net
assets to be transferred to Buyer pursuant to Section 8.1 hereof as of their
dates and the results of operations of such portions of the Business or Other
Businesses, as the case may be, for the periods set forth therein (subject,
in the case of interim financial statements, to normal year-end adjustments
that will not be material in amount or effect), (iii) have been prepared in
accordance with GAAP consistently applied during the periods involved, and
(iv) not include any direct product contribution attributable to sales of
products (except products that have been discontinued) that are not Products
hereunder or to sales of Products outside of the Territory, retail channels
(in the case of the Pillsbury Retail Business) or foodservice channels (in
the case of the Pillsbury Foodservice Business). Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Section 5.12, the parties hereto agree that (A)
financial statements related to Other Businesses and the assets related
thereto currently are unaudited and not prepared in accordance with GAAP and
(B) to the extent Buyer reasonably requests, pursuant to this Section 5.12,
any financial statements related to Other Businesses and the assets related
thereto, such statements shall be (1) unaudited (except to the extent
required in order for Buyer to comply with disclosure requirements under
federal securities Laws) and (2) if Buyer requests, prepared in accordance
with GAAP, and (C) Buyer shall provide Sellers with written notice at least
two weeks (or four weeks if such statements are required to be audited in
order for Buyer to comply with disclosure requirements under federal
securities Laws) prior to the date Buyer requests that Sellers deliver such
statements.   5.13 NO SHOPPING. Prior to the Closing or any termination of
this Agreement in accordance with Article 10, neither Seller will, and each
Seller will cause its Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly, solicit,
encourage, facilitate, participate or engage in (including by way of
furnishing any nonpublic information concerning the business, properties,
assets or books or records of the Business or providing access to facilities
at which Products are produced), any Acquisition Proposal (as defined below).
Each Seller agrees to notify Buyer promptly if any Acquisition Proposal is
received by such Seller or any Affiliate of such Seller (including the
identity of the Person making such Acquisition Proposal and the terms of the
Acquisition Proposal). As used in this Agreement, "Acquisition Proposal"
shall mean any proposal (or inquiry relating to a possible proposal) received
by such Seller or any Affiliate of such Seller from a Person, other than
Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer, for the acquisition, directly or indirectly,
of a substantial portion of the Business or the Assets (other than for
the acquisition of finished goods Inventory in the ordinary course of
business of such Seller consistent with past practice) or any portion of the
Toledo Plant.   ARTICLE 6   COVENANTS OF BUYER   6.1 CONFIDENTIALITY.
Buyer acknowledges that all information provided to it by either Seller and
its Affiliates, agents and representatives is subject to the terms of a
confidentiality agreement between Buyer and Pillsbury (the "Confidentiality
Agreement"), the terms of which are incorporated herein by reference.
Effective upon, and only upon, the Closing, or the Toledo   -54-   Plant
Closing, with respect to information that relates to the Toledo Plant, the
Confidentiality Agreement will terminate only with respect to
information provided to Buyer or its Affiliates to the extent related to the
Business or each Other Business, the Assets, the Other Assets and the
Assumed Liabilities; and Buyer acknowledges that any and all information
provided to it by either Seller concerning either Seller (other than
information to the extent primarily related to the Business or each Other
Business, the Assets, the Other Assets and the Assumed Liabilities) shall
remain subject to the terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement
after the date of the Closing. After the Closing Date, Buyer shall also use
all reasonable best efforts to keep secret and retain in strictest confidence
all trade secrets and other applicable information provided to it by either
Seller and its Affiliates as provided in the Collateral Agreements, and shall
not use for the benefit of others, and shall not disclose, such information
to anyone outside of Sellers except with Sellers\' express written consent.
The parties agree that Buyer shall be deemed in compliance with this Section
6.1 so long as it treats such Confidential Information in accordance with the
applicable policies and procedures for the maintenance of its own
confidential and proprietary information of the same type as in effect on the
date of the Original Asset Purchase Agreement.   6.2 ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE.

those applicable to such Toledo Wage Employees immediately prior to
their employment by Buyer pursuant to the agreements set forth at SCHEDULE
3.12. If a collective bargaining agreement or other labor agreement described
in the immediately preceding sentence is not effective on the Conversion
Date, the initial terms and conditions of employment  
-55-   established by Buyer shall be no less favorable, in the aggregate,
than those applicable to the Toledo Wage Employees immediately prior to their

3.12.   (d) CREDITING OF SERVICE FOR CLOSING DATE EMPLOYEES. From and after
the Closing Date, Buyer shall treat all service by Closing Date Employees
with Sellers and their respective predecessors prior to the Closing Date for
all purposes (including determination of seniority) as service with Buyer
(except for purposes of benefit accrual under defined benefit pension plans
or to the extent such treatment would result in duplicative accrual on or
after the Closing Date of benefits for the same period of service), and, with
respect to any medical or dental plan in which the Closing Date Employees
participate after the Closing Date, Buyer shall waive or cause to be waived
any pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements
(PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that no such waiver shall apply to a pre-existing

deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket provisions, as well as such
employee\'s annual benefit limits, if any (until the first anniversary of the

claims made by Business Employees in connection with any actions taken by
Buyer pursuant to the first sentence of Section 5.8(a) that (i) relate to
claims of unlawful interviewing or information gathering practices with
respect to Business Employees, or unlawful discrimination with respect to the
Business Employees offered employment (or denied offers of employment) with
Buyer, or (ii) result in any liability under the WARN Act (unless such WARN
Act liability arises solely as a result of Buyer\'s failure to extend any
offer of employment to 50 or more Toledo Employees).   (g) DEFINED
CONTRIBUTION PLANS.   (i) Except (with respect solely to Toledo Wage 
Employees) to the extent otherwise agreed by  the union representing the
Toledo Wage  Employees consistent with applicable Law, as  of the Conversion

plan for the benefit of Toledo  Wage Employees and Toledo Salaried
Employees  who become employed by Buyer as of the  Conversion Date or

such plan under the applicable  provisions of the Code, and to make any and 
all filings and submissions to the  appropriate Governmental Entities

the appropriate defined  contribution plan described in Section  6.3(g)(i)
(the "Buyer DC Plan") to accept,  as of the Closing Date (for Closing Date

or  indirect rollovers by Closing Date Employees  employed by Buyer as of
the Closing Date and  all direct or indirect rollovers by Toledo  Employees
employed by Buyer as of the  Conversion Date, of such employees\' eligible 
rollover distributions from Sellers\' defined  contribution plans; PROVIDED,
that such  employees have elected to make such  rollovers and meet all
requirements of  Sellers and the Code with respect to such  rollovers. In
the event that a Business  Employee with an outstanding loan from a  Seller
defined contribution plan elects a  direct rollover (within the meaning of 
Section 401(a)(31) of the Code) of his or  her eligible rollover distribution
to the  Buyer DC Plan, the portion of the Business   -57-    Employee\'s
eligible rollover distribution  represented by the outstanding loan shall
be  rolled over to the Buyer DC Plan; PROVIDED,  HOWEVER, that in the event
that Buyer does  not offer the Buyer DC Plan to the Toledo  Wage Employees
it employs after the  Conversion Date, Buyer shall enable any  Toledo Wage
Employee in its employ to make  payments with respect to any outstanding 
loan such employee retains under a Seller  defined contribution plan through
the use of  regular payroll deductions that would be  transferred to the
appropriate Seller. Buyer  and each Seller shall each bear their own

the benefit of the Closing Date Employees who become employed by Buyer as of
the Closing Date or thereafter, and Buyer shall take all necessary action, if
any, to qualify such plan under the applicable provisions of the Code, and to
make any and all filings and submissions to the appropriate Governmental
Entities required to be made by it in connection with such establishment or
designation.   (i) ACCRUED PAID TIME OFF. Buyer shall use any funds wire

Section 5.8(c) to cover expenses relating to Accrued Paid Time Off for
Closing Date Employees who become employed by Buyer as of the Closing
Date.   ARTICLE 7   MUTUAL COVENANTS OF THE PARTIES   Each Seller and
Buyer covenants and agrees as follows:   7.1 COOPERATION AND TRANSITION
SERVICES.   (a) (i) As more fully described in Section 7.1(a)(ii), each of

assist and cooperate with one another to effect promptly all necessary
filings and to obtain all necessary permits, consents, approvals,  
-58-   orders and authorizations of, or any exemptions by, all third
parties and Governmental Entities necessary to consummate the purchase and
sale of the Assets, the Other Assets and the Toledo Plant Assets and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Collateral
Agreements. Each of the Sellers and Buyer, including each of its affiliates,
shall as promptly as practicable use its reasonable best efforts to prepare
and furnish all necessary information and documentation (including furnishing
all information requested by any Governmental Entities, including
information that may be required by the HSR Act) and otherwise to do whatever
is necessary, proper or advisable to assist and cooperate with each other
in obtaining necessary consents, approvals or orders of all
Governmental Entities necessary to consummate the purchase and sale of the
Assets, the Other Assets and the Toledo Plant Assets and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Collateral Agreements.
Each of the Sellers and Buyer shall keep the other apprised of the status of
any inquiries made of it by the FTC or any other Governmental Entities,
including their respective staffs, with respect to this Agreement (or any

Collateral Agreements and, to the extent possible, communicate with each
other in advance of any communications or correspondence with the FTC.
Without limiting the generality of the undertakings pursuant to this

ruling or other order (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) that
would materially delay, restrain, enjoin or otherwise prohibit consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Collateral
Agreements.   (b) In addition to the specific obligations created by the
Collateral Agreements, to the extent consistent with applicable Law, Buyer
and Sellers shall reasonably cooperate with each other and shall cause their
officers, employees, agents and representatives to reasonably cooperate with
each other for the periods contemplated by the Co-Pack Agreement and
the Transition Services Agreement to ensure the orderly transition of
the Business, the Assets and the Assumed Liabilities to Buyer, to minimize
the disruption to the respective businesses of the parties hereto (including
the parties\' relationships with customers and suppliers) resulting from
the transactions contemplated hereby and, in connection with Buyer\'s efforts
to obtain the financing contemplated by the Financing Commitment, to
reasonably cooperate with each other, and to cause their officers, employees,
agents and representatives to reasonably cooperate with each other, and to
make disclosures required by Law related thereto. Except as otherwise
provided in this Agreement, Buyer, on the one hand, and Sellers, on the other
hand, shall reimburse the other for reasonable out-of-pocket costs and
expenses incurred at the request of the other party in assisting the other
pursuant to this Section 7.1(b).   7.2 PUBLICITY. Sellers and Buyer agree
that, from the date of the Original Asset Purchase Agreement through the
Closing Date, no public release or announcement concerning the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be issued by a party without the prior written
consent of the other parties (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld), except as such release or announcement may be required by Law or
any United States or foreign securities exchange, in which case advance
notice and an opportunity to comment on the proposed release or other
announcement shall be given to the other party, to the extent
reasonably practicable. Sellers and Buyer agree to keep the terms of this
Agreement and the Collateral Agreements confidential, except to the extent
required by applicable Law and except that the parties may disclose such  
-59-   terms to their respective accountants and other representatives as
necessary in connection with the ordinary conduct of their respective
businesses (so long as such Persons agree to keep the terms of this Agreement
and the Collateral Agreements confidential) and to the FTC and other
antitrust regulatory agencies.   7.3 TAX MATTERS.   (a) TRANSFER TAXES.
Sellers shall pay transfer Taxes imposed as a result of the sale and transfer
of the Toledo Plant (but only such transfer Taxes to the extent based on a
fair market value of the Toledo Plant equal to or less than the Toledo Plant
Purchase Price), as contemplated hereby, and Buyer shall pay all other sales,
use, value-added, business, goods and services, transfer, documentary,
conveyancing or similar Taxes or expenses and all recording fees that may be
imposed as a result of the sale and transfer of the Assets, the Other Assets,
the Toledo Plant Assets (including any transfer Taxes to the extent based on
a fair market value of the Toledo Plant in excess of the Toledo Plant
Purchase Price) or the Special Inventory, or any other assets, property,
franchise, service or business to be, directly or indirectly, acquired by, or
provided to, Buyer or any of its Affiliates under this Agreement or any of
the Collateral Agreements (including any stamp duty or other Tax chargeable
in respect of any instrument transferring property and any Taxes (other than
income Taxes) payable in connection with the sale and transfer of the
Intellectual Property), together with any and all penalties, interest
and additions to Tax with respect thereto ("Transfer Taxes"), and Sellers and
Buyer shall cooperate in timely making all filings, returns, reports and
forms as may be required to comply with the provisions of such Tax Laws.  
(b) COOPERATION. Buyer and Sellers shall, and shall cause their respective
subsidiaries and Affiliates to, cooperate with respect to Tax matters. Buyer
and Sellers shall provide one another with such information as is reasonably
requested in order to enable the requesting party to complete and file all
Returns which it may be required to file with respect to the Business, the
Assets, each Other Business, the Special Inventory, the Other Assets,
and Windmill or to respond to audits, inquiries or other proceedings by any
Taxing Authority and otherwise to satisfy Tax requirements. Such cooperation
shall further include (i) provision of powers of attorney to Sellers (or
their designees) relating to Tax matters to satisfy Sellers\' obligations
under Section 7.3 and Article 9 of this Agreement, (ii) promptly forwarding
copies of appropriate notices, forms or other communications received from or
sent to any Taxing Authority, and (iii) promptly providing reasonably
requested copies of all relevant Returns together with accompanying schedules
and related workpapers, documents relating to rulings, audits or other
determinations by any Taxing Authority and records concerning the ownership
and tax basis of property, in each case only to the extent such materials
relate to the Business, the Assets, each Other Business, the Special
Inventory, the Other Assets, or Windmill.   (c) FILING RESPONSIBILITY.
Sellers shall prepare and file or shall cause Windmill, as the case may be,
to prepare and file, (i) all Returns with respect to Taxes attributable to
the Assets, the Business, each Other Business, the Special Inventory or the
Other Assets, or of Windmill, required to be filed (taking into account
extensions therefor) prior to the Closing Date and (ii) all Returns in
respect of any Transfer Taxes owing as a result of the sale and transfer of
the Toledo Plant as contemplated hereby. Sellers shall prepare and file, or
shall cause to be prepared and filed, any consolidated, combined or unitary
Return that includes   -60-   Sellers or any of their Affiliates (and any
Return that relates in whole or in part to Taxes (or Tax items) described in
clause (2) or (3) of the definition of Excluded Taxes). To the extent that
any such Tax Returns filed by Sellers after the Closing Date pertain to
Windmill, they shall be prepared in accordance with past practice (unless
contrary position is required by Law). Buyer shall file or cause to be filed
all Returns attributable to the Assets, the Business, each Other Business,
the Special Inventory or the Other Assets, or of Windmill, for which Sellers
do not have filing responsibility pursuant to this Section 7.3(c); PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that in the case of any Returns required to be filed after the
Closing Date for which Buyer has filing responsibility pursuant to this
Section 7.3(c) and for which Sellers could have liability under this
Agreement (including any Return for Property Taxes attributable to the
Equipment for any Tax period or portion thereof ending on or prior to the
Conversion Date and any Straddle Period Tax Return of Windmill, in each case,
for which Buyer has filing responsibility pursuant to this Section 7.3(c)),
Buyer (i) shall prepare all such Returns in accordance with past practice
(unless contrary position is required by Law), (ii) shall provide Sellers
with a draft of Buyer\'s proposed Return at least 30 days prior to the due
date (including extensions) for Sellers\' review, and (iii) shall revise such
Return prior to filing (and file the Return as so revised) to reflect any
good faith comments of Sellers given to Buyer within 15 days of Sellers\'
receipt of the draft Return (PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that to the extent that Buyer
does not agree with Sellers\' comments, the parties shall endeavor in good
faith to resolve such disagreement and, failing that, a neutral CPA firm
mutually selected by Sellers and Buyer shall resolve the disagreement prior
to the due date, including extensions, and the Return shall be filed in the
manner determined by such CPA firm). Buyer shall discharge all Tax
liabilities shown on Returns that Buyer is required to file pursuant to this
Section 7.3(c); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that no later than one (1) Business Day
prior to the filing of any such Return, the Sellers shall pay to the Buyer an
amount equal to the amount of Taxes shown due on such Return for which
Sellers are responsible with respect to such Return less any estimated Taxes
paid for such Taxes prior to the Closing Date.   (d) TIMING DIFFERENCES. If
as the result of any adjustment to an Excluded Tax made in an audit or other
Tax proceeding, the Sellers are required to make an additional Tax payment
(either directly to a Taxing Authority or as an indemnity payment under
Section 9.2 of this Agreement), or suffer a reduction in any refund or
credit, and, due to such Tax payment (or reduction in refund or credit, or
adjustment giving rise to such payment or reduction in such refund or
credit), the Buyer or Windmill or any of their Affiliates obtains a Tax
benefit, the Buyer shall pay to the Sellers an amount equal to the actual Tax
benefit so derived. The amount of any such Tax benefit shall be equal to the
amount of the actual reduction in Taxes (or increase in refund or credit)
reflected on any Return of the Buyer or Windmill or any of their Affiliates
(net of any resulting increases in Taxes borne by Buyer on any such other
filed Return) for such period (or any earlier period) as compared to the
amount that would have been reflected on such Return in the absence of the
additional Tax payment by (or reduction in refund or credit of) Sellers. Any
adjustment not resulting in a Tax benefit to the period to which it relates
or any earlier period shall be carried forward to succeeding taxable years
until used to the extent permitted by Law. All payments to Sellers pursuant
to this Section 7.3(d) shall be made within 15 days after the filing of the
applicable Return for the period in which the Tax benefit is realized
by Buyer or Windmill and shall be accompanied by supporting calculations in a
form reasonably acceptable to the Sellers documenting the Tax benefit to
which the payment relates. If the Buyer or Windmill makes a payment to
Sellers pursuant to this Section 7.3(d) and the actual Tax benefit (or
portion thereof) is eventually not realized (or another Tax benefit of Buyer
is not   -61-   utilized because of the prior use of a Tax benefit for
which payment has been made under this Section 7.3(d)), the Buyer shall
promptly notify the Sellers (with documents reasonably acceptable to Sellers
supporting the loss of Tax benefit) and, upon receipt of such notice, the
Sellers shall promptly refund such payment (or allocable portion thereof) to
the Buyer or Windmill (PROVIDED that in no case shall Sellers, in respect of
any payment a refund of which is sought under this sentence, be required to
refund an amount in excess of such payment previously received by Sellers
from Buyer).   (e) REFUNDS. (i) Sellers shall be entitled to any refunds or
credits of or against any Excluded Taxes (plus any interest received
with respect thereto) and Buyer shall file, or cause to be filed, any claims
for such refunds or credits reasonably requested by Sellers; (ii) except to
the extent set forth in Section 7.3(d) or 7.3(e)(i) above, Buyer shall be
entitled to any refunds or credits of Taxes attributable to the Business, the
Assets, each Other Business, the Special Inventory, the Other Assets, or of
Windmill (plus any interest received with respect thereto); (iii) Buyer shall
promptly forward to Sellers or reimburse Sellers for any refund or credits
due Sellers (pursuant to the terms of this Article 7) after receipt thereof,
and Sellers shall promptly forward to Buyer or reimburse Buyer for any
refunds or credits due Buyer (pursuant to the terms of this Article 7) after
receipt thereof; (iv) refunds or credits for a Straddle Period shall be
allocated in the manner set forth in the definition of "Excluded Taxes"; (v)
the Buyer and Windmill shall prepare and timely file an irrevocable election
under Treasury Regulation section 1.1502-21(b)(3)(ii)(B) for Buyer\'s
consolidated group to relinquish all consolidated net operating losses
allocable to Windmill for that portion of the loss carryback period during
which Windmill was a member of a Seller\'s consolidated group; and (vi) Buyer
shall not elect to carry back any item of loss, deduction or credit of Buyer,
Windmill or any of their Affiliates which arises in any Tax period or portion
thereof ending after the Closing Date into any Tax period or portion thereof
ending on or before the Closing Date.   (f) TAX-SHARING AGREEMENTS. Any tax-
sharing agreement or similar arrangement between Sellers, on the one hand,
and Windmill, on the other hand, shall be terminated with respect to Windmill
prior to the Closing.   7.4 ACCESS TO INFORMATION. After the Closing, or
with respect to information relating to the Toledo Plant, after the Toledo
Plant Closing, upon reasonable notice, and subject to Sections 5.6 and 6.1,
Buyer and Sellers agree to furnish or cause to be furnished to each other and
their representatives, employees, counsel and accountants access, during
normal business hours, to such information (including records pertinent to
the Business, the Pet Milk Business and the Toledo Plant) and assistance
relating to the Business, the Pet Milk Business and the Toledo Plant as are
reasonably necessary for financial reporting and accounting matters or
verifying such party\'s obligations hereunder, the preparation and filing of
any Tax returns, reports or forms or the defense of any Tax Claim or
assessment or other claim; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that such access and assistance
do not unreasonably disrupt the normal operations of Buyer or Sellers.  
7.5 BULK SALES WAIVER. Buyer and Sellers hereby waive compliance with the
terms and conditions of any applicable bulk sales Law or similar Laws
that may be applicable to the sale or transfer of the Assets or the Other
Assets.   -62-    7.6 EXPENSES. Except as contemplated by that certain
letter agreement dated December 17, 2000 by and among Sellers and Buyer, or
as otherwise expressly provided herein, all costs and expenses incurred in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby will
be paid by the party incurring such costs and expenses, whether or not the
transactions contemplated hereby are consummated, except that Sellers shall
pay the cost of obtaining a survey of the Toledo Plant site and customary
title insurance, with commercially reasonable and customary endorsements,
with respect to title of the Toledo Plant.   7.7 FURTHER ASSURANCES.
Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the parties
hereto will use all reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
all action, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable under applicable Laws to satisfy all conditions to, and to
consummate, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Collateral Agreements and to carry out the purposes hereof, including causing
any Subsidiaries of such party to execute the Collateral Agreements, as
applicable, and to carry out the purposes thereof; PROVIDED
that notwithstanding anything to the contrary stated in this Agreement, no
party hereto shall be required to pay any consideration for any third-party
consent or waiver. Buyer agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to
satisfy, or cause to be satisfied, all conditions set forth in the Financing
Commitment and to consummate the financing thereunder.   7.8 COLLATERAL
AGREEMENTS. At the Closing or the Toledo Plant Closing, as applicable, each
Seller, as applicable, and Buyer shall execute and deliver (i) the Trademark
License Agreements, (ii) the Omnibus Patent Assignment, (iii) the Pillsbury
Omnibus Trademark Assignment, the General Mills Omnibus Trademark Assignment,
the Pet, Inc. Omnibus Trademark Assignment, and the Guinness
Omnibus Trademark Assignment, (iv) the Retail Patent and Technology License
Agreement, (v) the Foodservice Patent and Technology License Agreement, (vi)
the Transition Services Agreement, (vii) the Co-Pack Agreement, (viii) a
limited warranty deed for the real property portions of the Toledo Plant,
(ix) the Martha White Trademark License Agreement and the Hungry Jack
Trademark License Agreement and the Grant Back Patent and Technology License
Agreement, (x) the Conversion Plan Agreement, and (xi) the General Mills
Guaranty (collectively, the "Collateral Agreements").   7.9 SHARED
SERVICES. Buyer and Sellers shall cooperate reasonably with respect to the
services and arrangements contemplated by the Transition Services Agreement,
the Co-Pack Agreement and the other Collateral Agreements and other shared
services and arrangements with the intent of ensuring that, as of the Closing
Date, and taking into account all such services and arrangements together
with the purchase and sale of the Assets hereunder, Buyer will have
the ability to continue to operate the Business on terms that are not, taken
as a whole, materially less advantageous to Buyer than the terms on which
the Business was conducted as of the date of the Original Asset Purchase
Agreement.   7.10 EMPLOYEE WELFARE BENEFITS. Sellers shall be solely
responsible for: (a) claims for the type of benefits described in Section
3(1) of ERISA (whether or not covered by ERISA) ("Welfare Benefits") and for
workers\' compensation, in each case that are incurred by or with respect to
any Business Employee prior to the date such employee becomes employed by the
Buyer, PROVIDED, in the case of a disability or workers\' compensation claim,
the Buyer shall have the right to enforce this provision against the Sellers
only with respect to such a claim that is actually filed on or before (x)
with respect to Closing Date Employees, the first anniversary of  
-63-   the Closing Date, and (y) with respect to Toledo Employees, the
first anniversary of the Conversion Date (or, in the case of a claim for
a disability benefits under the General Mills Toledo Plan, the date of the
DB Transfer); (b) claims relating to COBRA Coverage attributable to
"qualifying events" with respect to any Business Employee and his or her
beneficiaries and dependents that occur before the date such Business
Employee becomes employed by Buyer; and (c) claims for Welfare Benefits and
for workers\' compensation, in each case that are incurred by or with respect
to any Business Employee who does not become employed by Buyer, whether
incurred before, on or after the Closing Date (in the case of the Closing
Date Employees) or the Conversion Date (in the case of the Toledo
Employees). Buyer shall be solely responsible for: (a) claims for Welfare
Benefits and for workers\' compensation, in each case that are incurred by or
with respect to Business Employees from and after the date they become
employees of Buyer; and (b) claims relating to COBRA Coverage attributable to
"qualifying events" with respect to Business Employees who become employees
of Buyer, and their beneficiaries and dependents, that occur after such
employees become employees of Buyer. For purposes of the foregoing, a
disability or workers\' compensation claim shall be considered incurred at
the time the injury or condition giving rise to the claim occurs, and a
medical/dental claim shall be considered incurred when the services are
rendered or the supplies are provided, and not when the condition arose;
PROVIDED that claims relating to a hospital confinement that begins before
the date a Business Employee becomes employed by Buyer shall be deemed to
have occurred before such employee became employed by Buyer.   7.11 TOLEDO
DEFINED BENEFIT PLAN TRANSFER OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. With respect to
Toledo Wage Employees who become employees of Buyer as of the Conversion
Date, General Mills shall cause a transfer of assets and liabilities (the "DB
Transfer") to be made from the trust under the General Mills Toledo Plan to
the trust under the Multifoods Plan, as soon as reasonably practicable after
the Conversion Date and following the later of (a) the earlier of delivery to
General Mills of a favorable determination letter from the Internal
Revenue Service, or an opinion of counsel or indemnity, reasonably
satisfactory to General Mills relating to the qualified status of the
Multifoods Plan (as amended to the date of transfer), or (b) the delivery to
Buyer of a favorable determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service,
or an opinion of counsel or indemnity, reasonably satisfactory to Buyer
relating to the qualified status of the General Mills Toledo Plan (as amended
to the date of transfer). Subject to section 414(l) of the Code, the fair
market value of the assets to be transferred in the DB Transfer shall equal
the present value as of the Conversion Date of the accumulated benefit
obligations of the Toledo Wage Employees who become employees of Buyer as of
the Conversion Date, less the amount of any payments made from the General
Mills Toledo Plan with respect to such employees following the Conversion
Date and prior to the date of transfer, with such present value to be
determined using assumptions consistent with those used to determine the
pension expense for the current year, except for the discount rate. The
discount rate will be determined using the Merrill Lynch 10 year plus high
quality corporate bond index on the Conversion Date. Buyer shall cause the
Multifoods Plan to accept the assets transferred in the DB Transfer and to
assume the liability for all benefits accrued by such Toledo Wage Employees
under the General Mills Toledo Plan as of the Conversion Date.
The calculations shall be performed by the actuary for the General Mills
Toledo Plan with review by the actuary for the Multifoods Plan. If the
actuaries disagree, a third independent actuary shall be engaged (with the
costs shared equally by the Sellers and Buyer), and the determination of such
third independent actuary shall be binding. The DB Transfer shall not take
place prior to the 31st day following the filing of all Internal  
-64-   Revenue Service Forms 5310 required in connection therewith. General
Mills and Buyer shall use best efforts to expedite the DB Transfer, including
promptly providing or filing any documents, forms, or other information
necessary to effectuate the DB Transfer, and communicating and cooperating as
necessary to expedite the DB Transfer. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Section 7.11, in the event that the union representing the
Toledo Wage Employees agrees, pursuant to Section 6.3(e), that such employees
shall not participate in a defined benefit plan of Buyer following the
Conversion Date, the DB Transfer shall not occur.   7.12 OTHER
BUSINESSES.   (a) On the Closing Date, General Mills shall sell, convey,
transfer and assign to Buyer, or cause its applicable Subsidiaries to sell,
convey, transfer and assign to Buyer, (i) the Other Assets and (ii) the Other
Business Inventory, as contemplated by Section 7.13. Following the
Closing Date, Buyer shall assume all responsibility for the operation of each
Other Business, as applicable, except as otherwise expressly provided
herein. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, it is agreed and
understood that any Other Asset, Other Business Inventory or any other asset
relating to each Other Business that, pursuant to this Agreement will be
transferred to Buyer, shall be transferred on the Closing Date.   (b) Prior
to, on or after the Closing Date, Buyer shall not assume, or in any way be
liable for the payment, performance or discharge of, any liabilities,
obligations or commitments of Sellers or any of their Affiliates for
manufacturer\'s coupons issued prior to, or by either Seller on, the Closing
Date and relating to Other Products with respect to each Other Business.  
(c) On the Closing Date, Buyer shall assume pursuant to a written instrument
reasonably satisfactory to Buyer and Sellers and shall pay, perform and
discharge when due all liabilities and obligations for trade promotions
arising from (i) trade promotion activities or events primarily related to
each Other Business that are committed to after the Closing Date and occur at
any time following the Closing Date or (ii) trade promotion activities or
events primarily related to each Other Business that occur following
the Closing Date and that were committed to before the Closing Date, except
to the extent any such single activity or promotion was not disclosed to
Buyer by Sellers and the liability and obligation per customer buying group
related to such activity or promotion exceeds $100,000 unless such activity
or promotion was committed to by Sellers in the ordinary course consistent
with past practice.   (d) After the Closing Date, Buyer shall pay, perform
and discharge when due (i) all obligations, liabilities and commitments of
each Seller in respect of any and all Other Products shipped by Buyer or in
respect of the operation of each Other Business by Buyer at any time after
the Closing Date except where such Other Products constituted finished
products as of the Closing Date and such liabilities, obligations or
commitments of Sellers constituted product liabilities or recall liabilities,
unless (and to the extent that) the liabilities, obligations or commitments
were caused by Buyer\'s negligence in the storage or transportation of such
Other Products after the Closing Date or Buyer\'s failure after the Closing
Date to employ quality control standards of at least the standards employed
by Sellers prior to the Closing Date, (ii) all refund and replacement
obligations relating to Other Products shipped after the Closing Date,  
-65-   and (iii) all liabilities and obligations for customer
deductions attributable to invoices issued by Buyer with respect to Other
Products shipped after the Closing Date.   7.13 OTHER BUSINESS
INVENTORY.   (a) On the Closing Date, General Mills shall sell, convey,
transfer and assign to Buyer, or cause its Affiliates to sell,
convey, transfer and assign to Buyer, the Other Business Inventory with
respect to each Other Business, except for an amount of such inventory with
respect to such Other Business necessary for General Mills to fill purchase
orders with respect to each such Other Business existing as of the Closing
Date, which inventory Buyer hereby permits General Mills to retain in order
to fill such orders and which inventory shall not be deemed to be Other
Business Inventory for purposes of this Agreement. Within thirty (30) days
following the Closing Date, General Mills shall prepare and deliver to Buyer
a statement setting forth the type and value of the Other Business Inventory,
as of the Closing Date, transferred and assigned to Buyer on the Closing
Date, which statement shall be derived from a physical taking of such Other
Business Inventory as of the Closing Date and shall be prepared in a manner
consistent with the Inventory Standards (the "Other Business Inventory
Statement"). Buyer and its representatives shall have such opportunity as
Buyer reasonably deems appropriate to observe the taking and reconciliation
of such Other Business Inventory (which may begin prior to the Closing Date)
in connection with the preparation of the Other Business Inventory Statement.
Buyer shall provide General Mills and its accountants full access to the
books and records, to any other information, including work papers of
its accountants, and to any employees of Buyer, in each case as may be
reasonably necessary for General Mills to prepare the Other Business
Inventory Statement, to respond to Buyer\'s Other Business Objection (as
defined herein) and to prepare materials for presentation to the CPA Firm in
connection with the matters contemplated by Section 7.13(c).   (b) Buyer
shall, within thirty (30) days after the delivery by General Mills of the
Other Business Inventory Statement, complete its review thereof. After
delivery of the Other Business Inventory Statement, General Mills shall
provide Buyer and its accountants full access to all books and records, to
any other information, including working papers of its accountants, and to
any employees of Sellers, in each case used in the preparation of the Other
Business Inventory Statement or as may otherwise be reasonably necessary for
Buyer to prepare the Buyer\'s Other Business Objection and to prepare
materials for presentation to the CPA Firm in connection with the matters
contemplated by Section 7.13(c). The Other Business Inventory Statement shall
be binding and conclusive upon, and deemed accepted by, Buyer unless
Buyer shall have notified General Mills in writing within thirty (30) days
after delivery of the Other Business Inventory Statement of any objection
thereto ("Buyer\'s Other Business Objection"). Buyer\'s Other Business
Objection shall set forth a description of the basis of the Buyer\'s Other
Business Objection and the adjustments to the value of Other Business
Inventory reflected on the Other Business Inventory Statement that Buyer
believes should be made. Any items not disputed during the foregoing thirty
(30) day period shall be deemed to have been accepted by Buyer.   (c) If
General Mills and Buyer are unable to resolve all of their disputes with
respect to the Other Business Inventory Statement within thirty (30) days
following General Mills\' receipt of the Buyer\'s Other Business Objection to
the Other Business Inventory   -66-   Statement pursuant to Section
7.13(b), they shall refer their remaining differences to the CPA Firm for
decision, which decision shall be made consistent with the Inventory
Standards within forty-five (45) days and shall be final and binding on the
parties, PROVIDED that the CPA Firm\'s determination as to any item set forth
in Buyer\'s Other Business Objection shall not be more beneficial to General
Mills than the determination of that item by General Mills in the Other
Business Inventory Statement or more beneficial to Buyer than the
determination of that item in Buyer\'s Other Business Objection. Any expenses
relating to the engagement of the CPA Firm shall be shared equally by General
Mills, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand. General Mills and Buyer
shall each bear the fees of their respective auditors incurred in connection
with the determination and review of the Other Business Inventory
Statement.   (d) The Other Business Inventory Statement shall become final
and binding on the parties upon the earliest of (i) if no Buyer\'s
Other Business Objection has been given, the expiration of the period within
which Buyer must make its objection pursuant to Section 7.13(b) hereof, (ii)
agreement in writing by General Mills and Buyer that the Other Business
Inventory Statement, together with any modifications thereto agreed to by
General Mills and Buyer, shall be final and binding and (iii) the date on
which the CPA Firm shall issue its written determination with respect to any
dispute relating to the Other Business Inventory Statement. The Other
Business Inventory Statement, as submitted by General Mills if no timely
Buyer\'s Other Business Objection has been given or as adjusted pursuant to
any agreement between the parties or as determined pursuant to the decision
of the CPA Firm, when final and binding on all parties, is herein referred to
as the "Final Other Business Inventory Statement."   (e) Within ten (10)
Business Days following issuance of the Final Other Business Inventory
Statement, the payment payable pursuant to this Section 7.13(e) (the "Other
Business Payment") and interest thereon shall be paid by Buyer to General
Mills by wire transfer of immediately available funds to a bank account or
bank accounts designated in writing by General Mills. The Other Business
Payment shall be equal to the value of the Other Business Inventory as
reflected on the Final Other Business Inventory Statement. The Other Business
Payment shall bear interest from the Closing Date to the date of payment at
the Closing Date Interest Rate, which interest shall be calculated on the
basis of a 365-day year and the actual number of days elapsed and
such interest shall be paid on the same date and in the same manner as such
Other Business Payment.   7.14 MANUFACTURER CODES. If after the Closing
Date, General Mills requests in writing that Buyer use reasonable best
efforts to change the portion of universal product codes constituting
manufacturer codes with respect to the Business and each Other Business,
Buyer shall use such reasonable best efforts to change such manufacturer
codes. To the extent Buyer incurs any direct, reasonable documented out-of-
pocket costs as a result of the change in such manufacturer codes (including
new or additional slotting allowances or similar charges), Buyer shall be
liable for the first $300,000 of such costs and General Mills shall be liable
for any amount in excess thereof.   7.15 CO-PACKING; MARKETING. (a)
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any Collateral
Agreement, as reasonably promptly as practicable prior to the Closing,
General Mills shall enter into a co-packing agreement (the "Third-Party Co-
Pack Agreement") with a third-party co-packer (the "Third Party Co-Packer")
to perform General Mills\' obligations under   -67-   the Co-Pack
Agreement to the extent such obligations relate to co-packing products at the
Tennessee Plant; PROVIDED, that Buyer shall be a third-party beneficiary of
the Third-Party Co-Pack Agreement; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that General Mills
shall in all events be responsible for ensuring that, directly or indirectly,
all of General Mills\' obligations under the Co-Pack Agreement, including
General Mills\' obligations under the Co-Pack Agreement to the extent such
obligations relate to co-packing products at the Tennessee Plant, are
performed pursuant to the terms and upon the conditions set forth in the Co-
Pack Agreement.   (b) As reasonably promptly as practicable following the
Closing, General Mills shall provide links on the Pillsbury website (or other
website maintained by General Mills and relating to Pillsbury to the extent
General Mills discontinues the Pillsbury website) to Buyer\'s website for so
long as and to the extent that General Mills maintains such Pillsbury website
or other website relating to Pillsbury, PROVIDED that Buyer pay General Mills
any incremental direct cost associated with establishing and maintaining such
link and that Buyer may provide General Mills with written notice of Buyer\'s
decision that General Mills terminate such link to Buyer\'s website. Upon
receipt of such notice, General Mills shall terminate such link as promptly
as practicable   7.16 ESCROW FUND. The parties acknowledge that each of
General Mills and Diageo has agreed at Closing to deliver to the Trustee,
reporting to the FTC, $5,000,000 ($10,000,000 in the aggregate) in cash to be
held by the Trustee pursuant to an escrow agreement between the Trustee,
General Mills, Diageo and Buyer (the "Escrow Agreement"). The Escrow
Agreement shall provide that the Trustee shall deposit such funds into an
interest-bearing account (the "Escrow Fund") to be used in a manner
consistent with this Section 7.16. The Escrow Agreement shall provide that
funds from the Escrow Fund (including earnings, but excluding costs of
administration which shall be paid from the Escrow Fund) shall be made
available to reimburse Buyer for the costs of either (i)
Buyer\'s restructuring or anticipated restructuring of the composition of its
selling organization in order to assume directly any part of the
responsibilities currently performed by the sales force of Pillsbury or (ii)
Buyer\'s need to finance changes in Buyer\'s operations of the businesses
that Buyer is acquiring pursuant to this Agreement, which changes were
unforeseen as of the Closing Date. Buyer shall (A) maintain records relating
to and sufficient to identify all expenditures and costs and recipients of
expenditures or anticipated expenditures and costs and recipients of
expenditures related to Buyer\'s restructuring or anticipated restructuring
of the composition of its selling organization as described in subpart (i) in
the immediately preceding sentence or Buyer\'s need to finance changes in

to the purchase and sale of the Toledo Plant Assets; (iv) General Mills shall
deliver to Buyer legal and actual possession of the Toledo Plant (subject,

extent they do not include confidential information with respect to Sellers\'
cereal-related operations); and (v) General Mills shall deliver to Buyer
evidence of General Mills\' satisfaction of requirements 5 and 8 set forth in
Schedule B-Section 1 of the Title Commitment. Buyer agrees irrevocably and

bank accounts per the wire transfer instructions on SCHEDULE 8.1(a) hereto,
immediately available funds in an aggregate amount equal to $5,750,000, the

Buyer agrees that it shall pay such Deferred Amount in full, without
deduction or offset, pursuant to the terms set forth in the immediately

immediately preceding sentence shall be calculated on a   -74-   per
diem basis (based upon the actual number of calendar days in the applicable
proration period) in the customary manner for commercial real estate
transactions in the county in which the Toledo Plant is located. To the
extent any such prorations are made based on estimates of actual charges or
property Taxes, such prorations shall be adjusted as between the parties when
the actual charges become known.   (d) General Mills and Buyer agree that if
General Mills notifies Buyer in writing at least 30 days prior to the
anticipated Toledo Plant Closing Date that General Mills elects to lease from
Buyer the portions of the Toledo Plant currently used for cereal
processing, production, packaging and material handling, then at the Toledo
Plant Closing General Mills and Buyer shall enter into a lease on the terms
set forth in the Toledo Plant Lease Term Sheet and other customary and
commercially reasonable terms. Such notice shall specify the term of the
lease (which term shall not exceed three months commencing upon the Toledo

and (b) Sellers shall be liable for the costs of any cleanup, remediation or

liability, obligation or commitment is covered by Sellers\' indemnification
obligation set forth in Section 9.2) following the Toledo Plant Closing Date
(or on the Toledo Plant Closing Date to the extent arising from Buyer\'s
operation on the Toledo Plant Closing Date), in each case other than Excluded
Liabilities (except for Excluded Environmental Liabilities in respect of
which Sellers are not obligated to indemnify Buyer pursuant to Section 9.2)
or other obligations which Sellers have expressly agreed to pay pursuant to
this Agreement or the Collateral Agreements; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that with
respect to any such liability, obligation or commitment that would not have

obligations under this clause (vi) shall not apply to the extent of (but only

Sellers each acknowledge and agree that, from and after the Closing, their
sole and exclusive remedy, with respect to any and all claims relating to
breaches of representations and warranties (but, for the avoidance of doubt,
not covenants or fraud) in this Agreement, shall be pursuant to the
indemnification provisions set forth in this Article 9. In furtherance of the
foregoing, Buyer and Sellers hereby waive, from and after the Closing, to the
fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, any and all rights, claims and
causes of action they may have against each other relating to breaches of
representations and warranties (but, for the avoidance of doubt, not
covenants or fraud) in this Agreement arising under or based upon any
federal, state or local statute, Law (including common law), ordinance, rule
or regulation or otherwise.   9.5 LOSSES NET OF INSURANCE. The amount of any
Loss for which indemnification is provided under this Article 9 shall be net
of any amounts recovered by the indemnified party under its insurance
policies with respect to such Loss after giving effect to any impact of such
claims on the indemnifying party\'s premiums and other costs of insurance.
Each party hereby waives, to the extent permitted under its applicable
insurance policies, any subrogation rights that its insurer may have with
respect to any indemnified Loss. Any payments made pursuant to this Article 9
shall be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes,
unless a final determination (which shall include the execution of a Form
870-AD or successor form) with respect to the indemnified party causes such
payment not to constitute an adjustment to the Purchase Price for federal
income Tax purposes.   9.6 PROCEDURES RELATING TO INDEMNIFICATION.   (a)
In order for an indemnified party to be entitled to any indemnification
provided for under this Article 9 in respect of, arising out of or involving
a claim or demand made by any person, firm, Governmental Entity or
corporation against the indemnified party (a "Third-Party Claim"), such
indemnified party must notify the indemnifying party in writing, and in
reasonable detail, of the Third-Party Claim as promptly as reasonably
possible after receipt by such indemnified party of written notice of the
Third-Party Claim; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that failure to give such notification
shall not affect the indemnification provided hereunder except to the extent
the indemnifying party shall have been actually prejudiced as a result of
such failure. Thereafter, the indemnified party shall deliver to the
indemnifying party, within five (5) Business Days after the indemnified
party\'s receipt thereof, copies of all notices and documents (including
court papers) received by the indemnified party relating to the Third-Party
Claim; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that failure to make such deliveries shall not
affect the indemnification provided hereunder except to the extent the
indemnifying party shall have been actually prejudiced as a result of such
failure.   (b) If a Third-Party Claim is made against an indemnified party,
the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate in the defense thereof
and, if it so elects in writing within ten (10) days of receipt of written
notice from the indemnified party and acknowledges its obligation to
indemnify the indemnified party therefor, to assume the defense thereof with
counsel, accountants or other designee selected by the indemnifying party and
reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party, PROVIDED that the
indemnifying party conducts the defense actively and diligently thereafter.
Should the indemnifying party so elect to assume the defense of a Third-Party
Claim, the indemnifying party will not be liable to the indemnified  
-78-   party for legal or accounting expenses subsequently incurred by
the indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof, absent any
conflict of interest between such parties. If the indemnifying party assumes
such defense, the indemnified party shall have the right to participate in
the defense thereof and to employ counsel, at its own expense, unless a
conflict of interest would arise if counsel to the indemnifying party also
represented the indemnified party, separate from the counsel employed by the
indemnifying party, it being understood that the indemnifying party shall
control such defense, except to the extent of any such conflict of interest
between such parties. The indemnifying party shall be liable for the fees and
expenses of counsel employed by the indemnified party for any period during
which the indemnifying party has not assumed the defense thereof or in the
event of any conflict of interest between the indemnified party and the
indemnifying party. All the parties hereto shall cooperate in the defense or
prosecution of any Third-Party Claim. Such cooperation shall include the
retention and (upon the other party\'s request) the provision to the other
party of records and information that are reasonably relevant to such Third-
Party Claim, and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to
provide additional information and explanation of any material provided
hereunder, at the reasonable expense of the indemnifying party. Whether or
not the indemnifying party shall have assumed the defense of a Third-Party
Claim, the indemnified party shall not admit any liability with respect to,
or settle, compromise or discharge, such Third-Party Claim without the
indemnifying party\'s prior written consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld). The indemnifying party shall not, without the prior
written consent of the indemnified party, enter into any settlement of
any Third-Party Claim that would result in the imposition of a consent
order, injunction or decree which would materially restrict or otherwise
materially adversely affect the future activity or conduct of the indemnified
party or any Affiliate thereof, or without the prior written consent of
the indemnified party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld)
that does not include, as an unconditional term thereof, the release of
the indemnified party from all liability in respect of such Third-Party
Claim except the liability satisfied by the indemnifying party.   (c)
Notwithstanding the foregoing in this Section 9.6, if a Third-Party Claim for
a Straddle Period includes or could reasonably be expected to include both a
claim for Taxes that are Excluded Taxes and a claim for Taxes that are
Assumed Liabilities, and such claim for Taxes that are Excluded Taxes is not
separable from such claim for Taxes that are Assumed Liabilities, the Sellers
(if the claim for Taxes that are Excluded Taxes exceeds or reasonably could
be expected to exceed in amount the claim for Taxes that are Assumed
Liabilities) or otherwise Buyer (Sellers, on the one hand, or Buyer, on the
other hand, as the case may be, the "Controlling Party") shall be entitled to
control the defense of such Third-Party Claim (such Third-Party Claim, a
"Tax Claim"). In such case, the other party (the "Non-Controlling Party")
shall be entitled to participate fully (at the Non-Controlling Party\'s sole
expense) in the conduct of such Tax Claim and the Controlling Party shall not
settle such Tax Claim without the consent of such Non-Controlling Party
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld). The costs and expenses of
conducting the defense of such Tax Claim shall be reasonably apportioned
based on the relative amounts of the claim for Taxes that are Excluded Taxes
and the claim for Taxes that are Assumed Liabilities. For purposes of this
Section 9.6(c), the term "Assumed Liabilities" shall include any Taxes of
Windmill (other than Excluded Taxes).   (d) Notwithstanding any other
provision, (a) Sellers shall be entitled to control in all respects, and
neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates shall be entitled to participate in,
any   -79-   Tax audit or other proceeding with respect to any
consolidated, combined or unitary Return that includes any of the Sellers or
any of their Affiliates; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that Sellers may not settle or
otherwise resolve the portion, if any, of any such Tax audit or other
proceeding that pertains to income, gain, loss, deduction or credit of
Windmill (other than any such portion that could impact an indemnification by
the Sellers under clause (vii) of Section 9.2 of this Agreement) without the
consent of Buyer, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, (b)
except as set forth in clause (c) below, Buyer shall be entitled to control
in all respects, and neither Sellers nor any of their Affiliates shall be
entitled to participate in, any Tax audit or other proceeding with respect to
any consolidated, combined or unitary Return that includes the Buyer or any
of its Affiliates, (c) if a Tax audit or other proceeding (including but not
limited to a Tax audit or other proceeding relating to a consolidated,
combined or unitary Return) could give rise to an indemnification by the
Sellers under clause (vii) of Section 9.2 of this Agreement, Sellers shall
have the right to control in all respects, including as to settlement, at
Sellers\' expense, the conduct of the portion of such Tax audit or other
proceeding which could give rise to such an indemnification, and with respect
to such portion, Buyer (A) shall promptly notify Sellers upon receipt of
notice of the Tax audit or other proceeding or any proposed assessment, (B)
shall thereafter promptly forward to Sellers copies of any communications
received from or sent to any Taxing Authority by Buyer, Windmill or any of
their Affiliates and (C) shall facilitate to the extent reasonably required
by the Sellers, and shall not impede, Seller\'s control over, such Tax audit
or proceeding, and (d) none of the Sellers shall have any obligation
whatsoever pursuant to clause (vii) of Section 9.2 or pursuant to Section
9.6(e) of this Agreement if Buyer fails to comply with any of the covenants
set forth in clauses (A), (B) and (C) of clause (c) above and Sellers are
actually prejudiced as a result of such failure.   (e) If and to the extent
that Sellers are required to indemnify Buyer pursuant to clause (vii) of
Section 9.2 of this Agreement, within thirty (30) days of receipt from Buyer
of notification (together with supporting documentation reasonably acceptable
to Sellers) of a "determination" within the meaning of Section 1313 of the
Code or other final agreement negotiated by Sellers with the relevant Taxing
Authority, but in no case sooner than one (1) Business Day prior to the date
on which Buyer is obligated to pay the applicable Taxing Authority, Sellers
shall pay to Buyer an amount equal to the sum of (1) the net present value
(assuming a nine and one-half percent (9.5%) discount rate) of forty percent
(40%) of the excess of (x) the amount allocated to the Stock pursuant to the
determination over (y) the amount set forth in SCHEDULE 2.2 hereto, amortized
over fifteen (15) years, and (2) any interest and penalties incurred by Buyer
that would not have been incurred but for such determination.   9.7
INDEMNIFICATION AMOUNTS. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary stated in
this Article 9, no indemnifying party shall have liability under Section
9.2(i) or 9.3(i), as the case may be, for breaches of representations and
warranties (a) other than those representations and warranties set forth in
Section 3.1(a), 3.2, 3.3(a), the last sentence of Section 3.3(b), and
Sections 3.7, 4.1(a) or 4.4 or fraudulent misrepresentations, for any
individual Loss less than $20,000 or until the aggregate amount of Losses
(excluding any Loss less than $20,000) that the indemnifying party would, but
for this Section 9.7, be liable exceeds on a cumulative basis an amount equal
to three million dollars ($3,000,000) (the "Basket"), and then only to the
extent that the aggregate of all Losses exceeds the Basket or (b) other than
those representations and warranties set forth in Section 3.1(a), 3.2,
3.3(a), the last sentence of Section 3.3(b), and Sections 3.7, 3.19(b)(i),
3.19(b)(viii), 3.19(b)(ix), 3.19(b)(x), 4.1(a) or 4.4 or fraudulent  
-80-   misrepresentations, for Losses in excess of fifteen (15) percent of
the Purchase Price. Buyer and Sellers agree that certain representations
and warranties contained in this Agreement are qualified by
materiality references or by matters having or not having a Material Adverse
Effect (collectively, the "Materiality Qualifiers"). Buyer and Sellers agree
that, except in the case of claims relating to the representations set forth
in Section 3.19(b)(i), for purposes of Sections 9.2 and 9.3 hereof and
for purposes of calculating the Basket and the amount of Losses, the
Materiality Qualifiers shall be ignored and the representations and
warranties shall be construed without regard to any Materiality Qualifiers
therein contained.   ARTICLE 10   TERMINATION   10.1 BASES FOR
TERMINATION. Anything contained herein to the contrary notwithstanding, this
Agreement may be terminated and the transactions contemplated hereby
abandoned at any time prior to the Closing Date:   (a) by mutual written
consent of Sellers and Buyer;   (b) by Buyer if any of the conditions set
forth in Section 8.2 shall have become incapable of fulfillment and shall not
have been waived by Buyer;   (c) by either Seller if any of the conditions
set forth in Section 8.3 shall have become incapable of fulfillment and shall
not have been waived by such Seller;   (d) by either Seller or Buyer if the
Closing does not occur on or prior to December 15, 2001 (provided, however,
that in the event that all of the conditions set forth in Sections 8.2 and
8.3 have been satisfied or waived except that the applicable waiting period
(and any extension thereof) under the HSR Act has not expired or been
terminated, then such date shall automatically be extended until June 30,
2002); or   (e) by either Seller if the Merger Agreement
is terminated  PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the party seeking termination
pursuant to clause (b), (c), or (d) is not in material breach of any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement.   10.2 NOTICE OF TERMINATION; RETURN OF DOCUMENTS;
CONTINUING CONFIDENTIALITY OBLIGATION. In the event of termination by either
Seller or by Buyer pursuant to this Article 10, written notice thereof shall
forthwith be given to the other parties and the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement shall be terminated, without further action by any party. If
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are terminated or rescinded
as provided herein:   (a) Buyer shall return all documents and copies
and other material received from Sellers relating to the
transactions contemplated hereby, whether so obtained before or after the
execution hereof, to Sellers; and   -81-    (b) all confidential
information received by Buyer with respect to the Business shall be treated
in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement, which shall remain in full
force and effect notwithstanding the termination of this Agreement.   10.3
EFFECT OF TERMINATION. If this Agreement is terminated and the transactions
contemplated hereby are abandoned as described in this Article 10, this
Agreement shall become void and of no further force and effect, except for
the provisions of (a) Section 5.5 relating to reimbursement of expenses, (b)
Section 6.1 relating to the obligation of Buyer to keep confidential certain
information and data obtained by it, (c) Section 7.6 relating generally to
expenses, (d) Section 7.2 relating to publicity, (e) Sections 3.7 and 4.4
relating to finders\' fees and brokers\' fees or commissions, and (f) Section
10.2 and this Section 10.3. Nothing in this Article 10 shall be deemed to
release any party from any liability for any breach by such party of the
terms and provisions of this Agreement or to impair the right of any party to
compel specific performance by another party of its obligations under this
Agreement.   ARTICLE 11   GENERAL PROVISIONS   11.1 ASSIGNMENT;
SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS. Except as set forth below, this Agreement and the
rights and obligations hereunder shall not be assignable or transferable by
Buyer or Sellers (including by operation of law in connection with a merger
or sale of substantially all the assets of Buyer or Sellers) without the
prior written consent of each of the other parties hereto. Buyer may assign
or delegate its rights, obligations or liabilities under this Agreement in
whole or in part to one or more Subsidiaries of Buyer or to the lender or
lenders providing to it the financing to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby, in each case without the consent of Sellers (provided
that a pledge of Buyer\'s rights, obligations or liabilities under this
Agreement to such lender or lenders shall not constitute an
assignment hereunder until such time as any such lender exercises its rights
under the pledge agreement or other applicable agreement or document);
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that in any such event, Buyer shall remain fully liable
for the fulfillment of all its obligations hereunder. Any attempted
assignment or delegation in contravention hereof shall be null and void. This
Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the successors
and assigns of the parties hereto.   11.2 RISK OF LOSS.   (a) If, prior
to the Toledo Plant Closing Date, the Toledo Plant or any part thereof shall
be damaged or destroyed by fire or other casualty or taken as a result of any
condemnation or eminent domain proceeding, General Mills shall promptly
notify Buyer of such occurrence. Notwithstanding any such casualty or
condemnation, the parties shall proceed with the Toledo Plant Closing
(subject to and in accordance with the provisions of Section 8.4 above) and
neither party shall have any right to terminate this Agreement as a result of
any such casualty or condemnation.   (b) In the event of a casualty or
condemnation in respect of the Converted Portion of the Toledo Plant prior to
the Toledo Plant Closing, General Mills shall, at its sole cost and expense,
repair, restore or rebuild or cause to be repaired, restored or rebuilt, the
affected   -82-   Converted Portion to its condition immediately prior to
such casualty or condemnation to the extent reasonably and commercially
practicable, subject to such alterations and modifications as may be
contemplated by the Conversion Plan. In the event of a casualty or
condemnation in respect of the Non-Converted Portion of the Toledo Plant
prior to the Toledo Plant Closing, promptly after the occurrence of such
casualty or condemnation, General Mills shall, at its sole cost and expense,
repair, restore and rebuild or cause to be repaired, restored or rebuilt, the
affected Non-Converted Portion to the condition required pursuant to the
second sentence of Section 5.9 above. Notwithstanding the foregoing, however,
(x) any repair, restoration or rebuilding shall be consistent with the
Conversion Plan and (y) if General Mills shall commence to repair, restore or
rebuild or cause to be repaired, restored or rebuilt, the Non-Converted
Portion but such repair, restoration or rebuilding shall not be completed on
or before the Toledo Plant Closing Date, then, the Toledo Plant Closing shall
nonetheless proceed on the Toledo Plant Closing Date without delay, and
General Mills shall (a) provide Buyer at the Toledo Plant Closing insurance
or condemnation proceeds and any such additional amount as reasonably
estimated to be sufficient to complete such repair, restoration or rebuilding
and Buyer shall thereafter be responsible for such completion and (b) within
20 days after demand after the Toledo Plant Closing, pay to Buyer (i) such
additional amounts as Buyer reasonably incurs to complete such repair,
restoration or rebuilding in excess of the amounts paid to Buyer at the
Toledo Plant Closing, and (ii) if the Warehouse Space shall have suffered a
casualty or condemnation and shall not be useable by Buyer, any reasonable
cost incurred by Buyer in its rental or use of alternative warehouse space in
connection with its operation of the Toledo Plant during the period from and
after the Toledo Plant Closing Date through the date of completion of the
repair, restoration and rebuilding of the Warehouse Space (including any
penalties or excess charges reasonably incurred or obligations reasonably
undertaken under a lease for such alternative space having a term longer than
the period required to complete the repair, restoration and rebuilding of the
Warehouse Space, PROVIDED that General Mills shall not be obligated to
reimburse Buyer for such charges to the extent allocable to the period, if
any, during which Buyer uses such alternative space for longer than is
reasonably necessary). Except to the extent applied to such repair,
restoration or rebuilding, all condemnation proceeds relating to a
condemnation of the Toledo Plant from and after the date hereof shall belong
to and shall be paid to Buyer at the Toledo Plant Closing or if not then paid
by the condemning authority, assigned to Buyer at the Toledo Plant
Closing.   11.3 NO THIRD-PARTY BENEFICIARIES. Except for Persons entitled
to indemnification under Article 9 hereof and the FTC, this Agreement is for
the sole benefit of the parties hereto, and nothing herein express or
implied shall give or be construed to give to any Person or entity, other
than the parties hereto, any legal or equitable rights hereunder.   11.4
AMENDMENTS. No amendment to this Agreement shall be effective unless it shall
be in writing and signed by each party hereto.   11.5 WAIVER OF COMPLIANCE.
Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, any failure of any of the
parties to comply with any obligation, covenant, agreement or condition
herein may be waived by the party entitled to the benefits thereof only by a
written instrument signed by the party, granting such waiver, but such waiver
or failure to insist upon strict compliance with such obligation, covenant,
agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with
respect to, any subsequent or other failure. Any consent given by any
party   -83-   pursuant to this Agreement shall be valid only if
contained in a written consent signed by such party.   11.6 NOTICES. All
notices or other communications required or permitted to be given hereunder
shall be in writing and shall be delivered by hand or sent by telecopy, or by

contained in this Agreement, in any Exhibit or Schedule hereto and in the
table of contents to this Agreement, are for reference purposes only and
shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.
The terms defined in the singular shall have a comparable meaning when used
in the plural, and vice versa. This Agreement shall be construed without
regard to any presumption or rule requiring construction or interpretation
against the party drafting or causing any instrument to be drafted. When a
reference is made in this Agreement to Sections, Exhibits or Schedules, such
reference shall be to a Section of or Exhibit or Schedule to this Agreement
unless otherwise indicated. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or
"including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed
by the words "without limitation." The phrases "the date of this Agreement,"
"the date hereof" and terms of similar import, unless the context otherwise
requires, shall be deemed to refer to the date set forth in the first
paragraph of this Agreement. The words "hereof," "hereby," "herein,"
"hereunder" and similar terms in this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement
as a whole and not to any particular Section or Article in which such words
appear. All references to dollar amounts shall be deemed to be references to
U.S. Dollars.   11.8 COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement and any amendments hereto
may be executed by facsimile and in one or more counterparts, all of which
shall be considered one and the same agreement, and shall become effective

and delivered to the other party.   11.9 SEVERABILITY. If any provision of
this Agreement or the application of any such provision to any Person or
circumstance shall be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect
by a court of competent jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or
unenforceability shall not affect any other provision hereof.   11.10
GOVERNING LAW. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Minnesota applicable to
agreements made and to be performed entirely within such State, without

ACTIONS AND PROCEEDINGS. Sellers and Buyer hereby irrevocably consent to the
exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the Courts of the State of Minnesota and
the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota, in connection
with any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby. Buyer hereby irrevocably appoints
Buyer\'s General Counsel as its authorized agent upon whom process may be
served in any such action or proceeding instituted in any such court and
waives any objections to personal jurisdiction with respect thereto. Sellers
hereby irrevocably appoint General Mills\' General Counsel as their
authorized agent (PROVIDED that until the Acquisition is
consummated, Pillsbury appoints its General Counsel as its authorized agent)
upon whom process may be served in any such action or proceeding instituted
in any such court and waives any objections to personal jurisdiction with
respect thereto.   11.12 EXHIBITS AND SCHEDULES. All Exhibits and Schedules
annexed hereto or referred to herein are hereby incorporated in and made a
part of this Agreement as if set forth in full herein. If a matter is
disclosed in any Schedule to this Agreement, it shall be deemed to have been
disclosed with respect to all Schedules to this Agreement for which its
relevance is evident from the disclosure made, PROVIDED that the disclosure
in such Schedule is sufficient to reasonably inform the non-disclosing party
of the information required to be disclosed in another Schedule to avoid
a misrepresentation under the counterpart section or paragraph of
this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, the mere listing in any Schedule
to this Agreement of a document or other item shall be deemed adequate
to disclose an exception to a representation or warranty made herein only
if such listing of the document or item in the Schedule is sufficient
to reasonably inform Buyer of such exception to such representation or
warranty. Inclusion of any matter in any Schedule does not imply that such
matter would, under the provisions of this Agreement, have to be included in
such Schedule.   11.13 SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE. Buyer and each Seller
hereby acknowledge, recognize and agree that (a) the Business, each Other
Business, the Assets and the Other Assets are unique property that cannot be
duplicated and (b) irreparable injury may result to the non-breaching party
and its business if the other party or parties breach any provision of this
Agreement such that money damages alone would not be sufficient remedy for
any such breach. Each party hereto therefore agrees that if it should engage,
or cause or permit any other Person to engage, in any act in violation of
any provision hereof, the other party or parties shall be entitled, in
addition to such other remedies, damages and relief as may be available under
this Agreement or applicable Law, to an injunction prohibiting the breaching
party from engaging in any such act or specifically enforcing this Agreement,
as the case may be.   11.14 ENTIRE AGREEMENT. Except to the extent
otherwise contemplated herein, this Agreement (including the Schedules and
Exhibits attached hereto and the Collateral Agreements) contains the entire
agreement and understanding between the parties hereto with respect to the
subject matter hereof and, except to the extent specifically set forth
herein, supersedes all prior agreements and understandings relating to such
subject matter.   -86-    IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have
caused this Agreement amending and restating the Original Asset Purchase
Agreement to be duly executed as of the date first written above.   GENERAL
