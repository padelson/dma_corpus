 1.7.  _Surrender and Payment_.   

 (a) _Exchange Agent and Exchange Procedures_.   

 (i) _Exchange Agent_. Concurrent with Closing, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with an exchange agent selected by Parent, with the Companys prior approval, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld (the " _ _Exchange Agent__ "), for the benefit of the holders of Shares, cash in respect of the aggregate Amalgamation Consideration, to be paid pursuant to Section 1.6 in exchange for issued and outstanding Shares upon due surrender of the Certificates and other materials pursuant to the provisions of this Article I (such cash in respect of the aggregate Amalgamation Consideration, being hereinafter referred to as the " _ _Exchange Fund__ ").   

 (ii) _Exchange Procedures_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall and Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each registered holder of Shares (i) a form of letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates held by such holder shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such other customary provisions as Parent may reasonably specify, and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Amalgamation Consideration, in each case, as reasonably agreed upon by the Company. Upon the surrender of a Certificate to the Exchange Agent in accordance with the terms of the letter of transmittal, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Amalgamation Consideration in accordance with Section 1.6 and this Section 1.7, without interest thereon. To be effective, a letter of transmittal must be (x) properly completed, signed and submitted to the Exchange Agent at its designated office on the day specified in the letter of transmittal and (y) accompanied by the Certificate(s) representing the Shares as to which the exchange is being made (or by an appropriate guarantee of delivery of such Certificate(s) in accordance with the terms of the letter of transmittal). The Exchange Agent, in consultation with Parent and the Company, shall make all computations necessary to give effect to the provisions of this Section 1.7. Parent shall determine, in its sole and absolute discretion, which authority it may delegate in whole or in part to the Exchange Agent, and whether letters of transmittal have been properly completed, signed and submitted or revoked. The decision of Parent (or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be) in such matters shall be conclusive and binding. Neither Parent nor the Exchange Agent will be under any obligation to notify any Person of any defect in a letter of transmittal submitted to the Exchange Agent. For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _ _Person__ " shall mean any individual or any company, corporation (including not-for-profit), general or limited partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, estate, trust, association, organization, Governmental Entity or other entity of any kind or nature.   

 (b) _Transfers_. At or after the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the register of members of the Company of the Shares that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.   

 (c) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains unclaimed by the holders of the Shares for 180 days after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent. Any holder of the    ##### 

  

    

Shares that has not theretofore complied with this Article I shall thereafter
look only to Parent for payment of any cash in respect of the Amalgamation
Consideration payable pursuant to Section 1.6 and Section 1.7, in each case,
without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent,
the Amalgamated Company, the Exchange Agent or any other Person shall be
liable to any former holder of Shares for any amount properly delivered to a
public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
laws.   

 (d) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in customary amount as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Amalgamation Consideration would be payable or deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement had such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate been surrendered.   

 (e) _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. In the event that the Company changes the number of Shares or securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for Shares issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a result of a share consolidation, reclassification, share split (including a reverse share split), share dividend or distribution, recapitalization, amalgamation, merger, subdivision, issuer tender or exchange offer, or other similar transaction, the Amalgamation Consideration shall be equitably adjusted.   

 (f) _Withholding Rights_. Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause the Exchange Agent to deduct and withhold, from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Shares such amounts as it may be required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _ _Code__ "), or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax (as defined in Section 2.1(e)) Laws. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent, Amalgamation Sub, the Amalgamated Company or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, the withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Shares in respect of which the deduction and withholding was made by Parent, Amalgamation Sub, the Amalgamated Company or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be.   

 1.8.  _Dissenters  Rights_. The Company shall give Parent (a) prompt notice of the existence of any registered holder (each a " _ _Dissenting Shareholder__ ") that has properly dissented pursuant to Section 108 of the Companies Act, (b) prompt notice of attempted withdrawals by Dissenting Shareholders of applications to the Supreme Court of Bermuda for appraisal of the fair value of the Shares held by Dissenting Shareholders and any other instruments served pursuant to the Companies Act and received by the Company relating to any Dissenting Shareholders rights to be paid the fair value of such Dissenting Shareholders Shares, as provided in Section 106 of the Companies Act and (c) the opportunity to direct any and all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the Companies Act. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal of Shares, offer to settle or settle any demands or approve any withdrawal of any such demands.    ##### 

  

  

 1.9. _Company Equity Awards_.   

 (a) _Company Options_. At the Effective Time, each outstanding option to purchase Shares (a " _ _Company Option__ ") under the Share Plans (as defined in Section 2.1(b)) that is vested as of the Effective Time (a " _ _Vested Company Option__ "), shall automatically be cancelled at the Effective Time and converted into the right to receive, at the Effective Time, a lump sum cash payment (less applicable Taxes required to be withheld with respect to such payment) equal to the product of (i) the number of shares subject to such Vested Company Option and (ii) the excess, if any, of (A) the Amalgamation Consideration over (B) the exercise price per share of such Vested Company Option (the product of such amounts, the " _ _Cash Payment__ "). Each outstanding Company Option other than a Vested Company Option (each, an " _ _Unvested Company Option__ ") shall automatically be cancelled at the Effective Time, and Parent shall cause an amount equal to the product of (i) the number of shares subject to such Unvested Company Option and (ii) the excess, if any, of (A) the Amalgamation Consideration over (B) the exercise price per share of such Unvested Company Option to be credited as an opening balance of a deferred compensation account for each holder of Unvested Company Options, which balance, and any earnings thereon, shall be non-transferable and forfeitable until the Unvested Company Options would have vested in accordance with the terms and conditions (including those related to accelerated vesting) included in the original grant. All amounts in each holders deferred compensation account shall be deemed to receive a rate of return equal to the Amalgamated Companys rate of interest on its revolving credit line (not to exceed 5% per year). Upon vesting of the account, each holder shall be entitled to payment as soon as practicable following the vesting date, in settlement of his or her deferred compensation account, of a cash amount equal to the then-value of the vested portion of such holders deferred compensation account, based on the performance of such deemed investments, less applicable Taxes required to be withheld with respect to such payment.   

 (b) _Restricted Shares and Restricted Share Units_. At the Effective Time, each outstanding restricted Share granted under the Companys 2004 Share Incentive Plan (the " _ _2004 Plan__ ") (each, a " _ _Restricted Share__ ") that is unvested and each outstanding restricted Share unit granted under the 2004 Plan (each, a " _ _Restricted Share Unit__ ", and together with the Restricted Shares, the " _ _Restricted Company Shares__ ") that is unvested shall automatically be cancelled, and Parent shall cause an amount equal to the Amalgamation Consideration to be credited with respect to each Restricted Company Share so cancelled as an opening balance of a deferred compensation account for each holder of Restricted Company Shares, which balance, and any earnings thereon, shall be non-transferable and forfeitable until the Restricted Company Shares would have vested in accordance with the terms and conditions (including those related to accelerated vesting) included in the original grant.

 2.1. _Representations and Warranties of the Company_. Except as set forth in the corresponding section of the disclosure letter delivered to Parent by the Company immediately prior to entering into this Agreement and attached as Annex A hereto (the " _ _Company Disclosure Letter__ ") (or another section thereof, providing that the applicability or relevance to such other section is reasonably apparent from the face of the disclosure), the Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent, Amalgamation Sub and Amalgamation Sub Two that:   

 (a) _Organization, Good Standing and Qualification_. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is a company duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation or organization and has all requisite corporate or similar power and authority to own and operate its properties and assets and to carry on its business as presently conducted and is qualified to do business and is in good standing as a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction where the ownership or operation of its assets or properties or conduct of its business requires such qualification, except where the failure to be so organized, qualified or in good standing or to have such power or authority when taken together with all other such failures, has not had, or would not be reasonably expected to have, a Company Material Adverse Effect (as defined below). The Company has made available to Parent a complete and correct copy of the Companys and its Significant Subsidiaries (as defined below) memoranda of association, certificates of incorporation, charters, by-laws, bye-laws and other comparable governing instruments, each as amended to the date hereof. Each such document so delivered is in full force and effect. Section 2.1(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter contains a correct and complete list of each jurisdiction where the Company and each of its Significant Subsidiaries is organized and qualified to do business.   

 For purposes of this Agreement, the term (i) " _ _Subsidiary__ " means, with respect to the Company, Parent or Amalgamation Sub, as the case may be, any entity, whether incorporated or unincorporated (other than those entities listed in Section 2.1(a)(i) of the Company Disclosure Letter), of which at least a majority of the securities or ownership interests having by their terms voting power to elect a majority of the board of directors or other persons performing similar functions is directly or indirectly owned or controlled by such party or by one or more of its Subsidiaries, (ii) " _ _Significant Subsidiary__ " has the meaning set forth in Rule 1-02(w) of Regulation S-X promulgated pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the    #####

intermediaries, controls, or is controlled by, or is under common control
with, the Person specified and (iv) " _ _Company Material Adverse Effect__ "
means any effect, event, change or state of fact that, individually or in the
aggregate, (1) is materially adverse to the condition (financial or
otherwise), properties, business or results of operations of the Company (or,
after the Effective Time, the Amalgamated Company) and its Subsidiaries taken
as a whole; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that no such effect, event, change or
state of fact resulting from any (A) change in Law, U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles (" _ _GAAP__ ") or interpretations thereof that applies
to the Company, (B) change in economic, business or financial market
conditions generally or in the fixed satellite services industry specifically
or (C) items set forth in Section 2.1(a)(iv)(D) of the Company Disclosure
Letter, shall be deemed to be a Company Material Adverse Effect (except, in
the cases of clauses (A) and (B) to the extent such effect, event, change or
state of fact has had a disproportionate effect on the Company and its
Subsidiaries as compared to other Persons in the fixed satellite services
industry) or (2) would prevent, render illegal, delay beyond the Termination
Date (as defined in Section 5.2(a)) or materially impair the ability of the
Company to consummate the Amalgamation, the Sub Amalgamation or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Amalgamation Agreement or
the Sub Amalgamation Agreement (each as in the form attached hereto). For
purposes of all representations and warranties contained in this Section 2.1,
the phrase "transactions contemplated by this Agreement" includes the Debt
Financing (as defined in Section 2.2(j)(ii)) and assumes that the
Debt Financing obtained by Parent at the Closing will substantially be on the

The authorized share capital of the Company consists of (i) 216,666,666 2/3  Shares, of which 166,666,755 Shares were issued and outstanding as of the date hereof (which number includes 6,284,635 Shares held by Intelsat (Bermuda), Ltd. and does not include 602,555 Restricted Shares) and (ii) 2,500,000 preference shares, $3.00 par value per share (the " _ _Preference Shares__ "), of the Company, of which none was issued or outstanding as of August 1, 2004.

purposes of this Agreement, the term " _ _non-assessable__ ", when used with
respect to shares of the Company, Parent or any of their
respective Subsidiaries organized under Bermuda Law, means that no further
sums are required to be paid by the holders thereof in connection with the
issue of such shares. Other than the 6,284,635 Shares held by Bermuda
Limited, no Subsidiary of the Company owns any Shares.

 (ii) All Company Benefit Plans, other than Company Non-U.S. Benefit Plans (collectively, " _ _Company U.S. Benefit Plans__ "), are in substantial compliance with ERISA, the Code, and other applicable Laws. Each Company U.S. Benefit Plan which is subject to ERISA (the " _ _Company ERISA Plans__ ") that is an "employee pension benefit plan" within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA (a " _ _Company Pension Plan__ ") and that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code has received a favorable determination letter from the IRS covering all tax law changes prior to (but not including) the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 or has applied to the IRS for such favorable determination letter within the applicable remedial amendment period under Section 401(b) of the Code, and the Company is not aware of any circumstances likely to result in the loss of the qualification of such Plan under Section 401(a) of the Code.

Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has incurred or reasonably expects to incur a material tax or penalty imposed by Section 4980F of the Code or Section 502 of ERISA. No Company Benefit Plan is a "multiemployer plan" within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA (a " _ _Multiemployer Plan__ ") or a plan that has two or more contributing sponsors at least two of whom are not under common control, within the meaning of Section 4063 of ERISA (a " _ _Multiple Employer Plan__ ") and none of the Company and its Subsidiaries nor any of their respective ERISA Affiliates has contributed to or been obligated to contribute to any Multiemployer Plan or Multiple Employer Plan.

Single-Employer Plan of any entity which is considered one employer with the
Company under Section 4001 of ERISA or Section 414 of the Code (a " _
_Company ERISA Affiliate__ "). No notice of a "reportable event," within the
meaning of Section 4043 of ERISA, for which the 30-day reporting requirement
has not been waived or extended, other than pursuant to Pension Benefit
Guaranty Corporation (" _ _PBGC__ ") Reg. Section 4043.66, has been required
to be filed for any Company Pension Plan or by any Company ERISA Affiliate
within the 12-month period ending on the date hereof or will be required to
be filed in connection with the Amalgamation, the Sub Amalgamation or the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Amalgamation Agreement
and the Sub Amalgamation Agreement, other than any notice that may be
required under ERISA Section 4043(c)(9) if, as a result of the Amalgamation,
the Sub Amalgamation or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, the Amalgamation Agreement and the Sub Amalgamation Agreement, the
Company and/or a Company ERISA Affiliate ceases to be a member of the
controlled group, within the meaning of ERISA Section 4001(a)(14).    

 (iv) All contributions required to be made under each Company Benefit Plan, as of the date hereof, have been timely made, and all obligations in respect of each Company Benefit Plan have been properly accrued and reflected in the most recent consolidated balance sheet filed, furnished or incorporated by reference in the Company Reports prior to the date hereof. Neither any Company Pension Plan nor any Single-Employer Plan of a Company ERISA Affiliate has an "accumulated funding deficiency" (whether or not waived) within the meaning of Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA and no Company ERISA Affiliate has an outstanding funding waiver within the meaning of Section 412 of the Code or Section 303 of ERISA. It is not reasonably anticipated that required minimum contributions to any Company Pension Plan under Section 412 of the Code will be materially increased by application of Section 412(l) of the Code. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has provided, or is required to provide, security to any Company Pension Plan or to any Single-Employer Plan of a Company ERISA Affiliate pursuant to Section 401(a)(29) of the Code.   

 (v) Under each Company Pension Plan which is a Single-Employer Plan, as of the last day of the most recent plan year ended prior to the date hereof, the actuarially determined present value of all "accumulated benefit liabilities," within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(16) of ERISA (as determined on the basis of the actuarial assumptions contained in such Company Pension Plans most recent actuarial valuation), did not exceed the then current value of the assets of such Company Pension Plan, and there has been no material change in the financial condition of such Company Pension Plan since the last day of the most recent plan year.   

 (vi) (A) There is no material pending or, to the knowledge of the executive officers of the Company, threatened litigation relating to the Company Benefit Plans, (B) neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any obligations for retiree health and life benefits under any Company ERISA Plan or collective bargaining agreement and (C) the Company or its Subsidiaries may amend or terminate any Company Benefit Plan at any time without incurring any liability thereunder other than in respect of claims incurred prior to such amendment or termination.   

 (vii) There has been no amendment to, announcement by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries relating to, or change in employee participation or coverage under, any Company Benefit Plan which would increase materially the expense of maintaining such plan    ##### 

  

 

above the level of the expense incurred therefor for the most recent fiscal
year, other than any increase in the level of expenses attributable to the
level of employee participation or coverage in each such plan that arises in
the ordinary course of business. Neither the execution of this Agreement, the
Amalgamation Agreement or the Sub Amalgamation Agreement, nor the receipt of
the Company Shareholder Approval, nor the consummation of the
Amalgamation, the Sub Amalgamation or the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, the Amalgamation Agreement or the Sub Amalgamation Agreement
(whether alone or in conjunction with any other event) will (w) entitle any
employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to severance pay or any
increase in severance pay upon any termination of employment after the date
hereof, (x) accelerate the time of payment or vesting or result in any
payment or funding (through a grantor trust or otherwise) of compensation or

the extent of any accelerated vesting of benefits under a Company Pension
Plan that may be required under Section 411(d)(3) of the Code), (y) limit or
restrict the right of the Company or, after the consummation of the
Amalgamation, the Sub Amalgamation or the other transactions contemplated by

All Company Non-U.S. Benefit Plans are listed in Section 2.1(h)(viii) of the Company Disclosure Letter. The Company and its Subsidiaries have no material unfunded liabilities with respect to any such Company Non-U.S. Benefit Plan.

 (c) Section 3.2(a) notwithstanding, the Company may at any time prior to, but not after, the Company Shareholder Approval has been received, (i) provide information in response to a request therefor by, or engage in any negotiations or discussions with, a Person who has made an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that is made after the date of this Agreement that is not procured in violation of Section 3.2(a) if the Board of Directors of the Company receives from such Person an executed confidentiality agreement on customary terms no less favorable to the Company than the Confidentiality Agreement, dated March 29, 2004, between Parent and Apollo Management V, L.P.

the Company and Parent shall endeavor to negotiate in good faith), that such
Acquisition Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Proposal.

The Company also agrees to provide any non-ministerial information to Parent that it is providing to another Person pursuant to Section 3.2(c) at substantially the same time it provides such information to such other Person, unless Parent has already been provided such information. The Company acknowledges that with respect to the parties hereto, all provisions relating to the type of activities specified in clauses 8(i) through (vi) of the Confidentiality Agreement are hereby waived.   

 (f) Without limiting the foregoing, it is understood that any violation of the restrictions set forth in this Section 3.2 by any officer or director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any Representative of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not such Person is purporting to act on behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or otherwise, shall be deemed to be a breach of this Section 3.2 by the Company.    ##### 

  

  

 (g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, this Agreement and the Amalgamation Agreement shall be submitted to the holders of Shares for the purposes of considering and if thought fit approving this Agreement and the Amalgamation Agreement, regardless of the recommendation or any change in the recommendation of the Board of Directors of the Company with respect thereto.

as promptly as practicable. The parties shall negotiate in good faith with
the appropriate Governmental Entities with respect to the entry into the

The foregoing notwithstanding, nothing in this Agreement shall operate as a guarantee of    ##### 

  

    

employment for any Person nor limit the ability of Amalgamated Company or its
Subsidiaries to terminate the employment of any Employee.   

 (b) _Service Recognition_.

 (b) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under paragraph (a) of this Section 3.10, upon learning of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, shall promptly notify the Amalgamated Company thereof, but the failure to so notify shall not relieve the Amalgamated Company of any liability it may have to such Indemnified Party if such failure does not materially prejudice the indemnifying party. In the event of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before or after the Effective Time), (i) the Amalgamated Company shall have the right to assume the defense thereof and the Amalgamated Company shall not be liable to such Indemnified Parties for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Parties in connection with the defense thereof, except that if the Amalgamated Company elects not to assume such defense or the Indemnified Parties advise that there are issues which raise conflicts of interest between the Amalgamated Company and the Indemnified Parties, the Indemnified Parties may retain counsel satisfactory to them, and the Amalgamated Company shall pay all reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified Parties promptly as statements therefor are received; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Amalgamated Company shall be obligated pursuant to this paragraph (b) to pay for only one firm of counsel for all Indemnified Parties in any jurisdiction unless the use of one counsel for such Indemnified Parties would present such counsel with a conflict of interest, (ii) the Indemnified Parties will cooperate in the defense of any such matter and (iii) the Amalgamated Company shall not be liable for any settlement effected without its prior written consent; and _provided_ ,  _further_ , that the Amalgamated Company shall not have any obligation hereunder to any Indemnified Party if and when a court of competent jurisdiction shall ultimately determine, and such determination shall have become final, that the indemnification of such Indemnified Party in the manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by applicable Law. If such indemnity is not available with respect to any Indemnified Party, then Parent shall provide the Indemnified Parties with the monies necessary to fully implement the indemnity provided herein, and if such payments are not permitted by applicable Law, the Amalgamated Company and the Indemnified Party shall contribute to the amount payable in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect relative faults and benefits.   

 (c) The Company may, and if it does not, the Amalgamated Company shall, purchase a six-year "tail" prepaid policy on terms and conditions no less favorable to Indemnified Parties than the existing officers and directors liability insurance (the " _ _D andO Insurance__"); _provided_ , that if the Amalgamated Company, after using its reasonable best efforts, is unable to purchase such tail the Amalgamated Company will obtain that amount of officers and directors liability insurance that is available for a price of up to 500% of the current annual premium paid by the Company (which annual premium is set forth on Section 3.10(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter); _provided_ ,  _further_ , that, subject to Section 3.14, the Amalgamated Company shall be required to obtain and maintain DandO Insurance with the amount of coverage of no less than $100,000,000 in the event that the Company effects the IPO (as defined in Section 3.14). The Company may replace the DandO Insurance upon its expiration on September 1, 2004 with a new officers and directors liability insurance (the " _ _New D andO Insurance__") with substantially the same terms and conditions as the DandO Insurance; _provided_ , that the Company shall pay no more than 500% of the current annual premium paid by the Company for the DandO Insurance for the New DandO Insurance.   

 (d) If the Amalgamated Company or any of its successors or assigns (i) shall consolidate or amalgamate with or merge into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or    ##### 

  

    

amalgamated Person of such consolidation, amalgamation or merger or (ii)
shall transfer all or substantially all of its shares, other equity
interests, properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,
proper provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of
the Amalgamated Company shall assume all of the obligations set forth in
this Section 3.10.   

 (e) The provisions of this Section 3.10 are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties, their heirs and their representatives.   

 3.11. _Takeover Statute_. If any Takeover Statute or bye-law of the Company or Bermuda Limited is or may become applicable to the Amalgamation, the Sub Amalgamation or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Amalgamation Agreement or the Sub Amalgamation Agreement, each of Parent and the Company and its respective board of directors shall grant such approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that such transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement, the Amalgamation Agreement and the Sub Amalgamation Agreement and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of such statute or regulation on such transactions.   

 3.12. _Conduct of Parent_.   

 (a) Parent agrees that, during the period from the date hereof and continuing until the earlier of the termination of this Agreement or the Closing, except as required by applicable Law, and except as may be consented to in writing by the Company, Parent shall not, and shall not authorize any of its direct or indirect Subsidiaries or any Affiliates to (i)take any action or agree, in writing or otherwise, to take any action that would reasonably be likely to result in any of the representations and warranties set forth in Section 2.2 becoming false or inaccurate such that the conditions set forth in Sections 4.1 or 4.3 would fail to be satisfied, or (ii) enter into or consummate (A) any agreements or arrangements for an acquisition (via share purchase, merger, consolidation, purchase of assets or otherwise) or joint venture with respect to a fixed satellite services operator that owns and operates satellites which provide transponder capacity commercially, (B) any agreements or arrangements for sales of any securities or any assets of Parent, the Company, the Amalgamated Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any Person or (C) any other agreements or arrangements, in each case of clauses (A) through (C), reasonably likely to have an Amalgamated Company Material Adverse Effect.   

 3.13. _Debt Financing_.   

 (a) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Debt Financing on the terms and conditions described in the Debt Financing Commitment Letters, including using its reasonable best efforts to (i) negotiate definitive agreements with respect thereto on terms and conditions contained therein, (ii) satisfy all conditions applicable to Parent in such definitive agreements, (iii) comply with its obligations under the Debt Financing Commitment Letters, (iv) enforce its rights under the Debt Financing Commitment Letters and (v) in the event the Debt Financing Commitment Letters are terminated prior to the Closing, obtain a renewal of, or a substitute for, the Debt Financing Commitment Letters on terms and conditions comparable in all material respects to the terms and conditions contemplated in the Debt Financing Commitment Letters or on more favorable terms to Parent. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Parent and the Company agree that if at any time the conditions to closing set forth    ##### 

  

    

in Section 4.1 or Section 4.2 have been satisfied or waived (other than
the conditions set forth in Section 4.2(d) and any conditions that may only
be satisfied at Closing) and at such time the Notes (as defined in the
Debt Financing Commitment Letters) have not been issued then Parent shall
have a period of fifteen business days to either cause such Notes to be
issued or cause the Interim Loans (as defined in the Debt Financing
Commitment Letters) to be borrowed in full, it being understood that Parent
shall not be required to cause such issuances or borrowings to occur if all
conditions to Closing (other than Section 4.2(d)) are not satisfied at such
time. In the event any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on
terms and conditions comparable in all material respects to the terms and
conditions contemplated in the Debt Financing Commitment Letters, Parent
shall use its reasonable best efforts to arrange to obtain any such portion
from alternative sources on comparable or more favorable terms to Parent.
Parent shall give the Company prompt notice upon becoming aware of any
material breach by any party of the Debt Financing Commitment Letters or any
termination of the Debt Financing Commitment Letters. Parent shall keep the
Company informed on a reasonable basis and in reasonable detail of the status
of its efforts to arrange the Debt Financing and shall not permit any
amendment or modification to be made to, or any waiver of any material
provision or remedy under, the Debt Financing Commitment Letters if such
amendment, modification, waiver or remedy reduces the aggregate amount of the
Financing, amends the conditions to the drawdown of the financing or is
adverse to the interests of the Company or the Amalgamated Company in any
other respect.   

 (b) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall provide, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the respective officers, employees, Representatives, including legal and accounting, of the Company and its Subsidiaries to, provide all cooperation reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the Debt Financing on the terms and conditions described in the Debt Financing Commitment Letters, and shall cause (i) appropriate officers and employees to be available on a customary basis to meet with prospective lenders and investors in presentations, meetings, road shows and due diligence sessions, to assist with the preparation of disclosure documents in connection therewith, to execute and deliver customary certificates, legal opinions (which may be reasoned, if counsel reasonably believes it cannot give the opinion otherwise) or documents as may be reasonably requested by Parent, and (ii) its independent accountants and counsel to provide assistance to Parent, including providing consent, on a customary basis, to Parent to use their audit reports relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries and, at the cost of Parent, to provide any necessary "comfort letters" and to prepare and deliver other customary opinions or other deliverables.   

 (c) Provided that Parent provides to the Company such information concerning Parent and its Subsidiaries and the Debt Financing as the Company reasonably requests or requires in connection with the following, the Company shall cause the following to occur: not later than 30 days before the Closing Date, the Administrative Agent (as defined in the Debt Financing Commitment Letters) shall have received audited, in the case of year end, and unaudited, in the case of interim (which have been reviewed by the independent accountants for the Company as provided in Statement on Auditing Standards No. 100), consolidated financial statements of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries (including Bermuda Limited and the Guarantors (as defined in the Debt Financing Commitment Letters)) and financial statements relating to completed or probable acquisitions (including pro forma financial statements), in each case required by and meeting the requirements of Regulation S-X that would apply to a Form S-1 registration statement being filed by the Company on such date of delivery under the Securities    ##### 

  

    

Act of 1933, as amended (except with respect to the financial statements of
the Loral Transferred Satellites (as such term is used in the Form F-1 as
filed by the Company with the SEC on April 22, 2004) and the pro forma
financial information giving effect to the Companys acquisition of the Loral
Transferred Satellites, as modified in accordance with the letter of
the Company to the SEC, dated August 26, 2003, and the SECs response
thereto, dated August 28, 2003); _provided_ _that_ , if on any date during
such 30-day period prior to the Closing Date financial statements for a
later period-end would be required if the Company filed a registration
statement on Form S-1 on such date, and the Administrative Agent requests
that such financial statement be provided, then financial statements with
such later period-end meeting the forgoing requirements shall have also been
received reasonably promptly following such request and in any event prior to
the Closing Date.   

 (d) The Parties agree that nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent any Subsidiary of the Company from providing the funds necessary to enable the Company to satisfy its obligations as and when they come due under debt securities of the Company outstanding as of the date of this Agreement, pursuant to the terms thereof.   

 (e) Parents Debt Financing will contain provisions with the same substance to clauses (i) and (ii) of the definition of Restricted Payments Carve-outs in Exhibit A to the Debt Financing Commitment Letter (relating to the ability to payments on existing indebtedness of the Company).   

 3.14. _ORBIT Act Matters_. __    

 The Company will use its reasonable best efforts to achieve an extension of the time within which it must complete an initial public offering of its Shares in order to be in full compliance with all of its obligations under the ORBIT Act. If no such extension has occurred by the date which is 105 days prior to the then-current deadline (such then-current deadline, the " _Deadline_ ") for the satisfaction of such obligations, the Company may file a registration statement contemplating an initial public offering and other documentation relating to listing of Shares in order to achieve such satisfaction (the " _ _IPO__ ") and such other actions customarily occurring after such actions. The IPO shall be on such stock exchange, at such price and with such underwriters as the Company may reasonably determine, in each case, with the consent of Parent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed). Prior to the filing of any documents or written correspondence with the SEC concerning the IPO, the Company shall provide Parent and its Representatives a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such documents and shall consider in good faith such comments. The IPO shall be of not more than 15% of the outstanding Shares. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may not sell securities in the IPO at any time prior to the date that is ten business days prior to the Deadline. If the Company sells Shares in the IPO, the Amalgamation Consideration shall be the Adjusted Amount. For the purposes of this Agreement:   

 " _ _Adjusted Amount__ " means the per share amount calculated by dividing (x) the sum of (A) Equity Value plus (b) Net Proceeds from IPO by (y) the number of Fully Diluted Shares Post IPO (in each case as defined below).     ##### 

  

  

 " _ _Equity Value__ " is defined to means the Amalgamation Consideration (without giving effect to any adjustment hereunder) multiplied by the Fully Diluted Shares outstanding as of the date hereof.   

 " _ _Net Proceeds from IPO__ " means the gross cash proceeds from the IPO less all underwriting discounts, and less fees and expenses related to the IPO (as set forth on the Companys books and records in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and in each case set forth above including in connection with any overallotment option).   

 " _ _Fully Diluted Shares_ " _means the total number of Shares outstanding as of the relevant date determined using the Treasury method applied in accordance with GAAP.   

 " _ _Fully Diluted Shares Post IPO_ " _means the Fully Diluted Shares outstanding after, and after giving effect to, the IPO (including overallotment, if any).

relevant event, pay Parent an amount equal to $120,000,000 (the " _ _Fee__
"), less any Expenses previously paid by the Company to Parent, by wire
transfer of same day funds to an account designated by Parent in writing;
_provided_ , _however_ , that in the event the termination is pursuant to
Section 5.4(d) as provided above and the breach giving rise to such
termination is demonstrated by the Company to be inadvertent, the Company
shall not be required to pay the Expenses within the two business day period,
but shall pay the full amount of the Fee in the event that the events set
forth in clause (B) occur. The Company acknowledges that the agreements
contained in this Section 5.5(b) are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, Parent
would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails to
promptly pay the amount due pursuant to this Section 5.5(b), and, in order to
obtain such payment, Parent commences a suit that results in a judgment
against the Company for the fee set forth in this Section 5.5(b) or any
portion of such fee, the Company shall pay to Parent its costs and
expenses (including attorneys fees) in connection with such suit, together
with interest on the amount of the fee at the prime rate of Citibank, N.A. in
effect on the date such payment was required to be made from the date such
payment was required to be made through the date of payment.

 6.7. _Entire Agreement._ This Agreement (including any Exhibits and Annexes hereto), the Amalgamation Agreement (including any Schedules thereto) and the Sub Amalgamation Agreement (including any Schedules thereto) constitute the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersede all other prior agreements, understandings, representations and warranties both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof.   

 6.8. _No Third Party Beneficiaries._ Except as provided in Section 3.10, this Agreement is not intended to, and does not, confer upon any Person other than the parties who are signatories hereto any rights or remedies hereunder. The parties hereto further agree that the rights of third party beneficiaries under Section 3.10 shall not arise unless and until the Effective Time occurs.   

 6.9. _Obligations of Parent and of the Company._ Whenever this Agreement requires a Subsidiary of Parent to take any action, such requirement shall be deemed to include an undertaking on the part of Parent to cause such Subsidiary to take such action. Whenever this Agreement requires a Subsidiary of the Company to take any action, such requirement shall be deemed to include an undertaking on the part of the Company to cause such Subsidiary to take such action and, after the Effective Time, on the part of the Amalgamated Company to cause such Subsidiary to take such action.   

 6.10. _Transfer Taxes._ All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other such Taxes and fees (including penalties and interest) incurred in connection with the Amalgamation and the Sub Amalgamation shall be paid by the Amalgamated Company or the Amalgamated Sub Company, as the case may be.

 6.12. _Severability._ The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not affect the validity or enforceability or the other provisions hereof. If any provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof to any Person or any circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable and equitable provision shall be substituted therefor in order to carry out, so far as may be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid or unenforceable provision and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances shall not be affected by such invalidity or unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity or unenforceability affect the validity or enforceability of such provision, or the application thereof, in any other jurisdiction.   

 6.13. _Interpretation; Construction._ (a) The table of contents and headings herein are for convenience of reference only, do not constitute part of this Agreement and shall not be deemed to limit or otherwise affect any of the provisions hereof.

 (b) The parties have participated jointly in negotiating and drafting this Agreement. In the event that an ambiguity or a question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provision of this Agreement. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to require any party hereto to violate any applicable Law.   

 _Assignment._ This Agreement shall not be assignable by operation of law or otherwise; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent may designate, by written notice to the Company, another wholly owned direct or indirect Subsidiary incorporated under the laws of Bermuda to be a Constituent Company in lieu of Amalgamation Sub, and may so designate another Subsidiary incorporated under the laws of Bermuda to be a constituent company of Amalgamation Sub Two in lieu of Amalgamation Sub Two, in which event all references herein to Amalgamation Sub or Amalgamation Sub Two, as the case may be, shall be deemed references to such other Subsidiary, except that all representations and warranties made herein with respect to Amalgamation Sub or Amalgamation Sub Two, as the case may be, as of the date of this Agreement shall be deemed representations and warranties made with respect to such other Subsidiary as of the date of such designation;  _provided_ , _further_ , that Parent may designate, by written notice to the Company, an Affiliate of Parent incorporated under the laws of Bermuda to be hold all rights held by Parent in lieu of Parent, in which event all references herein to Parent shall be deemed references to such Affiliate of Parent, except that all representations and warranties made herein with respect to Parent as of the date of this Agreement shall be deemed representations and warranties made with respect to such Affiliate of Parent as of the date of such designation. Any purported assignment in violation of this Agreement is void.     #####
