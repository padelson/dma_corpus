(a)&nbsp;of this Section&nbsp;3.10, upon learning of any such claim, action, suit,

thereof, but the failure to so notify shall not relieve the Amalgamated Company
of any liability it may have to such Indemnified Party if such failure does not
materially prejudice the indemnifying party. In the event of any such claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before or after the

defense thereof and the Amalgamated Company shall not be liable to such
Indemnified Parties for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other

which raise conflicts of interest between the Amalgamated Company and the
Indemnified Parties, the Indemnified Parties may retain counsel satisfactory to

hereunder to any Indemnified Party if and when a court of competent
jurisdiction shall ultimately determine, and such determination shall have
become final, that the indemnification of such Indemnified Party in the manner
contemplated hereby is prohibited by applicable Law. If such indemnity is not
available with respect to any Indemnified Party, then Parent shall provide the
Indemnified Parties with the monies necessary to fully implement the indemnity
provided herein, and if such payments are not permitted by applicable Law, the

Amalgamated Company, after using its reasonable best efforts, is unable to
purchase such tail the Amalgamated Company will obtain that amount of officers&#146;

of the current annual premium paid by the Company (which annual premium is set
forth on Section&nbsp;3.10(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter); <U>provided</U>,

termination is pursuant to Section&nbsp;5.4(d) as provided above and the breach
giving rise to such termination is demonstrated by the Company to be

that the events set forth in clause (B)&nbsp;occur. The Company acknowledges that
the agreements contained in this Section&nbsp;5.5(b) are an integral part of the

judgment against the Company for the fee set forth in this Section&nbsp;5.5(b) or

(including attorneys&#146; fees) in connection with such suit, together with
interest on the amount of the fee at the prime rate of Citibank, N.A. in effect

Annexes hereto), the Amalgamation Agreement (including any Schedules thereto)
and the Sub Amalgamation Agreement (including any Schedules thereto) constitute
the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter
hereof, and supersede all other prior agreements, understandings,
representations and warranties both written and oral, among the parties with

Agreement requires a Subsidiary of Parent to take any action, such requirement
shall be deemed to include an undertaking on the part of Parent to cause such
Subsidiary to take such action. Whenever this Agreement requires a Subsidiary
of the Company to take any action, such requirement shall be deemed to include
an undertaking on the part of the Company to cause such Subsidiary to take such
action and, after the Effective Time, on the part of the Amalgamated Company to
cause such Subsidiary to take such action.

by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or
