Property");

(h) all Imbalances relating to the Properties or other Assets;

(i) all geophysical and other seismic and related technical data and
information relating to the Assets, excluding any proprietary geologic and

unless Buyer has paid such expenditures and entered into a license agreement

(j) all of the rights, titles and interests of Seller in and to all of the

Records shall not include any of the foregoing to the extent a transfer or
disclosure would be restricted by obligations of confidentiality (provided,
however, that Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain a
waiver of such restriction, provided, however, that Seller shall not be
required to incur any out-of-pocket costs in seeking to obtain any such
waiver) or to the extent that such information is privileged (excluding,
however, title opinions and Applicable Contracts);

(k) any claims and causes of action arising under or with respect to any Asset

an Assumed Obligation;

(l) all audit rights arising under any of the Applicable Contracts or
otherwise with respect to any period from or after the Effective Time
pertaining to any of the Assets or that relate to an Assumed Obligation (or
any other obligation which is the responsibility of Buyer hereunder) and, in
each case, to the extent not relating to any Retained Obligations; and



(m) any amounts held in suspense by Seller or any Third Party on Seller's
behalf pertaining to any of the Assets and that relate to an Assumed
Obligation.

Section 2.2. Excluded Assets. Seller shall reserve and retain all of the
Excluded Assets.

Section 2.3. Revenues and Expenses.

(a) Subject to the provisions hereof, Seller shall remain entitled to all of
the rights of ownership (including the right to all production, proceeds of
production and other proceeds) attributable to, and shall remain responsible
for all Operating Expenses incurred with respect to, the Assets for the period
of time prior to the Effective Time. Subject to the provisions hereof, and
subject to the occurrence of the Closing, Buyer shall be entitled to all of
the rights of ownership (including the right to all production, proceeds of
production and other proceeds) attributable to, and shall be responsible for
all Operating Expenses incurred with respect to, the Assets for the period of
time from and after the Effective Time. Subject to the provisions hereof, all
Operating Expenses attributable to the Assets, in each case that are: (i)
incurred prior to the Effective Time shall be paid by or allocated to Seller
and (ii) incurred from or after the Effective Time shall be paid by or
allocated to Buyer. "Operating Expenses" means all operating expenses
(including obligations to pay working interests, Royalties or other interest
owners' revenues or proceeds attributable to sales of Hydrocarbons relating to
the Properties and including costs of insurance) and capital expenditures
incurred in the ownership and operation of the Assets in the ordinary course
of business and, where applicable, in accordance with the relevant operating
or unit agreement, if any, and overhead costs charged to the Assets by Buyer
or its Affiliate under the relevant operating agreement or unit agreement, if
any, but excluding other overhead, general and administrative, and similar
costs (without limiting Section 3.2(a)(v)) and further excluding, in each
case, costs incurred by Seller (w) to cure any Title Defect (excluding any
ordinary course title curative undertaken in furtherance of the drilling or
completion of any well on the Properties on or after the Effective Time) or to
cure or remediate any Environmental Condition that exceeds the Individual
Environmental Threshold, regardless of whether raised by Buyer under Article X
and/or Article XI; (x) in respect of Retained Obligations; (y) in respect of
Taxes and Transfer Taxes; or (z) in respect of any indemnification, defense,
hold harmless, contribution, or reimbursement requirement under Section 12.2,
regardless of Section 12.4. Determination of whether Operating Expenses are
incurred before or after the Effective Time for purposes of this Section
2.3(a) is based on when services are rendered, when goods are delivered or
when the work is performed. Operating Expenses that are paid periodically
shall be prorated based on the number of days in the applicable period falling
before, or on or after, the Effective Time, as applicable. Operating Expenses
allocable to both the Assets and other assets and properties (including costs
of insurance) shall be prorated between the Assets to which such Operating
Expenses apply and such other assets and properties pursuant to Seller's past
accounting practices, consistently applied, or, if no such accounting
practices exist, a methodology reasonably reflective of the costs of ownership
of the applicable Assets and any other assets and properties, in any case,
excluding the effects of this Agreement.

(b) For purposes of allocating production (and proceeds of production and
other proceeds) under this Section 2.3, (i) liquid Hydrocarbons shall be
deemed to be "from or attributable



to" the Properties when they pass through the pipeline connecting into the
storage facilities into which they are run and (ii) gaseous Hydrocarbons shall
be deemed to be "from or attributable to" the Properties when they pass
through the royalty measurement meters, delivery point sales meters or custody
transfer meters on the gathering lines or pipelines through which they are
transported (whichever meter is closest to the well). Seller shall utilize
reasonable interpolative procedures to arrive at an allocation of production
when exact meter readings or gauging and strapping data is not available.

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 2.3 to the contrary and without
limiting Buyer's rights with respect to Section 4.23(b) and Section
12.2(c)(vii) (as such rights may be limited by Article XII), (i) the Final
Settlement Statement shall be the final accounting for any and all Operating
Expenses owing from Seller to Buyer, and there shall be no adjustment for, or
obligation to pay, any Operating Expenses owing from Seller to Buyer following
the final determination of the Final Settlement Statement, and (ii) all
Operating Expenses attributable to the Assets and not otherwise accounted for
in the Final Settlement Statement shall become an "Assumed Obligation" as and
to the extent set forth in Article XII.

ARTICLE III

PURCHASE PRICE

Section 3.1. Purchase Price; Deposit.

(a) The purchase price for the Assets shall be Two Hundred and Forty-Five
Million Dollars ($245,000,000) (the "Purchase Price"), payable in United
States currency by wire transfer in same day funds as and when provided in
this Agreement.

(b) Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, Buyer has deposited by
wire transfer in same day funds with Seller an amount equal to Twenty-Four
Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($24,500,000) (the "Deposit"), which
amount represents ten percent (10%) of the Purchase Price. The Deposit
(without interest) shall be applied towards the Adjusted Purchase Price at
Closing in accordance with Section 8.3(a)(vii) or be distributed in accordance
with the terms of Section 13.2, as applicable.

Section 3.2. Adjustments to Purchase Price. The Purchase Price shall be
adjusted as follows, and the resulting amount shall be herein called the
"Adjusted Purchase Price":

(a) The Purchase Price shall be adjusted upward by the following amounts
(without duplication):

(i) an amount equal to all proceeds received by Buyer following Closing, in
each case attributable to the sale of Hydrocarbons produced from or
attributable or allocable to the Assets prior to the Effective Time, net of
any Asset Taxes not already taken into account under Section 3.2(b)(iii),
incurred in connection therewith and not reimbursed to Buyer by a Third Party
purchaser and net of all Royalties (provided that to the extent such a netting
for Royalties is made, Buyer shall assume



the obligation to pay the netted amounts to the Persons to whom such amounts
are due);

(ii) an amount equal to all Operating Expenses paid by Seller and not
reimbursed to Seller that are incurred with respect to, the Assets on or after
the Effective Time, whether paid before or after the Effective Time;

(iii) the amount of all Asset Taxes prorated to Buyer pursuant to Section
14.1(b) but paid by Seller;

(iv) an amount equal to the value of all merchantable Hydrocarbons (excluding
basic sediment and water and tank bottoms) produced from or attributable or
allocable to the Assets that, at the Effective Time, are in storage or tanks,
or above the load level connection or within processing plants, at $50.00 per
barrel (with respect to non-gaseous Hydrocarbons) or $3.00 per MCF (with
respect to gaseous Hydrocarbons);

(v) for the period of time from the Effective Time until Closing, monthly
indirect overhead for producing and drilling/completing Wells included in the
Seller Operated Properties that would normally be charged under the applicable
joint operating agreement shall instead be calculated as a flat fee of Ninety
Thousand Dollars ($90,000.00) per month, prorated for any partial month;

(vi) any capital expenditures incurred by Seller with respect to the
Properties listed on Schedule 3.2(a)(vi) and attributable to periods before
the Effective Time;

(vii) an amount equal to the value of any Imbalances by which Seller is
underproduced or overdelivered priced at $3.00 per Mcf for gas Imbalances,
existing as of the Effective Time; and

(viii) any other amount provided for elsewhere in this Agreement or otherwise
agreed upon by Seller and Buyer.

(b) The Purchase Price shall be adjusted downward by the following amounts

adjustments in accordance with Section 3.4.

Section 3.4. Preliminary Settlement Statement. Not less than two (2) business
days prior to the Closing, Seller shall prepare and submit to Buyer for review
a draft settlement statement (the "Preliminary Settlement Statement") that
shall set forth the Adjusted Purchase Price, reflecting each adjustment made

Preliminary Settlement Statement and the calculation of the adjustments used
to determine such amount, together with reasonable supporting documentation
and the designation of Seller's account for the wire transfers of funds as set
forth in Section 8.3(a)(vii). Within twenty-four (24) hours after receipt of
the Preliminary Settlement Statement, Buyer will deliver to Seller a written
report containing all changes with the explanation therefor that Buyer
proposes to be made to the Preliminary Settlement Statement. The Preliminary
Settlement Statement, as agreed upon by the parties, will be used to adjust

adjustments to the Purchase Price on the Preliminary Settlement Statement
(excluding adjustments to the Purchase Price under Section 3.2(b)(v), Section

absent manifest error.



Section 3.5. Final Settlement Statement. On or before 120 days after the
Closing, a final settlement statement (the "Final Settlement Statement") will
be prepared by Seller, based on actual income and expenses during the Interim
Period and which takes into account all final adjustments made to the Purchase
Price (excluding any unresolved disputed matters under Section 11.1(b), or
Section 10.2(c)) and shows the resulting final Purchase Price ("Final Price").
The Final Settlement Statement shall set forth the actual proration of the
amounts required by this Agreement (including Section 2.3). As soon as
practicable, and in any event within 30 days, after receipt of the Final
Settlement Statement, Buyer shall return a written report containing any
proposed changes to the Final Settlement Statement and an explanation of any
such changes and the reasons therefor (the "Settlement Statement Dispute
Notice"). If the Final Price set forth in the Final Settlement Statement is
mutually agreed upon by Seller and Buyer or if Buyer fails to timely deliver
the Settlement Statement Dispute Notice, the Final Settlement Statement and
the Final Price, shall be final and binding on the parties hereto (excluding
any unresolved disputed matters under Section 11.1(b)(i) or Section 10.2(c)
and without limiting the other express rights of the parties under this
Agreement). Any difference in the Adjusted Purchase Price as paid at Closing
pursuant to the Preliminary Settlement Statement and the Final Price shall be
paid by the owing party within ten days to the owed party. All amounts paid
pursuant to this Section 3.5 shall be delivered in United States currency by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account specified in
writing by the relevant party.

Section 3.6. Disputes. If Seller and Buyer are unable to resolve the matters
addressed in a timely delivered Settlement Statement Dispute Notice, each of
Buyer and Seller shall, within 14 business days after the delivery of such
Settlement Statement Dispute Notice, summarize its position with regard to
such dispute in a written document and submit such summaries to the Houston
office of Grant Thornton LLP, or such other party as the parties may mutually
select (the "Accounting Arbitrator"), together with the Settlement Statement
Dispute Notice, the Final Settlement Statement and any other documentation
such party may desire to submit. The Accounting Arbitrator shall calculate the
Final Price based on the information submitted by the parties and in
accordance with the adjustment methodology set forth in this Article III, and
render its decision no later than 20 days after receiving the parties'
respective submissions. The Accounting Arbitrator shall act as an expert for
the limited purpose of determining the specific disputed aspects of the
adjustments to the Purchase Price under this Article III submitted by a party
and may not award damages, interest or penalties to any party with respect to
any matter. Any decision rendered by the Accounting Arbitrator pursuant hereto
shall be final, conclusive and binding on Seller and Buyer and will be
enforceable against any of the parties in any court of competent jurisdiction.
The costs of such Accounting Arbitrator shall be borne one-half by Buyer and
one-half by Seller. Any difference in the Adjusted Purchase Price as paid at
Closing pursuant to the Preliminary Settlement Statement and the Final Price,
as determined by the Accounting Arbitrator, shall be paid by the owing party
within ten days to the owed party.

Section 3.7. Allocation of Purchase Price for Tax Purposes. For federal income
Tax purposes, Buyer and Seller agree that the Final Price and any other items
properly treated as consideration for federal income Tax purposes shall be
allocated among the Assets transferred to Buyer by each of (i) Carrizo and
(ii) Carrizo Eagle Ford in accordance with the principles of Section 1060 of
the Code and the Treasury Regulations and in a manner reasonably consistent
with the



Allocated Values, and will be set forth in separate schedules proposed by
Buyer and reasonably acceptable to Seller (the "Tax Allocations"). If Seller
and Buyer are unable to agree upon the Tax Allocations within 15 days of
delivery of proposed schedules by Buyer, the matter will be submitted to the
Accounting Arbitrator for binding resolution in accordance with Section 3.6.
Buyer and Seller shall each bear their own respective costs of obtaining such
resolution, except that any fees and expenses related to the procurement of
services from an Accounting Arbitrator shall be shared equally by Buyer and
Seller. Buyer and Seller agree that (i) the Tax Allocations shall be used by
Seller and Buyer as the basis for reporting asset values and other items for
purposes of all federal, state and local Tax Returns, including Internal
Revenue Service Form 8594 and (ii) neither they nor their Affiliates will take
positions inconsistent with such Tax Allocations in notices to Governmental
Authorities, in audit or other proceedings with respect to Taxes. Seller makes
no representation or warranty as to the accuracy of any value determined
hereunder.

Section 3.8. Allocated Value. The "Allocated Value" for any Asset equals the
portion of the unadjusted Purchase Price allocated to such Asset on Schedule
3.8 and such Allocated Value shall be used in calculating adjustments to the
Purchase Price as provided herein. Seller makes no representation or warranty
as to the accuracy of any Allocated Value.

Buyer acknowledges that Seller owns undivided interests in certain of the
Properties where Seller is not the operator, and Buyer agrees that the acts or
omissions of the other working interest owners (including the operators) who
are not Seller or an Affiliate of Seller shall not constitute a breach of the
provisions of this Section 6.1, nor shall any action required by a vote of
working interest owners constitute such a breach so long as Seller and its
Affiliates have not proposed an action that would be in violation of this
Section 6.1 and have voted their interest in a manner that complies with the
provisions of this Section 6.1. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Section 6.1, subsections (ii) and (iii) of the lead-in of this Section
6.1 shall only constitute exceptions to Sections 6.1(e), (i), and (j).



Section 6.2. Notification of Breaches. Until the Closing:

(a) Buyer shall use good faith efforts to notify Seller promptly after Buyer
obtains actual Knowledge that any representation or warranty of Seller
contained in this Agreement is untrue in any material respect or will be
untrue in any material respect as of the Closing Date or that any covenant or
agreement to be performed or observed by Seller prior to or on the Closing
Date has not been so performed or observed in any material respect.

(b) Seller shall use good faith efforts to notify Buyer promptly after Seller
obtains actual knowledge that any representation or warranty of Buyer
contained in this Agreement is untrue in any material respect or will be
untrue in any material respect as of the Closing Date or that any covenant or
agreement to be performed or observed by Buyer prior to or on the Closing Date
has not been so performed or observed in any material respect.

Section 6.3. Successor Operator. While Buyer acknowledges that it desires to
succeed Seller as operator of the Seller Operated Properties, Buyer
acknowledges and agrees that Seller cannot and does not covenant or warrant
that Buyer shall become successor operator of the same since the Seller
Operated Properties or portions thereof may be subject to operating or other
agreements that control the appointment of a successor operator. Seller
agrees, however, that as to the Seller Operated Properties, to the extent
permitted under any joint operating agreement, Seller shall vote its interests
in favor of Buyer as successor operator and use its commercially reasonable
efforts to support Buyer's efforts to become successor operator (to the extent
permitted under any joint operating agreement) effective as of the Closing and
to designate or appoint, by assignment, to the extent legally possible, Buyer
as successor operator effective as of Closing.

Section 6.4. Governmental and Third Party Bonds. Buyer acknowledges that no
bonds, letters of credit and guarantees that have been posted by Seller or its
Affiliates with Governmental Authorities and Third Parties and relating to the
Assets are transferable to Buyer and any bonds, letter of credit and
guarantees shall be cancelled by Seller at or after Closing. On or before the
Closing Date, Buyer shall obtain, or cause to be obtained in the name of Buyer
or its designee, replacements for those bonds, letters of credit and
guarantees set forth on Schedule 4.21 to the extent required for Buyer to own
the Assets.

Section 6.5. Record Retention. Buyer shall, for the longer of a period of
seven years and as required by Law, following Closing, retain the Records and
provide Seller, its Affiliates, and its and their officers, employees and
representatives with reasonable access upon prior notice to the Records (to
the extent that Seller has not retained the original or a copy) during normal
business hours for review and copying at Seller's expense; provided that Buyer
may destroy Records from time to time and prior to the end of such period in
accordance with its normal document retention policy as long as Buyer notifies
Seller in advance and provides Seller with an opportunity to copy such Records
at Seller's expense. Buyer shall also provide Seller, its Affiliates and its
and their officers, employees and representatives with reasonable access
during normal business hours to Records relating to any indemnification claim
made under this Agreement with respect to a Claim for review and copying at
Seller's expense.



Section 6.6. Like-Kind Exchange. Seller and Buyer agree that either or both of
Seller and Buyer may elect to treat the acquisition or sale of the Assets as
an exchange of like-kind property under section 1031 of the Code or similar
section of the Code and any corresponding state income tax provisions (a
"Like-Kind Exchange"). Each such party shall cooperate fully, to the extent
reasonably requested by the other party, in connection with accommodating a
Like-Kind Exchange. Each party reserves the right, at or prior to Closing, to
assign its rights under this Agreement to a qualified intermediary (as that
term is defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.1031(k)-1(g)(4)(iii)) or an
exchange accommodation titleholder (as that term is defined in Internal
Revenue Service Revenue Procedure 2000-37) to effect an Exchange to accomplish
this transaction, in whole or in part, in a manner that will comply with the
requirements of a Like-Kind Exchange. In connection with any such Like-Kind
Exchange, any exchange accommodation title holder shall have taken all steps
necessary to own the Assets under applicable Law. Each party hereby consents
to the other party's assignment of its rights in this Agreement; provided that
the Closing shall not be delayed or affected by reason of the Like-Kind
Exchange. Each party acknowledges and agrees that a whole or partial
assignment of its rights under this Agreement shall not release such
exchanging party from any of its respective liabilities and obligations to the
other cooperating party or expand any liabilities or obligations of such
cooperating party under this Agreement. The cooperating party shall not be
obligated to pay any additional costs or incur any additional obligations if
such costs are the result of the exchanging party's Like-Kind Exchange, and
the exchanging party shall indemnify the cooperating party, its Affiliates,
and their respective former, current and future partners, members,
shareholders, owners, officers, directors, managers, employees, agents and
representatives against any Claims arising from such exchanging party's Like-
Kind Exchange. No representations are made that any particular tax treatment
will be given to either party as a result of the Like-Kind Exchange.

Section 6.7. Marketing and Transportation Agreements. Seller shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the consents necessary to assign any
marketing and transportation agreements before Closing. However, if Seller is
unable to obtain such consents prior to Closing, Seller shall, if permitted
under the terms of such agreements and applicable Law, make available the
benefits of such marketing and transportation agreements to Buyer by marketing
and selling Buyer's Hydrocarbons through such agreements on the same terms and
conditions as they exist on the Closing Date or such amended terms and
conditions as Seller shall approve; provided, that Seller shall not be
obligated to extend the stated term of any marketing and transportation
agreements, including pursuant to any available renewal option; provided
further, that Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to replace such
agreements as soon as practicable. If Seller markets and sells Buyer's
Hydrocarbons pursuant to this Section 6.7, Buyer shall deliver such quantity
of Hydrocarbons to Seller as is sufficient to allow Seller to meet the minimum
quantity and quality commitments under such agreement at the delivery point
set forth therein. Buyer shall also fully comply with all other terms and
conditions of such marketing and transportation agreements as if it were a
party thereto. Buyer shall indemnify, defend, hold harmless and release the
Seller Indemnified Parties against any Claims arising from or related to
Seller's marketing and transportation of Buyer's Hydrocarbons, except for any
claims actually resulting from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of
Seller.



Section 6.8. Amendment to Schedules. Buyer agrees that, without limiting in
any respect Buyer's rights hereunder or under any other Transaction Document
or giving rise to or constituting a claim, counter-claim or other cause or
right of action by Seller or any Seller Indemnified Party, Seller shall have
the continuing right until Closing to add, supplement or amend the Schedules
to its representations and warranties with respect to any matter hereafter
arising or discovered by Seller after Seller's execution and delivery of this
Agreement (including the addition of Schedules that are responsive to the
representations and warranties contained herein but for which a Schedule is
not contemplated as of the Execution Date). Any such amendment shall be for
informational purposes only, shall not constitute a waiver of, or otherwise
impair in any respect the rights of the parties under the other provisions of
this Agreement or any other Transaction Document (including under Article
XII); shall not be admissible in any proceeding between or among the parties
or their Affiliates (or Buyer Indemnified Parties or Seller Indemnified
Parties, as applicable), whether pursuant to a defense of any claim, a
counter-claim, or otherwise, and, without limiting the foregoing, for purposes
of determining whether the conditions set forth in Section 7.1 have been
fulfilled and for purposes of determining whether Seller has breached any of
its representations and warranties contained in this Agreement, the Schedules
to Seller's representations and warranties contained in this Agreement shall
be deemed to include only that information contained therein on the Execution
Date and shall be deemed to exclude all information contained in any addition,
supplement or amendment thereto.

Section 6.9. Tax Matters.

(a) Subject to Section 6.6, for federal income Tax purposes, Buyer and Seller
agree that the transaction contemplated by this Agreement shall be treated as
a sale and exchange of assets pursuant to section 1001 of the Code. Seller and
Buyer further agree that (i) they shall file all federal, state and local Tax
Returns consistently with this Section 6.9(a) and (ii) neither they nor their
Affiliates will take positions inconsistent with this Section 6.9(a) in
notices to Governmental Authorities, in audit or other proceedings with
respect to Taxes.

(b) As soon as practicable, Seller shall cause the Tax Partnership to
terminate effective on December 31, 2017. Seller shall cause the Tax
Partnership to timely file a final Internal Revenue Service Form 1065 U.S.
Partnership Return of Income and Internal Revenue Service Schedule K-1 (or
such successor form and schedule) for the tax year ending on December 31,
2017.

(c) As soon as practicable after Closing but no later than April 15, 2019,
pursuant to Section 3.3 of the Tax Partnership Agreement of the Tax
Partnership, Seller agrees to take any action after the Tax Partnership is
terminated, as is necessary to validly elect out of the provisions of
Subchapter K Chapter 1 of Subtitle A of the Code with respect to the Joint
Interests (as defined in the PPA) for the taxable year that includes the
Closing Date (such actions include the filing of any returns and information
statements required under Treas. Reg. Section 1.761-2(b) as consented to by
the parties thereto). Seller shall deliver to Buyer a copy of such election as
soon as practicable after such election is filed with the Internal Revenue
Service.

ARTICLE IX

ACCESS; CONFIDENTIALITY; USE; DISCLAIMERS

Section 9.1. Access.

(a) From and after the date hereof and up to delivery of the Records to Buyer
as provided in Section 8.4 (or earlier termination of this Agreement) but
subject to the other provisions of this Section 9.1 and obtaining any required
consents of Third Parties, including Third Party operators of the Assets (with
respect to which consents Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain), Seller shall afford to Buyer and its officers, employees, agents,
accountants, attorneys, consultants and other authorized representatives
("Buyer's Representatives") reasonable access, during normal business hours,
to the Seller Operated Properties and all Records in Seller's or its
Affiliates' possession relating to the Assets. Seller shall also make
available to Buyer and Buyer's Representatives, upon reasonable notice during
normal business hours, Seller's and Seller's Affiliates' personnel
knowledgeable with respect to the Assets so that Buyer may make such
reasonable diligence investigation as Buyer considers reasonably necessary or
appropriate. All investigations and due diligence conducted by Buyer or any
Buyer's Representative shall be conducted at Buyer's sole cost and expense and
any conclusions made from any examination done by Buyer or any Buyer's
Representative shall result from Buyer's own independent review and judgment
and shall be conducted so as not to interfere unreasonably with the operation
of the business of Seller and shall not require Seller to waive any attorney-
client privilege nor to violate any contractual obligation. In addition,
Seller shall provide Buyer with access to any records and to Seller's
Representatives to the extent reasonably requested and necessary to respond to
any tax audit or inquiry suggesting that Buyer is liable as successor,
transferee or member of a group having joint and several liability for any
Taxes payable by Buyer but allocated to Seller or its Affiliates under Section
14.1; provided, however, Seller shall not be required to take any action
pursuant to this Section 9.1 which would result in a waiver of attorney-client
privilege.



(b) Buyer shall be entitled to conduct a Phase I environmental property
assessment with respect to the Assets (excluding the Buyer Operated
Properties). Seller or its designee shall have the right to accompany Buyer
and Buyer's Representatives whenever they are on site on such Assets and also
to collect split test samples if any are collected; provided, however, subject
to Buyer providing Seller at least 2 business days' prior written notice of
Buyer's proposed site access particulars (including, without limitation, an
arrival schedule and list of persons to be present), Buyer's rights under this
Section 9.1 shall apply regardless of whether Seller or such designee elects
or is able to so accompany Buyer or Buyer's Representative, and neither Buyer
nor Buyer's Representative shall be required to accommodate the schedules of
Seller or its designee. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Buyer
shall not have access to, and shall not be permitted to conduct any
environmental due diligence (including any Phase I environmental property
assessments) with respect to any Assets where Seller does not have the
authority to grant access for such due diligence (provided, however, Seller
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain permission from any
Third Party to allow Buyer and Buyer's Representatives such access). In the
event that Buyer's Phase I environmental property assessments with respect to
the Assets (excluding the Buyer Operated Properties) identify actual or
potential "recognized environmental conditions," then Buyer may request
Seller's permission to conduct additional Phase II environmental property
assessments with respect to such Assets (excluding the Buyer Operated
Properties) to further assess such conditions. Any sampling, boring, drilling
or other invasive investigation activities shall be considered "Phase II"
activities. The additional Phase II environmental property assessment
procedures relating to any additional investigation shall be submitted to
Seller in a Phase II environmental property assessment plan, which shall
include a written description of the proposed scope of the Phase II
assessment, including a description of the activities to be conducted, and a
description of the approximate location and expected timing of such
activities. Seller may, in its sole discretion, approve said Phase II
environmental property assessment plan, in whole or in part, and Buyer shall
not have the right to conduct any activities set forth in such plan until such
time that Seller has approved such plan in writing. Any such approved Phase II
environmental property assessment plan shall be conducted by a reputable
environmental consulting or engineering firm, approved in advance by Seller
(such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) and, once approved,
such environmental consulting or engineering firm shall be deemed to be a
"Buyer's Representative," and any such assessment shall be performed in
accordance with this Section 9.1 and in compliance with all Governmental
Requirements.

(c) Subject to Buyer providing Seller at least 2 business days' prior written
notice of Buyer's proposed site access particulars (including, without
limitation, an arrival schedule and list of persons to be present), Buyer
shall coordinate any environmental property assessments and physical
inspections of the Seller Operated Properties with Seller to minimize any
inconvenience to or interruption of the conduct of business by Seller. Buyer
shall abide by Seller's safety rules, regulations and operating policies while
conducting its due diligence evaluation of the Assets, including any
environmental or other inspection or assessment of the Seller Operated
Properties. Buyer hereby defends, indemnifies and holds harmless each of the
operators of the Assets and Seller Indemnified Parties from and against any
and all personal injury or property damage actually resulting from the access
permitted pursuant to this Section 9.1 and the related due diligence activity
conducted by Buyer or any Buyer's Representative with respect to the Assets,
EVEN IF SUCH LIABILITIES ARISE OUT OF OR RESULT FROM, SOLELY OR IN PART, THE
SOLE,



ACTIVE, PASSIVE, CONCURRENT OR COMPARATIVE NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR
OTHER FAULT OR VIOLATION OF LAW OF OR BY A MEMBER OF SELLER INDEMNIFIED
PARTIES, EXCEPTING ONLY LIABILITIES ACTUALLY RESULTING FROM THE GROSS
NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OF A MEMBER OF THE SELLER INDEMNIFIED
PARTIES.

(d) Buyer will promptly provide a copy of any final environmental report
prepared by any Third Party environmental consultant to Seller. Seller shall
not be deemed by its receipt of said documents or otherwise as a result of
Buyer's environmental assessment process to have made any representation or
warranty, expressed, implied or statutory, as to the condition of the Assets
or to the accuracy of said documents or the information contained therein, it
being understood that Seller's only representations or warranties with respect
to environmental matters shall be those set forth in Section 4.16 of this
Agreement.

(e) Upon completion of Buyer's due diligence, Buyer shall at its sole cost and
expense and without any cost or expense to Seller or its Affiliates, (i)
repair all damage done to the Assets in connection with Buyer's due diligence
in a manner that restores the Assets to the approximate same or better
condition existing prior to commencement of Buyer's due diligence and (ii)
remove all equipment, tools or other property brought onto the Assets in
connection with Buyer's due diligence. Any damage to the Assets (including the
leasehold associated therewith) resulting from Buyer's due diligence will be
promptly corrected by Buyer.

(f) As a condition to its entry onto any of the Seller Operated Properties the
environmental consultant shall obtain insurance coverage for general liability
in an amount not less than $3,000,000 per occurrence and hold professional
liability insurance. If the environmental consultant or Buyer fails to provide
Seller with evidence of such insurance, Seller may deny the environmental
consultant the right to enter upon the Seller Operated Properties. The parties
acknowledge and agree that, for purposes of this Section 9.1(f), as of the

the Assets, Buyer will become privy to confidential and other information of

and anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Seller shall have the non-
exclusive right to use in the ordinary course of business any information

Assets (including copies of any geologic and geophysical interpretations
retained pursuant to Section 2.1(i)) and (B) any reserve studies and
evaluations, logs, Records or other data and information being transferred as
part of the Assets; provided, however, that, except as required by Law, Seller
shall, and shall cause Seller's Representatives and each of their respective
Affiliates to (i) keep such data and information confidential in accordance
with the terms hereof, (ii) require any Third Party consultant or advisor to
keep such information confidential in accordance with the terms hereof and

ARTICLE X

TITLE MATTERS; CASUALTIES; TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS

Section 10.1. Seller's Title.

(a) General Disclaimer of Title Warranties and Representations. Except for the
special warranty of title set forth in the Assignment and the Deed and without
limiting the express representations and warranties set forth in Article IV
(or the certificate to be delivered at Closing pursuant to Section 8.3(b)(i))
or Buyer's remedies for Title Defects set forth in this Article X, Seller
makes no warranty or representation, express, implied, statutory or otherwise,
with respect to Seller's title to any of the Assets, and Buyer hereby
acknowledges and agrees that Buyer's sole remedy for any defect of title,
including any Title Defect, with respect to any of the Assets (i) before
Closing, shall be as set forth in Section 10.2 and (ii) after the Closing,
shall be pursuant to the special warranty of title set forth in the Assignment
and the Deed.

(b) Special Warranty of Title. If the Closing occurs, then Seller, pursuant to
the Assignment and the Deed, will warrant Defensible Title, without
duplication, to the Properties unto Buyer against every Person whomsoever
lawfully claiming or to claim the same or any part thereof by, through and
under Seller or its Affiliates, subject, however, to the Permitted
Encumbrances. If Buyer provides written notice of a breach of the special
warranty of title in the Assignment or the Deed to Seller, Seller shall have a
reasonable opportunity to cure such breach to the reasonable satisfaction of
Buyer, and in any event, the value of any losses with respect to such breach
shall not exceed the Allocated Value of the affected Properties. Disputes
regarding the existence of a breach of the special warranty of title contained
in the Assignment or the Deed or the cure thereof shall be resolved subject to
and in accordance with Section 10.2(g) of this Agreement.

(c) Beneficial Ownership by Carrizo Eagle Ford. Buyer acknowledges that as of
the Execution Date and the Closing Date, Carrizo holds record title as to
certain of the Properties for the benefit of Carrizo Eagle Ford with Carrizo
Eagle Ford owning all of the beneficial interest in such Properties. At the
Closing, Carrizo Eagle Ford shall cause Carrizo to convey to Buyer record
title to those Properties as to which Carrizo holds record title on behalf of
Seller.

Section 10.2. Notice of Title Defects; Defect Adjustments.

(a) Title Defect Notices. In order to assert a claim under this Section 10.2,
no later than January 18, 2018 (the "Title Claim Date"), Buyer must deliver
claim notices to Seller



meeting the requirements of this Section 10.2(a) (collectively the "Title
Defect Notices" and individually a "Title Defect Notice") setting forth any
matters which, in Buyer's reasonable opinion, constitute Title Defects and
which Buyer intends to assert as a Title Defect pursuant to this Article X.
For all purposes of this Agreement and notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, but subject in all cases to Buyer's rights pursuant to the special
warranty of title in the Assignment and the Deed, Buyer shall be deemed to
have waived, and Seller shall have no liability for, any Title Defect which
Buyer fails to assert as a Title Defect by a Title Defect Notice received by
Seller on or before the Title Claim Date. Each Title Defect Notice shall be in
writing, and shall include (i) a description of the alleged Title Defects,
(ii) the Wells and/or Undeveloped Wells (or portion thereof) affected by the
Title Defect (each a "Title Defect Property"), (iii) the Allocated Value of
each Title Defect Property and (iv) the amount, which estimate is non-binding,
by which Buyer reasonably believes the Allocated Value of each Title Defect
Property is reduced by the alleged Title Defects. To give Seller an
opportunity to commence reviewing and curing Title Defects, Buyer agrees to
use reasonable efforts to give Seller written notice (which shall not
constitute a Title Defect Notice) of all Title Defects discovered by Buyer on
a weekly basis, which notice may be preliminary in nature and supplemented
prior to the Title Claim Date and which notice, or the failure by Buyer to
give such notice, will not prejudice in any way Buyer's ability to assert a
Title Defect, serve to reduce any relevant Title Defect Amount, give rise to,
or serve as the basis of a claim or counter-claim by or on behalf of Seller,
or otherwise be taken into account (or be admissible in any proceeding under
Section 10.2(h)) in determining whether a Title Defect exists or the Title
Defect Amount with respect thereto. Buyer shall have the burden of proof in
proving the existence of each alleged Title Defect and Title Defect Amount
with respect thereto.

(b) Seller's Right to Cure. If Buyer provides written notice of a Title
Defect, Seller shall have the right, but not the obligation, by giving Buyer
written notice thereof on or before the Closing Date, to attempt, at its sole
cost and expense, to cure at any time prior to 110 days after the Closing Date
(the "Cure Period"), to the reasonable satisfaction of Buyer, any Title
Defects of which it has been advised by Buyer.

(c) Remedies for Title Defects. Subject to the rights of the parties pursuant
to Section 13.1, and subject to Seller's right to dispute the existence of a
Title Defect and the Title Defect Amount asserted by Buyer, in the event that
any Title Defect timely asserted by Buyer in accordance with Section 10.2(a)
is not waived in writing by Buyer or cured on or before the last day of the
Cure Period to Buyer's reasonable satisfaction, the parties shall mutually
agree to elect one of the following remedies:

(i) subject to the Individual Title Defect Threshold and the Aggregate
Deductible (except as set forth in Section 10.2(f)), a reduction in the
Purchase Price by the Title Defect Amount;

(ii) indemnification of Buyer by Seller against all Liability resulting from
such Title Defect pursuant to a mutually acceptable indemnity agreement in
which case the Purchase Price shall not be reduced by the Title Defect Amount
or Allocated Value with respect to such Title Defect Property; or



(iii) retention by Seller of the entirety of the Title Defect Property that is
subject to such Title Defect, together with all associated Assets, in which
event the Purchase Price shall be reduced by an amount equal to the Allocated
Value of such Title Defect Property and such associated Assets.

If the parties are unable to agree on whether subsection (i), (ii) or (iii)
above will apply, then the parties shall be deemed to have elected option (i).

(d) Exclusive Remedy. Except for Seller's special warranty of title under the
Assignment and the Deed, and without limiting the express representations and
warranties set forth in Article IV (or the certificate to be delivered at
Closing pursuant to Section 8.3(b)(i)), Section 10.2(c) shall be the exclusive
right and remedy of Buyer with respect to Seller's failure to have Defensible
Title or any other title matter or liens and Encumbrances with respect to any
Property or Properties.

(e) Title Defect Amount. The "Title Defect Amount" resulting from a Title
Defect that is not waived in writing by Buyer shall be the amount by which the
Allocated Value of the affected Title Defect Property is reduced as a result
of the existence of such Title Defect and shall be determined in accordance
with the following methodology, terms and conditions:

(i) if Buyer and Seller agree on the Title Defect Amount, then that amount
shall be the Title Defect Amount;

(ii) if the Title Defect is an Encumbrance (other than a Permitted
Encumbrance) that is undisputed and liquidated in amount, then the Title
Defect Amount shall be the amount necessary to be paid to remove the Title
Defect from all relevant Title Defect Properties;

(iii) if the Title Defect represents a discrepancy between (i) the actual Net
Revenue Interest with respect to the Target Formation for any Title Defect
Property and (ii) the Net Revenue Interest with respect to the Target
Formation as stated on Schedule 3.8, and Seller's Working Interest is
correspondingly and proportionately reduced as a result of such Title Defect
over the entire life of the Title Defect Property, then the Title Defect
Amount shall be the product of the Allocated Value of such Title Defect
Property and a fraction, the numerator of which is the Net Revenue Interest
decrease and the denominator of which is the Net Revenue Interest with respect
to the Target Formation stated in Schedule 3.8;

(iv) if the Title Defect represents an obligation or Encumbrance (other than a
Permitted Encumbrance) upon or other defect in title to the Title Defect
Property of a type not described above, the Title Defect Amount shall be
determined by taking into account the Allocated Value of the Title Defect
Property, the portion of the Title Defect Property affected by the Title
Defect, the legal effect of the Title Defect, the potential economic effect of
the Title Defect over the life of the Title Defect Property, the values placed
upon the Title Defect by Buyer and Seller and such other reasonable factors as
are necessary to make a proper evaluation;



(v) the Title Defect Amount with respect to a Title Defect Property shall be
determined without duplication of any costs or losses included in another
Title Defect Amount hereunder; and

(vi) notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the aggregate
Title Defect Amounts attributable to the effects of all Title Defects upon any
Title Defect Property shall not exceed the Allocated Value of such Title
Defect Property.

(f) Title Deductibles. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, (i) in no
event shall there be any adjustments to the Purchase Price or other remedies
provided by Seller for any individual Title Defect for which the Title Defect
Amount does not exceed $75,000 (the "Individual Title Defect Threshold"); and
(ii) in no event shall there be any adjustments to the Purchase Price or other
remedies provided by Seller for any Title Defect for which the Title Defect
Amount exceeds the Individual Title Defect Threshold unless (A) the amount of
the sum of (x) the Title Defect Amounts of all uncured Title Defects that
exceed the Individual Title Defect Threshold, in the aggregate, excluding any
Title Defect Amounts attributable to Title Defects cured by Seller, and (y)
the Remediation Amounts of all Environmental Conditions, in the aggregate,
excluding (1) any individual Environmental Condition for which the Remediation
Amount does not exceed the Individual Environmental Threshold, (2) any
Environmental Conditions Remediated by Seller and (3) any Remediation Amounts
attributable to an Asset affected by an Environmental Condition retained by
Seller, after offsetting all Title Benefits which individually exceed the
Individual Title Benefit Threshold, exceeds (B) the Aggregate Deductible,
after which point Buyer shall be entitled to adjustments to the Purchase Price
or other remedies only with respect to such Title Defects in excess of such
Aggregate Deductible. If Seller retains any Title Defect Property pursuant to
Section 10.2(c)(iii), the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the Allocated
Value of such Title Defect Property and the Title Defect Amount relating to
such Title Defect Property will not be counted towards the Aggregate
Deductible.

(g) Title Benefits. If in the course of Buyer's due diligence review of the
Wells and/or Undeveloped Wells Buyer discovers a Title Benefit (such Well
and/or Undeveloped Well, a "Title Benefit Property"), Buyer shall promptly
notify Seller in writing of the existence of such Title Benefit and the
associated Title Benefit Amount. Seller may also notify Buyer in writing of
the existence of a Title Benefit and the associated Title Benefit Amount if
Seller discovers a Title Benefit (such notice by Buyer or Seller, a "Title
Benefit Notice"). A Title Benefit Notice must be delivered by the Title Claim
Date and shall be in the form and contain the information required of a Title
Defect Notice, mutatis mutandis. Each Title Benefit Amount in excess of the
Individual Title Benefit Threshold shall be an offset to any Title Defect
Amounts.

(h) Title Dispute Resolution. Seller and Buyer shall attempt to agree on all
Title Defects, Title Benefits, Title Defect Amounts and Title Benefit Amounts
prior to the end of the Cure Period. If Seller and Buyer are unable to agree
by the Closing Date, then (i) Seller's estimate thereof shall control for the
purposes of Closing, (ii) the relevant Title Defect Property shall be assigned
to Buyer at Closing, (iii) the Purchase Price shall not be adjusted at Closing
with respect to the relevant Title Defect or Title Defect Amount, and (iv) the
existence of the Title Defect, Title Defect Amount,



Title Benefit, or Title Benefit Amount, as applicable, shall be exclusively
and finally resolved pursuant to this Section 10.2(h). There shall be a single
arbitrator, who shall be a title attorney with at least ten years of
experience in oil and gas titles involving properties in Texas, as selected by
mutual agreement of Buyer and Seller within 15 days after the end of the Cure
Period, and absent such agreement, by the Houston, Texas office of the
American Arbitration Association (the "Title Arbitrator"). The arbitration
proceeding shall be held in Houston, Texas and shall be conducted in
accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration
Association, to the extent such rules do not conflict with the terms of this
Section 10.2. The Title Arbitrator's determination shall be made within 20
days after submission of the matters in dispute and shall be final and binding
upon both parties without right of appeal. In making his determination, the
Title Arbitrator shall be bound by the rules set forth in this Article X and,
subject to the foregoing, may consider such other matters as in the opinion of
the Title Arbitrator are necessary to make a proper determination. The Title
Arbitrator, however, may not award Buyer or Seller a greater Title Defect
Amount or Title Benefit Amount, as applicable, than the Title Defect Amount or
Title Benefit Amount claimed by Buyer or Seller in its applicable Title Defect
Notice or Title Benefit Notice, and notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, the Title Arbitrator's awards are subject to the limitation on
liabilities provisions set forth in Section 10.2(f). The Title Arbitrator
shall act as an expert for the limited purpose of determining the specific
disputed Title Defects, Title Benefits, Title Defect Amounts and Title Benefit
Amounts submitted by either party and may not award damages, interest or
penalties to either party with respect to any matter. Seller and Buyer shall
each bear its own legal fees and other costs of presenting its case. Each of
Seller and Buyer shall bear one-half of the costs and expenses of the Title
Arbitrator. Following the determination of the Title Arbitrator, the parties
shall make an election pursuant to Section 10.2(c) with respect to the Title
Defect Property, to the extent determined to be subject to a Title Defect. To
the extent that the award of the Title Arbitrator with respect to any Title
Defect Amount or Title Benefit Amount is not taken into account as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant to Section 3.4 or Section 3.5, then
within ten days after the Title Arbitrator delivers written notice to Buyer
and Seller of his award with respect to a Title Defect Amount or Title Benefit
Amount, Seller shall pay to Buyer, the amount, if any, so awarded by the Title
Arbitrator to Buyer. Subject to the parties' rights pursuant to Section 13.1,
the Closing shall not be delayed on account of any arbitration hereunder.

Section 10.3. Casualty or Condemnation Loss.

(a) Seller shall promptly notify Buyer of any material casualty to the Assets
(other than the Buyer Operated Properties) or any portion thereof that occurs,
or any condemnation proceeding commenced, after the Execution Date and prior
to the Closing Date. If prior to the Closing Date any portion of the Assets is
destroyed by Casualty Loss, then, if the Closing occurs, Seller, at Seller's
sole discretion, shall select one of the following options which shall apply
to the Casualty Losses:

(i) Seller shall cause the Assets affected by such Casualty Losses to be
repaired or restored to at least their condition prior to such Casualty
Losses, at Seller's sole cost, risk and expense, as promptly as reasonably
practicable (which work may extend after the Closing Date); provided, however,
that, in such circumstance, Seller shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless
Buyer Indemnified Parties from and



against any Liability arising out of, or relating to, such attempt on the
terms set forth in Section 12.5; or

(ii) Seller shall, at Closing, pay to Buyer all sums paid to Seller or its
Affiliates by Third Parties by reason of such Casualty Losses and shall assign
to Buyer all of Seller's or its Affiliates' right, title and interest (if any)
in insurance claims, unpaid awards and other rights against Third Parties
arising out of the casualty.

(b) If after the date of this Agreement but prior to the Closing Date, any
portion of the Assets is taken in condemnation or under right of eminent
domain by any Governmental Authority, the Assets or portion thereof shall be
excluded from the Assets to be conveyed to Buyer at Closing to the extent of
the interest affected by the condemnation or right of eminent domain and the
Purchase Price will be reduced by the Allocated Value of such interest.

(c) If any action for condemnation or taking under right of eminent domain is
pending or threatened with respect to any Asset or portion thereof after the
Execution Date, but no taking of such Asset or portion thereof occurs prior to
the Closing Date, the transaction contemplated by this Agreement shall
nevertheless close and Seller, at Closing, shall assign, transfer and set over
to Buyer or subrogate Buyer to all of Seller's or its Affiliates' right, title
and interest (if any) in such taking, including any insurance claims, unpaid
awards and other rights against Third Parties arising out of the taking,
insofar as they are attributable to the Assets threatened to be taken.

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, from and after the
Effective Time, if Closing occurs, Buyer shall assume all risk of loss with
respect to production of Hydrocarbons through normal depletion or otherwise
(including watering out of any Well, collapsed casing or sand infiltration of
any Well) and the depreciation of Personal Property due to ordinary wear and
tear, in each case, with respect to the Assets.

Section 10.4. Preferential Rights to Purchase and Consents to Assign.

(a) With respect to each Preferential Right to Purchase pertaining to an Asset
and the transactions contemplated hereby, promptly (but in any event within 5
days) following the date hereof shall send to the holder of each such right a
notice, in compliance with the contractual provisions applicable to such right
and otherwise in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Buyer. In
addition, promptly (but in any event within 5 days) following the date hereof,
Seller shall send to each holder of a right to consent applicable to the
transactions contemplated hereby or otherwise as set forth on Schedule 4.4(a)
(excepting the holder of a right to a Customary Post-Closing Consent) a notice
seeking such party's consent to the transactions contemplated hereby, which
notice shall be in compliance with the contractual provisions applicable to
such right and otherwise in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
Buyer.

(b) If, prior to the Closing, any holder of a Preferential Right to Purchase
notifies Seller or an Affiliate of Seller that it elects to purchase of the
Asset to which its Preferential Right to Purchase applies, that Asset shall be
excluded from the Assets to be conveyed to Buyer to the extent of the interest
affected by the Preferential Right to Purchase, and the Purchase Price shall
be



reduced by the Allocated Value of the relevant Asset (or portion thereof)
allocable to such interest. Seller shall be entitled to all proceeds paid by a
party exercising a Preferential Right to Purchase prior to the Closing. If
such holder of such Preferential Right to Purchase thereafter fails to
consummate the purchase of the Asset covered by such right on or before 60
days following the later of the Closing Date or the expiration of the time for
exercising such Preferential Right to Purchase, no suit or other proceeding by
such Person with respect to the Preferential Right to Purchase is pending or
threatened, such Person has not disputed the Preferential Right to Purchase in
any respect (including the Allocated Value of the Asset subject thereto), and
the conditions set forth in Section 7.1 are otherwise satisfied with respect
to such Asset, then Seller shall so notify Buyer, and Buyer shall purchase, on
or before ten days following receipt of such notice, such Asset from Seller,
under the terms of this Agreement for a price equal to the Allocated Value (or
portion thereof) previously allocated to it (adjusted as set forth in this
Agreement) and Seller shall assign to Buyer the Asset (or portion thereof) so
excluded at Closing pursuant to an instrument in substantially the same form
as the Assignment.

(c) If a Preferential Right to Purchase burdening any Asset is not exercised
and the time for exercising such Preferential Right to Purchase has not
expired prior to the Closing Date, then such Asset shall be excluded from the
Assets to be conveyed at Closing and the Purchase Price shall be reduced by
the Allocated Value of the relevant Asset. If the holder of such Preferential
Right to Purchase thereafter fails to exercise or consummate the purchase of
the Asset covered by such right on or before 60 days following the later of
the Closing Date or the date that such Preferential Right to Purchase expires
without being exercised, no suit or other proceeding by such Person with
respect to the Preferential Right to Purchase is pending or threatened, such
Person has not disputed the Preferential Right to Purchase in any respect
(including the Allocated Value of the Asset subject thereto), and the
conditions set forth in Section 7.1 are otherwise satisfied with respect to
such Asset, then Seller shall so notify Buyer, and Buyer shall purchase, on or
before ten days following receipt of such notice, such Asset from Seller,
under the terms of this Agreement for a price equal to the Allocated Value (or
portion thereof) previously allocated to it (adjusted as set forth in this
Agreement) and Seller shall assign to Buyer the Asset (or portion thereof) so
excluded at Closing pursuant to an instrument in substantially the same form
as the Assignment.

(d) All Assets for which Preferential Rights to Purchase have been waived, or
as to which the period to exercise such right has expired prior to the
Closing, shall, if no dispute, suit or other proceeding with respect to such
Preferential Right to Purchase is pending or threatened, be sold to Buyer at
the Closing pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement.

(e) Promptly following the date hereof, and, in any event, prior to the
Closing, Seller shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all
consents with respect to the Assets, including those listed on Schedule
4.4(a), Schedule 4.4(b), Required Consents and Soft Consents (other than
Customary Post-Closing Consents that cannot be acquired until after Closing),
that are required to permit the assignment of the Assets by Seller to Buyer
and the consummation by Seller of the transactions contemplated hereby;
provided, however, neither party shall be required to incur any Liability or
pay any money in order to be in compliance with the foregoing covenant.



(f) If Seller fails to obtain a Required Consent affecting a Property (or
portion thereof) that has an Allocated Value prior to the Closing, then the
Property (or portion thereof) subject to such failed consent shall be excluded
from the Assets to be conveyed to Buyer, and the Purchase Price shall be
reduced by an amount equal to what the reduction to the Purchase Price would
have been under Section 10.2(c)(i) had the relevant Property (or portion
thereof) been subject to a Title Defect, except that Section 10.2(f) shall not
apply and, notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in the event that
the parties cannot agree on the amount of such adjustment, Buyer's reasonable
and good faith estimate thereof (to the extent that the relevant Property is
included in a unit, not to exceed a number (calculated on a unit-by-unit
basis) equal to the total number of net mineral acres contributed to the
applicable unit by the relevant Property divided by the total number of net
mineral acres included in the applicable unit multiplied by the aggregate
Allocated Value for the entirety of such unit) shall control for purposes of
closing and resolution of such dispute shall be resolved pursuant to Section
10.2(h), mutatis mutandis. If Seller fails to obtain a Required Consent
affecting an Asset other than a Property with an Allocated Value and Buyer is
assigned the Property or Properties to which such Asset relates, such Asset
shall be excluded from the Assets conveyed to Buyer at Closing, and, at
Buyer's election, and if permitted by applicable Law and contract, such Asset
shall be held by Seller for the benefit of Buyer and Buyer shall be
responsible for the performance of any obligations under or with respect to
such Asset to the extent Buyer has been transferred the other Assets that are
necessary for such performance. Buyer shall indemnify, defend, hold harmless
and release the Seller Indemnified Parties against any Claims arising from or
related to Seller's holding such Asset for the benefit of Buyer, except for
any Claims actually resulting from the gross negligence or willful misconduct
of Seller and except to the extent any such Claim would otherwise be the
responsibility of Seller hereunder (including under Article XII, Section 2.3,
or Section 14.1). For a period of 110 days following Closing, Seller and Buyer
shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to attempt to obtain any
Required Consent which was not obtained prior to Closing. If any such Required
Consent is obtained within such period, or if Buyer otherwise so elects (in
which case Buyer shall indemnify, defend, hold harmless and release the Seller
Indemnified Parties against any Claims arising from or related to such
conveyance of the applicable Asset without having obtained the Required
Consent), then Seller shall convey to Buyer the Asset (or portion thereof)
which was excluded from the Assets, and Buyer shall pay to Seller the amount
by which the Purchase Price was reduced at Closing pursuant to this Section
10.4(f) (with appropriate adjustments pursuant to Section 3.2. If any such
Required Consent is not obtained at the end of such 110 day period and Buyer
does not elect to receive an assignment thereof, the relevant Asset shall
constitute an Excluded Asset and shall no longer be subject to this Section
10.4(f), and, if the Asset is a Lease that is not already governed by an
operating agreement to which Buyer and Seller are both parties, Buyer and
Seller shall enter into an operating agreement substantially in the form of
the Maltsberger B Unit operating agreement, naming Buyer as operator of such
Asset. For the avoidance of doubt, although Seller will use its commercially
reasonable best efforts to obtain any Soft Consent, Seller shall have no
liability to Buyer if it fails to obtain such Soft Consent, and Buyer shall
take assignment of such Lease without any adjustment to the Purchase Price
under this Section 10.4(f) or any other provision of this Agreement.



ARTICLE XI

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

Section 11.1. Environmental Conditions.

(a) Assertions of Environmental Conditions. In order to assert a claim under
this Section 11.1, Buyer must deliver claim notices to Seller meeting the
requirements of this Section 11.1(a) (collectively the "Environmental
Condition Notices" and individually an "Environmental Condition Notice") no
later than the Environmental Claim Date, setting forth any matters which, in
Buyer's reasonable opinion, constitute Environmental Conditions and which
Buyer intends to assert as Environmental Conditions pursuant to this Section
11.1. For the avoidance of doubt, Buyer may only assert an Environmental
Condition Notice, and claim an Environmental Condition with respect to Assets
other than Buyer Operated Properties and Assets located thereon, and Buyer
shall not be entitled to assert an Environmental Condition with respect to any
Property or Asset that is operated by Buyer or any of its Affiliates. For all
purposes of this Agreement but subject to Buyer's remedy for a breach of
Seller's representation contained in Article IV (or the certificate to be
delivered at Closing pursuant to Section 8.3(b)(i)), Seller's indemnity
obligation in Section 12.2(c)(ii) and (c)(v), Buyer shall be deemed to have
waived any Environmental Condition which Buyer fails to assert as an
Environmental Condition by an Environmental Condition Notice received by
Seller on or before the Environmental Claim Date, as well as any Environmental
Condition located on a Property that is a Buyer Operated Property, regardless
of when such Environmental Condition arose, whether before or after the
Effective Time. Each Environmental Condition Notice shall be in writing and
shall include (i) a reasonably detailed description, including, where
available, supporting documentation in Buyer's possession or control, of the
matter constituting the alleged Environmental Condition, (ii) a description of
each Asset (or portion thereof) that is affected by the alleged Environmental
Condition, (iii) Buyer's assertion of the Allocated Value of the portion of
the Assets affected by the alleged Environmental Condition, and (iv) an
estimate, which is non-binding, of the Remediation Amount that Buyer asserts
is attributable to such alleged Environmental Condition. Buyer's calculation
of the Remediation Amount included in the Environmental Condition Notice
should describe in reasonable detail the Remediation proposed for the
Environmental Condition that gives rise to the asserted Environmental
Condition and the primary assumptions used in calculating the Remediation
Amount, including, any standards that Buyer asserts must be met to comply with
Environmental Laws. Seller shall have the right, but not the obligation, to
Remediate any claimed Environmental Condition on or before the Closing Date
(the "Environmental Condition Cure Period"). Seller may select and employ at
its sole discretion any generally accepted remedial technology or approach to
Remediate an identified Environmental Condition. Any Remediation attempt shall
be at Seller's sole cost, risk and expense, and Seller shall indemnify,
defend, and hold harmless Buyer Indemnified Parties from and against any
Liabilities arising out of, or relating to, such attempt on the terms set
forth in Section 12.5.

(b) Remedies for Environmental Conditions. Subject to the parties' rights
pursuant to Section 13.1, in the event that any Environmental Condition timely
asserted by Buyer in accordance with Section 11.1(a) is not waived in writing
by Buyer or Remediated on or before Closing, then the parties shall mutually
agree to elect one of the following remedies:



(i) subject to the Individual Environmental Threshold and the Aggregate
Deductible, a reduction of the Purchase Price by the Remediation Amount agreed
upon by Seller and Buyer or determined in accordance with Section 11.1(g) and
assumption by Buyer of responsibility for Remediation of the Environmental
Condition;

(ii) assumption of responsibility by Seller for the Remediation of such
Environmental Condition and mutually agreeable indemnification of Buyer
Indemnified Parties by Seller therefor under a mutually acceptable access
agreement; or

(iii) retention by Seller of the entirety of the Asset that is subject to such
Environmental Condition, together with all associated Assets, in which event
the Purchase Price shall be reduced by an amount equal to the Allocated Value
of such Asset and such associated Assets.

In the event the parties cannot agree to either Section 11.1(b)(i), (ii) or
(iii), then Section 11.1(b)(i) shall be the remedy for an Environmental
Condition unless the Allocated Value of such Asset is equal to or less than
the Remediation Amount asserted by Buyer, in which event, at the election of
either party, Section 11.1(b)(iii) shall be the remedy for an Environmental
Condition.

(c) If clause (i) of Section 11.1(b) above is applicable or the default
remedy, Buyer shall be deemed to have assumed responsibility for Remediation
of such Environmental Condition and such Environmental Condition and all
Liabilities with respect thereto shall be deemed to constitute Assumed
Obligations. If clause (ii) of Section 11.1(b) above is applicable, then (A)
Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to implement such Remediation
in a manner which is consistent with the requirements of Environmental Laws,
taking into consideration Buyer's use and operation of the Assets, in a timely
fashion for the type of Remediation Seller elects to undertake and, upon
reasonable advance written notice, Buyer hereby grants Seller access to the
affected Assets after the Closing Date to implement and complete such
Remediation in accordance with an access agreement proposed by Buyer and
reasonably acceptable to Seller, and (B) there shall be no reduction to the
Purchase Price due to the relevant Environmental Condition pending
implementation of such Remediation. Any Remediation shall be subject to the
consent of Buyer, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. To the
extent such Remediation is not completed to Buyer's reasonable satisfaction
within 110 days after the Closing Date, and neither party has elected to
exclude the relevant Asset pursuant to Section 11.1(b)(iii), within five
business days of the end of such period (or such longer period as is required
by Section 11.1(g)), Seller shall pay to Buyer the amounts still required to
Remediate such Environmental Condition (not to exceed the Allocated Value of
the relevant Asset), and thereafter Buyer shall assume and discharge all
responsibility for Remediation of the relevant Environmental Condition and all
Liabilities with respect thereto shall be deemed to constitute Assumed
Obligations. Any dispute regarding the Remediation Amount or whether, or to
what extent, and Environmental Condition has been remediated shall be resolved
pursuant to Section 11.1(g). Except as provided above in this Section 11.1(c),
upon completion of Remediation under clause (ii) of Section 11.1(b) above,
Seller shall at its sole cost and expense and without any cost or expense to
Buyer or its Affiliates, (1) close all



bore holes from its Remediation in accordance with recognized industry
standards, (2) repair all damage done to the Assets in connection with the
Remediation, and (3) remove all equipment, tools or other property brought
onto the Assets in connection with the Remediation. The party performing
Remediation shall keep the other party reasonably informed regarding any
Remediation. In completing the Remediation, the party performing the
Remediation shall provide the other party with draft copies of all documents
to be submitted to any Governmental Authorities regarding the Remediation and
shall reasonably cooperate with the other party to incorporate comments
provided by it to the party performing the Remediation regarding such
documents. In addition, the party performing the Remediation shall promptly
provide the other party with copies of any correspondence with any
Governmental Authority regarding the Remediation and shall provide the other
party with the opportunity to participate in any meetings with any
Governmental Authority regarding the Remediation. The party performing the
Remediation shall be solely responsible for obtaining any permits or other
authorizations from any Governmental Authority associated with the
Remediation. The party performing the Remediation shall promptly remove any
waste material generated during the Remediation from the Assets. The party
performing the Remediation shall require any contractors or subcontractors
entering the Assets in connection with the Remediation to provide the other
party with certificates of insurance demonstrating coverage under Commercial
General Liability, Contractors Pollution Liability, and Errors and Omissions
Liability insurance policies in a form reasonably acceptable to the other
party and naming the other party as an additional insured.

(d) With respect to any provision of this Article XI that refers to any
Remediation completed by Seller, whether before or after the Closing, Seller
will be deemed to have adequately completed the Remediation (A) upon receipt
of a certificate of approval or completion or its equivalent from the
applicable Governmental Authority that the Remediation has been implemented to
the extent necessary to comply with existing Laws or (B) if no certificate or
approval is available under Environmental Law or upon express written consent
of Buyer, upon mutual agreement of the parties, upon receipt of a certificate
from an independent, licensed professional engineer that the Remediation has
been implemented to the extent necessary to comply with Environmental Laws;
provided, if the parties cannot agree, the issue of whether the Remediation is
completed may be resolved by the dispute resolution procedures set forth in
Section 11.1(g).

(e) Exclusive Remedy. Without limiting the express representations and
warranties set forth in Article IV (or the certificate to be delivered at
Closing pursuant to Section 8.3(b)(i)), and except for Buyer's remedy for a
breach of Seller's representation contained in Section 4.16, Seller's
indemnification obligation in Section 12.2(c)(ii) and Section 12.2(c)(v), and
Buyer's rights to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 13.1, the
provisions set forth in Section 11.1(b) shall be the exclusive right and
remedy of Buyer with respect to any Environmental Condition or other
environmental matter with respect to any Asset. The parties acknowledge and
agree that Environmental Conditions for which Buyer submits or, with Knowledge
of the same, elects not to submit an Environmental Condition Notice pursuant
to Section 11.1(a) shall not form the basis for a claim for a breach of
representation or warranty pursuant to Section 4.16.

(f) Environmental Deductibles. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, (i)
in no event shall there be any adjustments to the Purchase Price or other
remedies provided by Seller



for any individual Environmental Condition under this Article XI for which the
Remediation Amount does not exceed $75,000 ("Individual Environmental
Threshold"); and (ii) in no event shall there be any adjustments to the
Purchase Price or other remedies provided by Seller for any Environmental
Condition for which the Remediation Amount exceeds the Individual
Environmental Threshold unless (A) the sum of (1) the Remediation Amounts of
all such Environmental Conditions that exceed the Individual Environmental
Threshold, in the aggregate, excluding (x) any Environmental Conditions
Remediated by Seller and (y) the Remediation Amounts attributable to an Asset
retained by Seller under Section 11.1(b)(iii), and (2) the Title Defect
Amounts of all Title Defects, in the aggregate, excluding (x) any individual
Title Defect for which the Title Defect Amount does not exceed the Individual
Title Defect Threshold, (y) any Title Defects cured by Seller, and (z) any
Title Defect Properties retained by Seller hereunder, (B) exceeds the
Aggregate Deductible, after which point Buyer shall be entitled to adjustments
to the Purchase Price or other remedies only with respect to the portion of
the Remediation Amounts in excess of such Aggregate Deductible.

(g) Environmental Dispute Resolution. Seller and Buyer shall attempt to agree
on all Environmental Conditions and Remediation Amounts prior to the Closing
Date. If Seller and Buyer are unable to agree on the existence of an
Environmental Condition or a Remediation Amount by the Closing Date, the
entirety of the Asset that is subject to such Environmental Condition,
together with all associated Assets, shall not be assigned by Seller at
Closing, (ii) the Purchase Price shall be reduced by an amount equal to the
Allocated Value of such Asset and such associated Assets and (iii) the
existence of the Environmental Condition or the Remediation Amount, as
applicable, shall be exclusively and finally resolved by arbitration pursuant
to this Section 11.1(g). There shall be a single arbitrator, who shall be an
environmental attorney or environmental expert with at least ten years'
experience in environmental matters involving oil and gas producing properties
in Texas, as selected by mutual agreement of Buyer and Seller within 15 days
after the Closing Date, and absent such agreement within such time period,
then each party will nominate a candidate to select the Environmental
Arbitrator, and such candidates so nominated by Buyer and Seller shall
together determine the Environmental Arbitrator within 15 days after the last
candidate is nominated and absent such determination within such time period,
the Environmental Arbitrator shall be selected by the Houston, Texas office of
the American Arbitration Association (the "Environmental Arbitrator"). The
arbitration proceeding shall be held in Houston, Texas and shall be conducted
in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American
Arbitration Association, to the extent such rules do not conflict with the
terms of this Article. The Environmental Arbitrator's determination shall be
made within 20 days after submission of the matters in dispute and shall be
final and binding upon both parties, without right of appeal. In making his
determination, the Environmental Arbitrator shall be bound by the rules set
forth in this Section 11.1 and, subject to the foregoing, may consider such
other matters as in the opinion of the Environmental Arbitrator are necessary
or helpful to make a proper determination. The Environmental Arbitrator,
however, may not award Buyer a greater Remediation Amount than the Remediation
Amount claimed by Buyer in its applicable Environmental Condition Notice and
notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Environmental
Arbitrator's awards are subject to the limitations on liability set forth in
Section 11.1(f). The Environmental Arbitrator shall act as an expert for the
limited purpose of determining the specific disputed Environmental Conditions
or Remediation Amounts submitted by either party and may not award damages,
interest or penalties to either party with respect to any



matter. Seller and Buyer shall each bear its own legal fees and other costs of
presenting its case. Each of Seller and Buyer shall bear one-half of the costs
and expenses of the Environmental Arbitrator. Following the determination of
the Environmental Arbitrator, the parties shall make an election pursuant to
Section 11.1(b) with respect to the affected Asset, to the extent determined
to be subject to an Environmental Condition. To the extent that the award of
the Environmental Arbitrator with respect to any Remediation Amount is not
taken into account as an adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant to Section
3.4 or Section 3.5, then within ten days after the Environmental Arbitrator
delivers written notice to Buyer and Seller of his award with respect to a
Remediation Amount if the relevant Asset and its associated Assets are to be
conveyed to Buyer pursuant to Section 11.1(b), Buyer shall pay to Seller the
Allocated Value of such Asset and its associated Assets (less any relevant
Remediation Amount as determined pursuant to Section 11.1(b)(i) or 11.1(c), as
applicable), and Seller shall convey such Asset and its associated Assets on a
form of assignment substantially in the form attached to this Agreement as
Exhibit C. Subject to the parties' rights pursuant to Section 13.1, nothing
herein shall operate to cause the Closing to be delayed on account of any
arbitration hereunder.

Section 11.2. NORM, Wastes and Other Substances. Buyer acknowledges that the
Assets have been used for exploration, development and production of oil and
gas and that there may be Hydrocarbons, produced water, wastes, Hazardous
Substances or other substances or materials located in, on or under the Assets
or associated with the Assets. Equipment and sites included in the Assets may
contain asbestos, NORM or other Hazardous Substances. NORM may affix or attach
itself to the inside of wells, materials and equipment as scale, or in other
forms. The wells, materials and equipment located on the Assets or included in
the Assets may contain NORM and other wastes or Hazardous Substances. NORM
containing material and other wastes or Hazardous Substances may have come in
contact with various environmental media, including water, soils or sediment.
Special procedures may be required for the assessment, remediation, removal,
transportation or disposal of environmental media, wastes, asbestos, NORM and
other Hazardous Substances from the Assets.

ARTICLE XII

ASSUMPTION; SURVIVAL; INDEMNIFICATION

Section 12.1. Assumption by Buyer. Except as otherwise provided herein
(including in Section 14.1(b)) and subject to Buyer's rights to indemnity
under Section 12.2, from and after the Closing, Buyer assumes and hereby
agrees to fulfill, perform, pay and discharge (or cause to be fulfilled,
performed, paid or discharged) all obligations and Liabilities, known or
unknown, with respect to the Assets, regardless of whether such obligations or
Liabilities arose prior to, on or after the Effective Time, including
obligations and Liabilities relating in any manner to the ownership, operation
or use of the Assets, including obligations (a) to furnish makeup gas or
settle Imbalances according to the terms of applicable gas sales, processing,
gathering or transportation Contracts, (b) to pay working interests, Royalties
and owners' revenues or proceeds attributable to the sale of Hydrocarbons
produced from or attributable to the Assets after the Effective Time
(including any such payments held in suspense that are transferred to Buyer
pursuant to Section 2.1(m)), (c) to properly plug, re-plug and abandon any and
all wells, wellbores, or previously plugged Wells on the Properties to the
extent required or necessary, (d) to dismantle or decommission



and remove any Personal Property and other property of whatever kind related

Assets, (e) to clean up, restore or remediate the premises covered by or
related to the Assets in accordance with applicable agreements and
Governmental Requirements, including Environmental Laws, (f) to perform all
obligations applicable to or imposed on the lessee, owner or operator from and
after the Effective Time under the Leases and the Applicable Contracts or as
required by agreements and Governmental Requirements, (g) to pay any claims
regarding the general method, manner or practice of calculating or making
Royalty payments (or payments of overriding Royalties or similar burdens on
production) with respect to the Properties, and (h) to dispose of or transport
of any Hazardous Substances (all of said obligations and Liabilities herein
being referred to as the "Assumed Obligations"). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Buyer does not assume, and shall not be responsible for, the
Retained Obligations until such time as Seller's indemnity obligations with
respect thereto expire (if ever).

Section 12.2. Retained Obligations; Indemnities of Seller. If Closing occurs,
subject to the limitations set forth in Section 12.4 and otherwise in this
Article XII, Seller shall be responsible for, shall pay on a current basis,
and hereby defends, indemnifies, holds harmless and forever releases Buyer and
its Affiliates, and all of their respective stockholders, partners, members,
directors, officers, managers, employees, agents and representatives
(collectively, "Buyer Indemnified Parties") from and against any and all
Liabilities arising from, based upon, related to or associated with:

(a) any breach by Seller of its representations or warranties contained in
Article IV (or the certificate to be delivered by Seller at Closing pursuant
to Section 8.3(b)(i)), as of the Execution Date and as of the Closing, as
though made at and as of the Closing;

(b) any breach by Seller of its covenants and agreements under this Agreement;
and

(c) any obligations or liabilities of Seller or any of its Affiliates to the
extent involving or relating to (i) the ownership, use or operation of the
Excluded Assets, (ii) the transport or disposal prior to the Closing Date of
any Hazardous Substances from the Assets (other than the Buyer Operated
Properties) to any location not on the Assets prior to the Closing Date; (iii)
any Seller Taxes; (iv) any Liability or obligation for compensation or
reimbursement to any of Seller's current or former employees for work
performed, including any Liabilities or obligations to the extent related to
or arising under any employee benefit plan, express or implied contract,
wages, bonuses, commissions or severance benefits; (v) any fines, penalties
and sanctions asserted, imposed or levied by any Governmental Authority
resulting from any criminal investigation or proceedings to the extent arising
out of or related to Seller's ownership, use, maintenance or operation of the
Seller Operated Properties; (vi) any death, physical injury, illness, or
property damage (other than property damage constituting an Environmental
Condition and/or property damage suffered by Third Parties that are not
contractors or subcontractors of any tier of Seller or its Affiliates) related
to or arising out of the Assets (other than the Buyer Operated Properties) and
occurring prior to the Closing Date; (vii) the SOP Retained Operating
Expenses; or (viii) litigation disclosed on Schedule 4.6 (collectively, the
"Retained Obligations").



Section 12.3. Indemnities of Buyer. Effective as of the Closing, Buyer shall
be responsible for, shall pay on a current basis, and hereby defends,
indemnifies, holds harmless and forever releases Seller and its Affiliates,
and all of their respective owners, stockholders, partners, members,
directors, officers, managers, employees, agents and representatives
(collectively, "Seller Indemnified Parties") from and against any and all
Liabilities arising from, based upon, related to or associated with any breach
by Buyer of its representations or warranties contained in Article V (or the
certificate to be delivered by Seller at Closing pursuant to Section
8.3(b)(i)), as of the Execution Date and as of the Closing, as though made at
and as of the Closing;

(a) any breach by Buyer of its covenants and agreements under this Agreement;
and

(b) the Assumed Obligations,

excluding, in each case above, matters against which Seller would be required
to indemnify, defend, or hold harmless Buyer Indemnified Parties at the time
that a Claim Notice or other notice of the matter indemnified against is
presented to Buyer or a Buyer Indemnified Party.

Section 12.4. Limitation on Liability.

(a) Seller shall not have any liability for any indemnification under Section
12.2 for any individual Liability unless the indemnification amount owed by
Seller to the Buyer Indemnified Parties with respect to such Liability exceeds
the Post-Closing Threshold. Additionally, Seller shall not have any liability
for any indemnification under Section 12.2 unless and until the amount of all
Liabilities for which Claim Notices with respect thereto are delivered by
Buyer exceeding the Post-Closing Threshold exceeds, in the aggregate, the
Post-Closing Deductible, and then only to the extent such damages exceed the
Post-Closing Deductible. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 12.4(a) to
the contrary, the limitations on Seller's Liability in this Section 12.4(a)
shall not apply to (i) Seller's Liability for breaches of its Fundamental
Representations or the representations and warranties in Section 4.11, Section
4.17, or Section 4.18, (ii) Seller's Liability for breaches of any covenant
hereunder or (iii) Seller's Liability under Section 12.2(c) (such Seller
Liabilities in the immediately preceding clauses (i), (ii) and (iii), the
"Specified Seller Indemnity Obligations").

(b) Except with respect to the Specified Seller Indemnity Obligations,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Seller shall not
have any liability for any indemnification under Section 12.2, in the
aggregate, in excess of 20% of the Final Price.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Seller's
aggregate Liabilities under and in connection with this Agreement shall not
exceed 100% of the Final Price.

(d) Seller recognizes that the express terms of the Transaction Documents,
including its representations and warranties in Article IV and its obligations
under Section 12.2 are material inducements to Buyer's decision to pursue the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and without such provisions,
Buyer would not have entered into this Agreement. It is



the intent of the parties that such terms shall be enforceable as expressly
set forth herein and regardless of the knowledge of any Buyer Indemnified
Party, including of any matters that would constitute a breach of
representation, warranty, covenant, or agreement or give rise to an obligation
of indemnification under Section 12.2. For purposes of this Article XII
(including for the purpose of determining whether or not a representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement has been breached and except with respect to
Section 4.16(a)), any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
qualified by Material Adverse Effect shall be deemed not to be so qualified.

Section 12.5. Express Negligence. THE DEFENSE, INDEMNIFICATION, HOLD HARMLESS,
RELEASE, ASSUMED OBLIGATIONS AND RETAINED OBLIGATIONS PROVISIONS PROVIDED FOR
IN THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE APPLICABLE WHETHER OR NOT THE LIABILITIES, LOSSES,
COSTS, EXPENSES AND DAMAGES IN QUESTION AROSE OR RESULTED SOLELY OR IN PART
FROM THE GROSS, SOLE, ACTIVE, PASSIVE, CONCURRENT OR COMPARATIVE NEGLIGENCE,
STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER FAULT OR VIOLATION OF LAW OF OR BY ANY INDEMNIFIED
PARTY, BUT EXCLUDING THE WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OF ANY INDEMNIFIED PARTY. BUYER
AND SELLER ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS STATEMENT COMPLIES WITH THE EXPRESS
NEGLIGENCE RULE AND IS CONSPICUOUS.

Section 12.6. Exclusive Remedy. FROM AND AFTER THE CLOSING, EXCEPT WITH
RESPECT TO SECTION 2.3, SECTION 3.5, SECTION 3.6, SECTION 3.7, SECTION 6.3,
SECTION 6.5, SECTION 6.7, SECTION 6.9, SECTION 8.4, SECTION 9.1(d), SECTION
9.1(e), SECTION 9.2, SECTIONS 10.2(c) and (h), SECTION 10.3, SECTION 10.4,
SECTIONS 11.1(b), (c), and (g), SECTION 14.1, SECTION 14.3, SECTION 14.5,
SECTION 14.6, SECTION 14.7 AND SECTION 14.12 (FOR WHICH THE PARTIES SHALL BE
ADDITIONALLY ENTITLED TO THE REMEDY OF SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE), THE SOLE AND
EXCLUSIVE REMEDY OF ANY PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ITS AFFILIATES AND ANY
INDEMNIFIED PARTY WITH RESPECT TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE ASSETS, THE EVENTS
GIVING RISE TO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS
AGREEMENT AND THE TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE
INDEMNIFICATION PROVISIONS AND REMEDIES SET FORTH IN SECTION 6.7 AND SECTION
10.4(F) AND ARTICLE IX, ARTICLE X, ARTICLE XI AND ARTICLE XII (WITH RESPECT TO
THE MATTERS ADDRESSED THEREIN) AND SUCH PARTY'S RIGHTS UNDER ARTICLE XIII,
AND, IN FURTHERANCE OF THE FOREGOING, EACH OF THE PARTIES, ON BEHALF OF ITSELF
AND OF ITS AFFILIATES, HEREBY WAIVES, RELEASES AND DISCHARGES, TO THE FULLEST
EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE OTHER PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT AND
THEIR RESPECTIVE AFFILIATES FROM ANY AND ALL LIABILITIES OF ANY KIND (WHETHER
AT LAW OR IN EQUITY OR OTHERWISE, FORESEEN OR UNFORESEEN, MATURED OR
UNMATURED, KNOWN OR UNKNOWN, ACCRUED OR NOT ACCRUED OR BASED ON ANY LAW OR
RIGHT OF ACTION OR OTHERWISE) EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN THIS AGREEMENT
NOTWITHSTANDING THE STRICT LIABILITY OR NEGLIGENCE OF A RELEASED PARTY
(WHETHER SOLE, JOINT OR CONCURRENT OR ACTIVE OR PASSIVE).



Section 12.7. Indemnification Procedures. All claims for indemnification under
Section 9.1(c), Section 12.2 and Section 12.3 shall be asserted and resolved
as follows:

(a) For purposes of this Article XII, the term "Indemnifying Party", when used
in connection with particular Liabilities, shall mean the party or parties
having an obligation to indemnify another party or parties with respect to
such Liabilities pursuant to this Article XII, and the term "Indemnified
Party", when used in connection with particular Liabilities, shall mean the
party or parties having the right to be indemnified with respect to such
Liabilities by another party or parties pursuant to this Article XII.

(b) To make a claim for indemnification under Section 9.1(c), Section 12.2 or
Section 12.3, a party shall notify the Indemnifying Party of the claim of an
Indemnified Party under this Section 12.7, including the specific details of,
and specific basis under this Agreement for, its claim (the "Claim Notice").
In the event that the claim for indemnification is based upon a claim by a
Third Party against the Indemnified Party (a "Claim"), such party shall
provide its Claim Notice promptly after the Indemnified Party has actual
knowledge of the Claim and shall enclose a copy of all papers (if any) served
with respect to the Claim; provided that the failure of any Indemnified Party
to give notice of a Claim as provided in this Section 12.7 shall not relieve
the Indemnifying Party of its obligations under Section 9.1(c), Section 12.2
or Section 12.3 (as applicable) except to the extent such failure results in
insufficient time being available to permit the Indemnifying Party to
effectively defend against the Claim or otherwise materially prejudices the
Indemnifying Party's ability to defend against the claim. All claims by an
Indemnified Party pursuant to this Article XII may only be brought by a party
hereto, on its own behalf or on behalf of an Indemnified Party.

(c) In the case of a claim for indemnification based upon a Claim, the
Indemnifying Party shall have 30 days from its receipt of the Claim Notice to
notify the Indemnified Party whether it admits or denies its liability to
defend the Indemnified Party against such Claim at the sole cost and expense
of the Indemnifying Party. The Indemnified Party is authorized, prior to and
during such 30 day period, to file any motion, answer or other pleading that
it shall deem necessary or appropriate to protect its interests or those of
the Indemnifying Party and that is not prejudicial to the Indemnifying Party.

(d) If the Indemnifying Party admits its liability, it shall have the right
and obligation to diligently defend, at its sole cost and expense, the Claim.
The Indemnifying Party shall have full control of such defense and
proceedings, including any compromise or settlement thereof subject to the
remainder of this Section 12.7(d). If requested by the Indemnifying Party, the
Indemnified Party agrees to cooperate in contesting any Claim which the
Indemnifying Party elects to contest, including by making available all
records (in any form) and furnishing management and employees as may be
reasonable necessary for the preparation of any defense or settlement. The
Indemnified Party may participate in, but not control, any defense or
settlement of any Claim controlled by the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this
Section 12.7(d). An Indemnifying Party shall not, without the prior written
consent of the Indemnified Party, (i) settle any Claim or consent to the entry
of any judgment with respect thereto which does not include an unconditional
written release of the Indemnified Party from all liability in respect of such
Claim or (ii) settle any Claim or consent to the entry of any judgment with
respect thereto in any manner that may materially and



adversely affect the Indemnified Party (other than as a result of money
damages covered by the indemnity).

(e) If the Indemnifying Party does not admit its liability within the 30 day
period or admits its liability but fails to diligently defend or settle the
Claim, then the Indemnified Party shall have the right to defend against the
Claim at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party, with counsel of
the Indemnified Party's choosing; provided that the Indemnified Party shall
not settle a Claim or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect
thereto without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.

(f) In the case of a claim for indemnification not based upon a Claim, the
Indemnifying Party shall have 90 days from its receipt of the Claim Notice to
(i) cure, if curable, or Remediate, if applicable, the Liabilities complained
of, (ii) admit its liability for such Liability or (iii) dispute the claim for
such Liabilities.

(g) The amount of any Liabilities for which any of the Indemnified Parties is
entitled to indemnification under this Agreement or in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be reduced by any
corresponding insurance proceeds actually realized, net of any collection
costs, and excluding the proceeds of any insurance underwritten by the
Indemnified Parties; provided, however, that no Indemnified Party shall be
required to seek or pursue such insurance proceeds as a condition of
indemnification hereunder. If an Indemnified Party directly or indirectly
receives an amount under insurance coverage with respect to Buyer Liabilities
or Seller Liabilities, as applicable, at any time subsequent to any
indemnification provided by Seller or Buyer, as applicable, pursuant to this
Section 12.7, then such Indemnified Party shall promptly reimburse the
Indemnifying Party for any payment made or expense incurred by the
Indemnifying Party in connection with providing such indemnification up to
such amount received by the Indemnified Party.

(h) Any liability for indemnification hereunder shall be determined without
duplication of recovery by reason of the state of facts giving rise to such
Liability constituting a breach of more than one representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement herein. The Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for
indemnification with respect to any of the Indemnified Party's Liabilities,
based on any set of facts to the extent the Purchase Price is being or has
been adjusted by reason of the same set of facts. The determination of the
dollar amount of any Liabilities shall be based solely on the actual dollar
value thereof, on a dollar-for-dollar basis, and shall not take into account
any multiplier valuations, including any multiple based on earnings or other
financial condition.

Section 12.8. Survival.

(a) The representations and warranties of Seller in Article IV (other than
Fundamental Representations and the representations and warranties in Section
4.17, Section 4.18, and Section 4.23(b)) and the covenants to be performed by
Seller prior to Closing shall survive the Closing and for a period of 365 days
thereafter. The representations and warranties of Seller in Section 4.23(b)
shall survive Closing for a period of 15 months. The representations and
warranties of Seller in Section 4.17 and Section 4.18 shall survive Closing
for the applicable statute of



limitations period plus 30 days. The covenants to be performed by Seller
following Closing shall survive until fully performed. Subject to the
foregoing and Section 12.8(b), the remainder of this Agreement shall survive
the Closing without time limit. Representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements shall be of no further force and effect after the date of their
expiration and no claim may be brought in respect thereof after the date of
such expiration; provided that there shall be no termination of any bona fide
claim asserted pursuant to a Claim Notice under this Agreement with respect to
such a representation, warranty, covenant or agreement prior to its expiration
date. The parties intend to shorten the applicable statute of limitations as
provided herein.

(b) The indemnities in this Article XII shall terminate as of the termination
date of each respective representation, warranty, covenant or agreement that
is subject to indemnification, except in each case as to matters for which a
Claim Notice has been delivered to the Indemnifying Party on or before such
termination date. Seller's obligations under Section 12.2(c) shall survive the
Closing without time limit; provided, however, that, notwithstanding the
foregoing, Seller's obligations under (i) Section 12.2(c)(vii) shall only
survive the Closing for a period of 15 months; and (ii) Section 12.2(c)(iii)
shall only survive the Closing for the applicable statute of limitations
period plus an additional 30 days, except, in each case as to matters for
which a Claim Notice has been delivered to the Indemnifying Party on or before
such termination date.

Section 12.9. Waiver of Right to Rescission. Seller and Buyer acknowledge that
the payment of money, as limited by the terms of this Agreement, and Buyer's
remedy of specific performance, shall be adequate compensation and remedy for
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained herein
or for any other claim arising in connection with or with respect to the
transactions contemplated in this Agreement. As the payment of money and
Buyer's remedy of specific performance shall be adequate compensation and
remedy, Buyer and Seller waive any right to rescind this Agreement or any of
the transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 12.10. Non-Compensatory Damages. None of the Buyer Indemnified Parties
nor the Seller Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to recover from Seller or
Buyer, or their respective Affiliates, any punitive, special, indirect,
remote, speculative, exemplary or consequential damages of any kind arising
under or in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby, except to the extent any such party suffers such damages (including
costs of defense and reasonable attorney's fees incurred in connection with
defending of such damages) to a Third Party, which damages (including costs of
defense and reasonable attorney's fees incurred in connection with defending
against such damages) shall not be excluded by this provision as to recovery
hereunder. SUBJECT TO THE PRECEDING SENTENCE, BUYER, ON BEHALF OF EACH OF THE
BUYER INDEMNIFIED PARTIES, AND SELLER, ON BEHALF OF EACH OF SELLER INDEMNIFIED
PARTIES, WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO RECOVER PUNITIVE, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, REMOTE,
SPECULATIVE, EXEMPLARY AND CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, ARISING IN CONNECTION WITH

NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, NOTHING HEREIN SHALL PREJUDICE BUYER'S RIGHTS
TO PURSUE SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE IN ACCORDANCE WITH SECTION 13.2(c).



Section 12.11. Disclaimer of Application of Anti-Indemnity Statutes. The
parties acknowledge and agree that the provisions of any anti-indemnity
statute relating to oilfield services and associated activities shall not be
applicable to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 12.12. Waiver of Trade Practices Act.

(a) It is the intention of the parties that Buyer's rights and remedies with
respect to this transaction and with respect to all acts or practices of
Seller, past, present or future, in connection with this transaction shall be
governed by the legal principles other than the Texas Deceptive Trade
Practices-Consumer Protection Act, Tex. Bus. and Com. Code Ann. § 17.41 et seq.
(the "DTPA"). As such, Buyer hereby waives the applicability of the DTPA to
this transaction and any and all duties, rights or remedies that might be
imposed by the DTPA, whether such duties, rights and remedies are applied
directly by the DTPA itself or indirectly in connection with other statutes.
Buyer acknowledges, represents and warrants (i) that it is purchasing the
goods and services covered by this Agreement for commercial or business use,
(ii) that it or its controlling entity has assets of $25,000,000 or more
according to its most recent financial statement prepared in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles, (iii) that it has knowledge and
experience in financial and business matters that enable it to evaluate the
merits and risks of a transaction such as this and (iv) that it is not in a
significantly disparate bargaining position with Seller. In furtherance of the
foregoing,

WAIVER OF CONSUMER RIGHTS

BUYER WAIVES ITS RIGHTS UNDER THE TEXAS DECEPTIVE TRADE PRACTICES-CONSUMER
PROTECTION ACT, SECTION 17.41 ET SEQ., BUSINESS and COMMERCE CODE, A LAW THAT
GIVES CONSUMERS SPECIAL RIGHTS AND PROTECTIONS. AFTER CONSULTATION WITH AN
ATTORNEY OF BUYER'S OWN SELECTION, BUYER VOLUNTARILY CONSENTS TO THIS WAIVER.

(b) Buyer expressly recognizes that the price for which Seller has agreed to
perform its obligations under this Agreement has been predicated upon the
inapplicability of the DTPA and this waiver of the DTPA. Buyer further
recognizes that Seller, in determining to enter into this Agreement, has
expressly relied on this waiver and the inapplicability of the DTPA.

ARTICLE XIII

TERMINATION, DEFAULT AND REMEDIES

Section 13.1. Right of Termination. This Agreement and the transactions
contemplated herein may be terminated (a) at any time at or prior to Closing
by mutual written agreement of the parties, (b) by Seller if (i) Seller is
ready, willing and able to perform all of its agreements and covenants
contained herein which are to be performed or observed by Seller at the
Closing and (ii) the Closing shall not have occurred on or before February 14,
2018, or (c) by Buyer if (i) Buyer is ready, willing and able to perform all
of its agreements and covenants contained herein which are to be performed or
observed by such party at the Closing and (ii) the Closing shall



not have occurred on or before February 14, 2018; provided, however, that no
party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement to this Section 13.1 if
such party or its Affiliates are at such time in material breach of any
provision of this Agreement.

Section 13.2. Effect of Termination; Remedies.

(a) If the obligation to close the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
is terminated pursuant to any provision of Section 13.1 hereof, then except
for the provisions of Section 1.1, Section 9.1(e), Section 9.2(a), Section
12.10, this Article XIII, Article XIV (other than Section 14.1(b), Section
14.5, Section 14.6 and Section 14.7) and such of the defined terms in Appendix
1 as are referenced in such Sections and Articles, this Agreement shall
forthwith become void, and the parties shall have no Liability or obligation
hereunder.

(b) If Seller has the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section
13.1 and Buyer is a Breaching Party, then Seller shall, as its sole and
exclusive remedy, have the right to terminate this Agreement and retain the
Deposit, as liquidated damages and not as a penalty for such termination, free
and clear of any claims thereon by Buyer. THE PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE
THAT (A) SELLER'S ACTUAL DAMAGES RESULTING FROM A TERMINATION UNDER THIS
SECTION 13.2(B) MAY BE DIFFICULT, IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE TO CALCULATE, (B) THE
DEPOSIT IS A FAIR AND REASONABLE ESTIMATE OF SELLER'S LIQUIDATED DAMAGES IN
LIGHT OF THE UNCERTAINTIES IN CALCULATING THE ACTUAL DAMAGES THAT WOULD BE
SUFFERED BY SELLER UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION 13.2(B)
AND (C) SUCH LIQUIDATED DAMAGES ARE NOT A PENALTY.

(c) If Buyer has a right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 13.1
and Seller is a Breaching Party, then Buyer shall, as its sole and exclusive
remedy, have the right to, at its option, either (i) terminate this Agreement
and receive a return of the Deposit; or (ii) seek specific performance by
Seller of this Agreement. In connection with the foregoing, it is agreed and
acknowledged by the parties that the Assets are unique and that Buyer shall be
entitled to the remedies set forth in this Section 13.2(c)(ii), without the
posting of a bond or other surety or proof of harm.

(d) In the event that this Agreement is terminated under Section 13.1 and
Seller is not entitled to retain the Deposit under Section 13.2(b), then
Seller shall, within five (5) business days of the date of such termination,
return to Buyer the Deposit (without interest), free of any claims thereon by
Seller.

(e) If a party resorts to legal proceedings to enforce this Agreement prior to
Closing, the prevailing party in such proceedings shall be entitled to recover
all costs incurred by such party from the party that is in breach or default,
including reasonable attorneys' fees, in addition to any other relief to which
such party may be entitled.

Section 13.3. Return of Documentation and Confidentiality. Upon termination of
this Agreement, Buyer shall promptly (a) return to Seller, or, if electronic,
destroy, all title, engineering, geological and geophysical data,
environmental assessments and reports, maps and other information furnished by
Seller to Buyer or prepared by or on behalf of Buyer in connection



with its due diligence investigation of the Assets and any documents, data,
reports, assessments in paper, electronic, digital or any other form, to the
extent derived from the matters described in this clause (a) or from any
confidential information obtained under the Confidentiality Agreement, or (b)
destroy any copies of such data, assessments and reports. An officer of Buyer
shall certify same to Seller in writing. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
nothing herein shall require Buyer to destroy or return data and information
contained in Buyer's computer back-up systems that will be deleted in
accordance with Buyer's document retention policies or data or information
embedded within board or management presentations or minutes compiled by or on
behalf of Buyer or that are otherwise retained for corporate governance
purposes.

ARTICLE XIV

MISCELLANEOUS

Section 14.1. Expenses and Taxes.

(a) Except as otherwise specifically provided, all fees, costs and expenses
incurred by Buyer or Seller in negotiating this Agreement or in consummating
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the party
incurring the same, including legal and accounting fees, costs and expenses.

(b) All required documentary, filing and recording fees and expenses in
connection with the filing and recording of the assignments, conveyances or
other instruments required to convey title to the Assets to Buyer shall be
borne by Buyer. Buyer shall (i) file all necessary Tax Returns and other
documentation with respect to all sales, use, transfer and similar taxes
("Transfer Taxes") and fees arising out of or in connection with the
transactions effected pursuant to this Agreement and (ii) be liable for and
either promptly reimburse Seller for, or promptly pay, any such Transfer
Taxes. Seller and Buyer shall cooperate in good faith to obtain an exemption
from, or minimize, to the extent permissible under applicable Law, the amount
of Transfer Taxes. Seller shall be responsible for, and shall bear and pay,
all Asset Taxes assessed by any Governmental Authority for any period or the
portion of the Straddle Period that ends prior to the Effective Time. Buyer
shall be responsible for, and shall bear and pay, all Asset Taxes assessed by
any Governmental Authority for any period, or the portion of the Straddle
Period that begins on or after the Effective Time (including any "rollback" or
similar ad valorem or property Tax resulting from a change in use of property
by Buyer, regardless of the period with respect to which such rollback or
similar Tax is calculated). For purposes of this Agreement, (i) production,
severance, and similar Asset Taxes (including any applicable interest or
penalties) that are attributable to the severance or production of
Hydrocarbons shall be allocated to the period during which the relevant
production or severance occurred, (ii) ad valorem, property and similar Asset
Taxes (including any applicable interest or penalties) shall be prorated at
the Closing based on the ratio of the number of days in the Straddle Period
prior to (for Seller) and on and after (for Buyer) the Effective Time to the
total number of days in the Straddle Period as applied to the amount of such
Asset Taxes for the most recent year for which the amount of such Asset Taxes
can be finally determined at the Closing, and (iii) all other Asset Taxes
shall be allocated to the period in which the transaction giving rise to such
taxes occurred. Seller shall pay to Buyer within 30 days of Buyer's written
demand Seller's portion of all Asset Taxes prorated to Seller under this
Section 14.1(b) but paid by Buyer to the extent not



taken into account under Section 3.2(b)(iii). Buyer shall pay to Seller within
30 days of Seller's written demand Buyer's portion of all Asset Taxes prorated
to Buyer under this Section 14.1(b) but paid by Seller to the extent not taken
into account under Section 3.2(a)(iii).

(c) If Buyer receives a refund of any Taxes that Seller is responsible for
hereunder, or if Seller receive a refund of any Taxes that Buyer is
responsible for hereunder, and such refund was not taken into account for
purposes of determining the Final Price under Section 3.1(b), the party
receiving such refund shall, within 30 days after receipt of such refund,
remit it to the party who has responsibility for such Taxes hereunder.

Section 14.2. Assignment. Except as otherwise set forth in Section 6.8, this
Agreement may not be assigned by either party without prior written consent of
the other, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or
delayed; provided, however, Buyer shall have the right to assign this
Agreement, in whole or in part, to an Affiliate of Buyer. No assignment of any
rights hereunder by a party shall relieve such party of any obligations and
responsibilities hereunder. Any assignment or other transfer by Buyer or its
successors and assigns of any of the Assets shall not relieve Buyer or its
successors or assigns of any of their obligations (including indemnity
obligations) hereunder, as to the Assets so assigned or transferred.

Section 14.3. Publicity. Except as otherwise set forth in this Section 14.3,
Seller and Buyer shall consult with each other with regard to all press
releases or other public or private announcements issued or made prior to the
Closing concerning this Agreement or the transactions contemplated herein,
and, except as the disclosing party may reasonably consider necessary in order
to satisfy its or its Affiliates' obligations under Laws or the applicable
rules and regulations of any Governmental Authority or stock exchange, neither
Buyer nor Seller shall issue any such press release prior to the Closing,
without the prior written consent of the other party, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld; provided that a party shall have no obligation under
this Section 14.3 with respect to information the substance of which has
previously been publicly disclosed by a party other than themselves in breach
of this Agreement and provided further that any information concerning this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated herein once in the public domain
may be discussed with the media, in investor presentations and conference

Section 14.6. Further Cooperation. After the Closing, Buyer and Seller shall
execute and deliver, or shall cause to be executed and delivered from time to
time, such further instruments of conveyance and transfer, and shall take such
other actions as any party may reasonably request to convey and deliver the
Assets to Buyer, to perfect Buyer's title thereto and to accomplish the
orderly transfer of the Assets to Buyer in the manner contemplated by this
Agreement. If any party hereto receives monies belonging to the other, such

received by a party, which is partially an obligation of both Seller and
Buyer, then the parties shall consult with each other, and each shall promptly
pay its portion of such obligation to the obligee. At Seller's sole cost and
expense, Buyer agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with
Seller in connection with Seller's defense and other actions relating to or
arising out of the litigation and claims that are Retained Obligations,
including upon reasonable request by making its and its Affiliates' employees

and claims that are Assumed Obligations, including upon reasonable request by
making its and its Affiliates' employees that were engaged in the operation of
the Assets prior to Closing available during normal business hours and upon
reasonable notice for the purposes of providing testimony, depositions,
information and other related activities relating to such litigation and
claims.

Section 14.7. Filings and Certain Governmental Approvals. Promptly after
Closing Buyer shall (a) record the Assignments of the Assets executed at the
Closing in all applicable real property records and (b) actively pursue the
approval of all applicable Governmental Authorities of the assignment of the
Assets to Buyer and the designation of Buyer as the operator thereof, as
applicable. Buyer shall be solely responsible for all filing fees associated
therewith.

Section 14.8. Entire Agreement. This Agreement, the exhibits and schedules
hereto, the Assignments, Assignment and Assumption, the Transaction Documents,
and, only until Closing, the Confidentiality Agreement, collectively
constitute the entire Agreement among Seller and Buyer pertaining to the
subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements, understandings,
negotiations and discussions, whether oral or written, of the parties
pertaining to the subject matter hereof.

shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of Seller and Buyer and their
respective legal representatives, successors and assigns. Except as expressly
set forth in Section 12.2 or Section 12.3 (which rights must be enforced, if
at all, by the applicable party to this Agreement), no other person shall have
any right, benefit, priority, or interest hereunder or as a result hereof or
have standing to require satisfaction of the provisions hereof in accordance
with their terms.

Section 14.10. Amendment. This Agreement may be amended only by an instrument
in writing executed by both parties.

Section 14.11. Waiver; Rights Cumulative. Any of the terms, covenants,
representations, warranties or conditions hereof may be waived only by a
written instrument executed by or on behalf of the party hereto waiving
compliance. No course of dealing on the part of Seller or Buyer, or their
respective officers, employees, agents or representatives, nor any failure by
Seller or Buyer to exercise any of its rights under this Agreement shall
operate as a waiver thereof or affect in any way the right of such party at a
later time to enforce the performance of such provision. No waiver by any
party of any condition, or any breach of any term, covenant,



representation or warranty contained in this Agreement, in any one or more
instances, shall be deemed to be or construed as a further or continuing
waiver of any such condition or breach or a waiver of any other condition or
of any breach of any other term, covenant, representation or warranty. The
rights of Seller and Buyer under this Agreement shall be cumulative, and the
exercise or partial exercise of any such right shall not preclude the exercise
of any other right.

Section 14.12. Governing Law; Dispute Resolution.

(a) This Agreement and the legal relations among the parties shall be governed
and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Texas, excluding any
conflicts of law rule or principle that might refer construction of such
provisions to the laws of another jurisdiction.

(b) Any controversy, dispute or claim arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or the Transaction Documents, or the transactions contemplated
thereby (a "Dispute") shall be resolved in accordance with this Section 14.12.
Any party may give the other party written notice (a "Dispute Notice") of any
Dispute which has not been resolved in the normal course of business. Within
15 business days after delivery of the Dispute Notice, the receiving party
shall submit to the other party a written response (the "Response"). The
Dispute Notice and the Response shall each include (i) a statement setting
forth the position of the party giving such notice, a summary of the arguments
supporting such position and, if applicable, the relief sought and (ii) the
name and title of a senior manager of such party who has authority to settle
the Dispute and will be responsible for the negotiations related to the
settlement of the Dispute (the "Senior Manager").

(c) Within 10 days after the delivery of the Response provided for in Section
14.12(b), the Senior Managers of both parties shall meet or communicate by
telephone at a mutually acceptable time and place, and thereafter as often as
they reasonably deem necessary, and shall negotiate in good faith to attempt
to resolve the Dispute that is the subject of such Dispute Notice. It is
agreed between the parties that the content of any communications pursuant to
this Section 14.12(c) will be and shall remain confidential. The parties, on
behalf of themselves and their attorneys, hereby agree that they will not in
any way reveal the content or terms of any such communications to any person,
firm, corporation, or entity, with the exception that the disclosure shall not
be a violation of this Section 14.12(c) where the same is required by Law or
court Order, or any agency or authority having jurisdiction to require
disclosure; provided, however, that the parties may disclose the content or
terms of such communications to their attorneys, accountants, trustees,
financial advisors or their tax related consultants, as may be necessary in
their business affairs. If such Dispute has not been resolved within 30 days
after delivery of the Dispute Notice, then the parties may proceed to
arbitration pursuant to Section 14.12(d).

(d) Except as specifically otherwise provided in this Agreement, the parties
agree that any and all Disputes arising from or related to this Agreement that
cannot be amicably settled pursuant to Section 14.12(c) shall be determined
solely and exclusively by arbitration in accordance with the Federal
Arbitration Act and using the rules of the American Arbitration Association or
any successor thereof when not in conflict with such act. Arbitration shall
take place at an appointed time and place in Houston, Texas. Each party shall
select one impartial arbitrator, and the two so designated shall select a
third impartial arbitrator. If either party shall fail to designate an
arbitrator within 14 days after arbitration is requested, or if the two
arbitrators shall fail to select a third



arbitrator within 30 days after arbitration is requested, then an arbitrator
shall be selected by the Senior U.S. District Judge for the Southern District
of Texas. Discovery shall be made pursuant to the Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure and completed within 45 days of selection of the third arbitrator.
Final hearing on the matter shall be had within 60 days of the selection of
the third arbitrator and a final decision (which may include the award of
reasonable attorney's fees and costs) with a written opinion stating the
reasons therefor shall be rendered within 75 days of said date and be final
and binding, and the parties also waive irrevocably their right to any form of
appeal, review or recourse to any state court or other judicial authority,
insofar as such waiver may be validly made. Judgment upon an award of the
majority of the arbitrators shall be binding. Judgment on the award may be
entered and enforced by any court of competent jurisdiction. In no event may
the arbitrators award damages that have been waived by the parties under
Section 12.10. The arbitration process shall be kept confidential, and such
conduct, statements, promises, offers, views and opinions shall not be
discoverable or admissible in any legal proceeding for any purpose, except to
the extent reasonably necessary to enforce the final decision of the
arbitrators.

Section 14.13. Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect. Upon the determination that any
term or provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to
effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an
acceptable manner to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are
fulfilled to the extent possible.

Section 14.14. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, and each such counterpart hereof shall be deemed to be an
original instrument, but all of such counterparts shall constitute for all
purposes one agreement. Any signature hereto delivered by a party by
electronic transmission shall be deemed an original signature hereto.

records, unless such gap is affirmatively shown to exist in such records by an

This Closing Agreement and Amendment to Purchase and Sale Agreement (this
"Amendment"), dated as of January 31, 2018, is made and entered into between
Carrizo Oil and Gas, Inc. and Carrizo (Eagle Ford) LLC (collectively, "Seller")
and EP Energy EandP Company, L.P. ("Buyer"). Seller and Buyer are each referred
to as a "Party" and collectively referred to as the "Parties." Capitalized
terms used but not defined in this Amendment shall have the meanings given to
such terms in the PSA (as hereinafter defined).

WHEREAS, Seller and Buyer have entered into, and desire to amend as set forth
below, that certain Purchase and Sale Agreement dated as of December 11, 2017
(as further amended, restated or supplemented from time to time, the "PSA");
and

WHEREAS, the Parties desire to amend certain Exhibits and Schedules to the
PSA, as more specifically set forth in this Amendment and agree on certain
other matters for the purposes of Closing.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the Closing of the transaction
contemplated under the PSA, the mutual promises and covenants set forth
herein, and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency
of which are hereby acknowledged, the Parties hereby agree as follows:

1. Amendments to the PSA. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the PSA, the Parties agree that the following amendments to the PSA are made effective as of the Execution Date:

(a) Exhibit A-1 to the PSA is hereby deleted and replaced in its entirety with
Annex 1 attached hereto;

(b) Exhibit A-3 to the PSA is hereby deleted and replaced in its entirety with
Annex 2 attached hereto; and

(c) Schedule 4.7 to the PSA is hereby deleted and replaced in its entirety
with Annex 3 attached hereto.

2. Pipe Permits. Notwithstanding Section 2.1(f) of the PSA, certain permits relating to pipelines, rights of way, and related assets included in the Assets (the "Affected Pipelines") may not be transferred to Buyer at Closing. The Parties shall cooperate to cause the transfer of such permits to Buyer (or its Affiliate) or the removal of the Affected Pipelines from Seller's existing permits and the addition of the Affected Pipelines to Buyer's permits.

3. Frio LaSalle Contract. Reference is made to that certain Gas Gathering and Processing Agreement dated April 1, 2014 by and between Frio LaSalle Pipeline, LP and Carrizo (Eagle Ford) LLC (as amended, the "Gathering Agreement"). The Gathering Agreement covers and affects certain of the Assets and certain other properties and assets not included in the Assets 

under the PSA. The Parties shall cooperate reasonably to affect a partial
assignment, novation, or similar arrangement with respect to the Gathering
Agreement to Buyer such (a) that the Gathering Contract applies separately to
the Assets and such other properties and assets and (b) the actions or
omissions of one Party shall not affect the other Party with respect to the
Gathering Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, unless and until such
partial assignment, novation, or similar arrangement occurs, each Party shall
be liable and responsible for performance under the Gathering Agreement only
with respect to its assets and properties held by such Party, and, with
respect to Seller and its assets and properties that are not included in the
Assets and transferred to Buyer under the PSA, the Gathering Agreement shall
be considered to be an Excluded Asset. Notwithstanding the foregoing or
anything to the contrary in the PSA, Buyer shall be responsible for a
proportionate share of the Capital Recovery Fee under Section V.1 of the
Gathering Agreement as determined under the final grammatical sentence of
Section 2.3(a) of the PSA, not to exceed the amount of any Capital Recovery
Fee attributable to throughput at the Carrizo Seigele Delivery Point, as
described in Exhibit B of the Gathering Agreement.

4. Mellenbruch Family Partnership Required Consent. As of the Closing Date, Seller has not obtained the Required Consent identified as TX2069001031-001 MELLENBRUCH FAMILY PARTNERSHIP LP CARRIZO (EAGLE FORD) LLC on Schedule 4.4(a) of the PSA (the "Mellenbruch Consent"), and the Properties (or portions thereof) affected thereby have been excluded from the Assets conveyed to Buyer at Closing. In accordance with Section 10.4(f) of the PSA, the Parties shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to attempt to obtain the Mellenbruch Consent, provided that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 10.4(f) of the PSA, (i) the period of time after Closing for which the Parties shall attempt to obtain the Mellenbruch Consent shall be ninety (90) days; (ii) if the Mellenbruch Consent is obtained within such period, or if Buyer otherwise so elects in writing, the Parties shall promptly close on the Properties that were excluded at Closing in respect of the Mellenbruch Consent in accordance with Section 10.4(f) of the PSA; (iii) if, after such ninety (90) day period, the Parties have not obtained the Mellenbruch Consent, and party holding such consent right has not affirmatively objected in writing to the assignment with a reasonable basis for such objection, the Parties shall promptly close on the Properties that were excluded at Closing in respect of the Mellenbruch Consent in accordance with Section 10.4(f) of the PSA; and (iv) if, on or before the end of such ninety (90) day period, the party or parties holding such consent right have affirmatively objected in writing to the assignment with a reasonable basis for such objection, and Buyer does not elect to close notwithstanding such objection, the Properties excluded at Closing in respect of the Mellenbruch Consent shall become Excluded Assets in accordance with the terms of the PSA, and the Parties shall enter into an operating agreement substantially in the form of the Maltsberger B Unit operating agreement, naming Seller as operator of such Asset, and such operating agreement shall prohibit the proposal of drilling operations with respect to a well by a non-operator that would, taking into account any non-consents by third parties in such well, hold less than a 25% Working Interest in such well.

5. Confirmation. Except as otherwise provided herein, the provisions of the PSA shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with their respective terms following the execution of this Amendment. 

6. Conflicts. If any provision of this Amendment is construed to conflict with any provision of the PSA (except as otherwise expressly provided in this Amendment), the provisions of this Amendment shall be deemed controlling to the extent of that conflict.

7. Entire Agreement. This Amendment, the PSA, the Appendices, Exhibits and Schedules to the PSA, the Transaction Documents and the Confidentiality Agreement collectively constitute the entire agreement between the Parties pertaining to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements, understandings, negotiations, and discussions, whether oral or written, of the Parties pertaining to the subject matter hereof or thereof except as specifically set forth herein or therein.

8. Choice of Law. This Amendment and any claim, controversy or dispute arising under or related to this Amendment or the transactions contemplated hereby or the rights, duties and relationship of the parties hereto and thereto, shall be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of Texas, excluding any conflicts of law, rule or principle that might refer construction of provisions to the Laws of another jurisdiction.

9. Amendment. This Amendment may be amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified only by an instrument in writing executed by all Parties specifically referring to the terms to be amended, restated, supplemented and/or modified and expressly identified as an amendment, restatement, supplement or modification.

10. Counterparts. This Amendment may be executed in any number of counterparts, and each such counterpart hereof shall be deemed to be an original instrument, but all of such counterparts shall constitute for all purposes one agreement. Any signature hereto delivered by a Party by facsimile or other electronic transmission shall be deemed an original signature hereto.
