AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 

 

THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this "Agreement"), is made and entered
into as of March 13, 2008, by and among Allion Healthcare, Inc., a Delaware
corporation ("Parent"), Biomed Healthcare, Inc., a Delaware corporation and
wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"), Biomed America, Inc., a
Delaware corporation (the "Company"), and Parallex LLC, a Delaware limited
liability company (the "Owner").

 

 

RECITALS

 

 

WHEREAS, the boards of directors of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company have
approved the merger of the Company with and into Merger Sub (the "Merger"),
upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and
have determined that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement are in the best interests of their respective stockholders;

 

 

WHEREAS, this Agreement and the Merger has been approved by the affirmative
written consent of holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares
of the Company's Common Stock (the "Requisite Consent"), in accordance with
Section 228 of the DGCL (the "Requisite Consent Action"). In addition, on the
date of this Agreement the Owner and certain of the other Stockholders has
executed a counterpart signature page to the Requisite Consent Action
approving the terms of this Agreement (including, without limitation, the
appointment of the Stockholders' Representative as set forth in Section 14.02
below) and the Merger;

 

 

WHEREAS, the transactions described in this Agreement are subject to the
termination or expiration of the waiting period required under the HSR Act
and the satisfaction of certain other conditions set forth in this Agreement;

 

 

WHEREAS, concurrent with the execution of this Agreement, as a condition and
inducement to Parent and Merger Sub\'s willingness to enter into this
Agreement, each of the Owner and Raymond A. Mirra, Jr. have entered into a
restrictive covenant agreement with Parent and Merger Sub (copies of which
are attached hereto as Exhibit A-1 through Exhibit A-2) that becomes
effective automatically with the Closing;

 

 

WHEREAS, concurrent with the execution of this Agreement, as a condition and
inducement to Parent and Merger Sub\'s willingness to enter into this
Agreement, Raymond A. Mirra, Jr. has entered into an indemnification
agreement with Parent and Merger Sub (a copy of which is attached hereto as
Exhibit B) that becomes effective automatically with the Closing;

 

 

WHEREAS, the parties intend that the Merger qualify as a "reorganization"
within the meaning of Section 368(a)(1)(a) of the Code, and this Agreement
constitutes a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of
Section 1.368-1(c) of the Treasury Regulations and it is, therefore,
contemplated and intended by the parties that the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement will be non-taxable to the Company, and the receipt of
Parent Capital Stock by the Stockholders will, therefore, be entitled to non-
recognition treatment in accordance with Section 354 of the Code; and

 

 

WHEREAS, certain capitalized terms used in this Agreement and not defined
elsewhere in this Agreement are defined in Article 13.

 

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective

General Corporation Law (the "DGCL"), (i) the Company shall be merged with
and into Merger Sub, (ii) the separate corporate existence of the Company
shall cease, and (iii) Merger Sub shall continue as the surviving corporation
and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. Merger Sub, as the surviving
corporation after the Merger, is hereinafter sometimes referred to as the

the terms of this Agreement, which has been approved by the respective Boards
of Directors of the Company, Merger Sub and Parent and which will be approved
on the date hereof by the stockholders of the Company.

 

 

1.02 Time and Place of the Closing. Subject to the conditions contained in
this Agreement, the closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall take place
(i) at the offices of Alston and Bird LLP, 90 Park Avenue, New York, New York
10016, at 10:00 a.m., local time, on the date most promptly
practicable following the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth
in Article 10 (other than those conditions requiring performance at the
Closing), but in no event later than the third (3rd) business day following
such date or (ii) at such other place and time and/or on such other date as
the Company and Merger Sub may mutually agree in writing. The date on which
the Closing occurs is hereinafter referred to as the "Closing Date".

 

 

1.03 Effective Time. At the Closing, the parties shall cause the Merger to
be consummated by filing with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware
a certificate of merger (the "Certificate of Merger"), executed in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL. The Merger shall become
effective upon the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware or at such later time as is agreed to by the
Company and Merger Sub and specified in the Certificate of Merger (the time
at which the Merger becomes effective is hereinafter referred to as the
"Effective Time").

 

 

1.04 Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.

(b) The Bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time, shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, until duly amended

1.05 Directors and Officers. The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be the initial directors of the Surviving
Corporation and shall hold office until their respective successors are duly

Incorporation and Bylaws. The officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation and

ARTICLE 2

 

 

EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK

 

OF THE COMPANY AND MERGER SUB

 

 

2.01 Effect on Shares of Merger Sub Capital Stock. Each share of Merger Sub
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall remain issued and outstanding from and after the Effective Time and
shall represent one (1) share of Common Stock of the Surviving Corporation.

 

 

2.02 Effect on Shares of the Company Common Stock.

 

 

(a) Common Stock of the Company. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent or Merger
Sub, or the stockholders of any of the foregoing, each share of Company
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than (i) any Dissenting Shares, and (ii) those shares of Company
Common Stock to be canceled pursuant to Section 2.02(b)) shall be converted
into the right to receive, upon surrender of the certificates representing
such Company Common Stock in the manner provided for in Section 3.02(d),
from Parent in an amount equal to the Effective Time Per Share Merger
Consideration and the Per Share Earn Out Payment, if applicable. All such
shares of Company Common Stock, when so converted, shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be canceled, and each holder of a
certificate or certificates representing shares of Company Common Stock shall
cease to have any rights with respect to such shares of Company Common Stock,
except the right to receive the Effective Time Per Share Merger
Consideration. In addition, each holder of Company Common Stock shall be
entitled to receive its Ownership Percentage of the Escrow Amount, which will
be released pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement.

 

 

(b) Cancellation of Certain Shares of Common Stock. As of the Effective Time,
by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of
any shares of Company Common Stock, the Company or Merger Sub, each share of
Company Common Stock owned by the Company or any of its wholly-owned
subsidiaries as treasury stock or otherwise immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall automatically be canceled, and no cash or other
consideration shall be delivered or deliverable in exchange for such shares
of Company Common Stock.

 

 

2.03 Dissenting Shares. The Owner hereby waives notice of and agrees not
to seek or assert any dissenter\'s or appraisal rights, or any similar
rights, to which the Owner would otherwise be entitled. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, but only in the circumstances and
to the extent provided by the DGCL, shares of Company Common Stock that are
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by
Stockholders who did not vote such shares in favor of the Merger or consent
to the Merger in writing prior to the Effective Time and who shall have
properly and timely delivered to the Company, as the case may be, a written
demand for appraisal of their shares of the Company Common Stock in
accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL ("Dissenting Shares") shall not be
converted into the right to receive, or be exchangeable for, the Effective
Time Per Share Merger Consideration or the contingent right to receive a
proportionate percentage of the Escrow Amount or the Earn Out Payment, if
any. Instead, the holders of Dissenting Shares shall be entitled to payment
of the fair value of such shares in accordance with the provisions of Section
262 of the DGCL; provided, however, that (i) if any holder of Dissenting
Shares shall subsequently withdraw such holder's demand for payment of the
fair value of such Dissenting Shares, or (ii) if any holder fails to
establish and perfect such holder's entitlement to the relief provided in
Section 262 of the DGCL, then the rights and obligations of such holder to
receive such fair value shall terminate, and such Dissenting Shares shall
thereupon be deemed to have been converted, as of the Effective Time, into
the right to receive, and to

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have become exchangeable for, the Effective Time Per Share Merger
Consideration and a contingent right to receive a proportionate percentage of
the Escrow Amount or the Earn Out Payment, if any. The Company shall give
Parent (i) prompt written notice of all demands for payment under Section 262
of the DGCL, and (ii) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to demands for payment under Section 262 of the
DGCL. The Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent,
make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any demands
for payment under Section 262 of the DGCL, or agree to do any of the
foregoing. If a holder of Company Common Stock demands appraisal of the fair
value of shares of Company Common Stock under Section 262 of the DGCL after
Closing and such shares become Dissenting Shares, and subsequently such
holder receives payment for the fair value of such Dissenting Shares in lieu
of the Effective Time Merger Consideration and the contingent right to
receive a proportionate percentage of the Escrow Amount or the Earn Out
Payment, if any, Parent shall be entitled to withdraw from the Effective Time
Merger Consideration supplied to the Agent in accordance with Section
3.02(c) any portion of such Effective Time Merger Consideration with respect
to such Dissenting Shares.

 

 

2.04 Fractional Shares. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, each holder of shares of Company Common Stock exchanged pursuant
to the Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of
a share of Parent Common Stock or Parent Preferred Stock (after taking into
account all certificates delivered by such holder) shall receive, in lieu
thereof, cash (without interest) in an amount equal to such fractional part
of a share of Parent Common Stock or Parent Preferred Stock multiplied by the
ten (10)-day average closing price immediately prior to the date of
this Agreement. No such holder will be entitled to dividends, voting rights,
or any other rights as a stockholder in respect of any fractional shares.

 

 

2.05 Tax and Accounting Consequences. Each party hereby acknowledges and
agrees that it has consulted with its own tax advisors and accountants with
respect to the tax and accounting consequences, respectively, of the Merger.

CALCULATION AND PAYMENT OF THE EFFECTIVE TIME MERGER CONSIDERATION

 

 

3.01 Effective Time Merger Consideration.

 

 

(a) The aggregate merger consideration (the "Effective Time
Merger Consideration") to be paid by Parent to the Stockholders at or prior
to the Effective Time, subject to the post-Effective Time payment procedures
set forth in Section 3.02(d) below and the post-Effective Time working
capital adjustment set forth in Section 3.03(b) below, in consideration for
all of the capital stock and rights thereto of the Company shall be:

 

 

(i) 3,380,869 shares of Parent Common Stock (the "Effective Time Common
Stock Consideration Amount"); provided, however, that the Company and the
Owner each acknowledge and agree that (A) in no event shall the number of
shares of Parent Common Stock issued hereunder exceed nineteen and 9/10
percent (19.9%) of the total number of issued and outstanding shares
of Parent Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time (the "Common
Stock Cap") and (B) if for any reason whatsoever the number of shares of
Parent Common Stock to be issued hereunder exceeds the Common Stock Cap, then
any such excess shares shall be issuable to the Stockholders in the form of
additional shares of Parent Preferred Stock and not Parent Common Stock;

 

 

(ii) 5,969,131 shares of Parent Preferred Stock (the "Effective Time
Preferred Stock Consideration Amount"); provided, however, that the Company
and the Owner each

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

acknowledge and agree that the number of shares of Parent Preferred Stock
issuable as part of the Effective Time Merger Consideration may increase
pursuant to clause (B) of Section 3.01(a)(i) above; and

 

 

(iii) Forty Eight Million Dollars ($48,000,000) in cash minus the
Assumed Indebtedness Excess Amount, if applicable, minus the Escrow Amount
and minus the Estimated Shortfall Amount, if applicable (the "Effective Time
Cash Consideration Amount").

 

 

(b) In accordance with the payment procedures set forth in Section 3.02
below, at the Effective Time, each share of Company Common Stock shall be
converted into the right to receive the following consideration (the
"Effective Time Per Share Merger Consideration"):

 

 

(i) that number of shares of Parent Common Stock determined by dividing the
Effective Time Common Stock Consideration Amount (as such number may be
adjusted pursuant to Section 3.01(a)(i) above) by the total number of shares
of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time,
not including those shares referenced in Section 2.02(b) above;

 

 

(ii) that number of shares of Parent Preferred Stock determined by dividing
the Effective Time Preferred Stock Consideration Amount (as such number may
be adjusted pursuant to Section 3.01(a)(ii) above) by the total number of
shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time, not including those shares referenced in Section 2.02(b) above; and

 

 

(iii) that amount of cash determined by dividing the Effective Time Cash
Consideration Amount by the total number of shares of Company Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, not including those
shares referenced in Section 2.02(b) above.

 

 

(c) On the Closing Date, the Company, the Owner, Parent and Merger Sub shall
execute a certificate to document and certify the Assumed Indebtedness, the
Estimated Shortfall Amount, if applicable, and any unpaid Company Transaction
Expenses each as of the Closing Date, the Effective Time Merger Consideration
and the amounts of cash, Parent Common Stock and Parent Preferred Stock
payable to each Stockholder other than any such amounts payable in connection
with the Earn Out Payment, if any (the "Effective Time Merger Consideration
Certificate").

 

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything in Section 3.01(b) above to the contrary,
Parent agrees to accommodate the Owner with regard to the Owner's allocation
of its Effective Time Per Share Merger Consideration among the shares of
Company Common Stock held by the Owner at the time of the Closing.

 

 

3.02 Payment Procedures.

 

 

(a) At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit in an escrow
account (the "Escrow Account") with SunTrust Bank, as escrow agent (the
"Escrow Agent"), an amount of cash equal to Four Million Dollars ($4,000,000)
(the "Escrow Amount"). The Escrow Account shall be held, invested
and disbursed in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Escrow
Agreement in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit 3.02 (the
"Escrow Agreement").

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5  

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) Each Stockholder that has surrendered prior to the Closing Date (an
"Effective Time Surrendering Stockholder") all of its certificate or
certificates representing shares of Company Common Stock immediately prior to
the Effective Time (the "Certificates") shall be entitled to receive its
portion of the Effective Time Merger Consideration at or prior to the
Effective Time pursuant to this Section 3.02(b). Any Certificates so
surrendered prior to the Closing Date shall be endorsed for transfer or
accompanied by stock powers in favor of Parent and shall be accompanied by
such letter of transmittal duly executed and completed in accordance with the
instructions thereto and such other documents as may be required pursuant to
such instructions. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall (i) wire
in immediately available funds to each Effective Time Surrendering
Stockholder the cash portion of the Effective Time Merger Consideration
payable to such Effective Time Surrendering Stockholder and (ii) cause to be
issued to each Effective Time Surrendering Stockholder a duly authorized and
validly issued Parent Common Stock certificate and a duly authorized and
validly issued Parent Preferred Stock certificate issuable to such Effective
Time Surrendering Stockholder, for each share of Parent Common Stock and
Parent Preferred Stock represented by the surrendered Certificates.

 

 

(c) At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall supply or cause to be
supplied to Parent's transfer agent or other exchange agent selected by
Parent (the "Agent"), in trust for the benefit of the holders of Company
Common Stock other than the Effective Time Surrendering Stockholders and for
exchange pursuant to subsection (d) below, the aggregate Effective Time
Merger Consideration (in cash, Parent Common Stock and Parent Preferred
Stock) less the portion of the Effective Time Merger Consideration that is
paid to the Effective Time Surrendering Stockholders pursuant to subsection
(b) above.

 

 

(d) Promptly (and in no event more than three (3) business days) after the
Effective Time, Parent shall mail to each holder of record of a Certificate,
except for the Effective Time Surrendering Stockholders, (i) a notice of
the effectiveness of the Merger, (ii) a form letter of transmittal, in a
form reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Company, which shall specify
that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the
Agent, and (iii) instructions for use in surrendering such Certificates and
receiving the Effective Time Per Share Merger Consideration in
respect thereof. After the Effective Time, each such holder of Company
Common Stock shall surrender the Certificate or Certificates representing
shares of Company Common Stock owned by such Stockholder to the Agent.
Within three (3) business days (with respect to the cash portion of the
Effective Time Merger Consideration) and five (5) business days (with respect
to the stock portion of the Effective Time Merger Consideration) after such
surrender of shares of Company Common Stock, together with a duly executed
and completed transmittal letter, and such other documents as may reasonably
be requested by Parent, the Agent shall deliver to such Stockholder the
Effective Time Per Share Merger Consideration owed for each share surrendered
in accordance with Section 3.01 above. The Agent shall pay the cash portion
of the Effective Time Per Share Merger Consideration by check or wire
transfer in accordance with the instructions provided by the Stockholder. No
interest or dividends will be paid or accrued on the consideration payable
upon the surrender of any Certificate. The Agent shall not be obligated to
deliver the consideration to which any former holder of Company Common Stock
is entitled as a result of the Merger until such Person surrenders his, her
or its Certificate or Certificates representing the shares of Company Common
Stock for exchange as provided in this Section 3.02 or such Person provides
an appropriate affidavit regarding loss of such Certificate or Certificates
and an indemnification for loss in favor of Parent (as described below in
this Section 3.02(d)). The Certificate or Certificates representing
Company Common Stock so delivered shall be duly endorsed as Parent or the
Agent may reasonably require. If there has been a transfer of ownership
of shares of Company Common Stock represented by Certificates that is
not registered in the transfer records of the Company, then the Effective
Time Per Share Merger Consideration may be issued to a transferee if the
Certificate or Certificates representing such shares are delivered to
the Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence such transfer
and by evidence satisfactory to Parent and the Agent that any applicable
stock transfer taxes have been paid. If any Certificate shall have been
lost, stolen, mislaid or destroyed, upon receipt of (i) an affidavit of that
fact from the holder claiming such Certificate to be lost, mislaid, stolen or
destroyed, (ii) such bond, security or indemnity as Parent may reasonably
require, and (iii) any other documents necessary to evidence and effect the
bona fide exchange thereof, then the

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Agent shall deliver to such holder the consideration into which the shares
represented by such lost, stolen, mislaid or destroyed Certificate shall have
been converted.

 

 

(e) Each of the Agent, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled
to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to
this Agreement to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock such amounts,
if any, as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making
of such payment under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign
Tax Law. To the extent that any amounts are so withheld by the Agent, Parent
or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, such withheld amounts shall
be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to
the holder of the shares of Company Common Stock in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made by the Agent, Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, as the case may be.

 

 

(f) At any time following the one (1)-year anniversary of the Effective Time,
Parent shall be entitled to require the Agent to deliver to it any Effective
Time Merger Consideration that had been made available to the Agent and not
disbursed to holders of Company Common Stock (including, without limitation,
all interest and other income received by the Agent in respect of all cash
funds made available to it, free and clear of all claims, liens or interest
of any Person previously entitled thereto), and, thereafter, such holders
shall be entitled to look to Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheat
and other similar Laws) only as general creditors thereof with respect to any
consideration payable upon due surrender of the Certificates held by them.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Parent nor the Agent shall be liable
to any holder of Company Common Stock for any consideration delivered in
respect of such Company Common Stock to a public official pursuant to any
abandoned property, escheat or other similar Law.

 

 

(g) At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be
closed as to holders of Company Common Stock immediately prior to the
Effective Time and no transfer of Company Common Stock by any such holder
shall thereafter be made or recognized. Until surrendered for exchange in
accordance with the provisions of this Article 3, each Certificate
theretofore representing shares of Company Common Stock, excluding any
Dissenting Shares, shall from and after the Effective Time represent for
all purposes only the right to receive the consideration provided in Section
3.01 without interest.

 

 

(h) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Effective
Time Merger Consideration shall be adjusted to reflect fully the effect of
any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, reclassification,
redenomination, recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares
or other similar transaction with respect to the Company Common Stock, Parent
Common Stock or Parent Preferred Stock, as applicable, occurring or having a
record date or effective date between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time.

 

 

3.03 Net Working Capital Adjustments.

 

 

(a) Estimated Net Working Capital Closing Statement.

 

 

(i) At least five (5) business days but no more than ten (10) business days
prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to Parent a statement
certified by the Chief Financial Officer of the Company (the "Estimated
Closing Statement") setting forth the Company's reasonable, good
faith estimate of the Net Working Capital (the "Estimated Closing
Net Working Capital") as of the close of business on the Closing Date. Prior
to the Closing, the Company and Parent shall discuss the estimates set forth
in the Estimated Closing Statement and make revisions thereto as they may
mutually agree. The Estimated Closing Statement shall be prepared in
accordance with GAAP applied on a basis consistent with the preparation of
the Financial Statements.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7  

 

 

 

 

 

 

(ii) If the Estimated Closing Net Working Capital is less than the Target Net
Working Capital, the Effective Time Cash Consideration Amount shall be
decreased by the amount of such shortfall. The amount of any such
decrease shall be referred to as the "Estimated Shortfall Amount".

 

 

(b) Final Net Working Capital Closing Statement.

 

 

(i) Within sixty (60) calendar days following the Closing Date, the
Stockholders' Representative shall prepare and shall deliver to Parent, or
cause to be prepared and delivered to Parent, a statement (the
"Final Closing Statement"), setting forth the Stockholders'
Representative's determination of Net Working Capital as of the close of
business on the Closing Date. The Final Closing Statement shall be prepared
in accordance with GAAP applied on a basis consistent with the preparation of
the Financial Statements.

 

 

(ii) Following receipt of the Final Closing Statement, Parent will be
afforded a period of thirty (30) calendar days (the "30-Day Period") to
review the Final Closing Statement. At or before the end of the 30-Day
Period, Parent will either (i) accept the Final Closing Statement, and the
computation of Net Working Capital, in its entirety or (ii) deliver to
the Stockholders' Representative a written notice (the "Objection Notice")
containing a detailed written explanation of those items in the Final Closing
Statement which Parent disputes, in which case the items specifically
identified by Parent shall be deemed to be in dispute. The failure by Parent
to deliver the Objection Notice within the 30-Day Period shall constitute
Parent's acceptance of the Final Closing Statement and the computation of Net
Working Capital as of the close of business on the Closing Date. If Parent
delivers the Objection Notice in a timely manner, then, within a further
period of thirty (30) calendar days from the end of the 30-Day Period, the
parties and, if desired, their accountants will attempt to resolve in
good faith any disputed items and reach a written agreement (the
"Settlement Agreement") with respect thereto. Failing such resolution, the
unresolved disputed items will be referred for final binding resolution to a
mutually agreeable nationally recognized accounting firm with whom neither
Parent nor any Company Entity nor any of their respective Affiliates has had
a relationship during the eighteen (18)-month period prior to the date
hereof, which such firm will be mutually agreed upon prior to the Closing, or
such other Persons as the parties may mutually agree (the
"Accounting Arbitrator"), the fees and expenses of which shall be shared
equally between Parent, on the one hand, and the
Stockholders' Representative, on the other hand. The Accounting Arbitrator
shall be given reasonable access to all relevant records to calculate the Net
Working Capital as of the close of business on the Closing Date. Such
determination by the Accounting Arbitrator (the
"Accountant's Determination") shall be (i) in writing, (ii) furnished to the
parties as soon as practicable after the items in dispute have been referred
to the Accounting Arbitrator, (iii) made in accordance with GAAP applied on a
basis consistent with the preparation of the Financial Statements, and (iv)
nonappealable and incontestable by the parties hereto and each of their
respective Affiliates and successors and assigns and not subject to
collateral attack for any reason other than manifest error or fraud. As used
herein "Final Closing Net Working Capital" means the Net Working Capital
as finally determined in accordance with this Section 3.03(b)(ii).

 

 

(iii) For purposes of this Agreement, the "Final Determination Date"
shall mean the earliest to occur of (w) the thirty-first (31st) day following
the receipt by Parent of the Final Closing Statement if Parent shall have
failed to deliver the Objection Notice to the Stockholders' Representative
within the 30-Day Period, (x) the date on which either Parent or the
Stockholders' Representative gives the other a written notice to the effect
that such party has no objection to the other party's determination of the
Final Closing Statement, (y) the date on which Parent and the Stockholders'
Representative execute and deliver a Settlement Agreement and (z) the date as
of which Parent and the Stockholders' Representative shall have received the
Accountant's Determination.

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8  

 

 

 

 

 


 

(c) Post-Effective Time Working Capital Adjustment.

 

 

(i) If the Effective Time Cash Consideration Amount is reduced at the Closing
due to the Estimated Closing Net Working Capital being less than the Target
Net Working Capital and the Final Closing Net Working Capital is greater
than the Estimated Closing Net Working Capital and equal to or greater than
the Target Net Working Capital, then additional payment of the Estimated
Shortfall Amount shall, within three (3) business days after the Final
Determination Date, be paid by Parent to the Stockholders by Parent paying
each Stockholder via wire transfer of immediately available funds an amount
equal to the Estimated Shortfall Amount multiplied by such
Stockholder's Ownership Percentage.

 

 

(ii) If the Effective Time Cash Consideration Amount is reduced at the
Closing due to the Estimated Closing Net Working Capital being less than the
Target Net Working Capital and the Final Closing Net Working Capital is
greater than the Estimated Closing Net Working Capital but less than
the Target Net Working Capital, then additional payment of the difference
between the Estimated Closing Net Working Capital and the Final Closing Net
Working Capital (the "Adjusted Shortfall Amount") shall, within three (3)
business days after the Final Determination Date, be paid by Parent to the
Stockholders by Parent paying each Stockholder via wire transfer of
immediately available funds an amount equal to the Adjusted Shortfall Amount
multiplied by such Stockholder's Ownership Percentage.

 

 

(iii) If the Effective Time Cash Consideration Amount is reduced at the
Closing due to the Estimated Closing Net Working Capital being less than the
Target Net Working Capital and the Final Closing Net Working Capital is less
than the Estimated Closing Net Working Capital, then additional payment of
the difference between the Estimated Closing Net Working Capital and the Final
Closing Net Working Capital (the "Additional Shortfall Amount") shall,
within three (3) business days after the Final Determination Date, be paid by
the Stockholders to Parent. Parent, in Parent's sole discretion, shall have
the right to recover the Additional Shortfall Amount directly from the
Stockholders' Representative, who shall then have the right to seek
contribution from the Stockholders for their proportionate share of such
amount, or from the Escrow Account, without any further action on the part of
the Stockholders' Representative.

 

 

(iv) If the Effective Time Cash Consideration Amount is not reduced at the
Closing due to the Estimated Closing Net Working Capital being greater than
the Target Net Working Capital and the Final Closing Net Working Capital is
less than the Target Net Working Capital, then additional payment of
the difference between the Target Closing Net Working Capital and the Final
Net Working Capital (the "Actual Shortfall Amount") shall, within three (3)
business days after the Final Determination Date, be paid by the Stockholders
to Parent. Parent, in Parent's sole discretion, shall have the right
to recover the Actual Shortfall Amount directly from the
Stockholders' Representative, who shall then have the right to seek
contribution from the Stockholders for their proportionate share of such
amount, or from the Escrow Account, without any further action on the part of
the Stockholders' Representative.

 

 

ARTICLE 4

 

 

CALCULATION AND PAYMENT OF THE EARN OUT MERGER CONSIDERATION

 

 

4.01 Earn Out Determination.

 

 

(a) If for the first full twelve (12) calendar month period following the
Effective Time (the "Earn Out Period") the EBITDA of the Acquired Business
is equal to or less than Fourteen

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Million Seven Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($14,750,000), then Parent shall
not be obligated to pay the Stockholders any Earn Out Payment.

 

 

(b) If for the Earn Out Period, the EBITDA of the Acquired Business is
greater than Fourteen Million Seven Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars
($14,750,000), then Parent shall be obligated to pay the Stockholders
additional merger consideration in an amount of the difference between the
EBITDA of the Acquired Business and Fourteen Million Seven Hundred Fifty
Thousand Dollars ($14,750,000) multiplied by eight (8) (the "Earn Out
Payment Amount"). The portion of the Earn Out Payment Amount payable to each
Stockholder shall be the Earn Out Payment Amount multiplied by
each Stockholder's Ownership Percentage (the "Per Share Earn Out Payment").
Subject to Sections 4.01(c), 4.01(d) and 4.01(e) below with regard to the
cash portion of the Earn Out Payment, the first Forty-Two Million Dollars
($42,000,000) of any Earn Out Payment Amount will be payable (i) one-half in
cash within three (3) business days after the Earn Out Determination Date,
which shall be paid by Parent to each Stockholder by wire transfer
of immediately available funds pursuant to wire transfer instructions
received from such Stockholder and (ii) one-half in Parent Preferred Stock
within five (5) business days after the Earn Out Determination Date, which
Parent shall cause to be issued a duly authorized and validly issued
certificate representing such Parent Preferred Stock and delivered to such
Stockholder to its then-current mailing address. Any Earn Out Payment Amount
exceeding Forty-Two Million Dollars ($42,000,000) shall be payable pursuant
to the above-referenced time periods in a mixture of cash and Parent
Preferred Stock to be determined in Parent's sole discretion. Notwithstanding
anything in this Section 4.01(b) to the contrary, in the event the holders of
Parent's Common Stock approve the Conversion Approval Proposal prior to the
expiration of the Earn Out Period, then the capital stock component of any
Earn Out Payment hereunder shall be paid in shares of Parent's Common Stock
and not in shares of Parent's Preferred Stock.

 

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything in Section 4.01(b) above to the contrary, the
parties acknowledge and agree that, with regard to the cash portion of the
Earn Out Payment, if any, to the extent that (i) Parent does not have
sufficient available cash on hand net of reasonable reserves for the
continued operation of the Acquired Business (which the amount of such
reserves must be mutually agreed to between the Stockholders' Representative
and Parent) together with sufficient availability under any credit facility
extended to the Parent (a "Credit Facility") to pay such cash portion in
cash, provided that Parent is not prohibited from paying such cash portion
under the terms of any existing Credit Facility and (ii) if the conditions in
(i) are not met and Parent is not able to obtain financing of such cash
portion on terms reasonably acceptable to Parent or is prohibited from
incurring such additional financing under the terms of any existing Credit
Facility, then Parent shall have the option, instead of paying such cash
portion in cash, to pay such amount by issuing (x) one or more promissory
notes in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit 4.01(c) (which in
any event shall contain subordination provisions required under the terms of
any Credit Facility) or (y) shares of Parent Preferred Stock (or Parent
Common Stock if the holders of Parent's Common Stock approve the Conversion
Approval Proposal prior to the expiration of the Earn Out Period), with the
decision to issue the notes or Parent Capital Stock to be at the sole
discretion of Parent. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement, including
this Article 4, to the contrary, the parties acknowledge and agree that
under no circumstances will Parent be required to issue Parent Capital Stock
to the Stockholders in an amount that would result in the Stockholders
collectively holding in excess of forty-nine percent (49%) of (i) Parent's
then outstanding Parent Capital Stock or (ii) Parent Capital Stock with the
power to direct the management and policies of Parent.

 

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything in Section 4.01(b) above to the contrary, the
parties acknowledge and agree that the payment of an Alliance Ambulatory Earn
Out Payment during the Earn Out Period by Parent, the Surviving Company or
any of their respective Affiliates, successors or assigns shall be accounted
for as an adjustment to the Aggregate Merger Consideration and may be used to
reduce or offset against the cash portion of the Earn Out Payment, if any,
and if no Earn Out Payment is

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

due or is to be paid in cash under the terms of this Agreement then Parent
and the Stockholders' Representative on behalf of all of the Stockholders
shall submit a joint written instruction to the Escrow Agent instructing the
Escrow Agent to disburse an amount equal to the Alliance Ambulatory Earn Out
Payment to Parent out of the Escrow Account.

 

 

(e) For purposes of determining the number of shares of Parent Preferred
Stock (or Parent Common Stock if the holders of Parent's Common Stock approve
the Conversion Approval Proposal prior to the expiration of the Earn Out
Period) to be issued in connection with any portion of the Earn Out Payment
to be paid in shares of Parent Capital Stock (the "Earn Out Share Amount"),
Parent shall divide the Earn Out Share Amount by the most recent ten (10)-day
average of the closing price of Parent's Common Stock as of the last day of
the Earn Out Period; provided, however, that in the event the most recent ten
(10)-day average of the closing price of Parent's Common Stock is less than
Eight Dollars ($8.00) per share (the "Floor Amount"), then the number of
shares of Parent Preferred Stock (or Parent Common Stock if the holders of
Parent's Common Stock approve the Conversion Approval Proposal prior to the
expiration of the Earn Out Period) to be issued shall be the
quotient obtained by dividing the Earn Out Share Amount by the Floor Amount;
provided, further, that that in the event the most recent ten (10)-day
average of the closing price of Parent's Common Stock is greater than Ten
Dollars ($10.00) per share (the "Ceiling Amount"), then the number of shares
of Parent Preferred Stock (or Parent Common Stock if the holders of Parent's
Common Stock approve the Conversion Approval Proposal prior to the expiration
of the Earn Out Period) to be issued shall be the quotient obtained by
dividing the Earn Out Share Amount by the Ceiling Amount.

 

 

4.02 Earn Out Payment Mechanics.

 

 

(a) No later than sixty (60) calendar days after the expiration of the Earn
Out Period, Parent shall prepare and deliver to the Stockholders'
Representative a certificate (the "Earn Out Payment Certificate") certified
by the Chief Financial Officer of Parent certifying the EBITDA of the
Acquired Business for the Earn Out Period. If applicable, the Earn Out
Payment Certificate will also include Parent's calculation of any additional
merger consideration payable in the form of an Earn Out Payment pursuant to
Section 4.01 above.

 

 

(b) Parent shall keep customary records with respect to its EBITDA of the
Acquired Business calculation and shall furnish any information that the
Stockholders' Representative may reasonably request from time to time to
enable the Stockholders' Representative and his legal, financial and
other professional advisors and representatives to review the EBITDA of
the Acquired Business during the Earn Out Period. The
Stockholders' Representative shall have the right at any time during or after
the Earn Out Period, upon no less than two (2) business days' prior written
notice and at its sole expense, to examine, during normal business hours, and
make copies of such records and accounts as may be relevant to determining
the EBITDA of the Acquired Business during the Earn Out Period. In the event
that the Stockholders' Representative believes that an error has been made in
the computation of the EBITDA of the Acquired Business or in the amount of
any additional merger consideration payable in the form of an Earn Out
Payment as each are reflected on the Earn Out Payment Certificate, the
Stockholders' Representative shall give written notice setting forth the
basis for such belief in reasonable detail (an "Earn Out Objection Notice")
within forty-five (45) calendar days after receipt of the Earn Out Payment
Certificate. The failure to deliver an Earn Out Objection Notice within
forty-five (45) calendar days after receipt of the Earn Out Payment
Certificate shall be deemed to constitute a final and binding agreement by
the Stockholders' Representative and the Stockholders with
Parent's computation of the EBITDA of the Acquired Business and, if
applicable, the amount of any additional merger consideration payable in the
form of an Earn Out Payment, each as set forth in the Earn Out Payment
Certificate.

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11  

 

 

 

 

 


 

(c) If the Stockholders' Representative delivers an Earn Out Objection Notice
to Parent in a timely manner, then Parent and the Stockholders'
Representative (on behalf of all of the Stockholders) shall attempt in good
faith to resolve such dispute within thirty (30) calendar days from the date
of the Earn Out Objection Notice. If Parent and the Stockholders'
Representative cannot reach agreement within such thirty (30)-day period (or
such longer period as they may mutually agree), then either party shall have
the unilateral right to request that the matter be referred to the Accounting
Arbitrator on behalf of both parties to establish independently the EBITDA of
the Acquired Business for the Earn Out Period and, if applicable, the amount
of any additional merger consideration payable in the form of an Earn Out
Payment. The Accounting Arbitrator may conduct such proceedings as it
reasonably considers being appropriate and shall, within sixty (60) calendar
days following its engagement, deliver to Parent and the Stockholders'
Representative a written report setting forth its determination of the EBITDA
of the Acquired Business for the Earn Out Period and, if applicable, the
amount of any additional merger consideration payable in the form of an Earn
Out Payment. Each party shall cooperate with and timely respond to
any requests for information from such Accounting Arbitrator.
The determination of the Accounting Arbitrator shall be conclusive and
binding upon the parties. In connection with the resolution of any dispute,
each party shall pay its own legal and accounting fees and expenses and the
fees and expenses of the Accounting Arbitrator shall be allocated equally
between Parent, on the one hand, and the Stockholders, on the other hand.

 

 

(d) For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Earn Out Determination Date"
shall mean the date on which the Earn Out Payment Certificate, including the
EBITDA of the Acquired Business amount and the Earn Out Payment Amount, if
any, set forth therein, shall be deemed to constitute a final and binding
agreement of the parties with regard to such amounts either pursuant to
Section 4.02(b) or 4.02(c) above.

 

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 4.02 to the contrary, in the
event that a Fundamental Parent Transaction occurs after the six (6)-month
anniversary of the Closing Date but prior to the expiration of the Earn Out
Period and at the time of such Fundamental Parent Transaction the EBITDA of
the Acquired Business is greater than Fourteen Million Seven Hundred Fifty
Thousand Dollars ($14,750,000), the provisions of this Section 4.02(e)
shall apply for purposes of calculating and paying any portion of the Earn
Out Payment Amount earned and payable to the Stockholders as of the effective
date of the Fundamental Parent Transaction. As soon as reasonably
practicable prior to the occurrence of a Fundamental Parent Transaction,
Parent shall prepare and deliver to the Stockholders' Representative an
interim Earn Out Payment Certificate certified by the Chief Financial Officer
of Parent certifying the EBITDA of the Acquired Business for that portion of
the Earn Out Period ending on the last day of the month preceding the month
in which the Fundamental Parent Transaction is to occur (the "Interim Earn
Out Payment Certificate"). In the event that Parent and the
Stockholders' Representative are able to mutually agree on the amount, if
any, of the portion of the Earn Out Payment Amount earned for the period set
forth in the Interim Earn Out Payment Certificate (the "Interim Earn Out
Payment Amount") prior to the closing of the transaction contemplated by
the Fundamental Parent Transaction, then Parent shall pay in connection with
the closing of the Fundamental Parent Transaction the portion of the Interim
Earn Out Payment Amount payable to each Stockholder determined by multiplying
the Interim Earn Out Payment Amount by each Stockholder's
Ownership Percentage. If for any reason whatsoever Parent and the
Stockholders' Representative are unable to mutually agree on the Interim Earn
Out Payment Amount prior to the closing of the transaction contemplated by
the Fundamental Parent Transaction, then the Interim Earn Out Payment
Certificate and the Interim Earn Out Payment Amount shall be subject to the
dispute resolution provisions set forth in Sections 4.02(b)
and 4.02(c) above. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Section
4.02(e) nor the payment of an Interim Earn Out Payment Amount to the
Stockholders shall relieve Parent or any of its successors or assigns from
the obligation to pay the Stockholders any additional earn out payment
payable for the remainder of the Earn Out Period, if any. In the event an
Interim Earn Out Payment is made pursuant to this Section 4.02(e), all of
the

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provisions of Section 4.01 above relating to (i) the payment of the Earn Out
Payment Amount in cash, Parent Capital Stock and/or Parent promissory notes,
(ii) Parent's set off right related to the payment of an Alliance Ambulatory
Earn Out Payment and (iii) the determination of the number of shares of
Parent Capital Stock to issue as part of an Earn Out Payment Amount,
including the Floor Amount and the Ceiling Amount, shall apply to any Interim
Earn Out Payment.

breach or violation of or default under any of such licenses by the Company

thereunder by the Company Entities or, to the Knowledge of the Company, any
other party to any such licenses.

 

 

(b) Each Company Entity is not currently in receipt of any notice of any
violation or infringement of, and has no reason to believe that the

severance, unemployment compensation, golden parachute, or otherwise)
becoming due to any director or any employee of any of the Company Entities
or any ERISA Affiliate from any of the Company Entities or any
ERISA Affiliate under any Benefit Plan or otherwise; (ii) increase any

8.03 Antitrust Notification; Consents of Governmental Authorities.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

38  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(a) To the extent required by the HSR Act, each of Parent and the Company
shall, within five (5) business days of the date hereof, file with the United
States Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC") and the United States Department
of Justice (the "DOJ") the notification and report form required for the
transactions contemplated hereby, shall promptly file any supplemental or
additional information which may reasonably be requested in connection
therewith pursuant to the HSR Act, and shall comply in all material respects
with the requirements of the HSR Act. Each of Parent and the Company shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to resolve objections, if any, which
may be asserted with respect to the Merger under the HSR Act, the Sherman
Act, as amended, the Clayton Act, as amended, the Federal Trade Commission
Act, as amended, and any other federal, state or foreign Law or regulation or
decree designed to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions for the purpose or
effect of monopolization or restraint of trade (collectively
"Antitrust Laws"). In the event any Litigation is threatened or instituted
challenging the Merger as violative of Antitrust Laws, each of Parent and the
Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to avoid the filing of,
or to resist or resolve, such Litigation. Each of Parent and the Company
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to take such action as may be
required by: (i) the DOJ and/or the FTC in order to resolve such objections
as either of them may have to the Merger under the Antitrust Laws, or (ii)
any federal or state court of the United States, or similar court of
competent jurisdiction in any foreign jurisdiction, in any suit brought by
any Governmental Authority or any other Person challenging the Merger as
violative of the Antitrust Laws, in order to avoid the entry of any
Order (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) which has the effect of
preventing the consummation of the Merger and to have vacated, lifted,
reversed or overturned any such Order. Commercially reasonable efforts shall
not include the willingness of Parent or Merger Sub to accept an Order
agreeing to the divestiture, or the holding separate, of any assets of Parent
or Merger Sub or any of their Subsidiaries or any assets of the
Company Entities. Parent and Merger Sub shall be entitled to direct
any proceedings or negotiations with any Governmental Authority relating to
any of the foregoing, provided that it shall afford the Company a
reasonable opportunity to participate therein. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Section 8.03, Parent or Merger Sub shall not be
required to divest any of their businesses, product lines or assets, or to
take or agree to take any other action or agree to any limitation, that
Parent deems to be not in its best interest.

 

 

(b) Parent and the Company shall cooperate with each other and use their
commercially reasonable efforts to promptly prepare and file all necessary
documentation, to effect all applications, notices, petitions and filings
(which shall include the filings pursuant to subsection (a) above), and to
obtain as promptly as practicable all Consents of all Governmental
Authorities and other Persons that are necessary or advisable to consummate
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Parent
and the Company agree that they shall consult with each other with respect to
the obtaining of all Consents of all Governmental Authorities and other
Persons necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and each of them shall keep the other apprised of the status
of matters relating to consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Each of Parent and the Company also shall promptly advise the
other upon receiving any communication from any Governmental Authority or
other Person whose Consent is required for consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement which causes such party to believe that there
is a reasonable likelihood that any requisite Consent shall not be obtained
or that the receipt of any such Consent will be materially delayed.

 

 

8.04 Agreement as to Efforts to Consummate.

 

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of Parent,
the Company and the Owner agrees to use, and to cause its Affiliates to use,
its commercially reaonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper, or
advisable under applicable Laws to consummate and make effective, as soon as
reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement, the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including using its commercially reasonable
efforts to cause to be satisfied the conditions referred to in Article 10;
provided, however, that nothing herein shall preclude any party from
exercising its rights under this Agreement. The parties agree, on or prior to
the Closing Date, to execute those documents listed in Article 10 or
otherwise referred to in this Agreement to which they are a party and to
cause their Affiliates to execute any such documents to which they are to
become a party.

 

 

(b) From and after the date hereof, the Company shall cooperate fully with
and use its commercially reasonable efforts to assist Parent with developing
and executing an appropriate transition and communications plan in order to
assure an orderly transition following the Closing, including, but not
limited to, providing access to (i) officers, employees, medical directors,
consultants, attorneys, accountants, members of joint ventures (or their
representatives), managed company owners, vendors and independent contractors
of the Company Entities; (ii) offices, pharmacies and other facilities owned
or operated by the Company Entities; and (iii) all books, records, reports,
and files, in both electronic and paper form, owned by the Company Entities.
From and after the date hereof, the parties shall cooperate in good faith to
develop and implement a mutually acceptable communications plan for notifying
certain parties associated with the Company Entities including, without
limitation, employees, patients, medical directors, independent contractors,
vendors, members of joint ventures, managed company owners, customers and
applicable governmental agencies about the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. From and after the date hereof, the Company shall also use its
commercially reasonable efforts to assist Parent and Merger Sub with
completing and filing all notices, applications and reports required to be
filed with any applicable Governmental Authority as a result of the Merger.

8.05 Confidentiality; Public Announcements. The parties hereby affirm and
ratify the terms of that certain confidentiality agreement, dated October 29,
2007 (the "Confidentiality Agreement"), among them concerning
confidentiality, public announcements and related matters, which agreement
remains valid and binding among the parties notwithstanding Section
14.08 hereof. Parent and the Company will consult with each other
before issuing, and provide each other the opportunity to review, comment
upon and concur with, and use commercially reasonable efforts to agree on,
any press release or other public statements with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger, and shall not issue any
such press release or make any such public statement prior to such
consultation, except as either party may determine is required by applicable
Law, court process or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with
any national securities exchange or stock market. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if Parent determines it is required by applicable Law to make a
public announcement, including, without limitation, with respect to any
filing with the SEC that Parent may be required to make as a result of the
execution of this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, Parent shall give the Company as much prior notice as is
reasonably practicable and shall consult with the Company about the text of
such announcement or filing but shall not be required to obtain the consent
of the Company with regard to such announcement or filing. Notwithstanding
the foregoing or anything contained within the Confidentiality Agreement, the
parties acknowledge and agree that disclosures required to be made in
connection with Parent's obtaining the Debt Financing as described in Section
8.13 below shall not be deemed to be in violation of this Agreement or the
Confidentiality Agreement.

 

 

 

8.06 Resignations and Releases. On the Closing Date, the Company shall cause
to be delivered to Parent duly signed resignations and releases in
substantially the form of Exhibit 8.06 from the members of the boards of

and Releases").

 

 

8.07 Filing the Certificate of Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions of this Agreement, the Company and Merger Sub shall execute and
file a Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware in connection with the Closing.

 

 

8.08 Notification of Changes. Each of the parties shall promptly notify the
other parties hereto orally and in writing to the extent he, she or it has
Knowledge of (i) any representation or warranty made by him, her or it in
this Agreement becoming untrue or inaccurate, (ii) the failure by him, her or
it to comply in any material respect with or satisfy in any material respect
any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by him,
her or it under this Agreement, and (iii) any change or event having, or
that could reasonably and foreseeably be expected to have, a material adverse
effect on such party or on the truth of such party\'s representations and
warranties or the ability of the conditions set forth herein to be satisfied;
provided, however, that no such notification shall affect the
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties (or
remedies with respect thereto) or the conditions to the obligations of the
parties under this Agreement.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

40  

 

 

 

 

 

 

8.09 Notice of Appraisal Rights and Stockholder Action by Written Consent in
Lieu of Meeting. Within three (3) business days after the date of
this Agreement, in accordance with the DGCL and the Company's Certificate
of Incorporation and Bylaws, the Company shall prepare and mail a notice
(the "Stockholder Notice") to every Stockholder of the Company that did not
execute the Requisite Consent Action dated as of the date hereof.
The Stockholder Notice shall (i) provide the Stockholders to whom it is sent
with notice of the actions taken in the Requisite Consent Action, including
the approval of the Merger, and (ii) notify such Stockholders of their
dissent and appraisal rights pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL. The

Common Stock as contemplated by 262(d)(2) of the DGCL. The Stockholder Notice
at the time it is mailed shall not contain any untrue statement of a material

were made, not misleading.

omissions arising out of the Company Indemnified Party's service or services
as directors, officers, employees or agents of the Company Entities occurring

reasonable efforts to obtain waivers, consents, estoppels and approvals from
other parties to material leases, encumbrances and contracts to which any

financing sources with other parties to material leases, encumbrances and
contracts. The Company hereby consents to the use of its logo and the logo of
any of the Company Entities as may be reasonably necessary in connection with
the Debt Financing; provided, however, that such logos are used solely in a
manner that is not intended to nor reasonably likely to harm or disparage any
Company Entity or the reputation or goodwill of any Company Entity and their

indebtedness of any Company Entity that is being repaid at or prior to the
Closing, payoff letters, UCC termination statements, releases and similar

8.14 Certain Tax Matters.

 

 

(a) Responsibility for Filing Tax Returns. Parent shall prepare and file (or
cause to be prepared and filed) all Tax Returns for the Company Entities
which are filed after the Closing Date. Prior to filing such Tax Returns,
Parent (i) shall deliver copies to the Stockholders' Representative, (ii)
shall allow the Stockholders' Representative a reasonable amount of time to
review and comment upon such Tax Returns and (iii) shall resolve in good
faith any reasonable comments or concerns raised by the Stockholders'
Representative.

 

 

(b) Audits and Other Proceedings. Following the Closing Date, if an audit or
other administrative or judicial proceeding is initiated by any Governmental
Authority with respect to Taxes of any of the Company Entities for which the
Stockholders would be liable pursuant to Section 12.02, Parent or the
applicable Company Entity, as the case may be, shall notify
Stockholders' Representative in writing of such audit or proceeding. Failure
to give such notice shall not relieve the Stockholders from any
indemnification obligation which they would have with respect to Section
12.02, except to the extent that the Stockholders are actually and materially
prejudiced thereby. Subject to the rights of the Stockholders'
Representative and the Stockholders as set forth herein, Parent shall control
the conduct of all stages of all audits or other administrative or judicial
proceedings with respect to Taxes of the Company Entities. Parent shall not,
and shall not permit any of its Affiliates to, accept any proposed adjustment
or enter into any settlement or agreement in compromise regarding any Taxes
of the Company Entities for which the Stockholders would have an
indemnification obligation under Section 12.02 without the express written
consent of the Stockholders' Representative (on behalf of the Stockholders).
The Stockholders' Representative (on behalf of the Stockholders) will have
the right, at its option and expense, to participate in any audit or other
administrative or judicial proceeding with representatives of its own
choosing solely to the extent that such matters pertain to Taxes of the
Company Entities for which the Stockholders would have an indemnification
obligation under Section 12.02.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

43  

 

 

 

 

 

 

(c) Cooperation on Tax Matters. The parties hereto shall cooperate fully, as
and to the extent reasonably requested by the other Party, in connection with
the filing of Tax Returns pursuant to this Section 8.14 and any audit,
litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation shall
include the retention and (upon the other Party\'s request) the provision of
records and information which are reasonably relevant to any such
audit, litigation or other proceeding and making employees available on a
mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation
of any material provided hereunder. The Company Entities and Stockholders
agree (A) to retain all books and records with respect to Tax matters
pertinent to the Company Entities relating to any taxable period beginning
before the Closing Date until the expiration of the statute of limitations
(and, to the extent notified by Parent or Stockholders, any extensions
thereof) of the respective taxable periods, and to abide by all record
retention agreements entered into with any taxing authority, and (B) to give
the other Party reasonable written notice prior to transferring, destroying
or discarding any such books and records and, if the other Party so requests,
the Company Entities or Stockholders, as the case may be, shall allow the
other Party to take possession of such books and records.

 

 

(d) Tax Sharing Agreements. All Tax sharing agreements or similar
agreements with respect to or involving the Company Entities shall be
terminated as of the Closing Date and, after the Closing Date, the Company
Entities shall not be bound thereby or have any liability thereunder.

 

 

(e) Tax-Treatment of the Merger. The parties hereto agree to treat the Merger
as a reorganization under Section 368(a)(1)(A) of the Code for all
Tax purposes. The parties agree that this Agreement constitutes a plan
of reorganization within the meaning of Section 1.368-1(c) of the
Treasury Regulations and it is contemplated and intended by the parties that
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will be non-taxable to the
Company and that the receipt of Parent Capital Stock by the Stockholders will
therefore be entitled to non-recognition treatment in accordance with Section
354 of the Code.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

44  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(f) Certain Taxes and Fees. All transfer, documentary, sales, use,
stamp, registration and other such Taxes, and all conveyance fees, recording
charges and other fees and charges (including any penalties and interest)
incurred in connection with consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement shall be paid by Stockholders when due, and Stockholders will,
at their own expense, file all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation
with respect to all such Taxes, fees and charges, and, if required by
applicable law, Parent will, and will cause its Affiliates to, join in the
execution of any such Tax Returns and other documentation.

 

 

8.15 Transition Services Agreement. The Company, the Owner and Parent agree
to negotiate in good faith the terms of a transition services agreement (the
"Transition Services Agreement") pursuant to which RAM Capital, LLC, which
the Owner represents is controlled by it, will provide on a transitional
basis services to Merger Sub that are substantially consistent with the
services historically provided by RAM Capital, LLC to the Company in exchange
for a monthly fee of Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000), payable in arrears, for
the one (1)-year period beginning on the Closing Date or for any longer
period as Parent and the Stockholders' Representative may mutually agree is
necessary for the successful transition of the Acquired Business.

 

 

8.16 Nasdaq Guidance on Certificate of Designation.

 

 

(a) Promptly after the date hereof, Parent shall submit the Certificate of
Designation to the Nasdaq National Market and shall request from the Nasdaq
National Market a determination regarding the applicability of Nasdaq
Marketplace Rule 4350(i)(1)(C)(ii) to the issuance of the Parent Preferred
Stock under this Agreement. In the event that (i) the Nasdaq National
Market determines that the terms of the Parent Preferred Stock set forth in
the Certificate of Designation must be modified in order for Parent's
issuance of the Parent Preferred Stock hereunder to not require prior Parent
stockholder approval or to otherwise comply with the Nasdaq Marketplace Rules
and (ii) such modification of the terms of the Parent Preferred Stock
materially and adversely affect the Parent Preferred Stock, then the
Stockholders' Representative shall have the right to require (A) the Company
and Parent to amend the terms of this Agreement and any other affected
Transaction Documents in order to remove all shares of Parent Preferred Stock
from the Aggregate Merger Consideration and replace each such share of Parent
Preferred Stock with a share of Parent Common Stock and (B) as a condition to
the Closing, Parent to hold a Parent Stockholder Meeting for the purpose of
seeking approval from the holders of Parent Common Stock of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement as amended by the amendment contemplated in
the preceding clause (A).

 

 

(b) If pursuant to Section 8.16(a) above the Stockholders' Representative
elects to require Parent to hold a Parent Stockholder Meeting prior to the
Closing, Parent shall prepare the Proxy Statement and shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to file the preliminary Proxy Statement with the SEC no
later than twenty (20) calendar days after such election. Parent shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to get clearance for the Proxy Statement
by the SEC as soon as is practicable following the filing of the Proxy
Statement with the SEC. Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts
to deliver at the earliest practicable date following clearance of the Proxy
Statement by the SEC to the holders of Parent Common Stock the Proxy
Statement, which Proxy Statement shall include all information required under
applicable Laws to be furnished to the holders of Parent Common Stock in

9.04 Payment of RAM Capital Fees Prior to the Closing. The parties
acknowledge and agree that in the event that (i) the Estimated Closing Net
Working Capital exceeds the Target Net Working Capital and (ii) there is
not an Assumed Indebtedness Excess Amount set forth in the Payoff Letter,
the Company Entities may immediately prior to the Closing pay any RAM Capital
Fees out of the cash of the Company Entities; provided, however, that
after taking into account the payment of any such RAM Capital Fees in
connection herewith, the Estimated Closing Net Working Capital must still
exceed or be equal to the Target Net Working Capital at the Closing and there
must not be an Assumed Indebtedness Excess Amount at the Closing. For the
avoidance of doubt, in the event that any amounts are paid prior to the
Closing pursuant to the preceding sentence and the Final Closing Net Working
Capital (taking into account

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

48  

 

 

 

any such cash payments) is less than the Target Net Working Capital, then
Parent shall remain entitled to the Actual Shortfall Amount pursuant to
Section 3.03(c)(iv) above. Furthermore, at the Closing the Stockholders'
Representative, in his capacity as the controlling member of RAM Capital,
LLC, shall cause RAM Capital, LLC to execute a waiver and release (the "RAM

as of the Closing Date and (ii) release and forever discharge each of the
Company Entities and each of their respective Affiliates, successors and
assigns from any and all liabilities, obligations, claims, demands, rights or
causes of action existing or relating to transactions or events occurring on
or prior to the Effective Time, whether known or unknown, direct or indirect,
liquidated, matured, contingent or otherwise.

all Governmental Authorities required for consummation of the Merger shall
have been obtained or made and shall be in full force and effect and all

consummated as a result of the failure to satisfy the conditions set forth in

Section 11.01(b); provided, however, that if the Stockholders'
Representative elects to require Parent to seek stockholder approval of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement prior to the Closing pursuant to

not then in breach of any representation, warranty, covenant, or other
agreement contained in this Agreement) in the event of a breach by the other
party of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in
this Agreement which breach is reasonably likely, in the opinion of the non-
breaching party, to permit such party to refuse to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement pursuant to the standards set
forth in Section 10.02 or 10.03, as applicable; provided, however, that if
such breach in the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements is
curable prior to the End Date through the exercise of commercially reasonable
efforts and the breaching party exercises such commercially reasonable
efforts to cure such breach, then the non-breaching party may not terminate
this Agreement under this Section 11.01(c) prior to the later of (i) thirty
(30) calendar days after it gives the breaching party receipt of written

or Order permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the
consummation of the Merger shall have become final and nonappealable;

transactions contemplated by this Agreement, as amended if applicable, to the
holders of Parent Common Stock in accordance with Section 8.16 above and the
holders of Parent Common Stock fail to approve the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement; or

 

 

(i) By the Company (provided that the Company is not then in breach of
any representation, warranty, covenant, or other agreement contained in
this Agreement) in the event that Parent is unable to deliver to the Company
on or before the thirtieth (30th) calendar day after the date hereof a
letter signed by CIT Healthcare, LLC stating that CIT Healthcare, LLC and
Parent have reached agreement on the terms of a credit agreement necessary
for Parent to satisfy the condition set forth in Section 10.02(i) above,
that a definitive version of such credit agreement by and between CIT
Healthcare, LLC and Parent is complete and that, conditioned upon the
consummation of the Merger, CIT Healthcare, Inc. is prepared to execute
such credit agreement and fulfill its obligations thereunder.

 

 

11.02 Effect of Termination. In the event of the termination and
abandonment of this Agreement pursuant to Section 11.01, this Agreement
shall become void and have no effect, except that (i) the provisions of
Sections 8.05 and this 11.02 and Article 14, shall survive any such
termination and abandonment, and (ii) no such termination shall relieve the
breaching party from Liability resulting from any breach by that party of

12.04 Notice and Opportunity to Defend. The party indemnified under this
Article 12 (the "Indemnified Party") shall promptly give written notice to
the indemnifying party(ies) (the "Indemnifying Party") of any matter giving
rise to an obligation to indemnify. The Indemnifying Party may assume the
defense of such matter if it acknowledges the obligation to indemnify the
Indemnified Party with respect to such claim. If the Indemnifying Party
assumes such defense it shall conduct the defense diligently with counsel
reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party; provided, however, that
the Indemnified Party, in its sole discretion and at its cost and expense,
may participate with its counsel in the conduct of such defense along side of
the Indemnifying Party. The Indemnifying Party may not settle any such claim
without the consent of the Indemnified Party, unless such settlement provides
for only monetary relief that is paid in full by or on behalf of
the Indemnifying Party and includes a full and unconditional release of
the Indemnified Parties. If the Owner or the Stockholders are
the Indemnifying Party, then the notice required by the immediately
preceding sentence shall be given to the Stockholders' Representative who
shall act on behalf of the Indemnifying Party for purposes of this
Article 12. The Indemnified Party agrees to cooperate with the Indemnifying
Party and to make reasonably available to the Indemnifying Party any
necessary records or documents in the possession of the Indemnified
Party which are necessary to defend such claim. If the Indemnifying
Party does not defend or settle such claim, the Indemnified Party may do so
without the Indemnifying Party\'s participation, in which case the
Indemnifying Party shall pay the expenses of such defense (including, without
limitation, the Indemnified Party's attorney's fees), and the Indemnified
Party may settle or compromise such claim without the Indemnifying Party\'s
consent. The failure of any Indemnified Party to give notice as provided
herein shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder
except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced by
such failure to give notice.

 

 

12.05 Indemnification Limits.

 

 

(a) The indemnification rights of the parties hereto for Losses resulting
solely from a breach of representations and warranties contained in this
Agreement under Sections 12.02(a) and 12.03(a) are subject to the condition
that the Indemnifying Party shall have received written notice of the Losses
for which indemnity is sought within eighteen (18) months after the Closing
Date; provided, however, that, the indemnification obligations resulting from
a breach of the representations and warranties made in (a) Sections 5.10,
5.11, 5.18, 5.19, 5.20, 5.21, 5.22, 5.23, 5.24, 5.25, 7.09, 7.10, 7.11, 7.12
and 7.13 shall survive until thirty (30) calendar days after the expiration
of all applicable statutes of limitations for assertions by third parties
(including, without limitation, any Governmental Authority) of claims that
would give rise to a claim for indemnification under such sections hereunder
and (b) Sections 5.01, 5.02, 5.03, 5.04, 5.05, 7.01, 7.02, 7.03, 7.05, 7.06,
and 7.07 shall survive indefinitely; provided, further, that if there is an
unresolved claim at the expiration date for any applicable period for
bringing an indemnification claim made in compliance with the terms of
this Article 12, such applicable period shall not end in respect of such
claim until such claim is resolved. In the event that the Indemnifying Party
receives actual notice of a claim, prior to the expiration of the applicable
period referenced above, such notice shall be deemed to constitute the notice
required to be given by the Indemnified Party hereunder, the same as if the
Indemnified Party had timely given notice to the Indemnifying Party
hereunder.

 

 

(b) With regard to the right of indemnification under Sections 12.01
(a), 12.02(a) and 12.03(a), the Indemnifying Party(ies) shall be obligated
to indemnify the Indemnified Party only when the aggregate of all Losses
suffered or incurred by the Indemnified Party exceeds One Million Dollars
($1,000,000) (the "Threshold Amount"). After the aggregate of all such Losses
suffered or incurred by the Indemnified Party exceeds the Threshold Amount,
the Indemnifying Party(ies) shall be obligated to indemnify the Indemnified
Party to the full extent of all such Losses exceeding to Threshold Amount,
and shall be obligated to indemnify the Indemnified Party with respect to
fifty percent (50%) of the Threshold Amount.

 

 

(c) Claims for indemnification under Section 12.02(a) shall not exceed
Twenty-Five Million Dollars ($25,000,000); provided, however, that claims for
indemnification under Section 12.02(a) with regard to a breach of any
representation or warranty set forth in Sections 5.01, 5.02, 5.03, 5.04, 5.05
or 5.06 shall not exceed (A) the Effective Time Cash Consideration Amount,
plus (B) the aggregate monetary value on the applicable date of issuance of
the sum of (i) the Effective Time Common Stock Consideration Amount plus (ii)
the Effective Time Preferred Stock Consideration Amount and plus (iii) if and
when issued, the Parent Capital Stock issued as part of the Earn Out Payment,
if any (collectively, the aggregate monetary value of (i), (ii) and (iii)
shall be referred to as the "Aggregate Stock Consideration Amount");
provided, further, that the maximum liability for claims for indemnification
with regard to a breach of any representation or warranty set forth in
Section 5.06 shall be lowered to Twenty-Five Million Dollars ($25,000,000)
thirty (30) calendar days after Parent files with the SEC its Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the calendar year ending December 31, 2008 unless Parent has
initiated an indemnification claim regarding a Section 5.06 representation
or warranty breach prior thereto, in which case the maximum liability for
such claim(s) shall remain the Effective Time Cash Consideration Amount plus
the Aggregate Stock Consideration Amount or such lesser amount as is set
forth in such indemnification claim(s) until any such claim(s) are resolved.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in the event Parent is
obligated to pay an Earn Out Payment, the above dollar thresholds shall be
increased by the amount of such Earn Out Payment, respectively. The above
limitations shall apply regardless of whether the amount of any such
indemnification claim is recovered from the Escrow Amount or directly from
the Owner. Notwithstanding the foregoing and for the avoidance of doubt, the
above limitations shall not apply to claims for indemnification under
Sections 12.01(b) and 12.02(b) through (g).

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

56  

 

 

 

 

 

 

(d) Claims for indemnification under Section 12.03(a) shall not exceed
Twenty-Five Million Dollars ($25,000,000); provided, however, that claims for
indemnification under Section 12.03(a) with regard to a breach of any
representation or warranty set forth in Sections 7.01, 7.02, 7.03, 7.04,
7.05, 7.06 or 7.07 shall not exceed the Aggregate Stock Consideration Amount.
Notwithstanding the foregoing and for the avoidance of doubt, the above
limitations shall not apply to claims for indemnification under Sections
12.03(b) and 12.03(c).

 

 

(e) For purposes of Sections 12.05(c) and 12.05(d), the aggregate monetary
value of a number of shares of Parent Capital Stock for purposes of
determining the Aggregate Stock Consideration Amount shall be determined
based on the ten (10)-day average of the closing price of Parent's Common
Stock immediately preceding the date in which the Aggregate
Stock Consideration Amount is to be determined, which for purposes of making
an indemnification claim shall be the date of payment of such indemnity
claim; provided, however, that in the event the Owner sells or otherwise
disposes of any of its shares in an arms length transaction to a third party
purchaser not affiliated with the Owner prior to the determination of the
Aggregate Stock Consideration Amount, any such transferred shares shall be
valued at the monetary value of the consideration the Owner received in
exchange for such shares for purposes of determining the Aggregate Stock
Consideration Amount for Section 12.05(c).

 

 

(f) Any payments required to be made by the Stockholders pursuant to Section
12.02 shall initially be made from the Escrow Amount in accordance with the
terms of the Escrow Agreement and if the Escrow Agreement has terminated or
the Escrow Amount is insufficient to satisfy an amount due in connection with
a claim under Section 12.02 then Parent shall seek recovery of the excess
above the Escrow Amount from the Owner. Parent, in Parent's sole discretion,
may seek payment from the Owner in connection with any payments required to
be made by the Owner pursuant to Section 12.01 either from the Escrow Amount
in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement and up to the Owner's
proportionate share of the Escrow Amount or directly from the Owner. In any
instance when the Escrow Amount is insufficient to satisfy the obligations
under this Article 12 or if the Escrow Agreement has terminated, then the
Owner shall pay to Parent in cash an amount equal to the excess of such
Losses over the Escrow Amount (subject to the limitations set forth in
subsections (b) and (c) above). Notwithstanding anything in this Article 12
to the contrary, the Owner shall have the right to pay up to fifty-five
percent (55%) of any Loss in excess of the Escrow Amount in Parent Capital
Stock, with the monetary value of such Parent Capital Stock being determined
based on the ten (10)-day average of the closing price of Parent's Common
Stock at the time of payment of the indemnity claim.

 

 

(g) No Indemnifying Party shall have any liability under this Article 12 for
any Claim by an Indemnified Party alleging special, exemplary, punitive
or consequential damages suffered by such Indemnified Party unless claimed by
a third party in a matter covered by this Article 12.

 

 

(h) Notwithstanding anything in this Article 12,
including Section 12.05(a), to the contrary, in the event of any Fundamental
Parent Transaction the indemnification rights set forth in this Article 12
shall terminate upon the later to occur of (i) the consummation of any
Fundamental Parent Transaction or (ii) the expiration of the thirty (30)-day
period following end of the Earn Out Period.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

57  

 

 

 

 

 

 

12.06 Survival; Insurance. The representations and warranties of the
parties contained in this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents or in
any document or instrument delivered in connection therewith shall survive
the Closing for the period of time set forth in Section 12.05(a) above and
shall not be extinguished thereby notwithstanding any investigation or other
examination by any party. Any indemnified Loss shall be reduced by the amount
of any insurance proceeds actually received from insurance maintained by the
Indemnified Party, which shall nevertheless be applied against the amounts
described in Section 12.05 above. The limitations contained in this Article
12 shall not apply to fraud or intentional misrepresentation.

 

 

12.07 Adjustment to Earn Out. Any payment of an indemnification claim
hereunder shall be accounted for as an adjustment to the Aggregate Merger
Consideration and may be used to reduce or offset against the Earn Out
Payment, if any, as appropriate, provided Parent has given written
declaration and articulated in writing a good faith and rational basis for
the amount of Loss asserted. The foregoing shall not relieve the Owner or
the Stockholders of any indemnification obligation hereunder if the amount of
Loss or unpaid Earn Out Payment is not yet determined, or otherwise not due,
or is insufficient to cover an amount due to the Indemnified Party.

 

 

12.08 Exclusive Remedy. The indemnification provided in this Article 12 shall
be the sole and exclusive remedy after the Closing Date for damages available
to the parties to this Agreement for breach of any of the terms,
conditions, representations or warranties contained herein or any right,
claim or action arising from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
provided, however, this exclusive remedy for damages does not preclude (i) a
party from bringing an action for specific performance or other equitable
remedy to require a party to perform its obligations under this Agreement or
any of the Transaction Documents, (ii) a party from pursuing remedies under
applicable Law for fraud or intentional misrepresentation or (iii) any
Stockholder from joining in a class action suit arising out of an Exchange
Act Section 10(b)-5 claim or similar claim brought against Parent by any
holder of Parent Capital Stock.

Representative to take the actions contemplated by the Transaction Documents
