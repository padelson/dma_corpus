Exhibit 10.1

 

Voting Agreement and Irrevocable Proxy

 

This Voting Agreement and Irrevocable Proxy, dated as of April 3, 2019 (this
"Agreement"), is made by and among Glacier Bancorp, Inc. ("GBCI"), Glacier
Bank, a wholly owned subsidiary of GBCI ("Glacier Bank"), Heritage Bancorp
("HB"), Heritage Bank of Nevada, a wholly owned subsidiary of HB
("Heritage Bank"), and the undersigned, each of whom is a shareholder of HB
(each, a "Shareholder"). This Agreement is effective upon the signing of the
Merger Agreement (as defined below).

 

Recital

As an inducement for GBCI, Glacier Bank, HB, and Heritage Bank to enter into
the Plan and Agreement of Merger, dated April 3, 2019 (the "Merger
Agreement"), under which, among other things, HB will merge with and into GBCI
(the "Merger"), and Heritage Bank will merge with and into Glacier Bank, each
Shareholder agrees as follows:

Agreement 



   1. |

Voting of Shares. Each Shareholder irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to
vote or cause to be voted (including by proxy or written consent, if
applicable) at any shareholder meeting of HB, or any adjournment or
postponement thereof, including any meeting called for the purpose of
approving the Merger Agreement (a "HB Meeting"), all shares of HB common
stock that such Shareholder owns of record or beneficially, or acquires after
the date hereof but prior to the record date, in either case with power to
vote or direct the voting of such shares (collectively, the "Owned Shares"),
(a) in favor of (i) approval of the Merger Agreement and the transactions
contemplated therein, including the Merger, and (ii) any proposal to adjourn
or postpone such meeting to a later date if there are not sufficient votes to
approve the Merger Agreement, and (b) against any action, proposal,
transaction, or agreement that would reasonably be likely to (i) result in a
breach of any covenant, representation, or warranty or any other obligation
or agreement of HB contained in the Merger Agreement, or of the Shareholder
contained in this Agreement, or (ii) materially prevent, impede, interfere
with, delay, or frustrate the purposes of or materially and adversely affect
the completion of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement,
including the Merger. For the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing commitments
apply to any Owned Shares held by any trust, limited partnership, limited
liability company, corporation, or other entity holding shares of HB common
stock for which the Shareholder serves in any partner, member, shareholder, or
trustee capacity. To the extent the Shareholder does not control, by himself
or herself, the determinations of such shareholder entity, the Shareholder
agrees to exercise all voting or other determination rights the Shareholder
has in such shareholder entity to carry out the intent and purposes of the
Shareholders voting obligations under this Section 1 and as otherwise set
forth in this Agreement.

       2. |

No Solicitation. Solely in his or her capacity as a record or beneficial owner
of the Owned Shares, each Shareholder hereby agrees that during the term of
this Agreement, Shareholder shall not knowingly, and shall direct his or her
advisors and representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (a) take any of
the actions specified in Section 4.1.10 of the Merger Agreement, or (b)
participate in, directly or indirectly, a solicitation of proxies or powers of
attorney or similar rights to vote, or seek to advise or influence any person
with respect to the voting of, any shares of HB common stock in connection
with any vote or other action on any matter of a type described in Section 1
hereof, other than to recommend that shareholders of HB vote in favor of the
adoption and approval of the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, and as otherwise expressly
permitted by this Agreement. Shareholder agrees, solely in his or her capacity
as a record or beneficial owner of the Owned Shares, immediately to cease
and cause to be terminated any activities, discussions, or negotiations
conducted before the date of this Agreement with any persons other than GBCI
and Glacier Bank with respect to any possible Acquisition Proposal (as defined
in the Merger Agreement) and will take all necessary steps to inform any
investment banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant, or other
representative retained by Shareholder of the obligations undertaken by
Shareholder pursuant to this Section 2.  

---|--- 



   3. |

Ownership. On the date of this Agreement, each Shareholder represents and
warrants, severally but not jointly, that the Owned Shares set forth on such
Shareholders signature page (a) are owned of record or beneficially by the
Shareholder in the manner reflected thereon, (b) include all of the shares of
HB common stock owned of record or beneficially by the Shareholder as of the
date hereof, and (c) are free and clear of any proxy or voting restriction,
claims, liens, encumbrances, and security interests, except (if applicable) as
set forth on the Shareholders signature page, which encumbrances or other
items do not affect the ability of the Shareholder to perform his or her
obligations under this Agreement. As of the date of this Agreement, each
Shareholder has, and at any HB Meeting each Shareholder will have (except as
otherwise permitted by this Agreement), sole voting power and sole dispositive
power with respect to all of the Shareholders Owned Shares, except as
otherwise reflected on the Shareholders signature page.  

---|--- 



   4. |

Proxy. 

---|--- 



     | a. |

_Appointment of Proxy_. In order to better effect the provisions set forth in
Section 1, each Shareholder revokes any previously executed proxies and
constitutes and appoints Stanley Wilmoth with full power of substitution, such
Shareholders true and lawful proxy and attorney-in-fact (the "Proxy Holder")
to vote at any HB Meeting all of such Shareholders Owned Shares as provided
in Section 1, with such modifications to the Merger Agreement as the parties
to the Merger Agreement may make; _provided_ , _however_ , that this proxy
will not apply with respect to any vote on the Merger Agreement if the Merger
Agreement is amended so as to reduce the amount or form of consideration to
be received by the shareholders of HB or change the tax consequences of the
receipt thereof under the Merger Agreement in its present form. This
irrevocable proxy shall automatically terminate upon termination of this
Agreement _._ 

---|---|--- 
 



\- 2 -

         | b. |

_Substitute_. If for any reason the Proxy Holder becomes unable to perform his
duties as Proxy Holder under this Agreement, Shareholder appoints Robert A.
Cashell, Jr. ("Substitute") as substitute proxy to act as the Proxy Holder and
vote all of such Shareholders Owned Shares at any HB Meeting as provided in
Section 1, with such modifications to the Merger Agreement as the parties to
the Merger Agreement may make; _provided_ , _however_ , that this proxy will
not apply with respect to any vote on the Merger Agreement if the Merger
Agreement is amended so as to reduce the amount or form of consideration to
be received by the shareholders of HB or change the tax consequences of the
receipt thereof under the Merger Agreement in its present form.
Notwithstanding the above, the Proxy Holder may from time to time, in his
discretion, appoint any other substitute proxy to act as the Proxy Holder upon
prior written notice to GBCI and HB. 

---|---|--- 



   5. |

Shareholder Agreement. By signing this Agreement, each Shareholder that is a
party to that certain Right of First Refusal and Restriction on Transfer of
Shares Agreement, dated December 9, 2013, as amended by that certain First
Amendment of The Right of First Refusal and Restriction on Transfer of Shares
Agreement, effective October 19, 2017 (as amended, the "Right of First
Refusal Agreement"), confirms that the terms of the Right of First Refusal
Agreement do not apply to the Merger, and each such Shareholder agrees that,
effective upon closing of the Merger, the Right of First Refusal Agreement
terminates and will be of no further force or effect. 

---|--- 



   6. |

Acknowledgments. Each Shareholder acknowledges that GBCI and HB are relying on
this Agreement in incurring expenses in connection with the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement and that the proxy granted under this
Agreement is coupled with an interest and is irrevocable to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law. The vote of the Proxy Holder (and upon
substitution, the Substitute under Section 4.b.) will control in any conflict
between such vote of the Owned Shares and a vote by any substitute proxy
holder or the Shareholder, and HB agrees to recognize the vote of the Proxy
Holder or upon substitution, the Substitute. 

---|--- 



   7. |

No Transfer. Until the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.i.,
no Shareholder will sell, transfer, permit a lien or other encumbrance to be
created with respect to, or grant any proxy in respect of (except for proxies
solicited by the board of directors of HB in connection with the HB Meeting at
which the Merger Agreement is presented for shareholder approval) any of the
Owned Shares, unless all other parties to any such sale or other transaction
enter into an agreement in form and substance satisfactory to GBCI embodying
the benefits and rights contained in this Agreement. 

---|--- 



   8. |

Miscellaneous. 

---|--- 
 



     | a. |

_Individual Obligations_. The obligations of each of the signatories to this
Agreement are independent of one another and are not intended to be joint
obligations of the undersigned. This Agreement is intended to be enforceable
by GBCI or Glacier Bank against each Shareholder individually; _provided_ ,
_however_ , the foregoing applies solely to the Shareholder in his or her
capacity as a shareholder, and Shareholder makes no agreement or understanding
in this Agreement in Shareholders capacity as a director or officer of HB
and/or Heritage Bank (if  

---|---|--- 
 



\- 3 -

         |  Shareholder holds such office), and nothing in this Agreement:
(i) will limit or affect any actions or omissions taken by Shareholder in
Shareholders capacity as such a director or officer, including in exercising
rights under the Merger Agreement, and no such actions or omissions shall be
deemed a breach of this Agreement; or (ii) will be construed to prohibit,
limit, or restrict Shareholder from exercising Shareholders fiduciary duties
as an officer or director to HB, Heritage Bank or HBs shareholders. 
---|--- 



     | b. |

_Binding Effect_. This Agreement will inure to the benefit of, and will be
binding upon, each Shareholders heirs or legal representatives. 

---|---|--- 



     | c. |

_Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement or the application of such
provision to any person or circumstances will be held invalid or
unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, such provision or
application will be unenforceable only to the extent of such invalidity or
unenforceability, and the remainder of the provision held invalid or
unenforceable and the application of such provision to persons or
circumstances, other than the party as to which it is held invalid, and the
remainder of this Agreement, will not be affected. 

---|---|--- 
 



     | d. |

_Reformation_. If any court determines that the obligations and restrictions
set forth in this Agreement are unenforceable, then the parties request such
court to reform any unenforceable provisions to the maximum obligations or
restrictions, term, and scope, as applicable, that such court finds
enforceable. 

---|---|--- 
 



     | e. |

_Expenses_. Except as otherwise may be agreed in writing, all costs, fees, and
expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such costs, fees, and
expenses. 

---|---|--- 



     | f. |

_Amendments; Waivers_. Any provision of this Agreement may be amended or
waived if, and only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and signed (i)
in the case of an amendment, by GBCI and the Shareholder to be bound by such
amendment and (ii) in the case of a waiver, by the party against whom the
waiver is to be effective. No failure or delay by any party in exercising any
right, power, or privilege under this Agreement shall operate as a waiver
thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other
or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power, or
privilege. 

---|---|--- 



     | g. |

_Governing Law; Venue_. This Agreement will be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Montana, except to the extent that
federal law may govern certain matters. The parties must bring any legal
proceeding arising out of this Agreement in the state courts situated in
Kalispell, Montana or the federal district courts of the Missoula Division
for the State of Montana. Each party consents to and submits to the
jurisdiction of any such court. 

---|---|---

         | h. |

_Remedies_. Any breach of this Agreement entitles GBCI to injunctive relief
and/or specific performance, as well as to any other legal or equitable
remedies it may be entitled to, it being agreed that money damages alone would
be an inadequate remedy for such breach. The rights and remedies of the
parties to this Agreement are cumulative and not alternative. 

---|---|--- 



     | i. |

_Termination of Agreement_. This Agreement shall be effective from the date
hereof and shall terminate and be of no further force and effect upon the
earlier to occur of (i) the Effective Time (as defined in the Merger
Agreement), (ii) such date and time as termination of the Merger Agreement in
accordance with its terms, or (iii) upon mutual written agreement of the
parties hereto to terminate this Agreement. Upon termination of this
Agreement, no party shall have any further obligations or liabilities under
this Agreement. 

---|---|--- 
 



     | j. |

_Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts,
including facsimile and/or scanned counterparts, each of which will be deemed
an original, but all of which taken together will constitute one and the same
document.
