therefor.

 



 

2.3 _Certain Adjustments_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, if, from the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, the
outstanding shares of Boat Common Stock, Island Common Stock or Island
Preferred Stock shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a
different class by reason of any reclassification, stock split (including a
reverse stock split), recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of
shares, readjustment, or other similar transaction, or a stock dividend or
stock distribution thereon shall be declared with a record date within said
period, the applicable Island Merger Consideration, the Island Exchange Ratio
and the Boat Exchange Ratio and the Boat Merger Consideration and any other
similarly dependent items, as the case may be, shall be equitably adjusted to
provide the holders of Island Common Stock, Island Preferred Stock or Boat
Common Stock, as applicable, the same economic effect as contemplated by this
Agreement prior to such event.

 



 

2.4 _Fractional Shares_.

 



 

(a) No fractional shares of Holdco Common Stock or shall be issued in the
Mergers, but in lieu thereof each holder of Island Common Stock, Island
Preferred Stock or Boat Common Stock otherwise entitled to a fractional share
of Holdco Common Stock will be entitled to receive, from the Exchange Agent in
accordance with the provisions of this _Section 2.4_, a cash payment in lieu
of such fractional share of Holdco Common Stock representing such holders
proportionate interest, if any, in the proceeds from the sale by the Exchange
Agent (reduced by any fees of the Exchange Agent attributable to such sale) in
one or more transactions of shares of Holdco Common Stock equal to the excess
of (A) the aggregate number of shares of Holdco Common Stock to be delivered
to the Exchange Agent by Holdco pursuant to _Section 2.5(a)_ over (B) the
aggregate number of whole shares of Holdco Common Stock to be

 



      
 

 



 

distributed to the holders of shares of Island Common Stock, Island Preferred
Stock or Boat Common Stock pursuant to _Section 2.5(b)_ (such excess, the "
_Excess Shares_ "). Island, Boat and Holdco acknowledge that payment of the
cash consideration in lieu of issuing fractional shares of Holdco Common Stock
was not separately bargained-for consideration but merely represents a
mechanical rounding off for purposes of avoiding the expense and inconvenience
to Holdco that would otherwise be caused by the issuance of fractional shares
of Holdco Common Stock. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, the
Exchange Agent, as agent for the holders of Island Common Stock, Island
Preferred Stock and Boat Common Stock that would otherwise receive fractional
shares of Holdco Common Stock, shall sell the Excess Shares at then prevailing
prices on the NASDAQ in the manner provided in the following paragraph.

 



 

(b) The sale of the Excess Shares by the Exchange Agent, as agent for the
holders of Island Common Stock, Island Preferred Stock and Boat Common Stock
that would otherwise receive fractional shares of Holdco Common Stock, shall
be executed on the NASDAQ and shall be executed in round lots to the extent
practicable. Until the proceeds of such sale or sales have been distributed to
the holders of Island Common Stock, Island Preferred Stock and Boat Common
Stock, the Exchange Agent shall hold such proceeds in trust for the holders of
Island Common Stock, Island Preferred Stock and Boat Common Stock that would
otherwise receive fractional shares of Holdco Common Stock (the " _Common
Shares Trust_ "). The Exchange Agent shall determine the portion of the Common
Shares Trust to which each holder of Island Common Stock, Island Preferred
Stock or Boat Common Stock shall be entitled, if any, by multiplying the
amount of the aggregate proceeds comprising the Common Shares Trust by a
fraction, the numerator of which is the amount of the fractional share
interest to which such holder of Island Common Stock, Island Preferred Stock
or Boat Common Stock would otherwise be entitled and the denominator of which
is the aggregate amount of fractional share interests to which all holders of
Island Common Stock, Island Preferred Stock and Boat Common Stock would
otherwise be entitled (the " _Fractional Shares Cash Amount_ ").

 



 

(c) As soon as practicable after the determination of the amount of cash, if
any, to be paid to holders of Island Common Stock in lieu of any fractional
shares of Holdco Common Stock, the Exchange Agent shall make available such
amounts to such holders of shares of Island Common Stock without interest,
subject to and in accordance with _Section 2.5_.

 



 

2.5 _Exchange of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares_.

 



 

(a) Prior to the dissemination of the Joint Proxy Statement to the
stockholders of Island and the stockholders of Boat, Boat and Island shall
appoint a nationally recognized financial institution or trust company to act
as exchange agent (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") for the payment and delivery of
the Island Merger Consideration and the Boat Merger Consideration. At or prior
to the Effective Time, Holdco shall (and Boat and Island shall cause Holdco
to) deposit, in trust for the benefit of the holders of Island Common Stock,
the holders of Island Preferred Stock and the holders of Boat Common Stock,
with the Exchange Agent for exchange in accordance with this _Article 2_, a
number of shares of Holdco Common Stock equal to the total shares of Holdco
Common Stock issuable pursuant to _Section 2.1_ (together with the Fractional
Shares Cash Amount, the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The Exchange Agent shall,
pursuant to irrevocable instructions, deliver the whole shares of Holdco
Common Stock contemplated to be

 



      
 

 



 

issued pursuant to _Section 2.1_, the Fractional Shares Cash Amount out of
the Exchange Fund. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose.

 



 

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time
(but in no event later than three (3) Business Days thereafter), Holdco shall
cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of an Island
Certificate, Island Book-Entry Share, Boat Certificate or Boat Book-Entry
Share, in each case which shares were converted into the right to receive the
applicable Island Merger Consideration or Boat Merger Consideration at the
Effective Time pursuant to this Agreement: (i) a letter of transmittal, which
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
the Island Certificates and Boat Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery
of the Island Certificates and Boat Certificates to the Exchange Agent, and
shall otherwise be in such form and have such other provisions as Boat, Island
and the Exchange Agent may reasonably specify, and (ii) instructions for
effecting the surrender of the Island Certificates, Island Book-Entry Shares,
Boat Certificates and Boat Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the applicable
Island Merger Consideration or Boat Merger Consideration, as applicable, and
the method of payment of such holders Fractional Shares Cash Amount. Upon
surrender of Island Certificates, Island Book-Entry Shares, Boat Certificates
or Boat Book-Entry Shares for cancellation to the Exchange Agent or to such
other agent or agents as may be appointed by Island and Boat, and upon
delivery of a letter of transmittal, duly executed and in proper form with all
required enclosures and attachments, with respect to such Island Certificates,
Island Book-Entry Shares, Boat Certificates or Boat Book-Entry Shares, the
holder of such Island Certificates, Island Book-Entry Shares, Boat
Certificates or Boat Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive the whole
shares of Holdco Common Stock that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant
to _Section 2.1_ and, if applicable, the Fractional Shares Cash Amount for
each share of Island Common Stock, Island Preferred Stock or Boat Common Stock
formerly represented by such Island Certificates or Island Book-Entry Share or
Boat Certificates or Boat Book Entry Share. Any Island Certificates, Island
Book-Entry Shares, Boat Certificates or Boat Book-Entry Shares so surrendered
shall forthwith be cancelled. If payment of the applicable Island Merger
Consideration or Boat Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other
than the Person in whose name any surrendered Island Certificate or Boat
Certificate, as applicable is registered, it shall be a condition precedent to
payment that the Island Certificate or Boat Certificate so surrendered shall
be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer, and
the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other
similar Taxes required by reason of the delivery of the applicable Island
Merger Consideration or Boat Merger Consideration, as applicable, to a Person
other than the registered holder of the Island Certificate or Boat Certificate
so surrendered and shall have established to the satisfaction of Holdco that
such Taxes either have been paid or are not required to be paid. Delivery of
the applicable Island Merger Consideration or Boat Merger Consideration, as
applicable, with respect to Island Book-Entry Shares and Boat Book-Entry
Shares shall only be made to the Person in whose name such shares are
registered. Until surrendered as contemplated hereby, each Island Certificate,
Island Book-Entry Share, Boat Certificate or Boat Book-Entry Share shall be
deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive the applicable Island Merger Consideration or Boat Merger
Considerations provided in this Agreement.

 



 

(c) _Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of
Island and Boat shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further
registration of transfers of

 



      
 

 



 

shares of Island Common Stock or Island Preferred Stock on the records of
Island or shares of Boat Common Stock on the records of Boat. From and after
the Effective Time, the holders of Island Certificates, Island Book-Entry
Shares, Boat Certificates and Boat Book-Entry Shares representing shares of
Island Common Stock, Island Preferred Stock and Boat Common Stock, as
applicable, outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to
have any rights with respect to such shares except as otherwise provided for
herein or by applicable Law. If, after the Effective Time, Island Certificates
or Boat Certificates representing shares of Island Common Stock, Island
Preferred Stock or Boat Common Stock are presented to the Island Surviving
Corporation or the Boat Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be
cancelled and exchanged for the whole shares of Holdco Common Stock that such
holder is entitled to receive pursuant to _Section 2.1_ and, if applicable,
the Fractional Shares Cash Amount as provided in this Agreement subject, in
each case, to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws.

 



 

(d) _Termination of Fund; Abandoned Property_. At any time following six
months after the Closing Date, Holdco shall be entitled to require the
Exchange Agent to deliver to it any shares of Holdco Common Stock or cash
remaining in the Exchange Fund made available to the Exchange Agent and not
delivered to holders of Island Certificates, Island Book-Entry Shares, Boat
Certificates or Boat Book-Entry Shares and thereafter such holders shall be
entitled to look only to Holdco (subject to abandoned property, escheat or
other similar Laws) only as general creditors thereof with respect to the
applicable Island Merger Consideration or Boat Merger Consideration, as
applicable, payable upon due surrender of their Island Certificates, Island
Book-Entry Shares, Boat Certificates or Boat Book-Entry Shares and compliance
with the procedures in _Section 2.5_. If, prior to six years after the
Closing Date (or otherwise immediately prior to such time on which any payment
in respect hereof would escheat to or become the property of any Governmental
Entity pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
Laws), any holder of Island Certificates, Island Book-Entry Shares, Boat
Certificates or Boat Book-Entry Shares has not complied with the procedures in
_Section 2.5_ to receive the applicable Island Merger Consideration or Boat
Merger Consideration to which such holder would otherwise be entitled, the
applicable Island Merger Consideration or Boat Merger Consideration to which
such holder would otherwise be entitled in respect of such Island
Certificates, Island Book-Entry Shares, Boat Certificates or Boat Book-Entry
Shares shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property
of Holdco, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously
entitled thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Boat, the Island
Surviving Corporation, the Boat Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent,
or any Representative or affiliate thereof, shall be liable to any holder of
an Island Certificate, Island Book-Entry Shares, Boat Certificate or Boat
Book-Entry Shares for Island Merger Consideration or Boat Merger Consideration
delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Law.

 



 

(e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any Island
Certificates or Boat Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
the Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Island Certificates or Boat Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the holder thereof, the applicable Island Merger Consideration or
Boat Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to _Sections
2.1(a)(ii)_ and _2.1(b)(ii)_ ; _provided_ , _however_ , that Holdco or the
Exchange Agent may, in its reasonable discretion and as a condition precedent
to the payment of the applicable Island

 



      
 

 



 

Merger Consideration or Boat Merger Consideration, require the owners of such
lost, stolen or destroyed Island Certificates or Boat Certificates to deliver
a customary indemnity against any claim that may be made against Holdco, the
Island Surviving Corporation, the Boat Surviving Corporation or the Exchange
Agent with respect to the Island Certificates or Boat Certificates alleged to
have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

 



 

(f) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Holdco Common Stock_. No
dividends or other distributions declared or made after the Effective Time
with respect to Holdco Common Stock with a record date after the Effective
Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Island Certificate,
Island Book-Entry Share, Boat Certificate or Boat Book-Entry Share with
respect to any shares of Holdco Common Stock represented thereby, and, if
applicable, no portion of the Fractional Shares Cash Amount shall be paid to
any such holder pursuant to _Section 2.4_, unless and until the holder of
such Island Certificate, Island Book-Entry Share, Boat Certificate or Boat
Book-Entry Share shall surrender such Island Certificate, Island Book-Entry
Share, Boat Certificate or Boat Book-Entry Share in accordance with this
_Section 2.5_. Subject to the effect of escheat, Tax or other applicable
Laws, following surrender of any such Island Certificate, Island Book-Entry
Share, Boat Certificate or Boat Book-Entry Share in accordance with this
_Section 2.5,_ there shall be paid by Holdco to the holder of the
certificates representing whole shares of Holdco Common Stock issued in
exchange therefor, without interest, (i) promptly, the portion of the
Fractional Shares Cash Amount, if applicable, payable with respect to a
fractional share of Holdco Common Stock to which such holder is entitled
pursuant to _Section 2.4_ and the amount of dividends or other distributions
with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to
such whole shares of Holdco Common Stock and (ii) at the appropriate payment
date, the amount of dividends or other distributions, with a record date after
the Effective Time but prior to surrender and a payment date occurring after
surrender, payable with respect to such whole shares of Holdco Common Stock.

the Joint Proxy Statement promptly after receipt of such comments, and any
written or oral responses thereto. Each party and their respective counsel
shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review any such written responses

changes suggested thereto by the other party and their respective counsel.

Stockholders Meeting; (D) to allow reasonable additional time to solicit
additional proxies, if and to the extent the requisite Island Stockholder

to _Section 5.4_) and use its reasonable best efforts to (A) solicit from its
stockholders proxies in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and the
Transactions, including the Mergers, and (B) take all other action necessary
or advisable to secure the Island Stockholder Approval. Except as expressly
permitted in _Section 5.4(b)_ and _Section_

and (z) being referred to as a " _Boat Adverse Recommendation Change_ ").

 



 

(iii) Notwithstanding any Boat Adverse Recommendation Change, unless this

the generality of the foregoing, unless this Agreement is terminated in

5.4 _No Solicitation of Transactions_.

 



 

(a) Each of Island and Boat shall immediately cease, and shall cause its
respective Subsidiaries and Representatives to immediately cease, any
discussions or negotiations with any Person that may be ongoing with respect
to a Competing Proposal, or any proposal that would reasonably be expected to
lead to a Competing Proposal, and shall request to have returned promptly to
Island or Boat, as applicable, any confidential information that has been
provided in any such discussions or negotiations. From the date hereof until
the earlier of the Effective Time or the date of termination of this Agreement
in accordance with _Article 7_, each of Island and Boat shall not, and shall
cause its respective Subsidiaries and Representatives not to, directly or
indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage or induce (including
by way of furnishing information), or take any other action designed to
facilitate, any inquiries or the making of any proposal which constitutes, or
would reasonably be expected to lead to, any Competing Proposal, or (ii)
engage in any discussions or negotiations regarding any Competing Proposal;
_provided_ , _however_ , that (x) such party may ascertain facts from the
Person making an unsolicited Competing Proposal for the sole purpose of the
Island Board or the Boat Board, as applicable, informing itself about the
terms of such Competing Proposal and the Person that made it and (y) if, prior
to obtaining the Island Stockholder Approval (in the case of Island) or the
Boat Stockholder Approval (in the case of Boat) and following the receipt of a
bona fide written Competing Proposal made after the date hereof that the
Island Board or Boat Board, as applicable, determines in good faith (after
receiving advice of its financial advisor and of its outside legal counsel) is
or would reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal and that was
not, directly or indirectly, solicited, initiated or knowingly encouraged in
violation of this _Section 5.4_, the Island Board or the Boat Board, as
applicable, determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal
counsel, that a failure to take action with respect to such Competing
Proposal, as applicable, would constitute a breach of its fiduciary duties
under applicable Law, Island or Boat may, in response to such Competing
Proposal, as applicable, and subject to compliance with _Section 5.4(c)_, (A)
furnish information with respect to Island or Boat, as applicable, to the
Person making such Competing Proposal pursuant to an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement, and (B) engage in discussions or negotiations with
such Person regarding such Competing Proposal. Except as expressly permitted
by this _Section 5.4_, each of Boat and Island shall not, and shall cause
their respective Subsidiaries and Representatives not to, from and after the
date of this Agreement until the earlier of the Effective Time or the date, if
any, on which this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Article 7_, directly
or indirectly (1) approve, endorse, recommend or enter into, or publicly
propose to approve, endorse, recommend or enter into, any letter of intent,
memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement,
merger agreement or similar definitive agreement (other than an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement) with respect to any Competing Proposal; (2) take
any action to make the provisions of any takeover statute inapplicable to any
transactions contemplated by a Competing Proposal; or (3) terminate, amend,
release, modify or knowingly fail to enforce any provision of, or grant any
permission, waiver or request under, any standstill, confidentiality or
similar agreement entered into by the applicable party in respect of or in
contemplation of a Competing Proposal (other than to the extent the Boat Board
or the Island Board, as applicable, determines in good faith after
consultation with its outside legal counsel, that failure to take any of such
actions under clause (3) would be constitute a breach of its fiduciary duties
under applicable Law), or (4) propose to do any of the foregoing. For the

 



      
 

 



 

avoidance of doubt, nothing in this _Section 5.4(a)_ shall relieve any party
from its obligations under _Section 5.6_.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, including _Section
5.3_ but subject to compliance with this _Section 5.4_, prior to receipt of
the Island Stockholder Approval, the Island Board may, or, prior to receipt of
the Boat Stockholder Approval, the Boat Board may, in response to any bona
fide written Competing Proposal that was not, directly or indirectly,
solicited, initiated or knowingly encouraged in violation of this _Section
5.4_, effect an Island Adverse Recommendation Change or a Boat Adverse
Recommendation Change, as applicable, if and only if (i) the Island Board or
the Boat Board, as applicable, concludes in good faith, after consultation
with Islands or Boats outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel,
that such Competing Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal; (ii) the Boat
Board or the Island Board, as applicable, provides the other party four (4)
Business Days prior written notice of its intention to take such action (a "
_Competing Proposal Notice_ "), which notice shall include the information
with respect to such Competing Proposal that is specified in _Section
5.4(c)_, as well as a copy of such Competing Proposal (it being agreed that
neither the delivery of such notice by a party nor any public announcement
thereof that such party determines it is required to make under applicable Law
shall constitute an Island Adverse Recommendation Change or a Boat Adverse
Recommendation Change, as applicable, unless and until such party shall have
failed at or prior to the end of the period referred to in clause (iii) below
(and, upon the occurrence of such failure, such notice and such public
announcement shall constitute an Island Adverse Recommendation Change or a
Boat Adverse Recommendation Change, as applicable) to publicly announce that
it (A) is recommending the Transactions and (B) has determined that such other
Competing Proposal (taking into account (x) any modifications or adjustments
made to the Transactions agreed to by the other party in writing and (y) any
modifications or adjustments made to such other Competing Proposal) is not a
Superior Proposal and has publicly rejected such Competing Proposal); (iii)
during the four (4) Business Days following such written notice (the "
_Negotiation Period_ "), if requested by the other party, the Board of
Directors effecting the recommendation change and its Representatives have
negotiated in good faith with the other party regarding any revisions to the
terms of the Transactions proposed by the other party in response to such
Competing Proposal; and (iv) at the end of the four (4) Business Day period
described in the foregoing clause (iii), the Island Board or Boat Board, as
applicable, concludes in good faith, after consultation with Islands or
Boats outside legal counsel and financial advisors (and taking into account
any adjustment or modification of the terms of this Agreement to which the
other party has agreed in writing to make to the terms of the Transactions),
that the Competing Proposal continues to be a Superior Proposal and, after
consultation with Islands or Boats outside legal counsel, that the failure
to make an Island Adverse Recommendation Change or Boat Adverse Recommendation
Change, as applicable, would constitute a breach of the fiduciary duties of
the Island Board or Boat Board under applicable Law. Any material amendment or
modification to any Competing Proposal shall require a new Competing Proposal
Notice and the Negotiation Period shall be extended by an additional two (2)
Business Days from the date of receipt of such new Competing Proposal Notice.

 



 

(c) In addition to the obligations of Boat and Island set forth in _Section
5.4(a)_ and _Section 5.4(b)_, Boat or Island shall promptly, and in any event
no later than 24 hours, after it receives (i) any Competing Proposal or
indication by any Person that is

 



      
 

 



 

considering making a Competing Proposal, (ii) any request for non-public
information relating to Boat or Island or their respective Subsidiaries, other
than requests for information that would not reasonably be expected to result
in a Competing Proposal, or (iii) any inquiry or request for discussions or
negotiations regarding any Competing Proposal, notify the other party orally
and in writing of any of the foregoing occurrences, the identity of the person
making such request, inquiry or Competing Proposal and a copy of such request,
inquiry or Competing Proposal (or where no such copy is available, a
reasonably detailed description of such request, inquiry or Competing
Proposal). Each party shall keep the other party reasonably informed (orally
and in writing) on a current basis (and in any event at the other partys
request and otherwise no later than 24 hours after the occurrence of any
material changes, developments, discussions or negotiations) of the status of
any request, inquiry or Competing Proposal (including the terms and conditions
thereof and of any modification thereto), and any material developments,
discussions and negotiations, including furnishing copies of any written
inquiries, material correspondence and draft documentation, and written
summaries of any material oral inquiries or discussions. Without limiting the
foregoing, each party shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) notify
the other party orally and in writing if it determines to begin providing
information or to engage in discussions or negotiations concerning a Competing
Proposal pursuant to this _Section 5.4_. Each of Boat and Island agrees that,
subject to applicable restrictions under applicable Law, it shall, prior to or
concurrent with the time it is provided to any third parties, provide to the
other party any non-public information concerning Boat or Island and their
respective Subsidiaries that Boat or Island provided to any third party in
connection with any Competing Proposal which was not previously provided to
the other party.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 5.4_ to the contrary, at any
time prior to obtaining the Boat Stockholder Approval or the Island
Stockholder Approval, the Boat Board or the Island Board, as applicable, may
make a Boat Adverse Recommendation Change or an Island Adverse Recommendation
Change, as applicable, if (i) such board determines that an Intervening Event
has occurred and is continuing and (ii) such board determines in good faith
(after consultation with outside counsel) that the failure to make a Boat
Adverse Recommendation Change or an Island Adverse Recommendation Change, as
applicable, in response to such Intervening Event would constitute a breach of
its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_ that (x) the Boat Board
or the Island Board has given the other party at least four (4) Business Days
prior written notice of its intention to take such action and specifying in
reasonable detail the circumstances related to such determination and (y)
prior to effecting a Boat Adverse Recommendation Change or an Island Adverse
Recommendation Change, the applicable party has negotiated, and has caused its
Representatives to negotiate, in good faith with the other party during such
notice period to the extent such other party wishes to negotiate, to enable
such party to revise the terms of this Agreement, such that the failure to
make a Boat Adverse Recommendation Change or an Island Adverse Recommendation
Change, as applicable, would not constitute a breach of its fiduciary duties
under applicable Law.

 



 

(e) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Boat Board or the
Island Board from (i) taking and disclosing to their stockholders, as
applicable, a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated
under the Exchange Act regarding a Company Proposal, or from issuing a "stop,
look and listen" statement pending disclosure of its position thereunder, or
(ii) making any disclosure to their stockholders regarding a Company Proposal
if the Island Board or Boat Board, as applicable, determines in good faith,
after

 



      
 

 



 

consultation with its outside counsel, that the failure to make such
disclosure would be inconsistent with its duties to stockholders under, or
would violate, applicable Law, _provided_ , that if any such disclosure
pursuant to this clause (ii) has the substantive effect of withdrawing or
adversely modifying the Boat Recommendation or the Island Recommendation, such
disclosure shall be deemed to be Boat Adverse Recommendation Change or an
Island Adverse Recommendation Change, as applicable for purposes of this
Agreement (it being understood that any "stop, look or listen" communication
that contains only the information set forth in Rule 14d-9(f) shall not be
deemed, in and of itself to be a Boat Adverse Recommendation Change or an
Island Adverse Recommendation Change).

 



 

(f) For purposes of this Agreement:

 



 

(i) " _Competing Proposal_ " shall mean, with respect to Boat or Island, as
applicable, other than the Transactions, any proposal or offer from a third
party relating to (A) a merger, reorganization, sale of assets, out license,
share exchange, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization,
dissolution, liquidation, joint venture or similar transaction involving Boat
or Island, as applicable, or any of their respective Subsidiaries; (B) the
acquisition (whether by merger, consolidation, equity investment, joint
venture, out license or otherwise) by any Person of twenty percent (20%) or
more of the consolidated assets of Boat or Island, and their respective
Subsidiaries, as determined on a book-value or fair-market-value basis; (C)
the purchase or acquisition, in any manner, directly or indirectly, by any
Person of twenty percent (20%) or more of the issued and outstanding shares of
the Boat Common Stock or the Island Common Stock, as applicable, or any other
Equity Interests in Boat or Island, as applicable, (D) any purchase,
acquisition, tender offer or exchange offer that, if consummated, would result
in any Person beneficially owning twenty percent (20%) or more of the shares
of Boat Common Stock or Island Common Stock, as applicable, or any other
Equity Interests of Boat, Island or any of their respective Subsidiaries, as
applicable, or (E) any combination of the foregoing.

 



 

(ii) " _Intervening Event_ " means any material event, development or change
in circumstances that first occurs, arises or becomes known to Boat or Island
or its respective board, as applicable, after the date of this Agreement, to
the extent that such event, development or change in circumstances was not
reasonably foreseeable as of the date of this Agreement; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in no event shall the following events, developments or
changes in circumstances constitute an Intervening Event: (1) the receipt,
existence or terms of a Competing Proposal or any matter relating thereto or
consequence thereof; (2) any change in the price, or change in trading volume,
of Boat Common Stock or Island Common Stock ( _provided_ , _however_ , that
the exception to this clause (2) shall not apply to the underlying causes
giving rise to or contributing to such change or prevent any of such
underlying causes from being taken into account in determining whether an
Intervening Event has occurred); and (3) meeting or exceeding

 



      
 

 



 

internal or analysts expectations, projections or results of operations (
_provided_ , _however_ , that the exception to this clause (3) shall not apply
to the underlying causes giving rise to or contributing to such circumstances
or prevent any of such underlying causes from being taken into account in
determining whether an Intervening Event has occurred).

 



 

(iii) " _Superior Proposal_ " means a bona fide written Competing Proposal
(except the references therein to "20%" shall be replaced by "80%") made by a
third party which was not solicited by Boat or Island or any of their
respective Representatives and which, in the good faith judgment of the Boat
Board or the Island Board, as applicable, and after consultation with its
outside financial and legal advisors, taking into account the various legal,
financial and regulatory aspects of the Competing Proposal, including the
financing terms thereof, and the third party making such Competing Proposal
(A) if accepted, is reasonably likely to be consummated, (B) if consummated,
would result in a transaction that is more favorable to Boats stockholders or
Islands stockholders, as applicable, from a financial point of view, than the
Mergers and the other Transactions contemplated hereby (after giving effect to
all adjustments or modifications to the terms thereof which may be agreed in
writing to be made by the other party (including pursuant to _Section
5.4(b)_)) and (C) if a cash transaction (in whole or in part), financing for
which is then fully committed or reasonably determined to be available.

 



 

5.5 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

 



 

(a) Upon reasonable notice, each of Boat and Island shall (and shall cause
their respective Subsidiaries and Representatives to) afford to the other
party and its Representatives reasonable access during normal business hours,
during the period prior to the Effective Time, to all its properties, books,
Contracts and records and its officers, employees and Representatives and,
during such period, each of Boat and Island shall (and shall cause its
Subsidiaries and Representatives to) furnish promptly to the other party (i) a
copy of each report, schedule, registration statement and other document
filed, published, announced or received by it during such period pursuant to
the requirements of applicable securities Laws (other than reports or
documents which such party is not permitted to disclose under applicable Law)
and (ii) consistent with its obligations under applicable Law, all other
information concerning its business, properties and personnel as the other
party may reasonably request; _provided_ , _however_ , none of Boat or Island
or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Representatives shall be required
to provide access to or disclose information where such information or access
would, in the reasonable judgment of such party, (x) breach any agreement with
any third party, (y) constitute a waiver of the attorney-client or other
privilege held by such party or (z) otherwise violate any applicable Law. In
the event any of the restrictions in clauses (x) through (z) of the foregoing
sentence shall apply, each party shall advise the other party of the subject
matter of any such information that cannot be disclosed and the parties shall
use their reasonable best efforts to make appropriate alternate disclosure
arrangements, including adopting additional specific procedures to protect the
confidentiality of sensitive material and to ensure compliance with applicable
Laws. Any such information provided pursuant to this _Section 5.5_ shall be
held in

 



      
 

 



 

confidence to the extent required by, and in accordance with, the provisions
of that certain Confidentiality Agreement, dated October 18, 2017, as such
agreement may be amended from time to time in accordance with its terms (the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ "), between Boat and Island, which Confidentiality
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.

 



 

(b) Each of the parties hereby agree that no investigation by any of the
parties or their respective Representatives or information provided, made
available or delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall affect the
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of any other party set
forth herein.

 



 

5.6 _Appropriate Action_.

 



 

(a) Island, Merger Sub A, Merger Sub B, Holdco and Boat shall use their
reasonable best efforts to take or cause to be taken all appropriate action,
and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary to consummate and make
effective the transactions contemplated under this Agreement, including using
their reasonable best efforts to obtain, or cause to be obtained, all waivers,
permits, consents, approvals, authorizations, qualifications and orders of all
Governmental Entities and parties to Contracts with Island, Boat or any of
their respective Subsidiaries that may be or become necessary for the
performance of obligations pursuant to this Agreement and the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby. The parties shall cooperate and assist
one another in good faith (i) in connection with all actions to be taken
pursuant to this _Section 5.6(a)_, including the preparation and making of
the filings referred to herein and, if requested, amending or furnishing
additional information thereunder, and (ii) in seeking, as promptly as
reasonably practicable, to obtain all such waivers, permits, consents,
approvals, authorizations, qualifications and orders. Upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, each party agrees to
make any filings required to be made pursuant to the HSR Act or other
applicable Antitrust Laws with respect to the Transactions as promptly as
reasonably practicable (and, in the case of the required Notification and
Report Forms pursuant to the HSR Act, in any event within ten (10) Business
Days after the date hereof) and to supply as promptly as reasonably
practicable to the appropriate Governmental Entities any additional
information and documentary material that may be requested by such
Governmental Entities pursuant to the HSR Act or such other applicable
Antitrust Laws. All such antitrust filings to be made shall be made in
substantial compliance with the requirements of the HSR Act and such other
applicable Antitrust Laws, as applicable.

 



 

(b) In furtherance, and without limiting the generality, of the foregoing, the
parties shall use their reasonable best efforts to cooperate with and assist
each other in good faith to (A) determine, as promptly as reasonably
practicable, which filings are required to be made pursuant to the HSR Act or
other applicable Antitrust Laws with respect to the Transactions, (B) provide
or cause to be provided as promptly as reasonably practicable to the other
party all necessary information and assistance as any Governmental Entity may
from time to time require of such party in connection with obtaining the
relevant waivers, permits, consents, approvals, authorizations,
qualifications, Orders or expiration of waiting periods in relation to such
filings or in connection with any other review or investigation of the
Transactions by a Governmental Entity pursuant to the HSR Act or other
applicable Antitrust Laws and (C) provide or cause to be provided as promptly
as reasonably practicable all assistance and cooperation to allow the other
party to prepare and submit any such filings or

 



      
 

 



 

submissions required to be submitted under the HSR Act or other applicable
Antitrust Laws, including providing to the other party any information that
the other party may from time to time require for the purpose of any filing
with, notification to, application with, or request for further information
made by, any Governmental Entity in respect of any such filing. To the extent
permitted by applicable Law and not prohibited by any Governmental Entity,
each party shall (A) keep the other apprised of the content and status of any
communications with, and communications from, any Governmental Entity with
respect to the Transactions, including promptly notifying the other party of
any communication it receives from any Governmental Entity relating to any
review or investigation of the Transactions under the HSR Act or other
applicable Antitrust Laws, and (B) provide advance notice of and permit
representatives of the other party to be present and participate at each
meeting or teleconference relating to any review or investigation of the
Transactions under the HSR Act or other applicable Antitrust Laws; _provided,
further,_ that each party shall be consulted in advance in connection with any
argument, opinion or proposal to be made or submitted to any Governmental
Entity in such meetings or teleconferences. To the extent permitted by
applicable Law, the parties shall, and shall use their reasonable best efforts
to cause their respective affiliates to use their reasonable best efforts to,
provide each other with copies of all correspondence, filings or
communications between them or any of their respective Representatives, on the
one hand, and any Governmental Entity or members of its staff, on the other
hand, with respect to this Agreement and the Transactions; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that materials may be redacted (1) to remove references concerning
the valuation of Boat and its Subsidiaries or Island, as applicable; (2) as
necessary to comply with any Contract or Laws; and (3) as necessary to address
reasonable attorney-client or other privilege or confidentiality concerns.

 



 

(c) Subject to the penultimate sentence of this _Section 5.6(c)_, Island and
Boat shall, and shall cause each of their respective Subsidiaries to, take any
and all steps necessary to obtain approval of the consummation of the
Transactions by any antitrust or competition Governmental Entity, including
taking all steps necessary to avoid or eliminate each and every legal
impediment under any applicable Antitrust Law that may be asserted by any
antitrust or competition Governmental Entity so as to enable the parties
hereto to close the Transactions as promptly as reasonably practicable, and in
any event prior to the Outside Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any
other provision of this Agreement, nothing in this _Section 5.6_ shall
require Boat nor any of its Subsidiaries and affiliates nor Island nor any of
its Subsidiaries and affiliates to agree to any sale, transfer, license,
separate holding, divestiture or other disposition of, or to any prohibition
of or any limitation on the acquisition, ownership, operation, effective
control or exercise of full rights of ownership, or other modification of
rights in respect of, any material business, product line or asset, or
otherwise modify any material business practice or contractual relationship
(each, an " _Antitrust Restraint_ "). In the event of any conflict between
subsections _(a)_ , _(b)_ or _(c)_ of this _Section 5.6_, the provisions of
this _Section 5.6(c)_ shall, with respect to the matters addressed in this
_Section 5.6(c)_, supersede the provisions of subsection _(a)_ and _(b)_ of
this _Section 5.6_.

 



 

(d) Each party shall, and shall cause its respective Subsidiaries to, respond
as promptly as reasonably practicable to any inquiries or requests for
information and documentary material received from any Governmental Entity in
connection with any antitrust or competition matters related to this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



      
 

 



 

(e) Without the prior written approval of the other party, no party shall
effect or agree to any business combination (whether structured as a merger,
business combination, tender offer, exchange offer or similar transaction) or
acquisition of any assets, licenses, rights, product lines, operations or
businesses of any person that would reasonably be expected to prevent or
materially delay consummation of the Transactions.

 



 

(f) Boat will take all actions necessary to cause Holdco, Merger Sub A and
Merger Sub B to perform their respective obligations under this Agreement and
to consummate the Mergers on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth

parties if any of the following occur after the date of this Agreement: (a)
receipt of any notice or other communication in writing from any Person
alleging that the consent or approval of such Person is or may be required in
connection with the Transactions; (b) receipt of any notice or other
communication from any Governmental Entity or the NASDAQ (or any other
securities market) in connection with the Transactions; or (c) such party
becoming aware of the occurrence of an event that could prevent or delay
beyond the Outside Date the consummation of the Transactions or that would
reasonably be expected to result in any of the conditions to the Mergers set
forth in _Article 6_ not being satisfied; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
delivery of any notice pursuant to this _Section 5.7_ shall not cure any
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in
this Agreement or otherwise limit or affect the remedies available hereunder
to the party receiving such notice. Island and Boat shall promptly provide, to
the extent not publicly available, the other party with copies of all filings
made by such party with any Governmental Entity in connection with the
Transactions.

 



 

5.8 _Public Announcements_. Each party agrees that no public release or
announcement concerning the Transactions shall be issued by any party without
the prior written consent of Boat and Island (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), except to the extent such
release or announcement may be required by applicable Law or the rules or
regulations of any applicable securities exchange or regulatory or
governmental body to which the relevant party is subject, in which case the
party required to make the release or announcement shall use its reasonable
best efforts to allow each other party reasonable time to comment on such
release or announcement in advance of such issuance. Boat and Island agree
that the press release announcing the execution and delivery of this Agreement
shall be a joint release in the form heretofore agreed by the parties.

 



 

5.9 _Director and Officer Indemnification_.

 



 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Holdco shall, and shall cause each of
the Island Surviving Corporation and the Boat Surviving Corporation to,
indemnify, defend and hold harmless, and shall advance expenses as incurred,
to the fullest extent permitted under (i) applicable Law, (ii) Islands and

and (iii) any Contract of Island or Boat in effect as of the date of this
Agreement, each present and former director and officer of Island or Boat
(each, an " _Indemnitee_ " and, collectively, the " _Indemnitees_ ") against
any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments,
settlements, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities incurred in
connection with any Proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,

 



      
 

 



 

administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to matters
existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, including in
connection with this Agreement or the Transactions.

 



 

(b) Holdco agrees that all rights to exculpation, indemnification or
advancement of expenses arising from, relating to, or otherwise in respect of,
acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time (including in
connection with this Agreement or the Transactions) now existing in favor of
an Indemnitee as provided in its certificate of incorporation, bylaws or other
organizational documents shall survive the Mergers and shall continue in full
force and effect in accordance with their terms. For a period of no less than
six (6) years from the Effective Time, Holdco shall cause each of the Island
Surviving Corporation and the Boat Surviving Corporation to, and each of the
Island Surviving Corporation and the Boat Surviving Corporation shall maintain
in effect the exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses
provisions of the organizational documents of Island and Boat, respectively,
in effect as of the date of this Agreement, and shall not amend, repeal or
otherwise modify any such provisions in any manner that would adversely affect

expenses in respect of any Proceeding pending or asserted or any claim within

if substantially equivalent insurance coverage is unavailable, the best
available coverage; _provided_ , _however_ , that Holdco shall not be required
to pay an annual premium for the DandO Insurance in excess of 300% of the last
annual premium paid by Island or Boat, as applicable, prior to the date of
this Agreement (it being understood and agreed that, in the event that the
requisite coverage is not available for an annual premium less than or equal
to 300% of such last annual premium, Holdco shall nevertheless be obligated to
provide such coverage as may be obtained for 300% of such last annual
premium). The provisions of the immediately preceding sentence shall be deemed
to have been satisfied if prepaid "tail" policies have been obtained by Island
or Boat prior to the Effective Time, which policies provide such directors and
officers with coverage for an aggregate period of six (6) years with respect
to claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or before the
Effective Time, including in respect of the Transactions.

and Holdco shall use its reasonable best efforts to have the NASDAQ Listing

the preparation and submission of the NASDAQ Listing Application. No
submission of, or amendment or supplement to, the NASDAQ Listing Application
will be made by any party without providing the other parties hereto with a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon. In addition, each party
agrees to provide the other party and its legal counsel with copies of any
written comments, and shall inform the other party of any oral comments, that
such party or its counsel may receive from time to time from NASDAQ or its
staff with respect to the NASDAQ Listing Application promptly after receipt of
such comments, and any written or oral responses thereto. Each party and their
respective counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review any such
written responses and each party shall give due consideration to the

compromise, settle, come to an arrangement regarding or agree to compromise,
settle or come to an arrangement regarding any litigation arising or resulting
from the Transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or consent to the same,
without the prior written consent of the other party (not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 



 

5.13 _Tax Matters_.

 



 

(a) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, none of Island, Boat or
Holdco shall (and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries not to) take, or
omit to take, any action that would, or could reasonably be expected to,

the Boat Surviving Corporation and the Island Surviving Corporation and their
respective Subsidiaries) to, (i) cause all waiting periods, pre-existing
condition exclusions, evidence of insurability requirements and actively-at-

Employee and his or her covered dependents, to the extent any such waiting
periods, pre-existing condition exclusions, evidence of insurability
requirements and actively-at-work requirements were waived or were
inapplicable under the comparable Island Benefit Plan or Boat Benefit Plan,
(ii) fully credit each Continuing Employee with all deductible payments, co-
payments and other out-of-pocket expenses incurred by such Continuing Employee

covered dependents for such plan year under any Pre-Closing Plan providing
medical, dental, pharmaceutical, vision or health benefits, as if such amounts
had been paid in accordance with such plan, and (iii) credit the accounts of

spending plan with any unused balance in the account of such Continuing
Employee under the applicable Island Benefit Plan or Boat Benefit Plan.

part of a party to any such waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a
written instrument executed and delivered by a duly authorized officer on
behalf of such party. No failure or delay of any party in exercising any right
or remedy hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or
partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or
discontinuance of steps to enforce such right or power, or any course of
conduct, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any

jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.

 



 

(b) Each of the parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for
itself and its property, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware or, in the event, but only in the event,
that such court shall not have jurisdiction over such action or proceeding,
the Superior Court of the State of Delaware (Complex Commercial Division) or,

Court for the District of Delaware, and any appellate court from any thereof
(such courts, the " _Chosen Courts_ "), in any Proceeding arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or for
recognition or enforcement of any judgment relating thereto, and each of the

such Proceeding except in such Chosen Courts, (ii) agrees that any claim in

by Law. Each party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to service of
process in the manner provided for notices in _Section 8.2_. Nothing in this

(c) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO

 



      
 

 



 

INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT
OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY
HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN
THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE EITHER OF SUCH WAIVERS, (II) IT
UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVERS, (III) IT
MAKES SUCH WAIVERS VOLUNTARILY, AND (IV) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO
THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS
IN THIS _SECTION 8.10(c)_.

 



 

8.11 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate counterparts,

hereto, waivers hereof or consents or notifications hereunder, to the extent
signed and delivered by facsimile or by email with scan attachment, shall be
treated in all manner and respects as an original contract and shall be
considered to have the same binding legal effects as if it were the original
signed version thereof delivered in person. At the request of any party, each
other party shall re-execute original forms thereof and deliver them to all
other parties. No party shall raise the use of facsimile or email to deliver a
signature or the fact that any signature or Contract was transmitted or
communicated by facsimile or email with scan attachment as a defense to the
formation of a legally binding contract, and each such party forever waives
any such defense.

 



 

8.13 _Specific Performance_. The parties agree that irreparable damage would
occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached.
It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction
or injunctions to prevent actual or threatened breaches of this Agreement and
to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any court of the
United States or any state or foreign jurisdiction having jurisdiction, this
being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at Law or in
equity. The parties waive, in connection with any action for specific
performance or injunctive relief, the defense of adequacy of remedies at Law
and any requirement under Law to post a bond or other security as a
prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief.

 



 

8.14 _Disclosure Schedules_. The parties acknowledge and agree that (a) the
inclusion of any items or information in the Disclosure Schedules that are not
required by this Agreement to be so included is solely for the convenience of
parties, (b) the disclosure by the parties of any matter in the Disclosure
Schedules shall not be deemed to constitute an acknowledgement by any party

Schedules lists an item or information in such a way as to make its relevance

Disclosure Schedules, (d) except as provided in clause (c) above, headings
have been inserted in the Disclosure Schedules for convenience of reference
only, (e) the Disclosure Schedules are qualified in their entirety by

 **ARTICLE VIII**

 



 

1. _Action, Suits And Proceedings Other than by or in the Right of the Corporation_. The Corporation shall indemnify each person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (other than an action by or in the right of the Corporation), by reason of the fact that he is or was, or has agreed to become, a director or officer of the Corporation, or is or was serving, or has agreed to serve, at the request of the Corporation, as a director, officer or trustee of, or in a similar capacity with, another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise (including any employee benefit plan) (all such persons being referred to hereafter as an " _Indemnitee_ "), or by reason of any action alleged to have been taken or omitted in such capacity, against all expenses (including attorneys fees) judgment, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him or on his behalf in connection with such action, suit or proceeding and any appeal therefrom, if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful. The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which he reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Article_ , except as set forth in _Section 6_ below, the Corporation shall not indemnify an Indemnitee seeking indemnification in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by the Indemnitee unless the initiation thereof was approved by the Board of Directors.

 



 

2. _Actions or Suits By or in the Right of the Corporation_. The Corporation shall indemnify any Indemnitee who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that he is or was, or has agreed to become, a director or officer of the Corporation, or is or was serving, or has agreed to serve, at the request of the Corporation, as a director, officer or trustee of, or in a similar capacity with, another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise (including any employee benefit plan), or by reason of any action alleged to have been taken or omitted in such capacity, against all expenses (including attorneys fees) and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him or on his behalf in connection with such action, suit or proceeding and any appeal therefrom, if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests

      
 

 



 

of the Corporation, except that no indemnification shall be made in respect of
any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to
be liable to the Corporation unless and only to the extent that the Court of
Chancery of Delaware or the court in which such action or suit was brought
shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of such
liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is
fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses (including
attorneys fees) which the Court of Chancery of Delaware or such other court
shall deem proper.

 



 

3. _Indemnification For Expenses Of Successful Party_. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this _Article_ , to the extent that an Indemnitee has been successful, on the merits or otherwise, in defense of any action, suit or proceeding referred to in _Sections 1_ and _2_ of this _Article_ , or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, or on appeal from any such action, suit or proceeding, he shall be indemnified against all expenses (including attorneys fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him or on his behalf in connection therewith. Without limiting the foregoing, if any action, suit or proceeding is disposed of, on the merits or otherwise (including a disposition without prejudice), without (i) the disposition being adverse to the Indemnitee, (ii) an adjudication that the Indemnitee was liable to the Corporation, (iii) a plea of guilty or nolo contendere by the Indemnitee, (iv) an adjudication that the Indemnitee did not act in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and (v) with respect to any criminal proceeding, an adjudication that the Indemnitee had reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful, the Indemnitee shall be considered for the purposes hereof to have been wholly successful with respect thereto.

 



 

4. _Notification and Defense of Claim_. As a condition precedent to his right to be indemnified, the Indemnitee must notify the Corporation in writing as soon as practicable of any action, suit, proceeding or investigation involving him for which indemnity will or could be sought. With respect to any action, suit, proceeding or investigation of which the Corporation is so notified, the Corporation will be entitled to participate therein at its own expense and/or to assume the defense thereof at its own expense, with legal counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnitee. After notice from the Corporation to the Indemnitee of its election so to assume such defense, the Corporation shall not be liable to the Indemnitee for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnitee in connection with such claim, other than as provided below in this _Section 4_. The Indemnitee shall have the right to employ his own counsel in connection with such claim, but the fees and expenses of such counsel incurred after notice from the Corporation of its assumption of the defense thereof shall be at the expense of the Indemnitee unless (i) the employment of counsel by the Indemnitee has been authorized by the Corporation, (ii) counsel to the Indemnitee shall have reasonably concluded that there may be a conflict of interest or position on any significant issue between the Corporation and the Indemnitee in the conduct of the defense of such action or (iii) the Corporation shall not in fact have employed counsel to assume the defense of such action, in each of which cases the fees and expenses of counsel for the Indemnitee shall be at the expense of the Corporation, except as otherwise expressly provided by this _Article_. The Corporation shall not be entitled, without the consent of the Indemnitee, to assume the defense of any claim brought by or in the right of the Corporation or as to which counsel for the Indemnitee shall have reasonably made the conclusion provided for in clause (ii) above.

      
 

 



 

5. _Advance of Expenses_. Subject to the provisions of _Section 6_ below, in the event that the Corporation does not assume the defense pursuant to _Section 4_ of this _Article_ of any action, suit, proceeding or investigation of which the Corporation receives notice under this _Article_ , any expenses (including attorneys fees) incurred by an Indemnitee in defending a civil or criminal action, suit, proceeding or investigation or any appeal therefrom shall be paid by the Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such matter, provided, however, that the payment of such expense incurred by an Indemnitee in advance of the final disposition of such matter shall be made only upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the Indemnitee to repay all amounts so advanced in the event that it shall ultimately be determined that the Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation as authorized in this _Article_. Such undertaking may be accepted without reference to the financial ability of such person to make such repayment.

 



 

6. _Procedure for Indemnification_. In order to obtain indemnification or advancement of expenses pursuant to _Section 1_, _2_ , _3_ or _5_ of this _Article_ , the Indemnitee shall submit to the Corporation a written request, including in such request such documentation and information as is reasonably available to the Indemnitee and is reasonably necessary to determine whether and to what extent the Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification or advancement of expenses. Any such indemnification or advancement of expenses shall be made promptly, and in any event within 60 days after receipt by the Corporation of the written request of the Indemnitee, unless with respect to requests under _Section 1_, _2_ or _5_ the Corporation determines, by clear and convincing evidence, within such 60-day period that the Indemnitee did not meet the applicable standard of conduct set forth in _Section 1_ or _2_ , as the case may be. Such determination shall be made in each instance by (a) a majority vote of a quorum of the directors of the Corporation consisting of persons who are not at that time parties to the action, suit or proceeding in question (" _disinterested directors_ "), (b) if no such quorum is obtainable, a majority vote of a committee of two or more disinterested directors, (c) a majority vote of a quorum of the outstanding shares of stock of all classes entitled to vote for directors, voting as a single class, which quorum shall consist of stockholders who are not at that time parties to the action, suit or proceeding in question, (d) independent legal counsel (who may be regular legal counsel to the Corporation), or (e) a court of competent jurisdiction.

 



 

7. _Remedies_. The right to indemnification or advances as granted by this _Article_ shall be enforceable by the Indemnitee in any court of competent jurisdiction if the Corporation denies such request, in whole or in part, or if no disposition thereof is made within the 60-day period referred to above in _Section 6_. Unless otherwise provided by law, the burden of proving that the Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification or advanced of expenses under this _Article_ shall be on the Corporation. Neither the failure of the Corporation to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification is proper in the circumstances because the Indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct, nor an actual determination by the Corporation pursuant to _Section 6_ that the Indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that the Indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of conduct. The Indemnitees expenses (including attorneys fees) incurred in connection with successfully establishing his right to indemnification, in whole or in part, in any such proceeding shall also be indemnified by the Corporation.

 



 

8. _Subsequent Amendment_. No amendment, termination or repeal of this _Article_ or of the relevant provisions of the DGCL or any other applicable laws shall affect or diminish in any way

      
 

 



 

the rights of any Indemnitee to indemnification under the provisions hereof
with respect to any action, suit, proceeding or investigation arising out of
or relating to any actions, transactions or facts occurring prior to the final
adoption of such amendment, termination or repeal.

 



 

9. _Other Rights_. The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by this _Article_ shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which an Indemnitee seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled under any law (common or statutory), agreement or vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in his official capacity and as to action in any other capacity while holding office for the Corporation, and shall continue as to an Indemnitee who has ceased to be a director or officer, and shall inure to the benefit of the estate, heirs, executors and administrators of the Indemnitee. Nothing contained in this _Article_ shall be deemed to prohibit, and the Corporation is specifically authorized to enter into, agreements with officers and directors providing indemnification rights and procedures different from those set forth in this _Article_. In addition, the Corporation may, to the extent authorized from time to time by its Board of Directors, grant indemnification rights to other employees or agents of the Corporation or other persons serving the Corporation and such rights may be equivalent to, or greater or less than, those set forth in this _Article_.

 



 

10. _Partial Indemnification_. If an Indemnitee is entitled under any provision of this _Article_ to indemnification by the Corporation for some or a portion of the expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines or amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him or on his behalf in connection with any action, suit, proceeding or investigation and any appeal, therefrom but not, however, for the total amount thereof, the Corporation shall nevertheless indemnify the Indemnitee for the portion of such expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines or amounts paid in settlement to which the Indemnitee is entitled.

 



 

11. _Insurance_. The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance, at its expense, to protect itself and any director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation or another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise (including any employee benefit plan) against any expense, liability or loss incurred by him in any such capacity, or arising out of his status as such, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability or loss under the DGCL.

 



 

12. _Merger or Consolidation_. If the Corporation is merged into or consolidated with another corporation and the Corporation is not the surviving corporation, the surviving corporation shall assume the obligations of the Corporation under this _Article_ with respect to any action, suit, proceeding or investigation arising out of or relating to any actions, transactions or facts occurring prior to the date of such merger or consolidation.

 



 

13. _Savings Clause_. If this _Article_ or any portion hereof shall be invalidated on any ground by any court of competent jurisdiction, then the Corporation shall nevertheless indemnify each Indemnitee as to any expenses (including attorneys fees) judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal or administrative, including an action by or in the right of the Corporation, to the fullest extent permitted by any applicable portion of this _Article_ that shall not have been invalidated and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.

      
 

 



 

14. _Definitions_. Terms used herein and defined in Section 145(h) and Section 145(i) of the DGCL shall have the respective meanings assigned to such terms in such Section 145(h) and Section 145(i).

 



 

15. _Subsequent Legislation_. If the DGCL is amended after adoption of this _Article_ to expand further the indemnification permitted to Indemnitees, then the Corporation shall indemnify such persons to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL, as so amended.

(A) _Classes of Stock_. The total number of shares of stock of all classes of
capital stock that the Corporation is authorized to issue is two hundred
twenty million (220,000,000) shares. The authorized capital stock is divided
into twenty million (20,000,000) shares of preferred stock having a par value
of $0.01 per share (the " _Preferred Stock_ ") and two hundred million
(200,000,000) shares of common stock having a par value of $0.01 per share

resolutions from time to time for the issue of the Preferred Stock in one or
more series, the shares of each of which series may have such voting powers,
full or limited, or no voting powers, and such designations, preferences and
relative, participating, optional or other special rights, and qualification,
limitations or restrictions thereof, as shall be permitted under the DGCL and
as shall be stated in the resolution or resolutions providing for the issue of
such stock adopted by the Board of Directors pursuant to the authority
expressly vested in the Board of Directors hereby. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the resolution or resolutions providing for the
issuance of any series of Preferred Stock may provide that such series shall
be superior or rank equally or be junior to the Preferred Stock of any other
series to the extent permitted by law. The number of authorized shares of
Preferred Stock may be increased or decreased (but not below the number of
shares thereof then outstanding) by the affirmative vote of the holders of a
majority of the stock of the Corporation entitled to vote, irrespective of the
provisions of Section 242(b)(2) of the DGCL.

 



 

(C) _Common Stock_.

 



 

1. _General_. All shares of Common Stock shall be of one and the same class, shall be identical in all respects and shall have equal rights, powers and privileges, _provided_ , _however_ that such rights are subject to and qualified by the rights of the holders of the Preferred Stock of any series as may be designated by the Board upon any issuance of the Preferred Stock of any series.

The number of authorized shares of Common Stock may be increased or decreased (but not below the number of shares thereof

 



      
 

 



 

then outstanding) by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the
stock of the Corporation entitled to vote, irrespective of the provisions of
Section 242(b)(2) of the DGCL.

 



 

3. _Dividends_.

death, resignation or removal. Election of the directors need not be by
written ballot.

by law and subject to the rights of the holders of any class or series of
Preferred Stock to elect directors, any vacancies on the Board of Directors
for any reason, including from the death, resignation, disqualification or
removal of any director, and any newly created directorships resulting by
reason of any increase in the number of directors shall be filled exclusively
by the Board of Directors, acting by the affirmative vote of a majority of the
remaining directors then in office, even if less than a quorum, or by the sole
remaining director, and shall not be filled by stockholders. Any directors

hold office until his successor shall be elected and qualified.

 



 

(E) _Removal of Directors_. Except as otherwise required by law and subject to
the rights of the holders of any class or series of Preferred Stock then
outstanding, any director, or the entire Board of Directors, may be removed

of the holders of a majority of the voting power of all of the shares of
capital stock of the Corporation then entitled to vote generally in the
election of directors, voting as a single class.

 



 

 **ARTICLE VI**

 



 

 ** _LIMITATION OF LIABILITY AND INDEMNIFICATION._**

 



 

(A) _Limitation of Liability of Directors_. A director of the Corporation
shall not be personally liable to the Corporation or its stockholders for
monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director except for
liability (i) for any breach of the directors duty of loyalty to the
Corporation or its stockholders, (ii) for acts or omissions not in good faith
or which involve intentional misconduct or knowing

 



      
 

 



 

violation of law, (iii) under Section 174 of the DGCL, or (iv) for any
transaction from which the director derived any improper personal benefit. If
the DGCL is hereafter amended to authorize corporate action further
eliminating or limiting the personal liability of directors, then the
liability of a director shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent
permitted by the DGCL, as so amended. No repeal or modification of this
_Article VI_ shall adversely affect any right of or protection afforded to a
director prior to such repeal or modification.

 



 

(B) _Indemnification_. The Corporation shall, through the Bylaws or otherwise,
to the fullest extent permitted by Section 145 of the DGCL, indemnify each
person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any
threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative, by reason of the fact that he is or
was, or has agreed to become, a director or officer of the Corporation, or is
or was serving, or has agreed to serve, at the request of the Corporation, as
a director or officer of the Corporation, or is or was serving, or has agreed
to serve, at the request of the Corporation, as director, officer or trustee
of, or in a similar capacity with, another corporation, partnership, joint
venture, trust or other enterprise (including any employee benefit plan), or
by reason of any action alleged to have been taken or omitted in such
capacity, against all expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines
and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him or on
his behalf in connection with such action, suit or proceeding and any appeal
therefrom. Indemnification may include payment by the Corporation of expenses
in defending an action or proceeding in advance of the final disposition of
such action or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by the person
indemnified to repay such payment if it is ultimately determined that such
person is not entitled to indemnification under this _Article VI_, which
undertaking may be accepted without reference to the financial ability of such
person to make such repayment. The Corporation shall not indemnify any such
person seeking indemnification in connection with a proceeding (or part
thereof) initiated by such person unless the initiation thereof was approved
by the Board of Directors of the Corporation. The indemnification rights
provided in this _Article VI_ (i) shall not be deemed exclusive of any other
rights to which those indemnified may be entitled under any law, agreement or
vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, and (ii) shall
inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such
person. The Corporation may, to the extent authorized from time to time by its
Board of Directors, grant indemnification rights to other employees or agents
of the Corporation or to other persons serving the Corporation and such rights
may be equivalent to, or greater or less than, those set forth in this
_Article VI_. Any amendment, repeal or modification of this _Article VI_
shall not adversely affect any rights or protection existing hereunder
immediately prior to such amendment, repeal or modification.

 



      
 

 



 

 **ARTICLE VII**

 



 

 ** _STOCKHOLDER ACTION_**

 



 

(A) _Action by Written Consent_. Any action required or permitted to be taken
by the stockholders of the Corporation must be effected at a duly called
annual or special meeting of stockholders of the Corporation and may not be
effected by any consent in writing by such stockholders; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that any action required or permitted to be taken by the holders
of any series of Preferred Stock, voting separately as a series or separately
as a class with one or more other such series, may be taken without a meeting,
without prior notice and without a vote, to the extent expressly so provided
by the applicable certificate of designation for such series of Preferred
Stock.

 



 

(B) _Special Meetings_. Except as otherwise required by law and subject to the
rights of the holders of any class or series of Preferred Stock, (1) special
meetings of stockholders of the Corporation may only be called by the Board of
Directors pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority of the entire Board
of Directors, upon not less than ten (10) nor more than sixty (60) days prior
written notice, and (2) the stockholders of the Corporation shall have no
right to call a special meeting of stockholders.

 



 

 **ARTICLE VIII**

 



 

 ** _AMENDMENT OF BYLAWS_**

 



 

(A) _Amendment by the Board of Directors_. In furtherance, and not in
limitation, of the powers conferred upon it by law, the Board of Directors is
expressly authorized and empowered to amend, alter, change, adopt or repeal
the Bylaws of the Corporation; _provided_ , _however_ , that no Bylaws
hereafter adopted shall be inconsistent with the provisions of this Restated
certificate or invalidate any prior act of the directors that would have been
valid if such Bylaws had not been adopted. The Corporation may in its Bylaws
confer powers upon its Board of Directors in addition to the foregoing and in
addition to the powers and authorities expressly conferred upon the Board of
Directors by applicable law.

 



 

(B) _Amendment by Stockholders_. In addition to any requirements of the DGCL
(and notwithstanding the fact that a lesser percentage may be specified by the
DGCL), unless otherwise specified in the Bylaws, the affirmative vote of the
holders of a majority of all of the shares of capital stock of the Corporation
then outstanding and entitled to vote generally in the election of directors,
voting as a single class, shall be required for the stockholders of the
Corporation to amend, alter, change, adopt or repeal any Bylaws of the
Corporation. The holder of each share of capital stock entitled to vote
thereon shall be entitled to cast the same number of votes as the holder of
such shares is entitled to cast generally in the election of each director.

 



      
 

 



 

 **ARTICLE IX _ 

_**

 

 ** _FORUM SELECTION_**

 



 

Unless the Corporation consents in writing to the selection of an alternative
forum (an " _Alternative Forum Consent_ "), the Court of Chancery of the State
of Delaware shall be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative
action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Corporation, (ii) any action
asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer,
stockholder, employee or agent of the Corporation to the Corporation or the
Corporations stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim against the
Corporation or any director, officer, stockholder, employee or agent of the
Corporation arising out of or relating to any provision of the DGCL or this
Restated Certificate or the Corporations Bylaws, or (iv) any action asserting
a claim against the Corporation or any director, officer, stockholder,
employee or agent of the Corporation governed by the internal affairs doctrine
of the State of Delaware; _provided_ , _however_ , that, in the event that the
Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware lacks subject matter jurisdiction
over any such action or proceeding, the sole and exclusive forum for such
action or proceeding shall be another state or federal court located within
the State of Delaware, in each such case, unless the Court of Chancery (or
such other state or federal court located within the State of Delaware, as
applicable) has dismissed a prior action by the same plaintiff asserting the
same claims because such court lacked personal jurisdiction over an
indispensable party named as a defendant therein. Failure to enforce the
foregoing provisions would cause the Corporation irreparable harm and the
Corporation shall be entitled to equitable relief, including injunctive relief
and specific performance, to enforce the foregoing provisions. Any person or
entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of capital
stock of the Corporation shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to
the provisions of this _Article IX_. The existence of any prior Alternative
Forum Consent shall not act as a waiver of the Corporations ongoing consent
right as set forth above in this _Article IX_ with respect to any current or
future actions or claims.

 



 

 **ARTICLE X**

 



 

 ** _AMENDMENT OF CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION_**

of the outstanding shares entitled to vote for the election of directors shall

part of this Restated Certificate inconsistent with the intent and purpose of
