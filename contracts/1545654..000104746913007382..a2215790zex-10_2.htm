Merger Sub, Grace Pacific Corporation, a Hawaii corporation (" _Grace_ "), GPC

of Grace and, following the Holding Company Reorganization, the parent company
of Grace (" _GPC Holdings_ "), and David C. Hulihee, in his capacity as the
Shareholders Representative, pursuant to which, following the Restructuring,
GPC Holdings will be merged with and into Merger Sub, with Merger Sub
continuing as the surviving entity (the " _Merger_ ");

 



 

WHEREAS, the Shareholder will be issued shares of common stock, without par
value, of Parent (the " _Parent Common Stock_ ") pursuant to the Merger
Agreement; and

 



 

WHEREAS, as a condition to, and in consideration for, Parents and Merger
Subs willingness to enter into the Merger Agreement and to consummate the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated thereby, Parent and Merger Sub
have required that the Shareholder enter into this Agreement.

 



 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, the
parties hereto, intending to be legally bound, hereby agree as follows:

 



 

1. _Lock-Up Period_. The Shareholder covenants and agrees not to (a) offer, sell, contract to sell, sell any option or contract to purchase, purchase any option or contract to sell, pledge, hypothecate, grant any option, right or warrant to purchase, or otherwise transfer or dispose of, directly or indirectly, any of the shares of Parent Common Stock issued to the Shareholder pursuant to the Merger Agreement (all such shares, the " _Locked-Up Shares_ ") or (b) enter into any swap or other arrangement that transfers to another, in whole or in part, any of the economic consequences of ownership of any of the Locked Up Shares, whether any such transaction described in clause (a) or (b) is to be settled by delivery of Parent Common Stock, in cash or otherwise, for a period of six (6) months following the Effective Time of the Merger. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Shareholder may Transfer Locked-Up Shares to (i) a controlled Affiliate of the Shareholder, (ii) if the Shareholder is a natural person, an immediate family member or lineal descendant of the Shareholder or (iii) if the Shareholder is a natural person, any trust created for the benefit of any person specified in clause (ii) or other estate planning vehicle (each, a " _Permitted Transferee_ ") if, and only if, in each case, the Permitted

      
 

 



 

Transferee agrees in writing to be bound by the provisions of this Agreement
to the same extent as the Shareholder.

 



 

2. _Legend; Stop Transfer Instructions_.

 



 

(a) Each stock certificate representing the Locked-Up Shares shall be stamped
or otherwise imprinted with the following legend:

 



 

"THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED HEREBY ARE SUBJECT TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF
A LOCK-UP AGREEMENT, DATED AS OF JUNE 6, 2013, BY AND BETWEEN THE HOLDER
HEREOF AND THE ISSUER AND MAY ONLY BE SOLD OR TRANSFERRED IN ACCORDANCE WITH
THE TERMS THEREOF."

 



 

(b) The Shareholder hereby agrees and consents to the entry of stop transfer
instructions with Parents transfer agent and registrar against the transfer
of the Locked-Up Shares held by the Shareholder except in compliance with this
Agreement.

 



 

3. _Miscellaneous_.

 



 

(a) _Specific Performance_. The parties agree that irreparable damage would
occur and that the parties would not have any adequate remedy at law in the
event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is
accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement in any federal court located in the
State of Hawaii or in Hawaii state court, this being in addition to any other
remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.

 



 

(b) _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid or
unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction, be
ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without
rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this
Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of any of the terms or
provisions of this Agreement in any other jurisdiction. If any provision of
this Agreement is so broad as to be unenforceable, the provision shall be
interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable.

 



 

(c) _Fees and Expenses; Attorneys  Fees_. Except as otherwise expressly
provided in this Agreement, Parent, on the one hand, and the Shareholder, on
the other hand, shall each bear its own direct and indirect fees and expenses
in connection with the investigation, negotiation and performance of this
Agreement and the consummation of the other transactions contemplated hereby,
including all direct and indirect expenses, financial advisory, legal and
accounting fees.

 



 

(d) _Governing Law_. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED AND
ENFORCED UNDER THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF HAWAII.

 



 

(e) _Consent to Jurisdiction_. Each party to this Agreement, by its execution
hereof, hereby:

 



      
 

 



 

(i) irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of a court of competent
authority in the State of Hawaii or any United States federal court located in
the State of Hawaii, for the purpose of any and all actions, suits or
proceedings arising in whole or in part out of, related to, based upon or in
connection with this Agreement or the subject matter hereof;

 



 

(ii) waives to the extent not prohibited by applicable Law, and agrees not to
assert, by way of motion, as a defense or otherwise, in any such action, any
claim that it is not subject personally to the jurisdiction of the above-named
courts, that its property is exempt or immune from attachment or execution,
that any such action brought in one of the above-named courts should be
dismissed on grounds of forum non conveniens, should be transferred to any
court other than one of the above-named courts, or should be stayed by reason
of the pendency of some other proceeding in any other court other than one of
the above-named courts, or that this Agreement or the subject matter hereof
may not be enforced in or by such court; and

 



 

(iii) agrees not to commence any such action other than before one of the
above-named courts nor to make any motion or take any other action seeking or
intending to cause the transfer or removal of any such action to any court
other than one of the above-named courts whether on the grounds of forum non
conveniens or otherwise.

 



 

(f) _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement of the
parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all
prior agreements and understandings, written and oral, among the parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof.

(h) _Binding Effect; Persons Benefiting; No Assignment_. This Agreement shall
inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns. Nothing in this Agreement is
intended or shall be construed to confer upon any entity or person other than
the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns any
right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement or any part
hereof. This Agreement may not be assigned by any of the parties hereto
without the prior written consent of the other parties hereto and any
purported assignment or other transfer without such consent shall be void and
unenforceable; _provided_ , _however_ , that without such prior consent,
Parent shall have the right to assign all or any part of its right, title,
interest or obligations hereunder to any wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent,
_provided_ that Parent remains liable for its obligations hereunder
notwithstanding a permitted assignment.

 



 

(i) _Amendment, Modification and Waiver_. This Agreement may not be amended,
altered or modified except by written instrument executed by the parties
hereto. Any waiver of rights hereunder must be set forth in writing. The
failure by any party hereto to enforce at any time any of the provisions of
this Agreement shall in no way be construed to be a waiver of any such
provision nor in any way to affect the validity of this Agreement or any part
hereof or the right of such party thereafter to enforce each and every such
provision. No waiver of any breach of or non-compliance with this Agreement
shall be held to be a waiver of any other or subsequent breach or non-
compliance.

 



 

(j) _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which
taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement, it being
understood that all of the parties need not sign the same counterpart.
