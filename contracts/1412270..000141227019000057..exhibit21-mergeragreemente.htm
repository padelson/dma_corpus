AGREEMENT

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing, and the covenants,
premises, representations and warranties and agreements contained in this
Agreement and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, and intending to be legally bound,
the parties to this Agreement agree as follows:

Article 1 
THE OFFER AND THE MERGER

1.1 The Offer.

(a) Provided that this Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance
with Article 7, as promptly as practicable after the date hereof (but in no
event later than January 13, 2020), Merger Sub shall (and Parent shall cause
Merger Sub to) commence,



2 



within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act, the Offer to purchase
for cash any and all (i) Shares (other than Shares to be cancelled in
accordance with Section 2.1(b)) at the Share Offer Price and (ii) Preferred
Shares at the Preferred Share Offer Price. Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall
cause Merger Sub to, accept for payment, purchase and pay for all Shares and
Preferred Shares, as applicable, validly tendered and not properly withdrawn
pursuant to the Offer, subject only to: (a) there being validly tendered in
the Offer (in the aggregate) and not properly withdrawn prior to the
Expiration Date that number of Shares and Preferred Shares that, together with
the number of Shares and Preferred Shares (if any) then owned by the Parent,
equals at least a majority of the voting power represented by the Shares and
Preferred Shares (voting on an as-converted basis in accordance with the
Certificate of Designations) that are then issued and outstanding (the
"Minimum Condition"); and (b) the satisfaction, or waiver by Merger Sub, of
the other conditions and requirements set forth in Annex I.

(b) On or prior to the date that Merger Sub becomes obligated to pay for
Shares and Preferred Shares pursuant to the Offer, Parent shall provide or
cause to be provided to Merger Sub on a timely basis funds sufficient to
purchase and pay for any and all Shares and Preferred Shares, as applicable,
that Merger Sub shall become obligated to accept for payment and purchase
pursuant to the Offer. Subject to the satisfaction of the Minimum Condition
and the satisfaction, or waiver by Merger Sub, of the other conditions and
requirements set forth in Annex I, Merger Sub shall accept for payment (the
time of such acceptance, the "Acceptance Time") and pay for all Shares and
Preferred Shares validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the
Offer as soon as practicable following the Expiration Date, and, in any event,
no more than two (2) Business Days after the Expiration Date. The Offer Price
payable in respect of each Share and Preferred Share, as applicable, validly
tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer shall be paid to the
seller in cash, without interest, subject to any withholding of Taxes required
by applicable Law, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement.

(c) The Offer shall be made by means of an offer to purchase (the "Offer to
Purchase") that describes the terms and conditions of the Offer in accordance
with applicable Law and this Agreement, including the conditions and
requirements set forth in Annex I. To the extent permitted by applicable Law,
Parent and Merger Sub expressly reserve the right to increase the Offer Price
or to make any other changes in the terms and conditions of the Offer;
provided, however, that except with the prior written approval of the Company,
Merger Sub shall not (i) decrease the Offer Price, (ii) change the form of
consideration payable in the Offer, (iii) reduce the maximum number of Shares
or Preferred Shares sought to be purchased in the Offer, (iv) amend, modify or
waive the Minimum Condition, (v) amend any of the other conditions to the
Offer set forth in Annex I in a manner adverse to the holders of Shares or
Preferred Shares, (vi) impose conditions to the Offer that are in addition to
the conditions to the Offer set forth in Annex I hereto, (vii) except as
provided in Sections 1.1(e) and 1.1(f), terminate, accelerate or otherwise
modify or amend the Offer to accelerate the Expiration Date, or (viii)
otherwise modify or amend any of the other terms of the Offer in a manner
adverse in any material respect to the holders of Shares or Preferred Shares.



3 



(d) Unless extended in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the Offer
shall expire at one minute after 11:59 p.m. (New York City time) on the date
that is twenty (20) Business Days following the commencement of the Offer
(determined using Rule 14d-1(g)(3) promulgated under the Exchange Act) (such
date and time, the "Initial Expiration Date") or, if the Initial Expiration
Date has been extended in accordance with this Agreement, the date and time to
which the Offer has been so extended (the Initial Expiration Date, or such
later date and time to which the Initial Expiration Date has been extended in
accordance with this Agreement, the "Expiration Date").

(e) If on any then scheduled Expiration Date, any of the conditions to the
Offer (including the Minimum Condition and the other conditions and
requirements set forth in Annex I) have not been satisfied or waived by Merger
Sub, Merger Sub shall (and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to) extend the Offer
for successive periods of up to ten (10) Business Days each, or such longer
period as may be agreed between Merger Sub and the Company, in order to permit
the satisfaction of such conditions; provided, however, that Merger Sub shall
not be required to extend the Offer beyond the Outside Date. The "Outside
Date" shall be June 20, 2020. In addition, Merger Sub shall extend the Offer
for any period or periods required by applicable Law or applicable rules,
regulations, interpretations or positions of the SEC or its staff.

(f) Merger Sub shall not terminate the Offer prior to any scheduled Expiration
Date without the prior written consent of the Company, except if this
Agreement has been terminated in accordance with Article 7. If this Agreement
is terminated in accordance with Article 7, Merger Sub shall (and Parent shall
cause Merger Sub to) promptly (and in any event within 24 hours following such
termination), irrevocably and unconditionally terminate the Offer and shall
not acquire any Shares or Preferred Shares pursuant thereto. If the Offer is
terminated or withdrawn by Merger Sub, or this Agreement is terminated prior
to the Acceptance Time, Merger Sub shall (and the Parent shall cause Merger
Sub to) promptly return, and shall cause any depositary acting on behalf of
Merger Sub to return, in accordance with applicable Law, all tendered Shares
and Preferred Shares to the registered holders thereof and Merger Sub shall
not (and Parent shall cause Merger Sub not to) accept any Shares or Preferred
Shares pursuant to the Offer.

(g) As soon as practicable on the date of the commencement of the Offer,
Parent and Merger Sub shall file with the SEC, in accordance with Rule 14d-3
under the Exchange Act, a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with respect
to the Offer (together with all amendments, supplements and exhibits thereto,
the "Schedule TO"). The Schedule TO shall include, as exhibits, the Offer to
Purchase, a form of letter of transmittal and a form of summary advertisement
(collectively, together with any amendments, supplements and exhibits thereto,
the "Offer Documents"). Parent and Merger Sub agree to cause the Offer
Documents to be disseminated to holders of Shares and Preferred Shares, as and
to the extent required by federal securities Laws, including the Exchange Act.
Parent and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand,
agree to promptly notify the other party and correct any information provided
by it for use in the Offer Documents, if and to the extent that it shall have
become false or misleading in any material respect or as otherwise required by
applicable Law,



4 



and Merger Sub agrees to cause the Offer Documents, as so corrected, to be
filed with the SEC and disseminated to holders of Shares and Preferred Shares,
in each case, as and to the extent required by the Exchange Act. Except
following a Change of Board Recommendation, the Company and its counsel shall
be given a reasonable opportunity to review the Schedule TO and the Offer
Documents before they are filed with the SEC, and Parent and Merger Sub shall
give due consideration to any additions, deletions or changes suggested
thereto by the Company and its counsel. In addition, except following a Change
of Board Recommendation, Parent and Merger Sub shall provide the Company and
its counsel with copies of any written comments, and shall provide them an
oral summary of any oral comments, that Parent and Merger Sub or its counsel
may receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff with respect to the
Schedule TO or the Offer Documents promptly after receipt of such comments,
and any written or oral responses thereto. The Company and its counsel shall
be given a reasonable opportunity to review any such responses and Parent and
Merger Sub shall give due consideration to the reasonable additions, deletions
or changes suggested thereto by the Company and its counsel.

1.2 Company Actions.

(a) Contemporaneous with the filing of the Schedule TO, the Company shall, in
a manner that complies with the rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC
under the Exchange Act, including Rule 14d-9 thereunder, file with the SEC a
Tender Offer Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 with
respect to the Offer (together with all amendments, supplements and exhibits
thereto, the "Schedule 14D-9") that shall, subject to the provisions of
Section 5.3, contain the Company Board Recommendation. The Company shall also
include in the Schedule 14D-9, in its entirety, and a notice, in compliance
with Section 262 of the DGCL, of appraisal rights in connection with the
Merger under the DGCL. The Company hereby consents to the inclusion in the
Offer Documents of a description of the Company Board Recommendation. The
Company further agrees to cause the Schedule 14D-9 to be disseminated to
holders of Shares and Preferred Shares, as and when required by the Exchange
Act. If requested by Parent, the Company shall cause the Schedule 14D-9 to be
mailed or otherwise disseminated to the holders of Shares and Preferred Shares
together with the Offer Documents disseminated to the holders of Shares and
Preferred Shares. Parent and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on
the other hand, agree to promptly notify the other party and correct any
information included in, or incorporated by reference into, the Schedule
14D-9, if and to the extent that it shall have become false or misleading in
any material respect or as otherwise required by applicable Law, and the
Company agrees to cause the Schedule 14D-9, as so corrected, to be filed with
the SEC and disseminated to holders of Shares and Preferred Shares, in each
case, as and to the extent required by federal securities Laws, including the
Exchange Act. Except for a filing on Schedule 14D-9 to disclose a Change of
Board Recommendation, Parent and its counsel shall be given a reasonable
opportunity to review the Schedule 14D-9 before it is filed with the SEC, and
the Company shall give due consideration to the reasonable additions,
deletions or changes suggested thereto by Parent and its counsel. In addition,
except following a Change of Board Recommendation, the Company shall provide
Parent and its counsel with copies of any written comments, and shall provide
them with an oral summary of any oral comments, that the Company or its
counsel may receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff with respect
to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after receipt of such



5 



comments, and any written or oral responses thereto. Parent and its counsel
shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review any such written responses
and the Company shall give due consideration to the reasonable additions,
deletions or changes suggested thereto by Parent and its counsel.

(b) From time to time as reasonably requested by Parent or its agents, the
Company shall furnish or cause to be furnished to Parent mailing labels,
security position listings, non-objecting beneficial owner lists and any other
listings or computer files containing the names and addresses of the record or
beneficial holders of the Shares and Preferred Shares, as applicable, as of
the most recent practicable date, and shall promptly furnish Parent with such
information (including updated lists of holders of the Shares and Preferred
Shares and their addresses, mailing labels, security position listings and
non-objecting beneficial owner lists) and such other assistance as Parent or
its agents may reasonably request in communicating with the record and
beneficial holders of Shares and Preferred Shares. Subject to any and all
Laws, and except for such steps as are necessary to disseminate the Offer
Documents and any other documents necessary to consummate the Merger, Parent
and Merger Sub and their agents shall: (i) hold in confidence the information
contained in any such lists of stockholders, mailing labels and listings,
computer files or files of securities positions in accordance with the
Confidentiality Agreement and (ii) use such information only in connection
with the Offer and the Merger.

1.3 The Merger.

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
and in accordance with the DGCL, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be
merged with and into the Company. As a result of the Merger, the separate
corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease, and the Company shall continue
as the surviving corporation of the Merger and a wholly-owned Subsidiary of
Parent (the "Surviving Corporation"). The Merger shall be effected pursuant to
the Section 251(h) of DGCL and shall have the effects set forth in this
Agreement and the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, at the Effective Time, all of the property,
rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises of the Company and
Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all of the debts,
liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts,
liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation. The Offer, the Merger and
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement are referred to herein as
the "Transactions."

(b) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without the necessity
of further action by the Company or any other Person, the certificate of
incorporation of the Company, as amended and restated in the form attached
hereto as Exhibit A, shall be the certificate of incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation, and such certificate of incorporation shall be the
certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter
changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law (subject to
Section 5.8). In addition, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and
without the necessity of further action by the Company or any other Person,
the bylaws of the Company, as amended and restated in the form attached hereto
as Exhibit B, shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, and such
bylaws



6 



shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or
amended as provided therein or by applicable Law (subject to Section 5.8).

(c) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without the necessity
of further action by the Company or any other person, the directors of Merger
Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time or such other individuals
designated by Parent as of the Effective Time shall become the directors of
the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office, from and after the Effective
Time, in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation until their respective successors shall have been duly
elected, designated or qualified, or until their earlier death, resignation or
removal in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation. The officers of the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time, from and after the Effective Time, shall continue as the
officers of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with
the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until
their respective successors shall have been duly elected, designated or
qualified, or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance
with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.

(d) If, at any time after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
determine, in its sole discretion, or shall be advised, that any deeds, bills
of sale, instruments of conveyance, assignments, assurances or any other
actions or things are necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm of
record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation its right, title or interest
in, to or under any of the rights, properties or assets of either of the
Company or Merger Sub acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation
as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger or otherwise to carry out
this Agreement, then the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation
shall be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of
either the Company or Merger Sub, all such deeds, bills of sale, instruments
of conveyance, assignments and assurances and to take and do, in the name and
on behalf of each of such corporations or otherwise, all such other actions
and things as may be necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm any
and all right, title or interest in, to and under such rights, properties or
assets in the Surviving Corporation or otherwise to carry out this Agreement.

1.1 Closing and Effective Time of the Merger. The closing of the Merger (the
"Closing") shall take place at 8:00 a.m., local time, on the same Business Day
as the Acceptance Time, except if each of the applicable conditions set forth
in Article 6 (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the fulfillment or waiver of those
conditions at the Closing) has not been satisfied or waived by such date, in
which case on no later than the first Business Day on which each of such
conditions is satisfied, at the offices of Latham and Watkins LLP, 200 Clarendon
St., Boston, Massachusetts 02116, unless another time, date or place is agreed
to in writing by the parties hereto. The date on which the Closing actually
occurs is referred to as the "Closing Date." On the Closing Date, or on such
other date as Parent and the Company may agree to, Merger Sub or the Company
shall cause a certificate of merger (the "Certificate of Merger"), to be
executed and filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL and shall make all other
filings required under the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective at the time



7

State of the State of Delaware, or such later date and time as is agreed upon
by the parties and specified in the Certificate of Merger (such date and time
at which the Merger becomes effective hereinafter referred to as the
"Effective Time").

Law as provided in Section 2.5, upon surrender of the Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares in accordance with Section 2.2. As of the Effective Time, all
such Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
cancelled and shall cease to exist, and shall thereafter represent only the
right to receive the Merger Consideration to be paid in accordance with
Section 2.2.

(b) Cancellation of Treasury Shares and Parent-Owned Shares. Each Share held
by the Company as treasury stock or held directly by Parent or Merger Sub (or
any direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company, Parent or
Merger Sub), in each case, immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall
automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration or
payment shall be delivered in exchange therefor or in respect thereof.

(c) Merger Sub Equity Interests. All outstanding shares of capital stock of
Merger Sub held immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted
into and become (in the aggregate) 1,000 shares of newly and validly issued,
fully paid and non-assessable shares of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation and shall constitute the only outstanding capital of the Surviving
Corporation.

(d) Conversion of Series A Preferred Stock. Each share of Series A Preferred
Stock (each, a "Preferred Share" and collectively, the "Preferred Shares")
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than
Preferred Shares irrevocably accepted for payment in the Offer or Dissenting
Shares, shall be converted automatically into the right to receive the
Preferred Offer Price ( the "Series A Preferred Stock Consideration"), in
either case, payable net to the holder in cash, without interest, subject to
any withholding of Taxes required by applicable Law as provided in Section
2.5, upon surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in accordance
with Section 2.2. As of the Effective Time, all such Preferred Shares shall no
longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall



8 



cease to exist, and shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the
Series A Preferred Stock Consideration to be paid in accordance with Section
2.2.

2.2 Payment for Securities; Surrender of Certificates.

(a) Paying Agent. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a
reputable bank or trust company to act as the paying agent (the identity and
terms of designation and appointment of which shall be reasonably acceptable
to the Company) for purposes of effecting the payment of the aggregate Merger
Consideration and the aggregate Series A Preferred Stock Consideration in
connection with the Merger in accordance with this Article 2 (the "Paying
Agent"). Parent shall pay, or cause to be paid, the fees and expenses of the
Paying Agent. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or
cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent the aggregate Merger
Consideration and aggregate Series A Preferred Stock Consideration to which
holders of Shares and holders of Preferred Shares shall be entitled at the
Effective Time pursuant to this Agreement. In the event such deposited funds
are insufficient to make the payments contemplated pursuant to Section 2.1,
Parent shall promptly deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent
such additional funds to ensure that the Paying Agent has sufficient funds to
make such payments. Such funds shall be invested by the Paying Agent as
directed by Parent, pending payment thereof by the Paying Agent to the holders
of the Shares and the holders Preferred Shares in accordance with this Article
2; provided, however, that any such investments shall be in obligations of, or
guaranteed by, the United States government or rated A-1 or P-1 or better by
Moody's Investor Service, Inc. or Standard and Poor's Corporation, respectively.
Earnings from such investments shall be the sole and exclusive property of the
Surviving Corporation, and no part of such earnings shall accrue to the
benefit of holders of Shares and the holders of Preferred Shares.

(b) Procedures for Surrender.

(i) Certificates. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time (and in no
event later than three (3) Business Days after the Effective Time), the
Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each Person that
was, immediately prior to the Effective Time, a holder of record of Shares or
Preferred Shares, as applicable, represented by certificates (the
"Certificates"), which Shares or Preferred Shares were converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration or the Series A Preferred Stock
Consideration, as applicable, at the Effective Time pursuant to this
Agreement: (A) a letter of transmittal, which shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass,
only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent, and shall
otherwise be in such form as Parent and the Paying Agent shall reasonably
agree; and (B) instructions for effecting the surrender of the Certificates
(or affidavits of loss in lieu of the Certificates as provided in Section
2.2(e)) in exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration or the Series A
Preferred Stock Consideration, as applicable. Upon surrender of a Certificate
(or affidavit of loss in lieu of the Certificate as provided in Section
2.2(e)) to the Paying Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be
appointed by Parent, together with delivery of a letter of transmittal, duly
executed and in proper form, with respect to such Certificates, the holder of
such Certificates shall be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration or
Series A Preferred Stock Consideration, as



9 



applicable, formerly represented by such Certificates (after giving effect to
any required Tax withholdings as provided in Section 2.5), and any Certificate
so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. If payment of the Merger
Consideration or the Series A Preferred Stock Consideration is to be made to a
Person other than the Person in whose name any surrendered Certificate is
registered, it shall be a condition precedent of payment that the Certificate
so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form
for transfer, and the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any
transfer and other similar Taxes required by reason of the payment of the
Merger Consideration or the Series A Preferred Stock Consideration, as
applicable, to a Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate so
surrendered and shall have established to the satisfaction of the Surviving
Corporation that such Taxes either have been paid or are not required to be
paid. Any other transfer or similar Taxes arising out of the transactions
contemplated hereunder shall be borne by Parent. No interest will be paid or
accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of the Certificates. Until
surrendered as contemplated hereby, each Certificate shall be deemed at any
time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the
Merger Consideration or the Series A Preferred Stock Consideration, as
applicable, in cash as contemplated by this Agreement, except for Certificates
representing Dissenting Shares, which shall be deemed to represent only the
right to receive payment of the fair value of such Shares in accordance with
and to the extent provided by Section 262 of the DGCL.

(ii) Book-Entry Shares. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, no holder of non-certificated Shares or Preferred Shares
represented by book-entry ("Book-Entry Shares") shall be required to deliver a
Certificate or, in the case of holders of Book-Entry Shares held through The
Depository Trust Company, an executed letter of transmittal to the Paying
Agent, to receive the Merger Consideration or the Series A Preferred Stock
Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to Section
2.1(a) or Section 2.1(d), as applicable. In lieu thereof, each holder of
record of one or more Book-Entry Shares held through The Depository Trust
Company whose Shares or Preferred Shares were converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration or the Series A Preferred Stock
Consideration, as applicable, shall automatically upon the Effective Time be
entitled to receive, and Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to pay and
deliver to The Depository Trust Company or its nominee as promptly as
practicable after the Effective Time, in respect of each such Book-Entry Share
a cash amount in immediately available funds equal to the Merger Consideration
or the Series A Preferred Stock Consideration, as applicable (after giving
effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in Section 2.5), and such
Book-Entry Shares of such holder shall be cancelled. As soon as practicable
after the Effective Time (and in no event later than three (3) Business Days
after the Effective Time), the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying
Agent to mail to each Person that was, immediately prior to the Effective
Time, a holder of record of Book-Entry Shares not held through The Depository
Trust Company: (A) a letter of transmittal, which shall be in such form as
Parent and the Paying Agent shall reasonably agree; and (B) instructions for
returning such letter of transmittal in exchange for the Merger Consideration
or Series A Preferred Stock Consideration, as applicable. Upon delivery of
such letter of transmittal, in accordance with the terms of such letter of
transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such Book-Entry Shares shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor a cash amount in immediately
available funds equal to the Merger Consideration or the Series A Preferred
Stock



10 



Consideration, as applicable (after giving effect to any required Tax
withholdings as provided in Section 2.5), and such Book-Entry Shares so
surrendered shall at the Effective Time be cancelled. Payment of the Merger
Consideration or the Series A Preferred Stock Consideration with respect to
Book-Entry Shares shall only be made to the Person in whose name such Book-
Entry Shares are registered. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount
payable upon due surrender of Book-Entry Shares. Until paid or surrendered as
contemplated hereby, each Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after
the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration or the Series A Preferred Stock Consideration, as applicable, in
cash as contemplated by this Agreement, except for Book-Entry Shares
representing Dissenting Shares, which shall be deemed to represent the right
to receive payment of the fair value of such Shares or Preferred Shares, as
applicable, in accordance with and to the extent provided by Section 262 of
the DGCL.

(c) Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Shares. At the Effective
Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter
there shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares or Preferred
Shares on the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the
holders of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares
or Preferred Shares except as otherwise provided for herein or by applicable
Law. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving
Corporation for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided
in this Agreement.

(d) Termination of Fund; Abandoned Property; No Liability. Any portion of the
funds (including any interest received with respect thereto) made available to
the Paying Agent that remains unclaimed by the holders of Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares on the first anniversary of the Effective Time will be
returned to the Surviving Corporation or an affiliate thereof designated by
the Surviving Corporation, upon demand, and any such holder who has not
tendered its Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for the Merger Consideration or
the Series A Preferred Stock Consideration, as applicable, in accordance with
Section 2.2(b) prior to such time shall thereafter look only to Parent and the
Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar
Laws) for delivery of the Merger Consideration or the Series A Preferred Stock
Consideration, as applicable, without interest and subject to any withholding
of Taxes required by applicable Law as provided in Section 2.5, in respect of
such holder's surrender of their Certificates or Book-Entry Shares and
compliance with the procedures in Section 2.2(b). Any portion of the Aggregate
Merger Consideration remaining unclaimed by the holders of Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares immediately prior to such time as such amounts would
otherwise escheat to, or become property of, any Governmental Entity will, to
the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving
Corporation or an affiliate thereof designated by the Surviving Corporation,
free and clear of any claim or interest of any Person previously entitled
thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent or their respective affiliates will be
liable to any holder of a Certificate or Book-Entry Shares for Merger
Consideration or the Series A Preferred Stock Consideration, as applicable,
delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Law. Any portion of the Aggregate Merger Consideration made
available to the Paying Agent pursuant to Section 2.2(a), to pay for Shares or
Preferred



11 



Shares for which appraisal rights have been perfected shall be returned to the
Surviving Corporation, upon demand.

(e) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event that any Certificates
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent shall issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the making of
an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the Merger Consideration or
the Series A Preferred Stock Consideration, as applicable payable in respect
thereof pursuant to Section 2.1(a) or Section 2.1(d), as applicable. Parent
may, in its reasonable discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment
of such Merger Consideration or the Series A Preferred Stock Consideration, as
applicable, require the owners of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates
to deliver a bond in a reasonable sum as it may reasonably direct as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent with respect to the Certificates alleged to
have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

2.3 Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary (but subject to the provisions of this Section 2.3), Shares and/or
Preferred Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held
by a holder who is entitled to demand and has properly demanded appraisal for
such Shares in accordance with, and who complies in all respects with, Section
262 of the DGCL (such shares, the "Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration or the Series A Preferred
Stock Consideration, as applicable. At the Effective Time, all Dissenting
Shares shall be cancelled and cease to exist, and the holders of Dissenting
Shares shall only be entitled to the rights granted to them under the DGCL. If
any such holder fails to perfect or otherwise waives, withdraws or loses his
right to appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL or other applicable Law, then
the right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such Dissenting Shares
shall cease and such Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to have been converted,
as of the Effective Time, into and shall be exchangeable solely for the right
to receive the Merger Consideration or the Series A Preferred Stock
Consideration, as applicable, without interest and subject to any withholding
of Taxes required by applicable Law as provided in Section 2.5. The Company
shall give Parent prompt notice of any demands received by the Company for
appraisal of Shares or Preferred Shares and any other instruments served
pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company relating to rights to be paid
the fair value of Dissenting Shares, and Parent shall have the right to
participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands.
Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, except with the prior
written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or
settle or compromise, any such demands or agree to do any of the foregoing.

2.4 Treatment of Options and Restricted Stock Units.

(a) Treatment of Options.

(i) Effective as of five (5) Business Days prior to, and conditional upon the
occurrence of, the Effective Time, each holder of an outstanding option to
purchase Shares (each a "Company Option") that qualifies as an incentive stock
option within the meaning of Section 422(b) of the Code, whether vested or
unvested, shall be entitled to



12 



exercise such Company Option in full by providing the Company with a notice of
exercise and full payment of the applicable exercise price in accordance with
and subject to the terms of the applicable Company Equity Plan and award
agreement.

(ii) At the Effective Time, each Company Option, whether vested or unvested,
that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder
thereof or the Company, be cancelled and converted into the right to receive
(without interest) an amount in cash equal to the product of (x) the total
number of Shares underlying the Company Option as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time multiplied by (y) the excess, if any, of the Merger
Consideration over the per-share exercise price of such Company Option;
provided that any such Company Option with respect to which the per-share
exercise price subject thereto is equal to or greater than the Merger
Consideration shall be canceled for no consideration.

(b) Treatment of Restricted Stock Units. At the Effective Time, (i) each award
of Company restricted stock units that is subject solely to service-based
vesting conditions (including any Company restricted stock units that were
subject, in whole or in part, to performance-based vesting conditions as of
the applicable grant date, but that are solely subject to service-based
vesting conditions as of immediately prior to the Effective Time) ("Company
RSUs") and that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
become fully vested and shall, automatically and without any required action
on the part of the holder thereof or the Company, be cancelled and converted
into the right to receive (without interest) an amount in cash equal to (x)
the total number of Shares underlying such award of Company RSUs as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time, multiplied by (y) the Merger
Consideration. Each award of Company restricted stock units other than those
described in the immediately preceding sentence shall have been cancelled for
no consideration prior to the Effective Time in accordance with their terms.

(c) Payment by Surviving Corporation. The Surviving Corporation shall, and
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, pay to the holders of Company
Options and Company RSUs the amounts described in Sections 2.4(a) and 2.4(b),
less Taxes required to be withheld with respect to such payments, as soon as
practicable following the Closing Date, through the Surviving Corporation's
payroll system (to the extent applicable), but not later than three (3)
Business Days following the Closing Date; provided that, with respect to
Company RSUs, to the extent payment within such time or on such date would
trigger a Tax or penalty under Section 409A of the Code, such payments shall
be made on the earliest date that payment would not trigger such Tax or
penalty.

(d) Termination of Company Equity Plans. As of the Effective Time, the
Company's 2014 Incentive Award Plan and the Company's 2006 Stock Incentive
Plan (together, the "Company Equity Plans") shall be terminated and no further
Shares, Company Options, Company RSUs, other Equity Interests in the Company
or other rights with respect to Shares shall be granted thereunder. Following
the Effective Time, no such Company Option, Company RSU, Equity Interest or
other right that was outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
remain outstanding and each former holder of any such Company Option,



13 



Company RSU, Equity Interest or other right shall cease to have any rights
with respect thereto, except the right to receive the consideration set forth
in this Section 2.4.

(a) Board Actions. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board (or, if
appropriate, any committee thereof) shall adopt appropriate resolutions and
take such other actions as are reasonably necessary and appropriate (including
using reasonable best efforts to obtain any required consents) to effect the
transactions described in this Section 2.4.

2.5 Withholding Rights. The Company, Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving
Corporation and the Paying Agent, as the case may be, shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from any amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement such amounts as are required to be deducted and withheld with
respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any other provision of
applicable Law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld and
paid to the appropriate Governmental Entity, such amounts shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of
which such deduction or withholding was made.

2.6 Adjustments. In the event that, between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time, any change in the outstanding Shares and/or Preferred Shares
shall occur as a result of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock
dividend (including any dividend or distribution of Equity Interests
convertible into or exchangeable for Shares and/or Preferred Shares, but
excluding any dividends on Preferred Shares pursuant to Section 4(b) of the
Certificate of Designations), recapitalization, reclassification, combination,
exchange of shares or other similar event, the applicable Offer Price, the
Merger Consideration and/or the Series A Preferred Stock Consideration, as
applicable, shall be equitably adjusted to reflect such event and to provide
to holders of Shares and/or Preferred Shares, as applicable, the same economic
effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event; provided that
nothing in this Section 2.6 shall be deemed to permit or authorize the Company
to take any such action or effect any such change that it is not otherwise
authorized or permitted to take pursuant to this Agreement (including Section
5.1).

ARTICLE 3 
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

Except (a) as set forth in the corresponding section or subsection of the
disclosure schedule delivered by the Company to Parent and Merger Sub (the
"Company Disclosure Schedule") concurrent with the execution of this Agreement
(with specific reference to the representations and warranties in this Article
3 to which the information in such schedule relates; provided that disclosure
in the Company Disclosure Schedule as to a specific representation or warranty
shall qualify any other sections of this Article 3 to the extent
(notwithstanding the absence of a specific cross reference) it is reasonably
apparent on its face that such disclosure relates to such other sections), and
(b) as otherwise disclosed or identified in the Company SEC Documents filed by
the Company with the SEC not less than two (2) Business Days prior to the date
hereof (other than any forward-looking disclosures contained in the "Forward
Looking Statements" and "Risk Factors" sections of the Company SEC Documents
or any other section to the extent they are forward looking statements or
cautionary, predictive or forward-looking in



14 



nature but including any historical or factual matters disclosed in such
sections), the Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub
as follows:

3.1 Corporate Organization. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is a
corporation or other legal entity duly organized, validly existing and, to the
extent applicable, in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its
incorporation or organization and has the requisite corporate or
organizational, as the case may be, power and authority to own, operate or
lease its properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now
being conducted. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is duly licensed or
qualified to do business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the
business conducted by it or the character or location of the properties and
assets owned, operated or leased by it makes such licensing or qualification
necessary, except where the failure to be so licensed or qualified, has not
had and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. The copies of the Certificate of
Incorporation (the "Company Charter") and Amended and Restated Bylaws (the
"Company Bylaws") of the Company, as most recently filed with the Company SEC
Documents, are true, complete and correct copies of such documents as in
effect as of the date of this Agreement. The Company is not in violation of
any of the provisions of the Company Charter or the Company Bylaws.

3.2 Capitalization.

(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of three hundred
million (300,000,000) Shares and five million (5,000,000) shares of preferred
stock, par value $0.001 per share ("Company Preferred Stock"), 46,350 of which
have been designated as Series A Preferred Stock. As of the close of business
on December 18, 2019, (i) 33,268,479 Shares (other than treasury shares) and
46,350 Preferred Shares were issued and outstanding, all of which were validly
issued and fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive rights, (ii) no
Shares were held in the treasury of the Company or by its Subsidiaries and
(iii) 3,006,017 Shares are subject to outstanding Company Options and
1,472,562 Shares are subject to outstanding Company RSUs and 192,835 shares
are subject to outstanding restricted stock units that are subject, in whole
or in part, to performance-based vesting conditions ("Company PSUs") (assuming
maximum level of performance). Except for Company Options, Company RSUs and
Company PSUs under the Company Equity Plans, there are no options, warrants or
other rights, agreements, arrangements or commitments of any character to
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is bound relating to the issued or unissued
capital stock or other Equity Interests of the Company, or securities
convertible into or exchangeable for such capital stock or other Equity
Interests, or obligating the Company to issue or sell any shares of its
capital stock or other Equity Interests, or securities convertible into or
exchangeable for such capital stock of, or other Equity Interests in, the
Company. Since December 18, 2019 and prior to the date of this Agreement,
except for the issuance of Shares under the Company Equity Plans in accordance
with their terms, the Company has not issued any shares of its capital stock
or other Equity Interests, or securities convertible into or exchangeable for
such capital stock or other Equity Interests, other than those shares of
capital stock reserved for issuance described in this Section 3.2(a).



15 



(b) The Company has provided Parent with a true and complete list of all
outstanding Company Equity Awards as of December 18, 2019, including (i) the
type of award and the number of Shares related or subject thereto, (ii) the
name of the Company Equity Plan under which the award was granted, (iii) the
date of grant, and (iv) with respect to each Company Option, the per-share
exercise price and expiration date thereof. All Shares subject to issuance
under the Company Equity Plans, upon issuance prior to the Effective Time on
the terms and conditions specified in the instruments pursuant to which they
are issuable, will be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid,
nonassessable and free of preemptive rights. There are no outstanding
contractual obligations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (i)
restricting the transfer of, (ii) affecting the voting rights of, (iii)
requiring the repurchase, redemption or disposition of, or containing any
right of first refusal with respect to, (iv) requiring the registration for
sale of, or (v) granting any preemptive or antidilutive right with respect to,
any Shares or any capital stock of, or other Equity Interests in, the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries. There are no outstanding bonds, debentures, notes
or other obligations the holders of which have the right to vote (or
convertible into or exercisable for securities having the right to vote) with
the stockholders of the Company on any matter.

(c) Section 3.2(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true and
complete list of all of the Subsidiaries of the Company and the authorized,
issued and outstanding Equity Interests of each such Subsidiary. None of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries holds an Equity Interest in any other
Person. Each outstanding share of capital stock of or other Equity Interest in
each Subsidiary of the Company is duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid,
nonassessable and free of preemptive rights and is owned, beneficially and of
record, by the Company or one or more of its wholly-owned Subsidiaries free
and clear of all Liens, other than Permitted Liens. There are no options,
warrants or other rights, agreements, arrangements or commitments of any
character to which any Subsidiary of the Company is a party or by which any
Subsidiary of the Company is bound relating to the issued or unissued capital
stock or other Equity Interests of such Subsidiary, or securities convertible
into or exchangeable for such capital stock or other Equity Interests, or
obligating any Subsidiary of the Company to issue or sell any shares of its
capital stock or other Equity Interests, or securities convertible into or
exchangeable for such capital stock of, or other Equity Interests in, such
Subsidiary. There are no outstanding contractual obligations of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries to provide funds to, or make any investment (in the
form of a loan, capital contribution or otherwise) in, any Subsidiary of the
Company or any other Person, other than guarantees by the Company of any
indebtedness or other obligations of any wholly-owned Subsidiary of the
Company. None of the Company's Subsidiaries owns any Shares. The certificates
of incorporation or bylaws (or equivalent organizational documents) of each
Subsidiary of the Company as in effect as of the date of this Agreement have
been made available to Parent. None of the Company's Subsidiaries are in
material violation of any of their respective certificates of incorporation or
bylaws (or equivalent organizational documents).

3.3 Authority; Execution and Delivery; Enforceability.

(a) The Company has all necessary power and authority to execute and deliver
this Agreement, to perform and comply with each of its covenants and
obligations under



16 



this Agreement and to consummate the Transactions. The execution and delivery
by the Company of this Agreement, the performance and compliance by the
Company with each of its obligations herein, and the consummation by it of the
Transactions have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on
the part of the Company and no other corporate proceedings on the part of the
Company and no other stockholder votes are necessary to authorize this
Agreement or the consummation by the Company of the Transactions. The Company
has duly and validly executed and delivered this Agreement and, assuming the
due authorization, execution and delivery by Parent and Merger Sub of this
Agreement, this Agreement constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of
the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms,
except as limited by Laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights
generally, by general equitable principles or by the discretion of any
Governmental Entity before which any Proceeding seeking enforcement may be
brought.

(b) The Company Board has, at a meeting duly called and held, adopted
resolutions (i) determining that the Transactions, including the Offer and the
Merger, are advisable, fair to and in the best interests of the Company and
its stockholders, (ii) approving, adopting and declaring advisable this
Agreement and the Transactions, including the Offer and the Merger, (iii)
determining that the Merger shall be effected as soon as practicable following
the Acceptance Time without a vote of the Company's stockholders pursuant to
Section 251(h) of the DGCL and (iv) recommending that the Company's
stockholders accept the Offer and tender their Shares and Preferred Shares, as
applicable, to Merger Sub in response to the Offer (the "Company Board
Recommendation").

(c) Subject to the accuracy of Section 4.7, the Company Board has taken all
actions and votes as are necessary, so that the restrictions on business
combinations set forth in Section 203 of the DGCL and any other similar Law
are not applicable to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Offer, the Merger or the other Transactions. To the Knowledge of
the Company, no other takeover, anti-takeover, business combination, control
share acquisition or similar Law applies to the Merger or the other
Transactions. The only vote of holders of any class or series of Shares or
other Equity Interests of the Company necessary to adopt this Agreement would
be, in the absence of Section 251(h) of the DGCL, the adoption of this
Agreement by the holders of a majority of the voting power represented by the
Shares and the Preferred Shares (voting on an as-converted basis in accordance
with the Certificate of Designations) that are outstanding and entitled to
vote thereon.

3.4 No Conflicts.

(a) None of the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the acceptance for
payment or payment for Shares of Preferred Shares, as applicable, does or
will, nor will the performance of this Agreement by the Company , (i) conflict
with or violate any provision of the Company Charter or the Company Bylaws or
any equivalent organizational documents of any Subsidiary of the Company, (ii)
assuming that all consents, approvals, authorizations and permits described in
Section 3.4(b) have been obtained and all filings and notifications described
in Section 3.4(b) have been made and any waiting periods thereunder have
terminated or expired, conflict with or violate any Law applicable to the
Company or any of



17 



its Subsidiaries or by which any property or asset of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries is bound or affected or (iii) require any consent or approval
under, result in any breach of or any loss of any benefit under, constitute a
change of control or default (or an event which with notice or lapse of time
or both would become a default) under or give to others any right of
termination, vesting, amendment, acceleration or cancellation of, or result in
the creation of a Lien on any property or asset of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries pursuant to, any Contract or Permit to which the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries is party, except, with respect to clauses (ii) and (iii),
for any such conflicts, violations, breaches, defaults or other occurrences
which would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to
have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

(b) None of the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company or the
acceptance for payment or payment for Shares of Preferred Shares, as

(a) Except as expressly permitted by this Section 5.3, from and after the date

than the



43 



Company's Representatives) in connection with an Acquisition Proposal or any
inquiry, discussion, offer or request that would reasonably be expected to
lead to an Acquisition Proposal. Except as expressly permitted by this Section
5.3, from and after the date hereof until the Acceptance Time, or, if earlier,
the termination of this Agreement in accordance with Article 7, neither the

publicly propose to approve or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal, (ii)
withdraw, change or qualify, in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, the
Company Board Recommendation, (iii) approve or cause the Company to enter into

(ii) of this sentence), a "Change of Board Recommendation").

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 5.3(a), if
at any time following the date hereof and prior to the Acceptance Time (i) the
Company has received a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal from a Third
Party, (ii) such Acquisition Proposal did not result from a breach of this
Section 5.3 in any material respect by the Company and (iii) the Company Board
(or a duly authorized committee thereof) determines in good faith, after
consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, based on
information then available, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or
would reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal, then the Company
may (A) furnish information with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries
to the Third Party making such Acquisition Proposal, its representatives and
potential sources of financing pursuant to (but only pursuant to) one or more
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreements and (B) participate in discussions or
negotiations with the Third Party making such Acquisition Proposal regarding
such Acquisition Proposal; provided, however, that any material non-public
information concerning the Company or its Subsidiaries provided or made
available to any Third Party shall, to the extent not previously provided or
made available to Parent or Merger Sub, be provided or made available to
Parent or Merger Sub as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in no event
later than twenty four (24) hours) after it is provided or made available to
such Third Party, except to the extent providing Parent or Merger Sub with
such information would violate any applicable Law.

(c) From and after the date hereof, the Company shall promptly (and in any
event within twenty four (24) hours) notify Parent in the event that the
Company receives any Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall notify Parent
promptly (and in any event within twenty four (24) hours) of the identity of
such Person and provide to Parent a copy of such Acquisition Proposal (or,
where no such copy is available, a reasonable description of such Acquisition
Proposal). Without limiting the foregoing, the Company shall promptly (and in
any event within twenty four (24) hours after such determination) advise
Parent if the Company determines to begin providing information or to engage
in discussions or negotiations concerning an Acquisition Proposal pursuant to
Section 5.3(b).



44 



(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 5.3(a), if
the Company has received a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that the
Company Board (or any duly authorized committee thereof) determines in good
faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal
counsel, constitutes a Superior Proposal, the Company Board may at any time
prior to the Acceptance Time, (i) effect a Change of Board Recommendation with
respect to such Superior Proposal and/or (ii) terminate this Agreement
pursuant to Section 7.1(f), in either case subject to the requirements of this
Section 5.3(d). The Company shall not be entitled to effect a Change of Board
Recommendation pursuant to this Section 5.3(d) or terminate this Agreement
pursuant to Section 7.1(f) unless the Company shall have provided to Parent at
least three (3) Business Days' prior written notice (the "Notice Period") of
the Company's intention to take such action, which notice shall specify the
material terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal, and shall have
provided to Parent a copy of the available proposed transaction agreement to
be entered into in respect of such Acquisition Proposal, and:

(i) during the Notice Period, if requested by Parent, the Company shall have,
and shall have caused its legal and financial advisors to have, engaged in
good faith negotiations with Parent regarding any amendment to this Agreement
proposed in writing by Parent and intended to cause the relevant Acquisition
Proposal to no longer constitute a Superior Proposal; and

(ii) the Company Board shall have considered in good faith any adjustments
and/or proposed amendments to this Agreement (including a change to the price
terms hereof) and the other agreements contemplated hereby that may be
irrevocably offered in writing by Parent (the "Proposed Changed Terms") no
later than 11:59 a.m., New York City time, on the last day of the Notice
Period and shall have determined in good faith that the Superior Proposal
would continue to constitute a Superior Proposal if such Proposed Changed
Terms were to be given effect.

In the event of any material revisions to such Superior Proposal offered in
writing by the party making such Superior Proposal, the Company shall be
required to deliver a new written notice to Parent and to again comply with
the requirements of this Section 5.3(d) with respect to such new written
notice, except that the Notice Period shall be two (2) Business Days with
respect to any such revised Superior Proposal.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 5.3(a), the
Company Board (or a duly authorized committee thereof) may at any time prior
to the Acceptance Time, effect a Change of Board Recommendation if (i) the
Company Board (or a duly authorized committee thereof) determines that an
Intervening Event has occurred and is continuing and (ii) the Company Board
(or a duly authorized committee thereof) determines in good faith, after
consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to effect a Change
of Board Recommendation in response to such Intervening Event would be
reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the
stockholders of the Company, but such Change of Board Recommendation shall not
occur until a time that is after the third Business Day following Parent's
receipt of written notice from the Company advising Parent of the



45 



material facts relating to such Intervening Event and stating that it intends
to make a Change of Board Recommendation and provided that (A) during such
three (3) Business Day period the Company has negotiated in good faith with
Parent to the extent Parent wishes to negotiate to make such adjustments to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement as would enable the Company Board
to proceed with the Company Board Recommendation and (B) at the end of such
three (3) Business Day period, the Company Board maintains its determination
described in this clause (ii) (after taking into account any adjustments
offered in writing by Parent to the material terms and conditions of this
Agreement)

(f) Nothing contained in this Section 5.3 shall prohibit the Company Board
from (i) disclosing to the stockholders of the Company a position contemplated
by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 and Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated
under the Exchange Act; or (ii) making any disclosure to the stockholders of
the Company if the Company Board (or any duly authorized committee thereof)
determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that
the failure to make such disclosure would be reasonably likely to be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties or violate applicable Law. The issuance
by the Company or the Company Board of a "stop, look and listen" statement
pending disclosure of its position, as contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and
14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act, shall not constitute a Change of
Board Recommendation.

(g) For purposes of this Agreement:

(i) "Acquisition Proposal" means any offer or proposal from a Third Party
concerning (A) a merger, consolidation, share exchange, or other business
combination or similar transaction involving the Company, (B) a sale, lease or
other disposition by merger, consolidation, business combination, share
exchange, joint venture or otherwise, directly or indirectly, of assets of the
Company (including Equity Interests of any Subsidiary of the Company) or its
Subsidiaries representing fifteen percent (15%) or more of the consolidated
assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, based on their fair market value
as determined in good faith by the Company Board (or any duly authorized
committee thereof), (C) an issuance (including by way of merger,
consolidation, business combination or share exchange), directly or
indirectly, of Equity Interests representing fifteen percent (15%) or more of
the voting power of the Company, or (D) any combination of the foregoing (in
each case, other than the Offer and the Merger).

(ii) "Intervening Event" means any event, change, effect, development, state
of facts, condition or occurrence (including any acceleration or deceleration
of existing changes or developments) that is material to the Company and its
Subsidiaries that (A) was not known nor reasonably foreseeable to the Company
Board as of or prior to the date of this Agreement, (B) is first occurring
after the date of this Agreement and (C) does not involve or relate to an
Acquisition Proposal.

(iii) "Superior Proposal" means a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal
(except the references therein to "fifteen percent (15%)" shall be replaced by
"fifty percent (50%)") that the Company Board (or a duly authorized committee
thereof) determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial
advisors and outside legal counsel, taking into



46 



account all legal, financial and regulatory aspects of such Acquisition
Proposal that the Company Board determines to be relevant thereto and such
other factors as the Company Board (or any duly authorized committee thereof)
considers in good faith to be appropriate (including the conditionality,
timing and likelihood of consummation of such proposals), is more favorable
from a financial point of view to the Company's stockholders than the Offer
and the Merger.

5.4 Appropriate Action; Consents; Filings.

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
each of the parties agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions that are necessary, proper or advisable under
this Agreement and applicable Law to consummate and make effective the Offer,
the Merger and the other Transactions contemplated by this Agreement as
promptly as practicable, including using reasonable best efforts to accomplish
the following: (i) obtain all consents, approvals or waivers from, or
participation in other discussions or negotiations with, third parties,
including under any Contract to which the Company or Parent or any of their
respective Subsidiaries is party or by which such Person or any of their
respective properties or assets may be bound, (ii) obtain all necessary or
advisable actions or nonactions, waivers, consents, approvals, orders and
authorizations from Governmental Entities (including those in connection with
applicable Competition Laws), make all necessary or advisable registrations,
declarations and filings with and take all steps as may be necessary to obtain
an approval or waiver from, or to avoid any Proceeding by, any Governmental
Entity (including in connection with applicable Competition Laws), (iii)
submit promptly any additional information requested by any Governmental
Entity that is required or advisable and respond as practicable to any
inquiries or requests received from any Governmental Entity, (iv) resist,
contest or defend any Proceeding (including administrative or judicial
Proceedings) challenging the Offer, the Merger or the completion of the
Transactions, including seeking to have vacated, lifted, reversed or
overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order (whether temporary,
preliminary or permanent) that is in effect and that could restrict, prevent
or prohibit consummation of the Transactions, and (v) execute and deliver any
additional instruments necessary to consummate the Transactions and fully to
carry out the purposes of this Agreement. Each of the parties shall furnish to
each other party such necessary information and reasonable assistance as such
other party may reasonably request in connection with the foregoing. Subject
to applicable Law relating to the exchange of information, the Company and
Parent shall have the right to review in advance, and to the extent reasonably
practicable each shall consult with the other in connection with any filing
made with, or substantive written materials submitted to, any third party
and/or any Governmental Entity in connection with the Offer, the Merger and
the Transactions. In exercising the foregoing rights, each of the Company and
Parent shall act reasonably and as promptly as practicable. Subject to
applicable Law and the instructions of any Governmental Entity, the Company
and Parent shall keep each other reasonably apprised of the status of matters
relating to the completion of the Transactions, including promptly furnishing
the other with copies of notices or other written substantive communications
received by the Company or Parent, as the case may be, or any of their
respective Subsidiaries, from any Governmental Entity and/or third party with
respect to such transactions, and, to the extent practicable under the
circumstances, shall provide the other party and its counsel with the
opportunity to participate in any meeting with any Governmental



47 



Entity in respect of any substantive filing, investigation or other inquiry in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby. In furtherance and not
in limitation of the foregoing, each of the Company and Parent shall, and
shall cause their respective affiliates to, make or cause to be made all
filings required or advisable under applicable Competition Laws with respect
to the Transactions as promptly as practicable and, in any event, file all
required HSR Act notifications within ten (10) Business Days after the date of
this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Section 5.4(a), subject to Parent's obligations under this Section 5.4(a),
Parent shall devise and determine the strategy to be pursued for obtaining any
clearances, approvals or consents under any applicable Competition Laws in
connection with the Offer and the Merger, including with respect to any
filings, notifications, notices, reports, submissions and communications with
any antitrust regulatory authority, in each case subject to good faith
consultations with the Company.

(b) Without limiting this Section 5.4, Parent agrees to use its reasonable
best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, any and all steps and to make, or
cause to be made, any and all undertakings necessary to resolve, avoid or
eliminate each and every impediment under any applicable Competition Law
asserted by any Governmental Entity with respect to the Offer and the Merger
so as to enable the Closing to occur as promptly as practicable (and in any
event, no later than the Extended Outside Date), including (i) proposing,
negotiating, committing to, and effecting, by consent decree, hold separate
order, or otherwise, the sale, divestiture, licensing or disposition of any
assets, properties or businesses of Parent or the Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries or (ii) accepting any operational restrictions or
otherwise taking or committing to take actions that limit Parent's or any
Parent Subsidiary's freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to
retain, any of the assets, properties, licenses, rights, product lines,
operations or businesses of Parent or the Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries in each case, as may be required in order to avoid the entry of,
or to effect the lifting or dissolution of, any injunction, temporary
restraining order, or other Order in any suit or Proceeding, which would
otherwise have the effect of preventing or delaying the Closing, as
applicable. If such efforts fail to resolve, avoid or eliminate each and every
impediment under any applicable Competition Law that may be asserted by any
Governmental Entity with respect to the Offer and the Merger so as to enable
the Closing to occur, then Parent shall use its best efforts to defend through
litigation on the merits any claim asserted in court by any party in order to
avoid entry of, or to have vacated or terminated, any Order (whether
temporary, preliminary or permanent) that would prevent the Closing from
occurring as promptly as practicable (and in any event, no later than the
Extended Outside Date). Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision
of this Agreement, none of Parent, the Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries shall be required to agree to any sale, transfer, license,
separate holding, divestiture or other disposition of, or to any prohibition
of or any limitation on the acquisition, ownership, operation, effective
control or exercise of full rights of ownership, or other modification of
rights in respect of, any assets, properties or businesses of Parent or the
Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries that, in each case, is not
conditioned on the consummation of the Transactions.

(c) Neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall directly or indirectly acquire or
agree to acquire (by merging or consolidating with, or by purchasing a
substantial portion of the assets of or equity in, or by any other manner),
any Person or portion thereof, or otherwise



48 



acquire or agree to acquire any assets, if the entering into a definitive
agreement relating to, or the consummation of, such acquisition, merger or
consolidation would reasonably be expected to (i) impose any material delay in
the obtaining of, or materially increase the risk of not obtaining, any
permits, orders or other approvals of any Governmental Entity necessary to
consummate the Transactions or the expiration or termination of any applicable
waiting period, (ii) materially increase the risk of any Governmental Entity
seeking an Order prohibiting the consummation of the Transactions, (iii)
materially increase the risk of not being able to remove any such Order on
appeal or otherwise, or (iv) materially delay or prevent the consummation of
the Transactions.

(d) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Parent or Merger Sub,
directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the operations of the
Company prior to the consummation of the Merger. Prior to the Effective Time,
the Company shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, complete unilateral control and supervision over its business
operations.

5.5 Certain Notices. From and after the date of this Agreement until the
earlier of the Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with Article 7, unless prohibited by applicable Law, each party
shall give prompt notice to the other parties if any of the following occur:
(a) receipt of any notice or other communication in writing from any Person
alleging that the consent or approval of such Person is or may be required in
connection with the Transactions; (b) receipt of any notice or other
communication from any Governmental Entity or NYSE (or any other securities
market) in connection with the Transactions; or (c) such party becoming aware
of the occurrence of an event that could prevent or delay beyond the Outside
Date the consummation of the Transactions or that would reasonably be expected
to result in any of the conditions set forth in this Agreement not being
satisfied. Any such notice pursuant to this Section 5.5 shall not affect any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement
and any failure to make such notice (in and of itself) shall not be taken into
account in determining whether the conditions set forth in this Agreement have
been satisfied or give rise to any right of termination set forth in Article
7. The Company will also notify and keep Parent reasonably apprised of
communications it receives from, or discussions it has with, any stockholder,
if such communications or discussions are likely to be material to the
occurrence of the Acceptance Time.

5.6 Public Announcements. So long as this Agreement is in effect, Parent and
Merger Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other, shall not issue
any press release or make any public statement with respect to the Offer, the
Merger or this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other party
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed),
except as may be required by applicable Law or the rules or regulations of any
applicable United States securities exchange or regulatory or governmental
body to which the relevant party is subject, in which case the party required
to make the release or announcement shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to allow each other party reasonable time to comment on such release
or announcement in advance of such issuance. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the restrictions set forth in this Section 5.6 shall not apply to any public
release or public announcement (x) made or proposed to be made by the Company
in connection with an Acquisition Proposal, a Superior Proposal or a Change of
Board



49 



Recommendation or any action taken pursuant thereto, in each case, that does
not violate Section 5.3 or (y) in connection with any dispute between the
parties regarding this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. The
press release announcing the execution and delivery of this Agreement shall
not be issued prior to the approval of each of the Company and Parent. The
Company shall (i) file one or more current reports on Form 8-K with the SEC
attaching the announcement press release and a copy of this Agreement as
exhibits and (ii) file a pre-commencement communication on Schedule 14D-9 with
the SEC attaching the announcement press release. Parent and Merger Sub shall
file a pre-commencement communication on Schedule TO with the SEC attaching
the announcement press release. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Section 5.6, each of the parties may make public statements in response
to questions by press, analysts, investors, business partners or those
attending industry conferences or financial analyst conference calls, so long
as such statements are not inconsistent with previous press releases, public
disclosures or public statements made jointly by Parent and the Company.

5.7 Employee Benefit Matters

(a) During the period such Continuing Employee remains employed with the
Surviving Corporation following the Closing, Parent shall provide or cause the
Parent Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation, to provide to each
employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the
Effective Time (each a "Continuing Employee"), (i) during the period
commencing at the Closing Date and ending on the date that is twelve (12)
months following the Closing Date, base salary or wage rate, as applicable,
and a target annual cash bonus opportunity that is not less than the base
salary or wage rate, as applicable, and target annual cash bonus opportunity
provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time
and (ii) during the period commencing at the Closing Date and ending on
December 31, 2020, other compensation and benefits (excluding equity and
equity-based compensation, defined benefit pension and retiree welfare
benefits) that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to the other
compensation and benefits (excluding equity and equity-based compensation,
defined benefit pension and retiree welfare benefits) provided to such
Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(b) Without limiting the generality of Section 5.7(a), from and after the
Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Parent Subsidiaries,
including the Surviving Corporation, to, assume and honor each of the
Company's employment, severance, retention and termination plans, policies,
programs, agreements and arrangements, in each case, as in effect at the
Effective Time, including with respect to any payments, benefits or rights
arising as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (either
alone or in combination with any other event), in each case, which may be
amended or terminated by Parent or the applicable Parent Subsidiary in
accordance with the terms of the applicable plan, policy, program, agreement
or arrangement; provided, however, that if within 12 months following the
Effective Time, Parent or any Parent Subsidiary discontinues the Company's
severance practices, then the Company Employees shall be eligible for
severance benefits that are substantially comparable to those provided to
similarly situated employees of Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries.



50 



(c) With respect to benefit plans maintained by Parent or any of the Parent
Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation (including any vacation,
paid time-off and severance plans), Parent shall, or shall cause the
applicable Parent Subsidiary to, use reasonable best efforts to cause, for all
purposes, including determining eligibility to participate, level of benefits,
vesting and benefit accruals, each Continuing Employee's service with the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, as reflected in the Company's records, to
be treated as service with Parent or any of the Parent Subsidiaries, including
the Surviving Corporation, to the extent such service would have been
recognized under the comparable Company Benefit Plan immediately prior to the
Effective Time; provided, however, that such service need not be recognized to
the extent that such recognition would result in any duplication of benefits
and the foregoing service credit shall not apply with respect to any defined
benefit plan or retiree medical plan.

(d) Parent shall, or shall cause the Parent Subsidiaries (including the
Surviving Corporation) to, use reasonable best efforts to waive, or cause to
be waived, any pre-existing condition limitations, exclusions, evidence of
insurability, actively‑at‑work requirements and waiting periods under any
welfare benefit plan maintained by Parent or any of the Parent Subsidiaries in
which Continuing Employees (and their eligible dependents) will be eligible to
participate from and after the Effective Time, except to the extent that such
pre-existing condition limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements
and waiting periods would not have been satisfied or waived under the
comparable Company Benefit Plan immediately prior to the Effective Time.
Parent shall, or shall cause the Parent Subsidiaries, including the Surviving
Corporation, to use commercially reasonable efforts to recognize, or cause to
be recognized, the dollar amount of all co-payments, deductibles and similar
expenses incurred by each Continuing Employee (and his or her eligible
dependents) during the calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs for
purposes of satisfying such year's deductible and co-payment limitations under
the relevant welfare benefit plans in which such Continuing Employee (and
dependents) will be eligible to participate from and after the Effective Time.

(e) The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to: (i) obtain the
prior written consent of Parent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed) prior to making any broad-based communication or
written communications to employees (including website postings) pertaining to
employment, compensation or benefit matters that are or may be affected by the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) provide Parent with a
copy of the intended communication in advance of the intended date any such
communication is delivered or made available by the Company in order to
provide Parent with a reasonable opportunity to review a particular
communication in the given circumstances; provided, that the foregoing shall
not apply to any later communication of information that the same as, or is
substantially similar to, information with respect to which Parent has
previously provided its consent.

(f) Without limiting the generality of Section 8.10, the provisions of this
Section 5.7 are solely for the benefit of the parties to this Agreement, and
no current or former Service Provider (including any legal representative,
beneficiary or dependent thereof) shall be regarded for any purpose as a
third-party beneficiary of this Agreement, and no



51 



provision of this Section 5.7, express or implied, shall confer upon any such
individual or any other Person any rights or remedies under this Agreement or
any rights or remedies under any Company Benefit Plan that such Service
Provider, representative, beneficiary, dependent or other Person would not
otherwise have under the terms of any Company Benefit Plan. Nothing contained
in this Agreement, express or implied, shall: (i) guarantee employment for any
period of time, or compensation or benefits of any nature or kind whatsoever;
(ii) preclude the ability of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or their
respective affiliates to terminate the employment of any Continuing Employee
at any time and for any reason; (iii) require Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective affiliates to continue any Company
Benefit Plan or other employee benefit plans, programs or Contracts or prevent
the amendment, modification or termination thereof following the Closing; or
(iv) amend any Company Benefit Plans or other employee benefit plans, programs
or Contracts.

5.8 Indemnification.

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, indemnify, defend and hold harmless, and shall
advance expenses as incurred, to the fullest extent permitted under (i)
applicable Law, (ii) the Company Charter, the Company Bylaws or similar
organization documents in effect as of the date of this Agreement and (iii)
any Contract of the Company or its Subsidiaries in effect as of the date of
this Agreement, each present and former director and officer of the Company
and its Subsidiaries and each of their respective employees who serves as a
fiduciary of a Company Benefit Plan (in each case, when acting in such
capacity) (each, an "Indemnitee" and, collectively, the "Indemnitees") against
any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees), judgments,
settlements, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities incurred in
connection with any Proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, whenever asserted, arising out of or
pertaining to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time,
including in connection with this Agreement or the Transactions; provided,
however, that any Person to whom expenses are advanced may be required to
provide an unsecured undertaking to repay such advance if it is ultimately
determined that such Person is not entitled to indemnification.

(b) Parent agrees that all rights to exculpation, indemnification and
advancement of expenses arising from, relating to, or otherwise in respect of,
acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including in
connection with this Agreement or the Transactions) existing as of the
Effective Time in favor of the current or former directors or officers of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries and each of their respective employees who
serves as a fiduciary of a Company Benefit Plan as provided in its
certificates of incorporation, bylaws or other organizational documents shall
survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance
with their terms. For a period of no less than six (6) years from the
Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, and the
Surviving Corporation shall, maintain in effect the exculpation,
indemnification and advancement of expenses provisions of the applicable
party's certificate of incorporation and bylaws or similar organization
documents in effect as of the date of this Agreement or in any Contract of the
Company or its Subsidiaries with any of their respective directors, officers
or employees in effect as of the date of this Agreement, and shall not amend,
repeal or otherwise modify any such



52 



provisions in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of
any individuals who immediately before the Effective Time were current or
former directors, officers or employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries;
provided, however, that all rights to exculpation, indemnification and
advancement of expenses in respect of any Proceeding pending or asserted or
any claim made within such period shall continue until the final disposition
of such Proceeding; provided, further, that any Person to whom expenses are
advanced may be required to provide an unsecured undertaking to repay such
advance if it is ultimately determined that such Person is not entitled to
indemnification.

(c) For six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall be jointly and severally responsible for
maintaining for the benefit of the directors and officers of the Company, as
of the date of this Agreement and as of the Closing Date, an insurance and
indemnification policy that provides coverage for events occurring at or prior
to the Effective Time (the "DandO Insurance") that is substantially equivalent
to and in any event not less favorable in the aggregate than the existing
policy of the Company, or, if substantially equivalent insurance coverage is
unavailable, the best available coverage; provided, however, that Parent and
the Surviving Corporation shall not be required to pay an annual premium for
the DandO Insurance in excess of three hundred percent (300%) of the last annual
premium paid by the Company prior to the date of this Agreement, it being
understood that if the total premiums payable for such insurance coverage
exceeds such amount, Parent shall obtain a policy with the greatest coverage
available for a cost equal to such amount. The provisions of the immediately
preceding sentence shall be deemed to have been satisfied if prepaid policies
have been obtained by the Company prior to the Effective Time, which policies
provide such directors and officers with such coverage for an aggregate period
of six (6) years with respect to claims arising from facts or events that
occurred on or before the Effective Time, including in respect of this
Agreement or the Transactions.

(d) In the event that either Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of its
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person
and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all
of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in each case, Parent
shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, cause proper provision to
be made so that such successor or assign shall expressly assume the
obligations set forth in this Section 5.8.

(e) The provisions of this Section 5.8 are (i) intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnitee, his or her heirs and his or
her representatives and (ii) in addition to, and not in substitution for, any
other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such individual may
have under the Company Charter, the Company Bylaws or similar organization
documents in effect as of the date of this Agreement or in any Contract of the
Company or its Subsidiaries in effect as of the date of this Agreement. The
obligations of Parent under this Section 5.8 shall not be terminated or
modified in such a manner as to adversely affect the rights of any Indemnitee
to whom this Section 5.8 applies unless (x) such termination or modification
is required by applicable Law or (y) the affected Indemnitee shall have
consented in writing to such termination or modification (it being



53 



expressly agreed that the Indemnitees to whom this Section 5.8 applies shall
be third party beneficiaries of this Section 5.8).

(f) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall
release, waive or impair any rights to directors' and officers' insurance
claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any of their respective directors,
officers or employees, it being understood and agreed that the indemnification
or advancement of expenses provided for in this Section 5.8 is not prior to or
in substitution for any such claims under such policies.

5.9 Parent Agreements Concerning Merger Sub. Parent hereby guarantees the due,
prompt and faithful payment, performance and discharge by Merger Sub of, and
the compliance by Merger Sub with, all of the covenants, agreements,
obligations and undertakings of Merger Sub under this Agreement in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement, and covenants and agrees to take all actions
necessary or advisable to ensure such payment, performance and discharge by
Merger Sub hereunder.

5.10 Takeover Statutes. If any state takeover Law or state Law that purports
to limit or restrict business combinations or the ability to acquire or vote
Shares or Preferred Shares (including any "control share acquisition," "fair
price," "business combination" or other similar takeover Law) becomes or is
deemed to be applicable to the Company, Parent or Merger Sub, the Offer, the
Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement, then the
Company and the Company Board shall take all action reasonably available to it
to render such Law inapplicable to the foregoing.

5.11 Section 16 Matters. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take
all such steps as may be reasonably necessary to cause any dispositions of
Shares or Preferred Shares (including derivative securities with respect to
Shares or Preferred Shares) resulting from the Transactions by each individual
who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange
Act with respect to the Company, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated
under the Exchange Act.

5.12 Stockholder Litigation. The Company shall give Parent reasonable
opportunity to participate, review or comment on all material filings or
responses to be made by the Company in the defense or settlement of any
stockholder litigation against the Company and/or its directors and officers
relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the
Offer, the Merger and no such settlement of any stockholder litigation shall
be agreed to without Parent's prior written consent (which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). The Company shall promptly
notify Parent of any such litigation and shall keep Parent reasonably and
promptly informed with respect to the status thereof.

5.13 Stock Exchange Delisting. The Surviving Corporation shall cause the
Company's securities to be de-listed from NYSE and de-registered under the
Exchange Act as promptly as practicable following the Effective Time, and
prior to the Effective Time the Company shall reasonably cooperate with Parent
with respect thereto. Prior to the Closing, the



54 



Company shall in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice
prepare quarterly and annual reports pursuant to the Exchange Act such that if
any such reports are required to be filed after the Closing and prior to the
deregistration of the Company's securities under the Exchange Act, the Company
will be reasonably capable of timely filing such reports.

5.14 FIRPTA Certificate. On the Closing Date or, if earlier, no less than
thirty (30) days prior to the Closing, the Company shall deliver to Parent a
statement and notice to the IRS in accordance with Treasury Regulations
Sections 1.1445-2(c) and 1.897-2(h), dated within thirty (30) days prior to
the Closing Date and in the form contemplated by Exhibit C, which Parent shall
deliver to the IRS on behalf of the Company upon Closing. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the performance of the covenant in
this Section 5.14 shall not be a condition to the consummation of the Merger.

ARTICLE 6 
CONDITIONS TO CONSUMMATION OF THE MERGER

6.1 Conditions to Obligations of Each Party Under This Agreement. The
respective obligations of each party to consummate the Merger shall be subject
to the satisfaction (or waiver, if permissible under Law) at or prior to the
Effective Time of each of the following conditions:

(a) Merger Sub shall have irrevocably accepted for payment all Shares and
Preferred Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn in the Offer.

(b) The consummation of the Merger shall not then be restrained, enjoined or
prohibited by any Order (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) of a
court of competent jurisdiction or any other Governmental Entity and there
shall not be in effect any Law enacted or promulgated by any Governmental
Entity that prevents the consummation of the Merger.

6.2 Frustration of Closing Conditions. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub may rely
on the failure of any conditions set forth in Sections 6.1 to be satisfied if
the primary cause of such failure was the failure of Parent or Merger Sub to
perform any of its obligations under this Agreement. The Company may not rely
on the failure of any conditions set forth in Sections 6.1 to be satisfied if
the primary cause of such failure was the failure of the Company to perform
any of its obligations under this Agreement.

ARTICLE 7 
TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER

7.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated, and the Offer, the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated hereby may be abandoned at any time
prior to the Effective Time only as follows:

(a) By mutual written consent of Parent and the Company at any time prior to
the Effective Time;



55 



(b) By either the Company or Parent, if the Offer (as it may have been
extended pursuant to Section 1.1) expires as a result of the non-satisfaction
of any condition to the Offer set forth in Annex I in a circumstance where
Merger Sub has no further obligation to extend the Offer pursuant to Section
1.1; provided, however, that neither the Company nor Parent shall be permitted
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(b) if there has been
any material breach by such party of its material representations, warranties
or covenants contained in this Agreement, and such breach has primarily caused
or resulted in the non-satisfaction of any condition to the Offer set forth in
Annex I;

(c) By either the Company or Parent, if any court of competent jurisdiction or
other Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction shall have issued an Order
or taken any other action, in each case, permanently restraining, enjoining or
otherwise prohibiting, (i) prior to the Acceptance Time or (ii) prior to the
Effective Time, the consummation of the Offer or the Merger, and such Order or
other action shall have become final and non-appealable, provided, however,
that neither the Company nor Parent shall be permitted to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(c) if such Order or other action is
primarily the result of (x) a breach by such party of its representations and
warranties or (y) the failure by such party to comply with the covenants
applicable to such party, in each case, contained in this Agreement;

(d) By either the Company or Parent if the Acceptance Time shall not have
occurred on or before the Outside Date; provided, however, that neither the
Company nor Parent shall be permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this Section 7.1(d) if there has been any material breach by such party of its
material representations, warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement,
and such breach has primarily caused or resulted in the failure of the Closing
to have occurred prior to the Outside Date;

(e) By Parent, at any time prior to the Acceptance Time, if (i) the Company
Board or any authorized committee thereof shall have effected a Change of
Board Recommendation, whether or not in compliance with Section 5.3 (it being
understood and agreed that any written notice of the Company's intention to
make a Change of Board Recommendation prior to effecting such Change of Board
Recommendation in accordance with Section 5.3(d) or Section 5.3(e) shall not
result in Parent or Merger Sub having any termination rights pursuant to this
Section 7.1(e)), or (ii) the Company shall have entered into an Alternative
Acquisition Agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal;

(f) By the Company, at any time prior to the Acceptance Time, if the Company
Board or any authorized committee thereof authorizes the Company to enter into
an Alternative Acquisition Agreement, but only if the Company shall have
complied in all material respects with its obligations under Section 5.3 with
respect to such Superior Proposal; provided, however, that the Company shall
prior to or concurrently with such termination pay the Company Termination Fee
to or for the account of Parent pursuant to Section 7.3;

(g) By Parent, at any time prior to the Acceptance Time, if: (i) there has
been a breach by the Company of its representations, warranties or covenants
contained in this Agreement, in each case, such that any condition to the
Offer contained in paragraphs (c)(ii)



56 



or (c)(iii) of Annex I is not reasonably capable of being satisfied while such
breach is continuing, (ii) Parent shall have delivered to the Company written
notice of such breach and (iii) such breach is not capable of cure in a manner
sufficient to allow satisfaction of the conditions in paragraphs (c)(ii) or
(c)(iii) of Annex I prior to the applicable Outside Date or at least thirty
(30) days shall have elapsed since the date of delivery of such written notice
to the Company and such breach shall not have been cured in all material
respects; provided, however, that Parent shall not be permitted to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(g) if there has been any material
breach by Parent or Merger Sub of its material representations, warranties or
covenants contained in this Agreement, and such breach shall not have been
cured in all material respects;

(h) By the Company, at any time prior to the Acceptance Time, if: (i) there
has been a breach by Parent or Merger Sub of any of its representations,
warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement that has or would
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent
Material Adverse effect, (ii) the Company shall have delivered to Parent
written notice of such breach and (iii) either such breach is not capable of
cure prior to the applicable Outside Date or at least thirty (30) days shall
have elapsed since the date of delivery of such written notice to Parent and
such breach shall not have been cured in all material respects; provided,
however, that the Company shall not be permitted to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 7.1(h) if there has been any material breach by the
Company of its material representations, warranties or covenants contained in
this Agreement, and such breach shall not have been cured in all material
respects; or

(i) By the Company, if Merger Sub fails to accept for purchase Shares or
Preferred Shares validly tendered (and not withdrawn) pursuant to the Offer in
violation of the terms of this Agreement.

7.2 Effect of Termination. In the event of termination of this Agreement by
either the Company or Parent as provided in Section 7.1, written notice
thereof shall be given to the other party or parties, specifying the
provisions hereof pursuant to which such termination is made and the basis
therefor described in reasonable detail and this Agreement shall forthwith
become void and have no further force and effect (other than the first
sentence of Section 5.2(b), Section 7.2, Section 7.3 and Article 8, each of
which shall survive termination of this Agreement), and there shall be no
liability or obligation on the part of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company or
their respective Subsidiaries, officers, directors or Representatives, except
with respect to the first sentence of Section 5.2(b), Section 7.2, Section 7.3
and Article 8; provided that nothing in this Section 7.2 shall relieve any
party from liabilities or damages incurred or suffered as a result of Fraud or
a Willful and Material Breach by the Company, on the one hand, or Parent or
Merger Sub, on the other hand, of any of their respective representations,
warranties, covenants or other agreements set forth in this Agreement.

7.3 Company Termination Fee.

(a) The parties hereto agree that if this Agreement is terminated by Parent
pursuant to Section 7.1(e) or the Company pursuant to Section 7.1(f), then the
Company shall pay to Parent prior to or concurrently with such termination, in
the case of a termination by



57 



the Company, or within two (2) Business Days thereafter, in the case of a
termination by Parent, the Company Termination Fee. The "Company Termination
Fee" means $20,000,000.

(b) The parties hereto agree that if (i) this Agreement is terminated pursuant
to (A) Section 7.1(b) or Section 7.1(d) and, at the time of such termination,
all of the conditions to the Offer set forth in Annex I have been satisfied
other than the Minimum Condition and those conditions that by their nature are
to be satisfied at the Closing, or (B) Section 7.1(g), and, at the time of
such termination, the Minimum Condition shall not have been satisfied, (ii)
after the date hereof and prior to the date of termination, an Acquisition
Proposal has been publicly announced and not withdrawn prior to the date of
termination and (iii) the Company enters into a definitive agreement with
respect to such Acquisition Proposal or consummates any Acquisition Proposal
within nine (9) months after such termination, then the Company shall pay the
Company Termination Fee, no later than two (2) Business Days after the earlier
of the entry into a definitive agreement with respect to such transaction or
the consummation of such transaction. For purposes of this Section 7.3(b), the
term "Acquisition Proposal" shall have the meaning assigned to such term in
Section 5.3(g)(i), except that the references to "fifteen percent (15%)" shall
be deemed to be references to "fifty percent (50%)".

(c) All payments under this Section 7.3 shall be made by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by Parent, or
in the absence of such designation, an account established for the sole
benefit of Parent.

(d) Each of the parties acknowledges that the agreements contained in this
Section 7.3 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and that without these agreements, Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company would not enter into this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, in no
event shall the Company be required to pay the Company Termination Fee on more
than one occasion.

(e) In circumstances where the Company Termination Fee is payable in
accordance with this Section 7.3, Parent's receipt of the Company Termination
Fee (if received) from or on behalf of the Company shall be Parent's and
Merger Sub's sole and exclusive remedy (whether based in contract, tort or
strict liability, by the enforcement of any assessment, by any legal or
equitable proceeding, by virtue of any statute, regulation or applicable Laws
or otherwise) against the Company and its Subsidiaries and any of their
respective former, current or future direct or indirect equity holders,
general or limited partners, controlling persons, stockholders, members,
managers, directors, officers, employees, agents, affiliates or assignees for
all losses and damages suffered as a result of the failure of the Merger or
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated, for
any breach or failure to perform hereunder or otherwise, and upon payment of
such amount, no such Person shall have any further liability or obligation
relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby; provided that this Section 7.3(e) shall not relieve the Company or its
Subsidiaries from liability for Fraud.

7.4 Amendment. This Agreement may be amended by each of the Company, Parent
and Merger Sub by written agreement executed and delivered by duly authorized
officers of the respective parties at any time prior to the Effective Time.



58 



7.5 Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective Time, Parent and Merger Sub, on
the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, may (a) extend the time for
the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other, (b)
waive any breach of the representations and warranties of the other contained
herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto or (c) waive compliance by
the other with any of the agreements or covenants contained herein. Any such
extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed by the party or parties to be bound thereby, but such extension
or waiver or failure to insist on strict compliance with an obligation,
covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel
with respect to, any subsequent or other failure.

ARTICLE 8

illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in

OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 8.12(c).

8.13 Counterparts. This Agreement may be signed in any number of counterparts,
including by facsimile or other electronic transmission each of which shall be
an original, with the same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were
upon the same instrument. This Agreement shall become effective when each
party hereto shall have received a counterpart hereof signed by all of the
other parties hereto. Until and unless each party has received a counterpart
hereof signed by the other party hereto, this Agreement shall have no effect
and no party shall have any right or obligation hereunder (whether by virtue
of any other oral or written agreement or other communication). The exchange
of a fully executed Agreement (in counterparts or otherwise) by electronic
transmission in .PDF format or by facsimile shall be sufficient to bind the
parties to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

8.14 Specific Performance. The parties hereto agree that if any of the
provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached, irreparable damage would occur, no
adequate remedy at Law would exist and damages would be difficult to
determine, and accordingly, (i) the parties shall be entitled to an injunction
or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to specific
performance of the terms hereof, this being in addition to any other remedy to
which they are entitled at Law or in equity, (ii) the parties waive any
requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with the
obtaining of any specific performance or injunctive relief and (iii) the
parties will waive, in any action for specific performance, the defense of
adequacy of a remedy at Law. The Company's or Parent's pursuit of specific
performance at any time will not be deemed an election of remedies or waiver
of the right to pursue any other right or remedy to which such party may be
entitled, including the right to pursue remedies for liabilities or damages
incurred or suffered by the other party in the case of Fraud or Willful and
Material Breach of this Agreement.

all material respects as of such date or time); (ii) contained in Section
3.2(a) (Capitalization) of the Merger Agreement, shall fail to be true and

Agreement and applicable Laws, including the applicable rules and regulations

limitation of, the rights and obligations of Merger Sub to extend, terminate,
amend and/or modify the Offer in accordance with the terms and conditions of
the Merger Agreement and the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC. The
failure by Parent or Merger Sub at any time to exercise any of the foregoing
rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any such right and each such right
shall be deemed an ongoing right that may be asserted at any time and from
time to time.
