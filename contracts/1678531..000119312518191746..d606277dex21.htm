conditions set forth in Article 6 remain satisfied or waived on such third
Business Day (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied by actions to be taken at the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of such conditions); _provided_ that, if the Marketing
Period has not ended at the time of the satisfaction or waiver of the

less than three Business Days prior written notice to the Company and (ii)
the third Business Day following the final day of the Marketing Period, or, if
later, the day the Closing would otherwise be required to occur pursuant to

under this clause (a) occur prior to the expiration of the Healthcare Approval
Waiting Period without Parents prior written consent, or (b) at such other

_Certificate of Merger_ ") to be executed, acknowledged and filed with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in accordance with Section 251 of
the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective at such time as the Certificate
of Merger has been duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware or at such later date or time as may be agreed by the Company and

incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in
accordance with the DGCL and such certificate of incorporation; and (b) the
bylaws of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time (but
amended so that the name of the Surviving Corporation shall be "Envision
Healthcare Corporation"), as so amended, shall be the bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with the DGCL and such
bylaws.

Section 1.6  _Directors of the Surviving Corporation_. Subject to applicable
Law, the directors of Merger Sub as of immediately prior to the Effective Time

ARTICLE 2

 

CONVERSION OF SHARES; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

 

Section 2.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of the Company, Merger Sub or the holders of any securities of the
Company or Merger Sub:

(i) _Conversion of Common Stock_. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01
per share, of the Company (such shares, collectively, the " _Common Stock_ ,"
and each, a " _Share_ ") that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time, but excluding Excluded Shares and Dissenting Shares, shall be

 



-2- 

    

 converted automatically into the right to receive $46.00 per Share in cash,
without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). All Shares that have been
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in
this Section 2.1(a) shall be automatically cancelled upon the conversion
thereof and shall cease to exist, and the holders of Book-Entry Shares or
Certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented such
Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares other than
the right to receive the Merger Consideration upon surrender of Book-Entry
Shares or Certificates in accordance with Section 2.2.

 

(ii) _Treatment of Excluded Shares_. Each Share that is directly owned by the
Company as treasury stock or otherwise, or by Parent or Merger Sub, or by any
wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent or Merger Sub, immediately prior to the
Effective Time (the " _Cancelled Shares_ ") shall be cancelled and shall cease
to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. Each
Share that is owned by any direct or indirect Subsidiary of the Company shall
remain outstanding and automatically be converted into such number of shares
of common stock of the Surviving Corporation so as to maintain the same
relative ownership percentages (each such Share, together with the Cancelled
Shares, the " _Excluded Shares_ ").

 

(iii) _Conversion of Merger Sub Common Stock_. Each share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully
paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of
the Surviving Corporation with the same rights, powers and privileges as the
shares so converted and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of
capital stock of the Surviving Corporation (other than Shares converted into
shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation pursuant to the last
sentence of Section 2.1(a)(ii)). From and after the Effective Time, all
certificates representing the common stock of Merger Sub shall be deemed for
all purposes to represent the number of shares of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation into which they were converted in accordance with the
immediately preceding sentence.

(b) _Dissenters_ __ _Rights_. Any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary notwithstanding, if required by the DGCL (but only to the extent
required thereby), Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time (other than the Cancelled Shares) and that are held by
holders of such Shares who have not voted in favor of the adoption of this
Agreement or consented thereto in writing and who have properly exercised
appraisal rights with respect thereto in accordance with, and who have
complied with, Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to any such Shares held
by any such holder (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration, and holders of such Dissenting
Shares shall be entitled to receive payment of the fair value of such
Dissenting Shares in accordance with the provisions of such Section 262,
unless and until any such holder fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or
loses its rights to appraisal and payment under the DGCL. If, after the
Effective Time, any such holder fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or
loses such rights, such Dissenting Shares will thereupon be treated as if they
had been converted into, at the Effective Time, the right to receive the
Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon, and the Surviving
Corporation shall remain liable for payment of the Merger Consideration for
such Shares. At the Effective Time, any holder of Dissenting Shares shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the rights provided in
Section 262 of the DGCL and as provided in the previous sentence. The Company
shall give Parent (i) prompt written notice of any demands received by the
Company for appraisals of Shares, withdrawals of such demands and any other
instruments relating to appraisal demands received by the Company pursuant to
Section 262 of the DGCL and (ii) the opportunity to participate in and direct
and control all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands;
_provided_ that, after the date hereof until the Effective Time, Parent shall
reasonably consult with the Company with respect to such negotiations and
proceedings. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of
Parent, and prior to the Effective Time Parent shall not, except with the
prior written consent of the Company, make any payment with respect to any
demands for appraisal or offer to settle or settle any such demands or waive
any failure to timely deliver a written demand for appraisal or otherwise to
comply with Section 262 of the DGCL.

 



-3- 

    

(c) _Certain Adjustments_. If, between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time, the outstanding Shares of the Company shall have been changed
into a different number of shares or a different class of shares by reason of
any stock dividend, subdivision, reorganization, reclassification,
recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock split, combination or exchange
of shares, the Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted, without
duplication, to proportionally reflect such change.

 

Section 2.2 _Exchange of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Paying Agent_. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit,
or shall cause to be deposited, with a U.S. bank or trust company that shall
be appointed to act as a paying agent hereunder and approved in advance by the
Company in writing (the " _Paying Agent_ "), in trust for the benefit of
holders of the Shares, cash in U.S. dollars sufficient to pay the aggregate
Merger Consideration in exchange for all of the Shares outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than the Excluded Shares and Dissenting
Shares), payable upon due surrender of the certificates that, immediately
prior to the Effective Time, represented Shares (" _Certificates_ ") (or
effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or noncertificated Shares
represented by book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") pursuant to the provisions
of this Article 2 (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange
Fund_ ").

(b) _Payment Procedures_.

 

(i) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time and in any
event not later than the second Business Day following the Closing Date,
Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of Shares
whose Shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
pursuant to Section 2.1, (A) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify
that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to Certificates
shall pass, only upon delivery of Certificates (or effective affidavits of
loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent and shall
be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent and the Company may
mutually reasonably agree), and (B) instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or
Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration.

(ii) Upon surrender of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in
lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent, together with such
letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with
the instructions thereto, or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares, receipt of an
"agents message" by the Paying Agent, and such other documents as may
customarily be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificates
(or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares shall
be entitled to receive in exchange therefor an amount in cash equal to the
product of (x) the number of Shares represented by such holders properly
surrendered Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or
Book-Entry Shares and (y) the Merger Consideration. No interest shall be paid
or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of Certificates (or
effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares. In the
event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is not registered in the
transfer records of the Company, payment upon due surrender of the Certificate
may be paid to such a transferee if the Certificate formerly representing such
Shares is presented to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all
documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that
any applicable stock transfer Taxes have been paid or are not applicable.

 

(iii) The Paying Agent, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub, as applicable,
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts otherwise payable
under this Agreement such amounts as are required to be withheld or deducted
under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), or under
any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law with respect to the making
of such payment. To the extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld and
paid over to the relevant Governmental Entity, such deducted or withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction or withholding was
made.

 



-4- 

    

(c) _Closing of Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer
books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation of the Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent for
transfer or any other reason, the holder of any such Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares shall be given a copy of the letter of transmittal referred to
in Section 2.2(b) and instructed to comply with the instructions in that
letter of transmittal in order to receive the cash to which such holder is
entitled pursuant to this Article 2\.

 

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that
remains undistributed to the former holders of Shares on the first
anniversary of the Effective Time shall thereafter be delivered to the
Surviving Corporation upon demand, and any former holders of Shares who have
not surrendered their Shares in accordance with this Article 2 shall
thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of their claim
for the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon, upon due surrender
of their Shares.

 

(e) _No Liability_. Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, none of
the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent
or any other Person shall be liable to any former holder of Shares for any
amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

 

(f) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest all cash
included in the Exchange Fund as reasonably directed by Parent;  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that any investment of such cash shall be limited to direct short-
term obligations of, or short-term obligations fully guaranteed as to
principal and interest by, the U.S. government; _provided_ , _further_ , that
no such investment or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to holders
of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-
Entry Shares pursuant to this Article 2, and following any losses from any
such investment, Parent shall promptly provide additional funds to the Paying
Agent for the benefit of the holders of Shares of the Company. Any interest
and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to Parent or
the Surviving Corporation.

(g) _Lost Certificates_. In the case of any Certificate that has been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by Parent or the Paying Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond
in customary amount as indemnity against any claim that may be made against
it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall issue in exchange
for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate a check in the amount of the
number of Shares represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate 
_multiplied by_ the Merger Consideration.

Section 2.3 _Treatment of Company Equity Awards_.

 

(a) Except as otherwise agreed to in writing prior to the Effective Time by
Parent and a holder of any Company Options with respect to such holders
Company Options, each option to purchase Shares (each, a " _Company Option_
"), whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall, at the Effective Time, become fully vested and be
converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of
(i) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price
per Share of such Company Option in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time and (ii) the total number of Shares subject to such Company Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time. Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries, as applicable, to pay to the holders
of Company Options the cash amounts described in the immediately preceding
sentence, less such amounts as are required to be withheld or deducted under
the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law with respect to
the making of such payment, as promptly as practicable, but in any event no
later than the next payroll of the Company, following the Effective Time.

(b) Except as otherwise agreed to in writing prior to the Effective Time by

 stock units that corresponds to Shares (each, a " _Company RSU_ "), whether
vested or unvested, that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time, shall, at the Effective Time, become fully vested and be
converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the sum of (i)
the product of (A) the total number of Shares subject to such Company RSU
immediately prior to the Effective Time and (B) the Merger Consideration and
(ii) any accrued but unpaid dividend equivalents with respect to such Company
RSU. Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries,
as applicable, to pay to the holders of Company RSUs the cash amounts
described in the immediately preceding sentence, less such amounts as are
required to be withheld or deducted under the Code or any provision of state,
local or foreign Tax Law with respect to the making of such payment,
as promptly as practicable, but in any event no later than the next payroll
of the Company, following the Effective Time (or such later date as is
required by Section 409A of the Code).

 

(c) Except as otherwise agreed to in writing prior to the Effective Time by
Parent and a holder of any Company Restricted Shares with respect to such
holders Company Restricted Shares, each Share granted subject to any vesting,
forfeiture or other lapse restrictions (each, a " _Company Restricted Share_
") that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall,
at the Effective Time, become fully vested and be converted into the right to
receive an amount in cash equal to the Merger Consideration. Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries, as applicable, to
pay to the holders of Company Restricted Shares the cash amounts described in
the immediately preceding sentence, less such amounts as are required to be
withheld or deducted under the Code or any provision of state, local or
foreign Tax Law with respect to the making of such payment, as promptly as
practicable, but in any event no later than the next payroll of the Company,
following the Effective Time.

 

(d) Except as otherwise agreed to in writing prior to the Effective Time by
Parent and a holder of any award of performance stock units that corresponds
to Shares (each, a " _Company PSU_ ") with respect to such holders Company
PSUs, each Company PSU that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time, shall, at the Effective Time, be cancelled and converted into
the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the total
number of Shares subject to such Company PSU immediately prior to the
Effective Time assuming target performance and (ii) the Merger
Consideration (the " _Company Performance Share Award Consideration_ "). The
Company Performance Share Award Consideration (A) shall be payable to the
holder of the corresponding Company PSU in a single lump sum on the date on
which the applicable Company PSU would have otherwise vested (the " _Original
Company PSU Vesting Date_ "), subject to such holders continued service to
Parent, the Company or any of their Subsidiaries through the applicable
Original Company PSU Vesting Date, and (B) shall otherwise have vesting
(including accelerated and retirement vesting, but excluding performance
vesting conditions) and payment terms and conditions that are the same as the
vesting (including accelerated and retirement vesting, but excluding
performance vesting conditions) and payment terms applicable to the
corresponding Company PSU. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence,
if (and to the extent that) a Company PSU constitutes nonqualified deferred
compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code, then Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries to pay the Company
Performance Share Award Consideration corresponding to such Company PSU
at the earliest time that would not result in the imposition of any Tax or
penalty under Section 409A of the Code.

(e) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company, through its Board of Directors
or an appropriate committee thereof, shall adopt such resolutions as may
reasonably be required in its discretion to effectuate the actions
contemplated by this Section 2.3.

controls and procedures are reasonably designed to ensure that all material

completed an assessment of the effectiveness of the Companys internal
controls over financial reporting in compliance with the requirements of
Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the year ended December 31, 2017,

"significant deficiencies" or "material weaknesses" (each as defined in Rule

been subsequently remediated or (b) any fraud that involves the Companys
management or other employees who have a significant role in the preparation
of financial statements or the internal control over financial reporting
utilized by the Company and its Subsidiaries. Since December 31, 2015, the
Companys principal executive officer and its principal financial officer have
disclosed, based on their evaluation of internal control over financial
reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)), to the

as presently conducted and is qualified or licensed to do business and is in
good standing as a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction where the
ownership, leasing or operation of its assets, rights or properties or conduct
of its business requires such qualification or licensing, except, in each

other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (a " _Parent Material
Adverse Effect_ "). Parent has made available to the Company prior to the date
of this Agreement a true and complete copy of the certificates of

and validly authorized by the boards of directors of Parent and Merger Sub
and by the sole stockholder of Merger Sub, and, except for the filing of the
Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, no
other corporate proceedings on the part of Parent or Merger Sub are necessary
to authorize the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly and

terms, subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception.

(b) The execution, delivery and performance by Parent and Merger Sub of this
Agreement and the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby, by Parent and Merger Sub do not and will not require
Parent, Merger Sub or their Subsidiaries to procure, make or provide any
consent, approval, authorization or permit of, action by, filing with or

Certificate of Merger, (ii) compliance with the HSR Act, (iii) compliance with

consent, approval, authorization, permit, action, filing or notification the
failure of which to make or obtain would not have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

(c) Assuming receipt of the Parent Approvals, the execution, delivery and
performance by Parent and Merger Sub of this Agreement and the consummation by
Parent and Merger Sub of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby, do not and will not (i) contravene or conflict with the organizational
or governing documents of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) contravene
or conflict with or constitute a violation of any provision of any Law binding
upon or applicable to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective properties or assets, or (iii) result in any violation of, or
default (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise
to a right of termination, cancellation or acceleration of any material
obligation or to the loss of a material benefit under any Contract,
instrument, permit, concession, franchise, right or license binding upon
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or result in the creation of any Lien (other
than Permitted Liens) upon any of the properties or assets of Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries, other than, in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii), any
such contravention, conflict, violation, default, termination, cancellation,
acceleration, right, loss or Lien that would not have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

Section 4.3 _Investigations; Litigation_. As of the date hereof, there are
no Actions pending (or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened) against or
affecting Parent or any of Parents Subsidiaries, or any of their respective
properties at law or in equity before, and there are no orders, judgments or
decrees of, or before, any Governmental Entity, in each case that would have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 

Section 4.4 _Proxy Statement; Other Information_. None of the written
information supplied by or on behalf of Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
Affiliates specifically for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the
Proxy Statement will, at the time the Proxy Statement is filed with the SEC,
or at the time it is first mailed to the stockholders of the Company or at the
time of the Company Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading.

Section 4.5 _Financing_.

 

(a) Parent has received and accepted an executed and binding debt commitment
letter dated as of the date hereof, a true, correct and complete copy of
which has been delivered to the Company (as amended, modified, supplemented,
replaced or extended from time to time after the date of this Agreement in
compliance with

 



-21- 

    

 Section 5.11, including the exhibits, annexes and schedules thereto, the "
_Debt Commitment Letter_ ") from the lenders party thereto (collectively,
the " _Lenders_ ") pursuant to which the Lenders have agreed, subject to the
terms and conditions thereof, to provide the debt amounts set forth therein.
The debt financing committed pursuant to the Debt Commitment Letter is
collectively referred to in this Agreement as the " _Debt Financing_."

(b) Parent has received and accepted an executed and binding equity
commitment letter dated as of the date hereof, a true, correct and complete
copy of which has been delivered to the Company (as amended from time to time
after the date of this Agreement in compliance with Section 5.11, the "
_Equity Commitment Letter_ " and, together with the Debt Commitment Letter,
the " _Commitment Letters_ ") from the Sponsor pursuant to which the Sponsor
has committed, subject to the terms and conditions thereof, to invest in
Parent the amounts set forth therein. The Equity Commitment Letter provides
that the Company is a third-party beneficiary thereof only for the purpose of
seeking specific performance of Parents right to cause the Cash Equity to
be funded thereunder. The cash equity committed pursuant to the Equity
Commitment Letter is collectively referred to in this Agreement as the " _Cash
Equity_." The Cash Equity and the Debt Financing are collectively referred to
as the " _Financing_." Parent has delivered to the Company true, complete and
correct copies of the executed Commitment Letters.

 

(c) As of the date hereof, the obligations of the Lenders to fund the Debt
Financing under the Debt Commitment Letter and the obligations of the Sponsor
to fund the Cash Equity under the Equity Commitment Letter are not subject to
any conditions precedent or other contingencies, except as set forth in the
Commitment Letters and the Fee Letters. Except for a customary fee letter
related to the Debt Financing, a true, correct and complete copy of which has
been provided to the Company with only the amount of fees, "pricing flex" and
other economic terms therein redacted (none of which (x) subject the funding
of the Debt Financing to any additional conditions precedent or other
contingencies or (y) could reduce the total amount of the Debt Financing
available to Parent or Merger Sub on the Closing Date (other than customary
OID flex) to an amount such that Parent and Merger Sub will have funds that
are less than the Applicable Amount), and a customary fee credit letter
related to the Debt Financing and a customary engagement letter related to the
Debt Financing (neither of which (x) subject the funding of the Debt
Financing to any additional conditions precedent or other contingencies or (y)
could reduce the total amount of the Debt Financing available to Parent or
Merger Sub on the Closing Date (other than customary OID flex) to an amount
such that Parent and Merger Sub will have funds that are less than the
Applicable Amount) (collectively, such fee letter, fee credit letter and
engagement letter, the " _Fee Letters_ "), as of the date hereof, there are no
side agreements or other arrangements, commitments or understandings with
respect to the Financing.

(d) As of the date hereof and assuming satisfaction or waiver (to the extent
permitted by applicable Law) of the conditions to Parents and Merger Subs
obligations to consummate the Merger, Parent does not have any reason to
believe that it will be unable to satisfy on a timely basis all terms and
conditions to be satisfied by it in any of the Commitment Letters on or prior
to the Closing Date, nor does Parent have Knowledge that any of the Lenders or
the Sponsor will not, or is expected not to, perform its obligations
thereunder.

(e) Assuming the accuracy of the Companys representations and warranties in
Section 3.4(b), the Financing, when funded in accordance with the Commitment
Letters, shall, together with available cash on the Closing Date at the
Company and its Subsidiaries, in the aggregate, provide Parent with cash
proceeds on the Closing Date in an amount sufficient (the " _Applicable
Amount_ ") for the satisfaction of (i) all of Parents and Merger Subs
payment obligations under this Agreement and under the Commitment Letters to
pay the Merger Consideration, any payments pursuant to Section 2.3 and any
fees and expenses of or payable by Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving
Corporation or its Subsidiaries under this Agreement and under the Commitment
Letters or Fee Letters and due on or before the Closing Date and (ii) all
outstanding indebtedness of the Company and its Subsidiaries that is required
pursuant to its terms to be prepaid, repaid, refinanced or satisfied and
discharged at the Closing.

 

(f) As of the date hereof, the Commitment Letters are legal, valid and binding
obligations of Parent and, to the Knowledge of Parent, of the other parties
thereto, subject to the effects of (i) bankruptcy, insolvency,

 



-22- 

    

 fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and other similar Laws of
general application affecting or relating to the enforcement of creditors
rights generally and (ii) general principles of equity, whether considered in
a proceeding at law or in equity (such effects, the " _Bankruptcy and Equity
Exception_ "), and in full force and effect, and to the Knowledge of Parent,
no event has occurred that, with or without notice, lapse of time, or both,
would reasonably be expected to constitute a default or breach or a failure to
satisfy a condition precedent on the part of Parent under the terms and
conditions of the Commitment Letters. Parent has paid in full any and all
commitment fees or other fees required to be paid pursuant to the terms of the
Commitment Letters on or before the date of this Agreement and will pay in
full any such amounts due on or before the Closing Date. None of
the Commitment Letters has been modified, amended or altered as of the date
hereof, none of the Commitment Letters will be amended, modified or altered at
any time through the Closing, except as permitted by Section 5.11(a) (
_provided_ that Parent promptly notifies the Company in writing of any such
amendment, modification or alteration), and none of the respective commitments
under any of the Commitment Letters have been withdrawn or rescinded in any
respect (and, to the Knowledge of Parent, no withdrawal or rescission thereof
is contemplated or threatened as of the date of this Agreement).

(g) Without limiting Section 8.5, in no event shall the receipt or
availability of any funds or financing (including, for the avoidance of doubt,
the Financing) by Parent or any Affiliate thereof or any other financing or
other transactions be a condition to any of Parents or Merger Subs
obligations hereunder.

Section 4.6 _Guarantee_. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement,
Parent has delivered to the Company the guarantee addressed to the Company
from KKR Americas Fund XII L.P. (the " _Sponsor_ "), guaranteeing certain
obligations of Parent and Merger Sub under this Agreement on the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth therein (the " _Guarantee_ "). As of
the date hereof, the Guarantee is valid and in full force and effect and
constitutes the valid and binding obligation of the Sponsor, enforceable in
accordance with its terms, except as limited by the Bankruptcy and Equity
Exception.

Section 4.7 _Capitalization of Merger Sub_. The authorized capital stock of
Merger Sub consists of 1,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per
share, 100 of which are validly issued and outstanding. All of the issued and
outstanding capital stock of Merger Sub is, and at the Effective Time will
be, owned by a wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent. Merger Sub has not conducted
any business prior to the date hereof and has, and prior to the Effective Time
will have, no assets, liabilities or obligations of any nature other than
those incident to its formation and pursuant to this Agreement and the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

Section 4.8 _No Vote of Parent Stockholders_. No vote of the stockholders of
Parent or the holders of any other securities of Parent (equity or otherwise)
is required by any applicable Law, the certificate of incorporation or bylaws
or other equivalent organizational documents of Parent or the applicable rules
of any exchange on which securities of Parent are traded, in order for Parent
to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 4.9 _Finders or Brokers_. Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries
(including Merger Sub) has employed any investment banker, broker or finder in

Representatives have received access to such books and records, facilities,

warranty on behalf of the Company or any of its Affiliates. Parent and Merger
Sub agree and acknowledge that neither the Company nor any other Person has

completeness of any information regarding the Company or its Subsidiaries

material made available to Parent in the due diligence materials provided to
Parent, including in the data room, other management presentations (formal or
informal) or in any other form in connection with the transactions

included in the Company SEC Documents with respect to the relevant Tax matter
at issue as determined after good faith consultation with Parent), or
surrender any right to claim a material refund of Taxes (it being agreed and
understood that, notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, none
of clauses (i) through (xiii) nor (xv) through (xvii) shall apply to Tax
matters);

 



-27- 

    

(xv) shall not, and shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries, to recognize any
union or other labor organization as the representative of any of the
employees of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries, or enter into any new or
amended collective bargaining agreement with any labor organization, in each
case, except as required by applicable Law;

(xvi) shall not, and shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries to, (i) enter
into or amend in any manner any Contract with any Person covered under Item
404 of Regulation S-K under the Securities Act or (ii) make any payment to any
Person covered under Item 404 of Regulation S-K under the Securities Act
(other than any payments, transactions or benefits pursuant to Contracts or
Company Benefit Plans made available to Parent prior to the date hereof, or
otherwise as permitted by  _Section_ __ _ 5.1(b)(iii)_);

(xvii) shall not adopt a rights plan, "poison pill" or similar agreement
that is, or at the Effective Time will be, applicable to this Agreement, the
Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby; and

(xviii) shall not, and shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries to, authorize
or agree, in writing or otherwise, to take any of the foregoing actions.

 

(c) Between the date hereof and the earlier of the Effective Time and the
Termination Date, Parent and Merger Sub shall not take or agree to take any
action (including entering into agreements with respect to any acquisitions,
mergers, consolidations or business combinations or entering into any new
lines of business) that would reasonably be expected to result in,
individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

Section 5.2 _Control of Operations_. Nothing contained in this Agreement
shall give Parent or Merger Sub, directly or indirectly, the right to control
or direct the Companys operations prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall exercise, consistent with the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over its
operations.

Section 5.3 _Access_.

 

(a) Subject to compliance with applicable Laws, the Company shall afford to
Parent and to its officers, employees, Affiliates, accountants, consultants,
legal counsel, financial advisors, financing sources and agents and other
representatives (collectively, " _Representatives_ "), and, subject to their
joinder to the Confidentiality Agreements or their having executed
a confidentiality agreement with the Company in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to the Company (it being understood that a confidentiality
agreement with the Company having provisions as to confidential treatment of
information and other terms that are not less favorable in any material
respect to the Company than the confidentiality and other provisions of the
Initial Confidentiality Agreement will be deemed to be reasonably acceptable
to the Company), _bona fide_ potential purchasers of assets of the Company
and its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives as may reasonably be
requested by Parent, reasonable access during normal business hours, upon
reasonable advance notice, throughout the period prior to the earlier of the
Effective Time and the Termination Date, to the Companys and its
Subsidiaries personnel, properties, contracts, commitments, books and records
( _provided_ that in the case of such potential purchasers of assets and
their respective Representatives, the Company may limit such access to the
assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries that are the subject of such
potential purchase and, if applicable, apply "clean team" and other similar
customary procedures), other than any such matters that relate to the
negotiation and execution of this Agreement, including with respect to the
consideration or valuation of the Merger or any financial or strategic
alternatives thereto, or any Alternative Proposal or Superior Proposal (which
shall be governed by Section 5.4). The foregoing notwithstanding, the Company
shall not be required to afford such access if it would unreasonably disrupt
the operations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, would cause a
violation of any agreement to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is
a party, would cause a risk of a loss of privilege or trade secret protection
to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or would constitute a violation of
any applicable Law. The parties hereto shall use reasonable best efforts to
make appropriate substitute arrangements under circumstances in which the
restrictions of the preceding sentence apply to allow access in a manner that
does not result in such effects.

(b) Parent hereby agrees that all information provided to it or any of its
Representatives in connection with this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be treated in accordance with, the
confidentiality agreement, dated as of February 5, 2018, between the Company
and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Co. L.P. (the " _Initial Confidentiality
Agreement_ "), and the Clean Team Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of April
6, 2018, between the Company and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Co. L.P. (together
with the Initial Confidentiality Agreement, the " _Confidentiality
Agreements_ ").

Section 5.4 _No Solicitation_.

 

(a) Except as expressly permitted by the provisions of this Section 5.4, from
the date hereof until the earlier of the Effective Time and the Termination
Date, the Company agrees that it shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries,
Affiliates and Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit,

Company, its Subsidiaries and its Affiliates in connection with the foregoing
(except, in each case, solely to notify such Person as to the existence of the
provisions of this Section 5.4), (iii) enter into any letter of intent or
agreement in principle or any agreement providing for any Alternative Proposal
(except for confidentiality agreements permitted under Section 5.4(b)) (an "
_Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ "), (iv) approve, endorse, or recommend,
or publicly propose to approve, endorse or recommend, any Alternative Proposal
or (v) take any action to make any provision of any "fair price,"
"moratorium," "control share acquisition" or other form of antitakeover
statute or regulation (or any related provision in the Companys certificate
of incorporation or bylaws) inapplicable to any transactions contemplated by
an Alternative Proposal. The Company agrees that it shall, and shall cause
its Subsidiaries, Affiliates and Representatives to, (1) immediately cease and
cause to be terminated any solicitations, discussions or negotiations with any
Persons (other than Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Representatives)
in connection with any Alternative Proposal, (2) terminate access to any
physical or electronic data rooms hosted by or on behalf of the Company by any
Person (other than Parent, Merger Sub and their respective
Representatives) and (3) deliver written notice to each such Person
requesting that such Person (other than Parent, Merger Sub and their
respective Representatives) promptly return or destroy all confidential
information regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries in accordance with the
applicable confidentiality agreement between the Company and such Person. The
Company shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) notify Parent orally
and in writing of (A) the receipt by the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or
any of their Representatives of an Alternative Proposal, (B) any inquiry,
proposal, offer or request for information received by the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their Representatives with respect to, or that would
reasonably be expected to lead to, an Alternative Proposal or (C) any
solicitations, discussions or negotiations sought to be initiated or continued
with the Company, its Subsidiaries or its Affiliates or any of their
respective Representatives concerning an Alternative Proposal, which notice
shall include (x) a summary of the material terms and conditions of, and the
identity of the Person or the group of Persons making, such Alternative
Proposal, inquiry, offer, proposal or request for information and a copy of
any such Alternative Proposal, inquiry, offer, proposal or request for
information made in writing (including any draft agreements or term sheets,
financing commitments and other agreements submitted therewith) and (y) a
summary of the material terms and conditions of any such Alternative Proposal,
inquiry, offer, proposal or request for information not made in writing. In
addition, from and after the date hereof, the Company shall (i) notify Parent
in writing if the Company determines to begin providing non-public information
or to engage in discussions or negotiations concerning an Alternative Proposal
in accordance with Section 5.4(b), (ii) thereafter keep Parent reasonably
informed in all material respects of the status and terms (including any
material change to the terms of any such Alternative Proposal) of any such
Alternative Proposal, inquiry, offer, proposal or request for information and
(iii) provide Parent promptly after the receipt or delivery of copies of all
written proposals, offers or draft agreements sent or provided to the Company,
its Affiliates or its Representatives from any Person that describes any of
the terms or conditions of any such Alternative Proposal,

 



-29- 

    

 inquiry, offer, proposal or request for information. The Company shall not,
and shall cause its Affiliates not to, after the date hereof, enter into any
Contract with any Person that prohibits or otherwise limits the Company from
providing any information contemplated by this Section 5.4 to Parent, Merger
Sub or their Representatives or otherwise complying with its obligations in
this Section 5.4.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 5.4 to the contrary, at any time
prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, if (A) the Company
receives an unsolicited written Alternative Proposal that did not result from
a breach of this Section 5.4, (B) the Board of Directors determines in good
faith after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial
advisors that such Alternative Proposal would reasonably be expected to result
in a Superior Proposal and (C) the Board of Directors shall have determined in
good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel that
the failure to take the actions in clauses (x) and (y) below would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, the Company may
take the following actions: (x) furnish nonpublic information of the Company
or its Subsidiaries to the third party making such Alternative Proposal, if,
and only if, prior to so furnishing such information, the third party has
executed a confidentiality agreement with the Company having provisions as to
confidential treatment of information and other terms that are not less
favorable in any material respect to the Company than the confidentiality and
other provisions of the Confidentiality Agreements (it being understood that
such confidentiality agreement need not prohibit the making or amendment of
any confidential Alternative Proposal); _provided_ that any such nonpublic
information has previously been provided to Parent or is provided to Parent
prior to or substantially concurrently with the time such information
is furnished to such third party, and (y) engage in discussions or
negotiations with the third party with respect to the Alternative Proposal.
From the date hereof until the earlier of the Effective Time and the
Termination Date, the Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not
to, terminate, amend, modify or waive any provision of any confidentiality
agreement, standstill or similar agreement to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party and shall use reasonable best efforts to enforce the
provisions of any such agreement; _provided_ that the Company may grant a
limited waiver of such provision if the Board of Directors shall have
determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal
counsel, that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law and such waiver is limited to the extent
reasonably necessary to allow such Person to make a confidential Alternative
Proposal to the Board of Directors.

(c) Except as set forth in this Section 5.4, the Board of Directors shall not
(i) withdraw (or modify or qualify in any manner adverse to Parent), or
propose publicly to withdraw (or modify or qualify in any manner adverse to
Parent) the Recommendation, (ii) approve, recommend, endorse or declare
advisable or publicly propose to approve, recommend, endorse or declare
advisable any Alternative Proposal, (iii) fail to reaffirm publicly the
Recommendation within five Business Days of a request therefor in writing from
Parent following the public disclosure of an Alternative Proposal (other than
of the type referred to in the following clause (v)) (or, if the Company
Meeting is scheduled to be held within five Business Days of such request,
within two Business Days after such request and in any event, prior to the
date of the Company Meeting), (iv) fail to include the Recommendation in the
Proxy Statement or (v) fail to recommend, in a Solicitation/Recommendation
Statement on Schedule 14D-9, against any Alternative Proposal that is a tender
or exchange offer subject to Regulation 14D promulgated under the Exchange
Act within ten Business Days after the commencement (within the meaning of
Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) of such tender offer or exchange offer
(any such action, a " _Change of Recommendation_ "). Anything to the contrary
set forth in this Agreement notwithstanding, prior to obtaining the Company
Stockholder Approval, the Board of Directors may, in response to a written
Alternative Proposal received by the Company after the date of this Agreement
on an unsolicited basis and that did not result from a breach of this Section
5.4, (x) make a Change of Recommendation or (y) cause the Company
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(g); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Board of Directors shall not be entitled to make such a
Change of Recommendation or cause any termination of this Agreement pursuant
to Section 7.1(g) unless (A) the Board of Directors determines in good faith,
(1) after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors,
that such Alternative Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and (2)
after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to take
such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable
Law and (B)(1) the Company shall have given Parent at least four Business
Days written notice 

 



-30- 

    

 (a " _Superior Proposal Notice_ ") advising Parent of its intention to make
such a Change of Recommendation or terminate this Agreement, which Superior
Proposal Notice shall include a description of the terms and conditions of
the Superior Proposal that is the basis for the proposed action of the Board
of Directors, the identity of the Person making the Superior Proposal and a
copy of any written offer or proposal, proposed definitive agreements,
proposed or committed financing documentation and any other related documents
for such Superior Proposal, if any, (2) during such four Business Day period,
if requested by Parent, the Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective
Representatives shall meet and engage in good faith negotiations with Parent
and its Representatives to amend the terms and conditions of this Agreement in
such a manner so that such Alternative Proposal would cease to constitute
a Superior Proposal and (3) at the end of such four Business Day period,
after taking into account any proposal made by Parent to amend the terms of
this Agreement during the period following delivery of such Superior Proposal
Notice, the Board of Directors determines in good faith (x) after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors, that the
Alternative Proposal giving rise to the Superior Proposal Notice continues to
constitute a Superior Proposal and (y) after consultation with its outside
legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with
its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_ that any material
modifications or amendments to the terms of such Alternative Proposal shall
commence a new notice period under clause (B) of three Business Days.

(d) Anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement notwithstanding,
prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, the Board of Directors
may, in response to an Intervening Event, make a Change of Recommendation
contemplated by clauses (i) or (iv) of the definition thereof if the Board of
Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with the Companys
outside legal counsel, that the failure of the Board of Directors to take such
action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Board of Directors shall not be entitled to
make such a Change of Recommendation unless (i) the Company shall have given
Parent at least four Business Days written notice (an " _Intervening Event
Notice_ ") advising Parent of its intention to make such a Change of
Recommendation, which Intervening Event Notice shall include a description of
the applicable Intervening Event, (ii) during such four Business Day period,
if requested by Parent, the Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective
Representatives shall meet and engage in good faith negotiations with Parent
and its Representatives to amend the terms and conditions of this
Agreement in such a manner that would permit the Board of Directors not to
make such Change of Recommendation and (iii) at the end of such notice period,
after taking into account any proposal made by Parent to amend the terms of
this Agreement during the period following delivery of such Intervening Event
Notice, the Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation
with the Companys outside legal counsel, that the failure of the Board of
Directors to make such Change of Recommendation contemplated by clauses (i)
or (iv) of the definition thereof would continue to be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

 

(e) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or its
Board of Directors from (i) disclosing to its stockholders a position
contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act or from
issuing a "stop, look and listen" statement pending disclosure of its
position thereunder or (ii) making any other legally required disclosure to
its stockholders; _provided_ that (A) any disclosure made as permitted under
clause (ii) above that relates to an Alternative Proposal (other than any
"stop, look and listen" communication) shall be deemed to be a Change of
Recommendation unless the Board of Directors expressly publicly reaffirms the
Recommendation in connection with such disclosure and (B) any Change of
Recommendation may only be made in accordance with clauses (c) and (d) of
this Section 5.4.

(f) " _Alternative Proposal_ " means any  _bona fide_ inquiry, proposal or
offer made by any Person (other than Parent or Merger Sub or their Affiliates)
relating to or concerning (i) a merger, reorganization, share exchange,
consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation,
dissolution or similar transaction involving the Company, (ii) the direct or
indirect acquisition by any Person of more than twenty percent (20%) of the
assets (including equity interests of any Subsidiary of the Company) of
the Company and its Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, (iii) the direct
or indirect acquisition by any Person of more than twenty percent (20%) of the
total voting power of equity securities of the Company (or any Subsidiary or
Subsidiaries of the Company representing twenty percent (20%) or more of the
consolidated revenue, net income or assets of the Company and

 



-31- 

    

 its Subsidiaries taken as a whole) or (iv) any tender offer or exchange
offer that if consummated would result in any Person beneficially owning
twenty percent (20%) or more of the total voting power of equity securities
of the Company.

(g) " _Superior Proposal_ " means a _bona fide_ written
unsolicited Alternative Proposal, substituting in the definition thereof
"fifty percent (50%)" for "twenty percent (20%)" in each place it appears,
that the Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with
the Companys outside legal counsel and financial advisors, and considering
all financial (including financing terms), legal, timing, regulatory and other
aspects and risks of such Alternative Proposal and the Person making such
Alternative Proposal, (i) is reasonably capable of being consummated in
accordance with its terms and (ii) would, if consummated, result in a
transaction that is more favorable from a financial point of view to the
stockholders of the Company than the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

(h) " _Intervening Event_ " means any event, change, occurrence or
development that is material to the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a
whole that (i) is unknown and not reasonably foreseeable to the Board of

were not known and reasonably foreseeable to the Board of Directors as of the
date hereof, (ii) becomes known prior to the receipt of the Company
Stockholder Approval and (iii) does not involve or relate to any Alternative
Proposal.

Section 5.5 _Filings; Other Actions_.

 

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the date hereof (and in any
event within twenty Business Days after the date hereof), the Company shall
prepare and file with the SEC the Proxy Statement, which shall, subject to
Section 5.4, include the Recommendation, and shall use reasonable best efforts
to respond to any comments by the SEC staff in respect of the Proxy Statement
as promptly as reasonably practicable after the receipt thereof, to have the
Proxy Statement cleared by the SEC staff as promptly as reasonably practicable
and shall cause the definitive Proxy Statement to be mailed to the
Companys stockholders as of the record date established for the Company
Meeting promptly following the time the Proxy Statement is cleared by the SEC
for mailing to the Companys stockholders (and in any event within five
Business Days after such time). Unless the Board of Directors has made a
Change of Recommendation in accordance with Section 5.4(c) or Section 5.4(d),
the Recommendation shall be included in the Proxy Statement. Parent and Merger
Sub shall provide to the Company such information concerning themselves and
their Affiliates as is customarily included in a proxy statement prepared in
connection with a transaction of the type contemplated by this Agreement or as
otherwise required by applicable Law, requested by the SEC or its staff or as
the Company may reasonably request. Prior to filing or mailing the Proxy
Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any
comments of the SEC or its staff with respect thereto, the Company shall
provide Parent and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and to
propose comments on such document or response and consider in good faith such
comments reasonably proposed by Parent or its counsel for inclusion therein.
If at any time prior to the Company Meeting any information relating to the
Company or Parent, or any of their respective Affiliates, should be discovered
by a party, which information should be set forth in an amendment or
supplement to the Proxy Statement, so that either the Proxy Statement would
not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they are made, not misleading, the party that discovers
such information shall promptly notify the other party and the Company shall
prepare (with the assistance of Parent) and mail to its stockholders such an
amendment or supplement, in each case, to the extent required by applicable
Law. Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub agrees to promptly (i)
correct any information provided by it specifically for use in the Proxy
Statement if and to the extent that such information shall have become false
or misleading in any material respect and (ii) supplement the information
provided by it specifically for use in the Proxy Statement to include any
information that shall become necessary in order to make the statements in the
Proxy Statement, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. The Company agrees to cause the Proxy Statement as so
corrected or supplemented promptly to be filed with the SEC and to be
disseminated to its stockholders, in each case as and to the extent required
by applicable Law.

 



-32- 

    

(b) Subject to the other provisions of this Agreement, the Company shall (i)
take all action required, including under the DGCL and its certificate of
incorporation and bylaws, to set a record date for, duly call, give notice of,
convene and hold promptly following the mailing of the Proxy Statement a
meeting of its stockholders for the purpose of obtaining the Company
Stockholder Approval (the " _Company Meeting_ "), it being understood that the
Company Meeting may also be the Companys annual meeting of stockholders, with
the record date and meeting date of the Company Meeting to be selected after
reasonable consultation with Parent, and (ii) subject to a Change of
Recommendation in accordance with Section 5.4, use reasonable best efforts to
solicit from its stockholders proxies in favor of the approval of the
adoption of this Agreement. The Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed
on a reasonably current basis, and promptly upon the Companys request, of the
status of its efforts to solicit such approval. The Company may postpone or
adjourn the Company Meeting (A) with the written consent of Parent, (B) if a
quorum has not been established at the time of the originally scheduled
Company Meeting, (C) if required by applicable Law, (D) after consultation
with Parent, with respect to any supplemental or amended disclosure that the
Board of Directors has determined in good faith after consultation with its
outside legal counsel is necessary under applicable Law, to the extent
necessary to ensure such supplemental or amended disclosure is provided to
stockholders of the Company within a reasonable amount of time in advance of
the Company Meeting or (E) to allow reasonable additional time to solicit
additional proxies if necessary in order to obtain the Company Stockholder
Approval; _provided_ that the Company Meeting shall not be postponed or
adjourned to a date that is more than thirty (30) days after the date on which
the Company Meeting was (or was required to be) originally scheduled without
the prior written consent of Parent. In no event will the record date of the
Company Meeting be changed without Parents prior written consent, unless
required by applicable Law.

 

Section 5.6 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, the Company shall, and Parent shall
cause the Company to, honor all Company Benefit Plans in accordance with
their terms as in effect immediately before the Effective Time. For a period
of one year following the Effective Time (or if earlier, the date of the
Company Employees termination of employment with the Company or the
applicable Subsidiary), Parent shall provide, or shall cause to be provided,
to each employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries who is employed at the
Effective Time (" _Company Employees_ ") (i) base compensation and a target
annual cash incentive opportunity that are no less favorable than those that
were provided to the Company Employee immediately before the Effective Time,
and (ii) all other compensation and employee benefits (excluding equity-based
and long-term incentive compensation) that are substantially comparable, in
the aggregate, to all other compensation and employee benefits (excluding
equity-based and long-term incentive compensation) provided by the Company or
its Subsidiaries to such Company Employee immediately prior to the Effective
Time. Without limiting the generality of the immediately preceding sentence,
(A) Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide to each
Company Employee whose employment terminates during the one-year period
following the Effective Time severance benefits equal to the severance
benefits, if any, that would have been provided to the Company Employee under
the Companys severance arrangements in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, and (B) during such one-year period following the Effective
Time, severance benefits offered to each Company Employee shall be determined
without taking into account any reduction after the Effective Time in
compensation paid or benefits provided to such Company Employee.

(b) For all purposes (including for purposes of vesting, eligibility to
participate and level of benefits) under the employee benefit plans of Parent
and its Subsidiaries providing benefits to any Company Employees after the
Effective Time (the " _New Plans_ "), each Company Employee shall be credited
with his or her years of service with the Company and its Subsidiaries and
their respective predecessors before the Effective Time, to the same extent as
such Company Employee was entitled, before the Effective Time, to credit for
such service under any similar Company Benefit Plan in which such Company
Employee participated or was eligible to participate immediately prior to the
Effective Time, provided that the foregoing shall not apply with respect to
benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension plan or to the extent that
its application would result in a duplication of benefits. In addition, and
without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (i) each Company Employee
shall be

 



-33- 

    

 immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and
all New Plans to the extent coverage under such New Plan is comparable to a
Company Benefit Plan in which such Company Employee participated immediately
before the Effective Time (such plans, collectively, the " _Old Plans_ "), and
(ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical
and/or vision benefits to any Company Employee, Parent shall cause all pre-
existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New
Plan to be waived for such employee and his or her covered dependents, unless
such conditions would not have been waived under the comparable plans of the
Company or its Subsidiaries in which such employee participated immediately
prior to the Effective Time, and Parent shall cause any eligible expenses
incurred by such employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion
of the plan year of the Old Plans ending on the date such employees
participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into account
under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and
maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such employee and his or her
covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been
paid in accordance with such New Plan.

(c) The Company may implement a retention program in accordance with Section
5.6(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter.

(d) If the Effective Time occurs prior to the time annual bonuses in respect
of 2018 would be paid by the Company in the ordinary course of business, then
Parent shall pay annual bonuses in respect of 2018 based on actual performance
to each Company Employee who participates in an annual bonus plan covering
2018 as of the Effective Time and who remains employed with Parent, the
Company or their respective Subsidiaries through the applicable payment date;
_provided_ that, if, prior to the applicable payment date, the Company
Employee experiences a termination of employment entitling such Company
Employee to severance benefits under any Company Benefit Plan or New Plan,
then Parent shall pay such Company Employee a prorated annual
bonus (calculated based on actual performance) for the portion of 2018
elapsed through such termination of employment. The level of achievement of
the performance goals for such 2018 annual bonuses may be made (i) without
regard to any expenses or costs incurred or accrued by the Company and its
Subsidiaries during 2018 that are associated with, or arise as a result of, or
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including
any advisory or consulting fees) or any nonrecurring charges that would not
reasonably be expected to have been incurred by the Company and its
Subsidiaries had the transactions contemplated by this Agreement not arose,
and (ii) such that any acquisition shortfall or unanticipated divestiture
does not count against target achievement.

(e) Without limiting the generality of Section 8.10, the provisions of
this Section 5.6 are solely for the benefit of the parties to this Agreement,
and no current or former director, employee or individual independent
contractor or any other Person shall be a third-party beneficiary of this
Agreement, and nothing herein shall be construed as an amendment to any
Company Benefit Plan or other compensation or benefit plan or arrangement for
any purpose.

 

Section 5.7 _Efforts_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of
the parties hereto shall use all reasonable best efforts to take promptly, or
cause to be taken, all actions, and to do promptly, or cause to be done, and
to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary,
proper or advisable under applicable Laws to consummate and make effective
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement as
promptly as practicable after the date hereof and in any event prior to the
End Date, including (i) the obtaining of all necessary actions or nonactions,
waivers, consents, clearances, approvals and expirations or terminations of

contemplated hereby, and to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under
any Antitrust Law that may be asserted by any Governmental Entity with respect
to the Merger so as to enable the Closing to occur as promptly as practicable
after the date hereof (and in any event no later than the End Date), including
(x) proposing, negotiating, committing to and effecting, by consent decree,

separate or disposition of any and all of the share capital or other equity
voting interest, assets (whether tangible or intangible), products or
businesses of Parent or its Subsidiaries or of the Company or
its Subsidiaries and (y) otherwise taking or committing to take any actions

faith the views of the Company with respect thereto. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Agreement, nothing in this Section 5.7(b) or elsewhere

any action with respect to any of their Affiliates (other than Parent, the
Surviving Corporation and their Subsidiaries), including selling, divesting,
conveying, holding separate or otherwise limiting its freedom of action with
respect to any assets, rights, products, licenses, businesses, operations or

Parent or Merger Sub (other than the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to become

materially delay the Closing.

the status of matters relating to the completion of the transactions
contemplated thereby, including promptly furnishing the other with copies of
notices or other communications received by the Company or Parent, as the
case may be, or any of their respective Subsidiaries or HSR Affiliates, from
any third party and/or any Governmental Entity pursuant to any Antitrust Law
with respect to such transactions and promptly notifying the other of any
transaction or agreement to effect any transaction known to the Company,
Parent, or their respective Subsidiaries or HSR Affiliates, which would
reasonably be expected to, individually or in aggregate, prevent
or materially delay or impede the ability of any of the parties hereto to
obtain any necessary approvals or clearances of any Governmental Entity
required for the transactions contemplated hereby; provided that the foregoing
shall not apply to third-party hedge fund or asset managers in which KKR and
Co. L.P. or any Affiliate thereof owns a minority stake. Subject to applicable
Law relating to the exchange of information, the Company, on the one hand, and
Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, shall permit counsel for the other
party reasonable opportunity to review in advance, and consider in good faith
the views of the other party in connection with, any proposed notifications or
filings and any written communications or submissions, and with respect to
any such notification, filing, written communication or submission, any
documents submitted therewith to any Governmental Entity pursuant to any
Antitrust Law. Any materials shared under this Section 5.7(c) may be redacted
(x) to remove references concerning the valuation of the businesses of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, or proposals from third parties made prior to
the date hereof with respect thereto, (y) as necessary to comply
with contractual agreements and (z) as necessary to address reasonable
privilege or confidentiality concerns, and may be provided on an outside
counsel only basis. Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub agrees not to
participate in any meeting or discussion, either in person or by telephone,
with any Governmental Entity in connection with the proposed transactions
unless it consults with the other party in advance and, to the extent not
prohibited by such Governmental Entity, gives the other party (or its outside
counsel, as appropriate) the opportunity to attend and participate.

(d) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
contained in this Section 5.7, but subject to the other provisions of this
Section 5.7, if any administrative or judicial action or proceeding, including
any proceeding by a private party, is instituted (or threatened to be
instituted) challenging any transaction contemplated by this Agreement as
violative of any Law, each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall
cooperate in all respects with each other and shall use their respective
reasonable best efforts to contest and resist any such Action or proceeding
and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any Action, decree,
judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts
consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

share acquisition" or other form of antitakeover statute or regulation shall
become applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby, each of
the Company, Parent and Merger Sub and the members of their respective Boards
of Directors shall grant such approvals and take such actions as are
reasonably necessary so that the transactions contemplated hereby may be
consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and
otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of such statute or
regulation on the transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 5.9 _Public Announcements_. The Company, Parent and Merger Sub
shall consult with and provide each other the opportunity to review and
comment upon any press release or other public statement or comment prior to
the issuance of such press release or other public statement or comment
relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated herein and shall
not issue any such press release or other public statement or comment prior to
such consultation, except as may be required by applicable Law or by
obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities
exchange or as may be requested by a Governmental Entity; _provided_ that the
restrictions in this Section 5.9 shall not apply to any Company communication
regarding an Alternative Proposal or with respect to a Change of
Recommendation, in each case to the extent permitted by Section 5.4(c). Parent
and the Company agree to issue a joint press release as the first public
disclosure of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each of Parent
and its Affiliates may, without any such consultation, make ordinary course
disclosures and communications to existing or prospective general and limited
partners, equityholders, members, managers and investors of such Person or any
of its Affiliates, in each case who are subject to customary confidentiality
restrictions, and on such Persons website in the ordinary course of business.

 

Section 5.10 _Indemnification and Insurance_.

 

(a) Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to exculpation,
indemnification and advancement of expenses now existing in favor of
the current or former directors or officers, as the case may be, of the
Company or its Subsidiaries as provided in their respective certificates of
incorporation or bylaws or other organizational documents or in any
indemnification agreement set forth on Section 5.10 of the Company Disclosure
Letter, shall survive the Merger and shall continue at and after the Effective
Time in full force and effect. For a period of six years after the Effective
Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain in effect the
exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses provisions of the
Companys and any Company Subsidiarys certificates of incorporation and
bylaws or similar organizational documents as in effect as of the date of
this Agreement or in any indemnification agreements of the Company or its
Subsidiaries with any of their respective directors or officers set forth on
Section 5.10 of the Company Disclosure Letter as in effect as of the date of
this Agreement, and shall not amend, repeal or otherwise modify any such
provisions in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of
any individuals who at the Effective Time were current or former directors or
officers of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that all rights to indemnification in respect of any Action pending or
asserted or any claim made within such period shall continue until the final
disposition of such Action or resolution of such claim, even if beyond such
six-year period. From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to honor, in accordance with
their respective terms, each of the covenants contained in this Section 5.10.

(b) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, to the
fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, indemnify and hold harmless
(and advance funds in respect of each of the foregoing or any related expenses
in accordance herewith) each current and former director or officer of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries and each Person who served as a director,
officer, member, trustee or fiduciary of another corporation, partnership,
joint venture, trust, pension or other employee benefit plan or enterprise at
the request of or for the benefit of the Company or its Subsidiaries (each,
together with such Persons heirs, executors or administrators, and successors
and assigns, an " _Indemnified Party_ ") against any costs or expenses
(including advancing attorneys fees and expenses in advance of the final
disposition of any Action to each Indemnified Party to the fullest extent
permitted by Law following receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such
Person to repay such amount if it is ultimately determined that such Person
was not entitled to indemnification under this Section 5.10), judgments,
fines, losses, claims, damages, obligations, costs, liabilities and amounts
paid in settlement in connection with any actual or threatened claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative (an " _Action_ "), arising out of, relating to or in connection
with any action or omission occurring or alleged to have occurred whether
before or after the Effective Time (including acts or omissions in connection
with such Persons serving as an officer, director, employee or
other fiduciary in any entity if such service was at the request or for the
benefit of the Company or its Subsidiaries). In the event of any such Action,
Parent and the Surviving

 



-37- 

    

 Corporation shall have the right to control the defense thereof, and the
Indemnified Party shall reasonably cooperate with the Surviving Corporation in
the defense of any such Action.

 

(c) For a period of six years from the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, and the Surviving Corporation shall, maintain in
effect the current policies of directors and officers liability insurance
and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by the Company and its
Subsidiaries with respect to matters arising on or before the Effective
Time;  _provided_ , _however_ , that after the Effective Time, Parent shall
not be required to pay annual premiums in excess of 300% of the last annual
premium paid by the Company prior to the date hereof in respect of the
coverage required to be obtained pursuant hereto, but in such case shall
purchase as much coverage as reasonably practicable for such amount. In lieu
of the foregoing, Parent or the Company (with the written consent of Parent)
may purchase, prior to the Effective Time, a six-year prepaid "tail" policy on
terms and conditions providing substantially equivalent benefits as the
current policies of directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary
liability insurance maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries with
respect to matters arising on or before the Effective Time, covering without
limitation the transactions contemplated hereby at a cost not exceeding 300%
of the last annual premium paid by the Company prior to the date hereof with
respect to such coverage. If such prepaid "tail" policy has been obtained by
Parent or the Company prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, and the Surviving Corporation shall, maintain such
policy in full force and effect, for its full term, and cause all obligations
thereunder to be honored by the Surviving Corporation, and no other party
shall have any further obligation to purchase or pay for insurance hereunder.

(d) Parent shall pay all reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorneys
fees, that may be incurred by any Indemnified Party in enforcing the
indemnity and other obligations provided in this Section 5.10.

(e) The rights of each Indemnified Party hereunder shall be in addition to,
and not in limitation of, any other rights such Indemnified Party may have
under the certificates of incorporation or bylaws or other organizational
documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the Surviving
Corporation, any other indemnification arrangement set forth on Section 5.10
of the Company Disclosure Letter, the DGCL or otherwise. The provisions of
this Section 5.10 shall survive the consummation of the Merger and
expressly are intended to benefit, and are enforceable by, each of the
Indemnified Parties.

(f) In the event that Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity in such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in either such case,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or
the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the
obligations set forth in this Section 5.10.

Section 5.11 _Financing_.

 

(a) Parent and Merger Sub shall, and shall use reasonable best efforts to
cause their Representatives and Affiliates to, use reasonable best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all
things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable to obtain the proceeds of the
Financing on the terms and conditions described in the Commitment
Letters (including the "flex" provisions of any Fee Letter related to the
Debt Financing) as promptly as practicable after the date hereof (taking into
account the timing of the Marketing Period) and in any event prior to the End
Date, including using reasonable best efforts with respect to:

(i) maintaining in effect the Commitment Letters,

 

(ii) negotiating and entering into definitive agreements with respect to the
Debt Financing (the " _Definitive Agreements_ ") consistent with the terms
and conditions contained therein (including, as necessary, the "flex"
provisions contained in any related fee letter) or on other terms that (1) are
acceptable to Parent and Merger Sub in their sole discretion and (2) would
not reasonably be expected to delay (taking into account the timing of the
Marketing Period) or adversely affect the ability of Parent and Merger Sub to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, 

 



-38- 

    

(iii) satisfying on a timely basis (taking into account the timing of
the Marketing Period) all conditions under its control in the Commitment
Letters and the Definitive Agreements,

(iv) complying with its obligations under the Commitment Letters,

(v) in the event that all conditions contained in the Commitment Letters
(other than, with respect to the Debt Financing, the availability of the Cash
Equity, and those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied or
waived at the Closing) have been satisfied or waived, subject to Section
8.5, enforcing its rights under the Commitment Letters (including by promptly
commencing a litigation proceeding against any breaching lender or other
financial institution to compel such breaching party to provide its portion of
the Debt Financing or otherwise comply with its obligations under the Debt
Commitment Letter or the relevant Definitive Agreement), and

(vi) consummating the Financing at or prior to the Closing Date (including
drawing on any interim or bridge financing under the Debt Commitment Letter on
the Closing Date to the extent necessary to obtain the Applicable Amount).

 

Without limiting the foregoing, in the event that all conditions contained in
the Commitment Letters (other than, with respect to the Debt Financing,
the availability of the Cash Equity, and those conditions that by their
nature are to be satisfied or waived at the Closing) have been satisfied or
waived, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Lenders and
the Sponsor to fund the Financing required to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and to pay related fees and expenses on the
Closing Date. Parent shall not, without the prior written consent of the
Company: (A) permit any amendment, alteration or modification to, or any
waiver of any provision or remedy under, the Commitment Letters or any related
fee letters if such amendment, modification, waiver or remedy (w) adds new (or
adversely modifies any existing) conditions to the consummation of the
Financing as compared to those in the Commitment Letters or any related Fee
Letters as of the date hereof, (x) reduces the amount or value of the
Financing available to Parent or Merger Sub on the Closing Date to an
amount such that Parent and Merger Sub will have funds that are less than the
Applicable Amount, (y) adversely affects the ability of Parent to enforce its
rights against other parties to the Commitment Letters or the Definitive
Agreements as so amended, replaced, supplemented or otherwise modified,
relative to the ability of Parent to enforce its rights against such other
parties to the Commitment Letters as in effect on the date hereof or in the
Definitive Agreements or (z) could reasonably be expected to prevent, impede
or delay (taking into account the timing of the Marketing Period) the
consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; or (B) terminate any Commitment Letter. Parent shall promptly
deliver to the Company copies (redacted only as to fee amounts, dates and
certain other economic terms, including in respect of "market flex" (but none
of which (x) subject the funding of the Debt Financing to any additional
conditions precedent or other contingencies or (y) could reduce the total
amount of the Debt Financing available to Parent or Merger Sub on the Closing
Date (other than customary OID flex) to an amount such that Parent and Merger
Sub will have funds that are less than the Applicable Amount) in the case of
fee letters related to the Debt Financing) of any such amendment, replacement,
supplement or other modification or waiver of the Commitment Letters or any
related fee letters. In the event that any portion of the Debt Financing
becomes unavailable, regardless of the reason therefor, Parent shall (1) use
its reasonable best efforts to obtain as promptly as practicable (taking into
account the timing of the Marketing Period) alternative debt financing (in an
amount sufficient, when taken together with Cash Equity and any cash of the
Company and its Subsidiaries on hand at the Closing Date, to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to pay related fees and
expenses) on substantially equivalent or more favorable terms from the same or
other sources and which do not include any new conditions to the consummation
of such alternative debt financing that are more onerous than the conditions
set forth in the Debt Financing and (2) promptly notify the Company of such
unavailability and the reason therefor; _provided_ that in no event shall
Parent and Merger Sub be obligated to accept or pursue any such
alternative financing if it is less favorable to Parent in any material
respect than the Debt Financing. If any alternative financing is required in
accordance with the immediately preceding sentence, Parent shall use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain, and when obtained, provide the Company
with a copy of, a new financing commitment that provides for such alternative
financing, and Parent shall comply with its covenants in this

 



-39- 

    

 Section 5.11(a) with respect to such new financing commitment (as if such
financing commitment were the Debt Commitment Letter). For the purposes of
this Agreement, the term " _Debt Commitment Letter_ " shall be deemed to
include any commitment letter (or similar agreement) with respect to any
alternative financing contemplated hereby (and any Debt Commitment Letter
remaining in effect at the time in question). Parent shall provide the
Company with prompt oral and written notice of (i) any breach or default by
any party to any Commitment Letters or the Definitive Agreements or any
purported termination or repudiation of the Commitment Letters or
the Definitive Agreements, in each case, of which Parent becomes aware and
(ii) the receipt of any written notice or other written communication from any
Lender, the Sponsor or other financing source with respect to any breach,
default, termination or repudiation by any party to any Commitment Letters or
the Definitive Agreements of any provision thereof. Parent shall keep the
Company reasonably informed on a reasonably current basis, and promptly upon
the Companys request, of the status of its efforts to consummate the
Financing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, compliance by Parent with this
Section 5.11 shall not relieve Parent of its obligation to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement whether or not the Financing is
available. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in no
event shall Parent and Merger Sub be required pursuant to this Agreement to
pay any additional fees or to increase any interest rates or original
issue discounts applicable to the Financing, except as expressly required
pursuant to the Commitment Letters as in effect on the date hereof (including
the "flex" provisions of any Fee Letter). The Company acknowledges and agrees
that Parent and Merger Sub shall not be required to consummate the Financing
until the final day of the Marketing Period. In addition, Parent shall, as
promptly as practicably, deliver to the Company, in writing, all Parent Pro
Forma Information, and shall otherwise provide all assistance reasonably
requested by the Company from time to time in connection with the preparation
of the pro forma financial statements described in paragraphs (i)-(iv) of
clause (c) of the definition of Required Information.

(b) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries
to, and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause its and their respective
Representatives to, use reasonable best efforts to provide such cooperation to
Parent as is reasonably requested by Parent in connection with, and reasonably
necessary or advisable for the arrangement of, the Debt Financing (
_provided_ that such requested cooperation does not unreasonably interfere
with the ongoing operations of the Company or its Subsidiaries), including
using commercially reasonable efforts to, upon the reasonable request of
Parent: 

(i) prepare and furnish Parent (which Parent may furnish to its Financing
Sources) as promptly as practicable all financial and other pertinent

or Merger Sub in connection with the preparation of the Offering Documents
and all supplements thereto and projections included in the Offering
Documents;

its Subsidiaries participate, in a reasonable number of meetings,

Financing Sources to evaluate the Companys and its Subsidiaries assets,

relating thereto for the purpose of establishing collateral arrangements
(including using reasonable best efforts to assist in establishing bank and
other accounts and blocked account and control agreements in connection with
the foregoing);

 

(iv) assist Parent in the preparation of any Offering Documents (and any
supplement thereto);

determined by Parent in consultation with the Company; (II) comply with
applicable Law and with the indenture governing the applicable Company Notes
in all respects; (III) to the extent any such redemption notice is

Affiliates or Representatives.

(c)  _Acknowledgements_.

(i) Each party acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 7.3
are an integral part of this Agreement and that, without Section 7.3(a),
Parent would not have entered into this Agreement and that, without Section
7.3(b), the Company would not have entered into this Agreement. Accordingly,
if the Company or Parent fails to promptly pay any amount due pursuant to
this Section 7.3, the Company or the Parent, as applicable, shall pay to
Parent or the Company, respectively, all fees, costs and expenses of
enforcement (including attorneys fees as well as expenses incurred in
connection with any action initiated by such party), together with interest on
the amount of the Company Termination Fee or the Parent Termination Fee, as
applicable, at the prime lending rate as published in the _Wall Street
Journal_ , in effect on the date such payment is required to be made. The
parties further acknowledge that neither the Company Termination Fee nor the
Parent Termination Fee shall constitute a penalty but is liquidated damages,
in a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent or the Company, as
applicable, in the circumstances in which the Company Termination Fee or the
Parent Termination Fee is payable for the efforts and resources expended and
opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on
this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the Merger, which
amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision. The parties
acknowledge that the right to receive the Company Termination Fee or the
Parent Termination Fee, as applicable, shall not limit or otherwise affect any
such partys right to specific performance as provided in Section 8.5. While
each of the Company and Parent may pursue both a grant of specific
performance in accordance with Section 8.5 and the payment of the Parent
Termination Fee or the Company Termination Fee, as applicable, under no
circumstances shall the Company or Parent be 

 



-47- 

    

 permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of specific performance that
results in the Effective Time occurring and the Parent Termination Fee or the
Company Termination Fee, as applicable. 

(ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, but
subject to Section 8.5, each of the parties hereto expressly acknowledges and
agrees that the Companys right to terminate this Agreement and receive
payment of the Parent Termination Fee pursuant to Section 7.3(b), together
with any fees, costs, expenses and interest payable pursuant to Section
7.3(c), any amounts payable pursuant to Section 5.11(b) and any Filing Fees
payable pursuant to Section 8.2, shall constitute the sole and exclusive
remedy (whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) of the
Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective Affiliates and any of their
respective former, current or future general or limited partners,
stockholders, equityholders, members, managers, directors, officers,
employees, agents or Affiliates (collectively, the " _Company Related
Parties_ ") against Parent, Merger Sub, the Sponsor and their respective
Affiliates, the Financing Sources, any other potential debt or equity
financing source and any of their respective former, current or future
general or limited partners, stockholders, equityholders, members, managers,
directors, officers, employees, agents or Affiliates or any former, current or
future general or limited partner, stockholder, equityholder, member,
manager, director, officer, employee, agent or Affiliate of any of the
foregoing (collectively, the " _Parent Related Parties_ ") for all losses and
damages in respect of this Agreement (or the termination thereof) or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (or the failure of such
transactions to occur for any reason or for no reason) or any breach (whether
willful (including willful and material breach), intentional, unilateral or
otherwise) of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement or
otherwise in respect of this Agreement or any oral representation made or
alleged to be made in connection herewith, and upon payment of the Parent
Termination Fee to the Company pursuant to Section 7.3(b), together with any
fees, costs, expenses and interest payable pursuant to Section 7.3(c), any
amounts payable pursuant to Section 5.11(b) and any Filing Fees payable
pursuant to Section 8.2, (A) none of the Parent Related Parties shall have
any further liability or obligation to any of the Company Related Parties
relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the Guarantee, the Commitment
Letters or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, and (B) none of
the Company Related Parties shall seek to recover any other damages or seek
any other remedy, whether based on a claim at law or in equity, in contract,
tort or otherwise, with respect to any losses or damages suffered in
connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or any
oral representation made or alleged to be made in connection herewith. For the
avoidance of doubt, in no event shall Parent or Merger Sub be subject to (nor
shall any Company Related Party seek to recover) monetary damages in excess
of an amount equal to the Parent Termination Fee, in the aggregate (the "
_Damage Cap_ "), for any losses or other liabilities arising out of or in
connection with breaches (whether willful (including willful and material
breach), intentional, unilateral or otherwise) by Parent or Merger Sub of its
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this
Agreement or arising from any claim or cause of action that any Company
Related Party may have with respect thereto, including for a breach of Section
2.2(a) as a result of the Debt Financing not being available to be drawn down
or otherwise arising from the Commitment Letters or the Guarantee or
in respect of any oral representation made or alleged to be made in
connection herewith or therewith.

(iii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
but subject to Section 8.5 and except for the right of Parent and/or Merger
Sub to seek damages with respect to this Agreement as described in the
immediately following sentence (subject to the limitations described
therein), each of the parties hereto expressly acknowledges and agrees that:
Parents right to terminate this Agreement and receive payment of the Company
Termination Fee pursuant to Section 7.3(a), together with any fees, costs,
expenses and interest payable pursuant to Section 7.3(c) and any Proxy Costs
payable pursuant to Section 8.2, shall constitute the sole and exclusive
remedy (whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) of the
Parent Related Parties against the Company Related Parties for all losses and
damages in respect of this Agreement (or the termination thereof) or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (or the failure of such
transactions to occur for any reason or for no reason) or any breach (whether
willful (including any willful and material breach), intentional, unilateral
or otherwise) of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement or
otherwise in respect of this Agreement or any oral representation made

 



-48- 

    

 or alleged to be made in connection herewith, and upon payment of the
Company Termination Fee to Parent pursuant to Section 7.3(a), together with
any fees, costs, expenses and interest payable pursuant to Section 7.3(c) and
any Proxy Costs payable pursuant to Section 8.2, (A) none of the Company
Related Parties shall have any further liability or obligation to any of the
Parent Related Parties relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, and (B) none of the Parent
Related Parties shall seek to recover any other damages or seek any other
remedy, whether based on a claim at law or in equity, in contract, tort or
otherwise, with respect to any losses or damages suffered in connection with
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or any oral
representation made or alleged to be made in connection herewith.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, following termination of this Agreement by
either Parent or the Company, Parent may seek monetary damages from the
Company for its willful and material breach of this Agreement; _provided_
that, in no event shall the Company be subject to (nor shall any Parent
Related Party seek to recover) monetary damages in excess of an amount equal
to the Damage Cap, or payment of both monetary damages and the Company
Termination Fee in a combined amount in excess of the Damage Cap, for any
losses or other liabilities arising out of or in connection with breaches
(whether willful (including willful and material breach), intentional,
unilateral or otherwise) by the Company of its representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement or arising from any
claim or cause of action that any Parent Related Party may have with respect
thereto, including in respect of any oral representation made or alleged to be
made in connection herewith.
