its Subsidiaries have been, and are being, maintained in all material
respects in accordance with GAAP and any other applicable legal and
accounting requirements.

  

### 

  

### (b) Neither Cowen nor any of its Subsidiaries has any material liability
or obligation of any nature whatsoever (whether absolute, accrued,
contingent, determined, determinable or otherwise and whether due or to
become due) except for (i) those liabilities that are reflected or reserved
against on the consolidated balance sheet of Cowen included in its Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2008 (including
any notes thereto) and (ii)

contemplated hereby.

  

### 

  

### (c) The records, systems, controls, data and information of Cowen and its
Subsidiaries are recorded, stored, maintained and operated under means
(including any electronic, mechanical or photographic process, whether
computerized or not) that are under the exclusive ownership and direct
control of Cowen or its Subsidiaries or accountants (including all means of
access thereto and therefrom), except for any non-exclusive ownership and
non-direct control that would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on the system of internal accounting controls
described below in this _Section 4.6(c)_. Cowen (x) has implemented and
maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e)
of the Exchange Act) to ensure that material information relating to
Cowen, including its consolidated Subsidiaries, is made known to the chief
executive officer and the chief financial officer of Cowen by others within
those entities, and (y) has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation
prior to the date hereof, to Cowens outside auditors and the audit committee
of Cowens Board of Directors (i) any significant deficiencies and
material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls over
financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act)
which are reasonably likely to adversely affect Cowens ability to record,
process, summarize and report financial information and (ii) any fraud,
whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have
a significant role in Cowens internal controls over financial reporting.
Each of these disclosures were made in writing by management to Cowens
auditors and audit committee, a copy of which has previously been made
available to Ramius.  As of the date hereof, there is no reason to believe
that Cowens outside auditors, chief executive officer and chief financial
officer will not be able to give the certifications and attestations required
pursuant to the rules and regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without qualification, when next due.

  

### 

  

### (d) Since December 31, 2008, neither Cowen nor any of its Subsidiaries

assertion or claim, whether written or oral, regarding the accounting or
auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or methods of Cowen or any of

Subsidiaries).

  

### 

  

## 4.10 _Taxes and Tax Returns_. Each of Cowen and its Subsidiaries has (i)

(all such Tax Returns being accurate and complete in all material respects)
and (ii) has paid all Taxes due and owing by Cowen or any of its Subsidiaries
(whether or not shown on any Tax Return). Neither Cowen nor any of its

income Tax Returns for periods beginning after July 12, 2006 of Cowen and
its Subsidiaries have been examined by the IRS or other relevant
taxing authority. No written claim has ever been made by an authority in a
jurisdiction where Cowen or any of its Subsidiaries does not file Tax Returns
that Cowen or any of its Subsidiaries is or may be subject to taxation by
that jurisdiction. There are no material Liens for Taxes (other than Taxes
not yet due and payable) upon any of the assets of Cowen or any of its
Subsidiaries. Each of Cowen and its Subsidiaries have withheld and paid all
material Taxes required to have been withheld and paid in connection with any
amounts paid or owing to any employee, independent contractor, creditor,
stockholder, or other third party. Neither Cowen nor any of its Subsidiaries
has received from any foreign, federal, state, or local taxing authority
(including jurisdictions where Cowen or its Subsidiaries have not filed Tax
Returns) any (i) notice indicating an intent to open an audit or other
review, (ii) request for information related to Tax matters, or (iii) notice
of deficiency or proposed adjustment for any amount of Tax proposed,
asserted, or assessed by any taxing authority against Cowen or any of its
Subsidiaries. Neither Cowen nor any of its Subsidiaries has waived any
statute of limitations in respect of material Taxes or agreed to
any extension of time with respect to a material Tax assessment or
deficiency. Neither Cowen nor any of its Subsidiaries (A) has been a member
of an affiliated group filing a consolidated federal income Tax Return (other

## which is Cowen) or (B) has any liability for a material amount of Taxes of
any person (other than Cowen and any of its Subsidiaries) under Regulation
Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state, local, or foreign law),
as a transferee or successor, by contract, or otherwise. Any material
liabilities for Taxes not yet due and payable, or which are being contested
in good faith by appropriate proceedings, with respect to Cowen and any of
its Subsidiaries (A) did not, as of December 31, 2008, exceed the reserve and
provision for Tax liabilities set forth on the face of the consolidated
balance sheet of Cowen included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
fiscal year ended December 31, 2008 and (B) do not exceed that reserve and
provision as adjusted for Tax liabilities incurred in the Ordinary Course of
Business through the Closing Date. Neither Cowen nor any of its Subsidiaries
has a permanent establishment outside of the national jurisdiction in which
it was formed. Except as set forth in _Section 4.10_ of the Cowen Disclosure
Schedule, each Subsidiary of Cowen has since the date of its formation been
properly classified for U.S. Federal income tax purposes as either a
partnership or disregarded entity and not as an association taxable as a
corporation, or a "publicly traded partnership" within the meaning of Section
7704(b) of the Code that is treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income
tax purposes under Section 7704(a) of the Code, and neither Cowen nor any of
its Subsidiaries has taken a position inconsistent with such treatment with
regard to any Tax. There are no material disputes pending, or written claims
asserted, for Taxes or assessments upon Cowen or any of its Subsidiaries for
which Cowen does not have reserves that are adequate under GAAP. Neither Cowen
nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or is bound by any Tax sharing
agreement or arrangement (other than such an agreement or arrangement
exclusively between or among Cowen and its Subsidiaries). Within the past two
(2) years (or otherwise as part of a "plan (or series of related
transactions)" within the meaning of Section 355(e) of the Code of which the
Transactions are also a part), neither Cowen nor any of its Subsidiaries has
been a "distributing corporation" or a "controlled corporation" in a
distribution intended to qualify under Section 355(a) of the Code. Neither
Cowen nor any of its Subsidiaries has participated in a "listed transaction"
within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.6011-4(b)(2) subsequent
to such transaction becoming listed. The parties agree and acknowledge that
the foregoing representations and warranties shall not apply with respect to
any Tax Returns or Taxes that are the responsibility of SG Americas, Inc. ("
_SGAI_ ") pursuant to the Tax Matters Agreement, dated as of July 12, 2006
among SGAI, SG Americas Securities Holdings, Inc., Cowen and Company LLC, and
Cowen.

Subsidiaries is obligated to contribute, or with respect to which Cowen or
any of its Subsidiaries has any liability, direct or indirect, contingent or
otherwise (including any liability arising out of an indemnification,
guarantee, hold harmless or similar agreement) or otherwise providing

Cowen or any of its

  



  



        
   

  



  

### Subsidiaries or to any beneficiary or dependent thereof (such plans,
programs, agreements and commitments, herein referred to as the " _Cowen

Subsidiaries beyond their retirement or other termination of service, other

retirement benefits under any "employee pension plan" (as such term is
defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA).  Except as could not be reasonably
expected to result in a material liability to Cowen or any of its
Subsidiaries, neither Cowen nor any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in a
transaction in connection with which Cowen or any of its Subsidiaries
reasonably could be subject to either a civil penalty assessed pursuant to
Section 409 or 502(i) of ERISA or a tax imposed pursuant to Section 4975 or
4976 of the Code. Except as could not be reasonably expected to result in a
material liability to Cowen or any of its Subsidiaries, no Controlled Group

ERISA)

  



        
   

  



  

### or a plan that has two or more contributing sponsors at least two of whom
are not under common control, within the meaning of Section 4063 of ERISA.

  

### 

  

### (f) There are no pending, threatened or anticipated claims (other than
routine claims for benefits) by, on behalf of or against any of the Cowen
Benefit Plans or any trusts related thereto or fiduciaries thereof which
could reasonably be expected to result in a material liability of Cowen or
any of its Subsidiaries.

  

### 

  

### (g) Neither the execution or delivery of this Agreement nor the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will, either
alone or in conjunction with any other event, (i) result in any material
payment or benefit becoming due or payable, or required to be provided, to

there are no representation or certification proceedings or petitions seeking
a representation proceeding presently pending or threatened to be brought or
filed, with the National Labor Relations Board or any other labor relations
tribunal or authority. There are no organizing activities, strikes, work
stoppages, slowdowns, lockouts, material arbitrations or material grievances,

of the Cowen and its Subsidiaries is in compliance in all material respects
with all applicable Laws and collective bargaining agreements respecting
employment and employment practices, terms and conditions of employment,
wages and hours and occupational safety and health.

thereunder, in each case that is subject to Section 409A of the Code, has
been operated in compliance in all material respects with Section 409A of the
Code since July 12, 2006, based upon a good faith, reasonable interpretation
of (A) Section 409A of the Code and (B)(1) the proposed and final Treasury
Regulations issued thereunder, where applicable, and (2) Internal Revenue
Service Notice 2005-1, all subsequent Internal Revenue Service Notices, and

### (k) All grants of Cowen Stock Options, Cowen Restricted Shares and Cowen
RSUs and any other grants of stock options or other equity interests were
validly issued and properly approved by the Cowen Board of Directors or a
committee thereof (and all required approvals, if any, by the stockholders of
Cowen have been obtained) in accordance with all applicable Law and, to the
knowledge of Cowen, no such grants involved any "backdating" or similar
practices with respect to the effective date of grant. The per share exercise
price of each Cowen Stock Option was not less than the fair market value of
the Cowen Common Stock on the applicable grant date (as determined in a
manner consistent with Treasury Regulation §1.409A-1(b)(5)(iv)) and each such
grant was properly accounted for in all material respects in accordance with
GAAP in the financial statements (including the related notes) of Cowen and
disclosed in Cowens filings with the SEC in accordance with the Exchange Act
and other applicable Securities Laws. No modifications have been made to any
Cowen Stock Options after the applicable date of grant.

## 4.17 _CHRP_.

  

##

corporate, limited company, trust or partnership power and authority to own
its properties and to carry on its business as it is now conducted, and is
qualified to do business in each jurisdiction where it is required to do so
under applicable Law, except where the failure to have such power, authority
or qualification is not material to its business. Except as set forth on

required to be registered with the SEC or any other Governmental Entity as an
investment company under the Investment Company Act or any similar Law.

pertaining to CHRP did not, to the knowledge of Cowen, at any time such
offering documents were made available to investors or prospective investors
in CHRP, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. _Section 4.17(c)_ of the Cowen Disclosure Schedule sets
forth true, complete and correct descriptions of any "side letters" or
similar understandings relating to CHRP that reduce the management fees paid
to Cowen or its applicable Subsidiary.

  

###

Investment Advisory Agreement, from any Board or Limited Partners of CHRP or
any other applicable third-parties in order to (A) avoid triggering a
withdrawal right of any Limited Partner pursuant to the terms of any
agreements relating to CHRP or any side letters to any such agreements;
and (B) consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement so
that after the Closing Date, Cowen or its applicable Subsidiary may continue
its applicable management, advisory or sub-advisory relationships on terms
that are no less favorable to such Cowen entity than the terms of
existing relationships.

  

### 

  

## 4.18 _Risk Management Instruments_. (a) All Derivative
Transactions, whether entered into for the account of Cowen or any of its
Subsidiaries or for the account of a customer of Cowen or any of its
Subsidiaries, were entered into in the Ordinary Course of Business and in
accordance with applicable Laws, rules, regulations and policies of any
Regulatory Authority and in accordance with the investment, securities,
commodities, risk management and other policies, practices and procedures
employed by Cowen and its Subsidiaries, and with counterparties believed at
the time to be financially responsible and able to understand (either alone
or in consultation with their advisers) and to bear the risks of such
Derivative Transactions.  All of such Derivative Transactions are valid and
binding obligations of Cowen or one of its Subsidiaries enforceable against
it in accordance with their terms (subject to the Bankruptcy and

  



        
   

  



  

## Equity Exception), and are in full force and effect. Cowen and its
Subsidiaries and, to Cowens knowledge, all other parties thereto have duly
performed their obligations under the Derivative Transactions to the extent
that such obligations to perform have accrued and, to Cowens knowledge,
there are no breaches, violations or defaults or allegations or assertions of
such by any party thereunder.

income Tax Returns and other material Tax Returns required to be filed by it
(all such Tax Returns being accurate and complete in all material respects)
and (ii) has paid all Taxes due and owing by Ramius or any of its
Subsidiaries (whether or not shown on any Tax Return). Neither Ramius nor any
of its Subsidiaries currently is the beneficiary of any extension of time
within which to file any material Tax Return. None of the federal, state and
local income Tax Returns for periods beginning after January 1, 2005 of
Ramius and its Subsidiaries have been examined by the IRS or other relevant
taxing authority. No written claim has ever been made by an authority in a
jurisdiction where Ramius or any of its Subsidiaries does not file Tax
Returns that Ramius or any of its Subsidiaries is or may be subject to
taxation by that jurisdiction. There are no material Liens for Taxes
(other than Taxes not yet due and payable) upon any of the assets of Ramius
or any of its Subsidiaries. Each of Ramius and its Subsidiaries have
withheld and paid all material Taxes required to have been withheld and paid
in connection with any amounts paid or owing to any employee, independent
contractor, creditor, stockholder, or other third party. Neither Ramius nor
any of its Subsidiaries has received from any foreign, federal, state, or
local taxing authority (including jurisdictions where Ramius or its
Subsidiaries have not filed Tax Returns) any (i) notice indicating an intent
to open an audit or other review, (ii) request for information related to Tax
matters, or (iii) notice of deficiency or proposed adjustment for any amount
of Tax proposed, asserted, or assessed by any taxing authority against Ramius
or any of its Subsidiaries. Neither Ramius nor any of its Subsidiaries has
waived any statute of limitations in respect of material Taxes or agreed to
any extension of time with respect to a material Tax assessment or
deficiency. Neither Ramius nor any of its Subsidiaries (A) has been a member
of an affiliated group filing a consolidated federal income Tax Return or (B)
has any liability for a material amount of Taxes of any person (other than
Ramius and any of its Subsidiaries) under Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or any
similar provision of state, local, or foreign law), as a transferee or
successor, by contract, or otherwise. Any material liabilities for Taxes not
yet due and payable, or which are being contested in good faith
by appropriate proceedings, with respect to Ramius and any of its
Subsidiaries (A) did not, as of December 31, 2008, exceed the reserve and
provision for Tax liabilities set forth on the face of the Ramius Financial
Statements and (B) do not exceed that reserve and provision as adjusted for
Tax liabilities incurred in the Ordinary Course of Business through the
Closing Date. Neither Ramius nor any of its Subsidiaries has a permanent
establishment outside of the national jurisdiction in which it was formed.
Except as set forth in _Section 5.10_ of the Ramius Disclosure Schedule,
each Subsidiary of Ramius has since the date of its formation been properly
classified for U.S. Federal income tax purposes as either a partnership or
disregarded entity and not as an association taxable as a corporation, or a
"publicly traded partnership" within the meaning of Section 7704(b) of the
Code that is treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax
purposes under Section 7704(a) of the Code, and neither Ramius nor any of
its Subsidiaries has taken a position inconsistent with such treatment with
regard to any Tax. There are no material disputes pending, or written claims
asserted, for Taxes or assessments upon Ramius or any of its Subsidiaries for
which Ramius does not have reserves that are adequate under GAAP. Neither
Ramius nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or is bound by any Tax
sharing agreement or arrangement (other than such an agreement or
arrangement exclusively between or among Ramius and its Subsidiaries). Within
the past two (2) years (or otherwise as part of a "plan (or series of related
transactions)" within the meaning of Section 355(e) of the Code of which the
Transactions are also a part), neither Ramius nor any

  



        
   

  

## 

  

## of its Subsidiaries has been a "distributing corporation" or a "controlled
corporation" in a distribution intended to qualify under Section 355(a) of
the Code. Neither Ramius nor any of its Subsidiaries has participated in a
"listed transaction" within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section
1.6011-4(b)(2) subsequent to such transaction becoming listed.

  

## 

  

## 5.11 _Employee Matters_.

  

## 

  

### (a) _Section 5.11(a)_ of the Ramius Disclosure Schedule sets forth a
true, complete and correct list of each material "employee benefit plan" as
defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, whether or not subject to ERISA, and each
material employment, consulting, bonus, incentive or deferred compensation,
vacation, stock option or other equity-based, severance, termination,
retention, change of control, profit-sharing, fringe benefit or other similar
plan, program, agreement or commitment, whether written or unwritten, for the
benefit of any employee, former employee, manager or former manager of Ramius
or any of its Subsidiaries entered into, maintained or contributed to by
Ramius or any of its Subsidiaries or to which Ramius or any of its
Subsidiaries is obligated to contribute, or with respect to which Ramius or
any of its Subsidiaries has any liability, direct or indirect, contingent or
otherwise (including any liability arising out of an indemnification,
guarantee, hold harmless or similar agreement) or otherwise providing
benefits to any current, former or future employee, officer or manager of
Ramius or any of its Subsidiaries or to any beneficiary or dependent thereof
(such plans, programs, agreements and commitments, herein referred to as the
" _Ramius Benefit Plans_ ").

  

### 

  

### (b) With respect to each Ramius Benefit Plan, Ramius has delivered or
made available to Cowen a true, correct and complete copy of:  (i) each
writing constituting a part of such Plan; (ii) the most recent Annual Report
(Form 5500 Series) and accompanying schedule, if any; (iii) the current
summary plan description and any material modifications thereto, if any (in
each case, whether or not required to be furnished under ERISA); (iv) the
most recent annual financial report, if any; (v) the most recent actuarial
report, if any; and (vi) the most recent determination letter from the IRS,
if any.

  

### 

  

### (c) Each Ramius Benefit Plan intended to be "qualified" within the
meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code has received a favorable determination
letter from the IRS, or has pending an application for such determination
from the IRS with respect to those provisions for which the remedial
amendment period under Section 401(b) of the Code has not expired, and, to
the knowledge of Ramius, there is not any reason why any such determination
letter should be revoked. Each of the Ramius Benefit Plans has been operated
and administered in accordance with applicable Law, including, but
not limited to, ERISA, the Code and in each case the regulations thereunder.

  

### 

  

### (d) No Ramius Benefit Plan provides benefits, including, without
limitation, death or medical benefits (whether or not insured), with respect
to current or former employees or directors of Ramius or any of its
Subsidiaries beyond their retirement or other termination of service, other
than (1) coverage mandated by applicable Law or (2) death benefits or
retirement benefits under any "employee pension plan" (as such term is
defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA). Except as could not be reasonably
expected to result in a material liability to Ramius or any of
its Subsidiaries, neither Ramius nor any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in
a transaction in connection with which Ramius or any of its
Subsidiaries reasonably could be subject to either a

  



        
   

  

### 

  

### civil penalty assessed pursuant to Section 409 or 502(i) of ERISA or a
tax imposed pursuant to Section 4975 or 4976 of the Code. Except as could not
be reasonably expected to result in a material liability to Ramius or any of
its Subsidiaries no Controlled Group Liability has been incurred by Ramius,
any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective ERISA Affiliates that has
not been satisfied in full, and, to the knowledge of Ramius, no condition
exists that presents a risk to Ramius, any of its Subsidiaries or any of
their respective ERISA Affiliates of incurring any such liability. Except as
could not be reasonably expected to result in a material liability to Ramius
or any of its Subsidiaries, all contributions required to be made to any
Ramius Benefit Plan by applicable Law or by any plan document or other
contractual undertaking, and all premiums due or payable with respect to
insurance policies funding any Ramius Benefit Plan, for any period through
the date hereof have been timely made or paid in full or, to the extent not
required to be made or paid on or before the date hereof have been fully
accrued in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

  

### 

  

### (e) Section 5.11(e) of the Ramius Disclosure Schedule identifies each
Ramius Benefit Plan that is subject to Title IV or Section 302 of ERISA or
Section 412 or 4971 of the Code (a " _Ramius Pension Plan_ ").  With respect
to each Ramius Pension Plan, the most recent actuarial report prepared by
such plans actuary with respect to such plan in accordance with FASB No. 87
sets forth accurately the accrued benefit obligations of such plan,
determined using the actuarial methods, factors, and assumptions contained in
such report, and the fair market value of the assets of such plan, each as of
the date set forth in such report, and since the date of such report there
has been no material adverse change in the accrued benefit obligations or the
fair market value of the assets of such plan. Neither Ramius, any of its
Subsidiaries nor any of their respective ERISA Affiliates contributes (or has
contributed in the six years prior to the date hereof) to a "multiemployer
pension plan" (as such term is defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA) or a plan
that has two or more contributing sponsors at least two of whom are not under
common control, within the meaning of Section 4063 of ERISA.

  

### 

  

### (f) There are no pending, threatened or anticipated claims (other than
routine claims for benefits) by, on behalf of or against any of the Ramius
Benefit Plans or any trusts related thereto or fiduciaries thereof which
could reasonably be expected to result in a material liability of Ramius or
any of its Subsidiaries.

  

### 

  

### (g) Neither the execution or delivery of this Agreement nor the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will, either
alone or in conjunction with any other event, (i) result in any material
payment or benefit becoming due or payable, or required to be provided, to
any manager, member, employee or independent contractor of Ramius or any of
its Subsidiaries or to such individuals in the aggregate, (ii) materially
increase the amount or value of any benefit or compensation otherwise payable
or required to be provided to any such manager, member, employee or
independent contractor, (iii) result in the acceleration of the time of
payment, vesting or funding of any such benefit or compensation, (iv) result
in any material limitation on the right of Ramius or any of its Subsidiaries
to amend, merge or, terminate any Ramius Benefit Plan or related trust or (v)
fail to be deductible by reason of Section 280G of the Code.

  

### 

  

### (h) All Ramius Benefit Plans subject to the laws of any jurisdiction
outside of the United States (i) have been maintained in accordance with all
applicable requirements, (ii) if they

  



        
   

  

### 

  

### are intended to qualify for special tax treatment meet all requirements
for such treatment, and (iii) if they are intended to be funded and/or book-
reserved are fully funded and/or book reserved, as appropriate, based upon
reasonable actuarial assumptions.

  

### 

  

### (i) No labor organization or group of employees of Ramius or any of its
Subsidiaries has made a pending demand for recognition or certification, and
there are no representation or certification proceedings or petitions seeking
a representation proceeding presently pending or threatened to be brought or
filed, with the National Labor Relations Board or any other labor relations
tribunal or authority. There are no organizing activities, strikes, work
stoppages, slowdowns, lockouts, material arbitrations or material grievances,
or other material labor disputes pending or threatened against or involving
Ramius or any of its Subsidiaries. Except as could not be reasonably expected
to result in a material liability to Ramius or any of its Subsidiaries, each
of Ramius and its Subsidiaries is in compliance in all material respects with
all applicable laws and collective bargaining agreements respecting
employment and employment practices, terms and conditions of employment,
wages and hours and occupational safety and health.

  

### 

  

### (j) Each Ramius Benefit Plan that is a "nonqualified
deferred compensation plan" within the meaning of Section 409A(d)(1) of the
Code and any award thereunder, in each case that is subject to Section 409A
of the Code, has been operated in compliance in all material respects with
Section 409A of the Code since January 1, 2006, based upon a good faith,
reasonable interpretation of (A) Section 409A of the Code and (B)(1)
the proposed and final Treasury Regulations issued thereunder, where
applicable, and (2) Internal Revenue Service Notice 2005-1, all subsequent
Internal Revenue Service Notices, and other interim guidance on Section 409A
of the Code, where applicable.

disagreements or disputes with, any Regulatory Agency or other Governmental
Entity with respect to the business, operations, policies or procedures of

### 

  

### Entity that currently restricts or affects in any material respect the
conduct of its business or that in any material manner relates to its risk
management or compliance policies, its internal controls, its management or
its business, other than those of general application that apply to similarly
situated companies or their Subsidiaries (each item in this sentence, a "
_Ramius Regulatory Agreement_ "), nor has Ramius, any of its Subsidiaries nor
any Fund been advised since January 1, 2006 by any Regulatory Agency or other
Governmental Entity that it is considering issuing, initiating, ordering or
requesting any such Ramius Regulatory Agreement.

  

### 

  

### (c) _Section 5.16(c)_ of the Ramius Disclosure Schedule contains a list
of all Permits which are required for the operation of the business of
Ramius, its Subsidiaries as presently conducted, other than those the failure
of which to possess is not material to the operation of such business.  Each
of Ramius and its Subsidiaries currently has all Permits which are required
for the operation of its business as presently conducted and as presently
intended to be conducted, other than those the failure of which to possess is
not material to the operation of such business. None of Ramius or its
Subsidiaries is in default or violation, and no event has occurred which,
with notice or the lapse of time or both, would constitute a default or a
violation, in any material respect of any term, condition or provision of any
material Permit to which it is a party, to which its business is subject or
by which its properties or assets are bound, and to the knowledge of Ramius,
there are no facts or circumstances which could reasonably be expected to
form the basis for any such default or violation. Each employee of Ramius or
its Subsidiaries who is required to be registered or licensed as a registered
representative, investment advisor representative, sales person or an
equivalent person with any Governmental Entity or SRO is fully registered
or licensed as such and such registration is in full force and effect.

9(a) or 9(b) or (B) the ineligibility under such Section 9(b) of such
"affiliated person" to serve as an "affiliated person" of such person.

with an investment adviser, (iii) there is no proceeding or investigation
pending and served on Ramius or any of its Subsidiaries or, to Ramiuss
knowledge, pending and not so served or threatened by any Governmental
Entity, which would result in (A) the ineligibility under such Section 203(e)

person is (taking into account any applicable exemption) ineligible under
Section 15(b)(6) of the Exchange Act to serve as a "person associated" with a
broker or dealer and (iii) there is no proceeding or investigation pending
and served on Ramius or any Subsidiary or, to Ramiuss knowledge, pending and

## 5.17 _Investment Agreements and the Funds._

  

## 

  

### (a) Ramius or its Subsidiaries has performed in all material respects
all of the obligations thereof under each Management Agreement and each Fund
Agreement in accordance with its terms and all applicable Laws.

  

### 

  

### (b) _Section 5.17(b)_ of the Ramius Disclosure Schedule sets forth: (i)
a true, complete and correct schedule setting forth the calculation of the
management and performance fees for each Fund as of the Base Date; (ii) the
fees payable to Ramius or its applicable Subsidiary with respect to each Fund
under the applicable Management Agreement and the amount of any related fee
(including relating to any revenue-sharing arrangement) paid by Ramius or its
applicable Subsidiary to any Person other than Ramius or its applicable
Subsidiary as of the Base Date and as of March 31, 2009; (iii) as to each
Fund, as of the Base Date and the date hereof, the terms of any fee waivers,

and (iv) as to each Fund, as of the Base Date and as of the date hereof, the
rate and method of computation of any subadvisory fees payable to any Person
by Ramius or its Subsidiaries with respect to such Private Fund.

  

### 

  

### (c) Each Fund is duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization and has the
requisite corporate, limited company, trust or partnership power and
authority to own its properties and to carry on its business as it is now
conducted, and is qualified to do business in each jurisdiction where it is
required to do so under applicable Law, except where the failure to have such
power, authority or qualification is not material to its business.  Except
as set forth on _Section 5.17(c)_ of the Ramius Disclosure Schedule, none of
the Private Funds has been or is required to be registered with the SEC or
any other Governmental Entity as an investment company under the Investment
Company Act or any similar Law. _Section 5.17(c)_ of the Ramius Disclosure
Schedule sets forth (i) true, complete and correct descriptions of any "side
letters" or similar understandings relating to Fund Agreements, (ii) a true,
complete and correct list of Limited Partners entitled to "most
favored nation" status and descriptions of such arrangements and (iii) a
true, complete and correct list of any Limited Partners that receive unusual
services and descriptions of such services; _provided_ , _however_ , that
_Section 5.17(e)_ of the Ramius Disclosure Schedule need not set forth any
letter or similar understanding that does anything else other than reduce the
management fees paid to Ramius or its applicable Subsidiary.

  

### 

  

### (d) True, correct and complete copies of the offering documents,
subscription agreements, administrative services agreements, distribution,
solicitation or placement agency agreements and solicitation agreements, as
applicable, or any similar written agreements, including all "side letters"
or other understandings relating to Fund Agreements, in any case pertaining
to the Funds have been made available to Cowen. Such offering documents did
not, at any time such offering documents were made available to investors or
prospective investors in the Funds, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading.

  

### 

  

### (e) Except as set forth of _Section 5.17(e)_ of the Ramius
Disclosure Schedule, Ramius does not serve as a "fiduciary" with respect to
"plan assets" of any employee benefit plan subject to Title I of ERISA (other
than plans maintained for employees of Ramius and its Subsidiaries);

  



        
   

  

### 

  

### provided, that to the extent Ramius does act as a "fiduciary" with
respect to "plan assets" of any employee benefit plan subject to Title I of
ERISA (other than plans maintained for employees of Ramius and its
subsidiaries), Ramius has complied in all material respects with the
requirements of Title I of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code.

  

### 

  

### (f) True, correct and complete copies of the unaudited financial
statements, and where audited financial statements are available for any
Fund, such audited financial statements, of each of the Funds for its most
recent fiscal year ended on or prior to December 31, 2008 have been made
available to Cowen. Each of such financial statements presents fairly, in all
material respects, the consolidated financial position of such Fund in
accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis (except as otherwise noted
therein) at the respective date of such financial statements.

  

### 

  

### (g) Ramius has maintained the "soft dollar" and brokerage
allocation policies set forth in _Section 5.17(g)_ of the Ramius
Disclosure Schedule at the times set forth therein with respect to the
allocation of trade execution on behalf of accounts managed by Ramius or its
Subsidiaries. Ramiuss and its Subsidiaries receipt of all soft dollar
brokerage and research services since January 1, 2006, qualifies for the safe
harbor afforded by Section 28(e) of the Exchange Act and Ramius and its
Subsidiaries have complied with all related disclosure rules in all material
respects.  To the knowledge of Ramius, Ramius and its Subsidiaries have
satisfied in all material respects its duty of "best execution" (as such term
is understood under the Advisers Act) for all Funds for whom it exercises
trading discretion since January 1, 2006.

  

### 

  

### (h) No consents or approvals are required under (i) applicable Law
(including, for the absence of doubt, the Advisers Act), or (ii) any
Investment Advisory Agreement, from any Fund Board, any Limited Partners of
any Fund or any other applicable third-parties in order to (A) avoid
triggering a withdrawal right of any Limited Partner pursuant to the terms of
any Fund Agreement or any side letters to any Fund Agreement; and (B)
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement so that after the
Closing Date, Ramius or its applicable Subsidiary may continue its applicable
management, advisory or sub-advisory relationships on terms that are no less
favorable to such Ramius entity than the terms of existing relationships.

  

### 

  

## 5.18 _Risk Management Instruments_. All Derivative Transactions, whether
entered into for the account of Ramius or any of its Subsidiaries, were
entered into in the Ordinary Course of Business and in accordance with
applicable laws, rules, regulations and policies of any Regulatory Agency and
in accordance with the investment, securities, commodities, risk management
and other policies, practices and procedures employed by Ramius and its
Subsidiaries, and with counterparties believed at the time to be financially
responsible and able to understand (either alone or in consultation with
their advisers) and to bear the risks of such Derivative Transactions. All of
such Derivative Transactions are valid and binding obligations of Ramius or
one of its Subsidiaries enforceable against it in accordance with their terms
(subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception), and are in full force and
effect. Ramius and its Subsidiaries and, to Ramiuss knowledge, all other
parties thereto have duly performed their obligations under the Derivative
Transactions to the extent that such obligations to perform have accrued and,
to Ramiuss knowledge, there are no breaches, violations or defaults or
allegations or assertions of such by any party thereunder.

  



         
 

  



  

## 5.19 _Interested Party Transactions._ Except as set forth on _Section
5.19_ of the Ramius Disclosure Schedule, none of C4S and Co., LLC or its
managing members (i) owns any direct or indirect interest of any kind in, or
controls or is a director or managing member of any Person which is a
supplier, advisory Client, landlord, tenant, creditor or debtor of Ramius or
its Subsidiaries or (b) is a participant in any transaction to which Ramius
or its Subsidiaries is a party or (ii) is a party to any Contract with
Ramius, in each case other than this Agreement and the agreements
contemplated in connection herewith. Except as set forth on _Section
5.19_ of the Ramius Disclosure Schedule, any such contracts are on
commercially reasonable terms no more favorable to such director or managing
member than what any third party negotiating on an arms-length basis would
expect.

  

## 

  

## 5.20 _Reorganization._ As of the date of this Agreement, Ramius is not
aware of any fact or circumstance that could reasonably be expected
to prevent the Cowen Merger from qualifying as a "reorganization" within
the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

  

## 

  

## 5.21 _Ramius Information_. The information relating to Ramius and its
Subsidiaries and any Fund that is provided by Ramius or its representatives
for inclusion in the Proxy Statement and the Form S-4, or in any application,
notification or other document filed with any other Regulatory Agency or
other Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances in which they are made, not misleading and will
comply in all material respects with the provisions of the Exchange Act and
the rules and regulations thereunder; _provided_  that Ramius makes no
representations or warranties as it relates to any information provided by
Cowen or its representatives to Ramius or its representatives and contained

other Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

representations and warranties contained in this _Article V_, none of
Ramius, any Subsidiary of Ramius, or any other Person on behalf of Ramius
makes any other express or implied representation or warranty in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, no representations or warranties are made with
respect to any projections, forecasts, estimates, budgets or information as
to prospects with respect to Ramius and its Subsidiaries that may have been
made available to Cowen or any of its representatives, except as expressly
set forth in this _Article V_ or in any certificates to be delivered
pursuant to the terms set forth herein.

shall provide the other party and its counsel with advance notice of and the
opportunity to participate in any discussion, telephone call or meeting with

be materially delayed.

Stockholder Approval, on substantially the terms and conditions set forth in
this Agreement, required to consummate the issuance of New Parent Class
A Common Stock and other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
approve the Plan, and shall recommend such approval except as is permitted by
_Section 7.10(c)_ hereto and (y) the New Parent Plan Approval.  Cowen shall
submit this Agreement to its stockholders at the Cowen Stockholder Meeting
even if its Board of Directors shall have withdrawn, modified or qualified
its recommendation.  The Board of Directors of Cowen has adopted resolutions
approving the Transactions and the issuance of New Parent Class A Common
Stock, on substantially the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement,
and directing that the issuance of New Parent Class A Common Stock in
the Transactions, on such terms and conditions, be submitted to
Cowens stockholders for their consideration.  Notwithstanding the foregoing
provisions of this _Section 7.3_, if on a date for which the Cowen
Stockholder Meeting is scheduled, Cowen has not received proxies representing
a sufficient number of shares of Cowen Common Stock to obtain the Cowen
Stockholder Approval, whether or not a quorum is present, Cowen may for the
sole purpose of soliciting additional proxies elect to, or shall, if
requested by Ramius, use its reasonable best efforts to solicit additional
proxies for the sole purpose of obtaining the Cowen Stockholder Approval and,
in connection therewith, shall make one or more successive adjournments of
the Cowen Stockholder Meeting to a date specified by Cowen (if Cowen is
electing to solicit additional proxies) or by Ramius (if Ramius has requested
that Cowen solicit additional proxies); _provided_  that, in either case, the
Cowen Stockholder Meeting shall not be adjourned to a date that is more than
ten (10) days after the date for which the Cowen Stockholder Meeting was
originally scheduled (excluding any adjournments or postponements required by
applicable Law).

## 7.4 _Further Assurances; Additional Agreements_.  Each of Cowen and
Ramius shall use its reasonable best efforts to, and to cause their
respective Subsidiaries to, (i) take all actions necessary or appropriate to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) cause the
fulfillment at the earliest practicable date of all of the conditions to
their respective obligations to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. In addition, at and after the Effective Time, the officers,
directors and managers of New Parent, the Cowen Surviving Corporation or
Exchange Sub, as applicable, shall be authorized to execute and deliver, in
the name and on behalf of the Cowen Surviving Corporation, Merger Sub or
Cowen, or Exchange Sub or Ramius, any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or
assurances and to take and do, in the name and on behalf of the Cowen
Surviving Corporation, Merger Sub or Cowen, or Exchange Sub or Ramius, any
other actions and things necessary to vest, perfect or confirm of record or
otherwise in New Parent, the Cowen Surviving Corporation or Exchange Sub any
and all right, title and interest in, to and under any of the rights,

## 7.6 _Employee Matters_. (a) On or prior to the Closing, Ramius shall
take all action necessary to cause the employment of each employee of Ramius
and each Ramius Benefit Plan maintained by Ramius (and any related assets and
liabilities), other than the REOP and grant agreements evidencing
awards under the REOP and the portion of the Tapestry Interests under the
RAAP (as defined therein) representing a right to receive a Ramius Percentage
Interest, and in each case the liabilities with respect thereto
(collectively, the " _Excluded Ramius Benefits_ "), to be transferred to
Exchange Sub, each effective as of and subject to the Closing. From
and after the Effective Time, the Cowen Benefit Plans and the Ramius Benefit
Plans (which, for purposes of this _Section 7.6_, shall include those
plans transferred to Exchange Sub pursuant to this _Section 7.6(a)_)
in effect as of the Effective Time shall remain in effect with respect to
employees and former employees of Cowen or Ramius and their respective
Subsidiaries (the " _New Parent Employees_ "), respectively, covered by such
plans at the Effective Time, until such time as New Parent shall otherwise
determine, subject to applicable laws and the terms of such plans.  It is
the intention of Cowen and Exchange Sub, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, to develop new benefit plans, as soon as
reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, which, among other things,
(i) treat similarly situated employees on a substantially equivalent basis,
taking into account all relevant factors, including duties, geographic
location, tenure, qualifications and abilities and (ii) do not discriminate
between the New Parent Employees who were covered by Cowen Benefit Plans, on
the one hand, and those covered by Ramius Benefit Plans on the other, at the
Effective Time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for the period commencing on
the Effective Time and ending on the first anniversary of the Effective Time
(the " _Cowen Continuation Period_ "), New Parent shall, or shall cause one
of its Subsidiaries to, provide compensation and employee benefits to the New
Parent Employees who were employed by Cowen or its Subsidiaries prior to the
Effective Time (the " _Cowen Covered Employees_ ") that are substantially
comparable in the aggregate to those provided to the Cowen Covered Employees
immediately prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that in
connection with implementing the foregoing, New Parent shall not be precluded
from substituting for any Cowen

  



        
   

  

## 

  

## Benefit Plan or plans, during the Cowen Continuation Period, one or more
New Plans (as defined in _Section 7.6(b)_ hereof) of substantially the same
type. In addition to, and not in contravention of the foregoing, Cowen
Covered Employees whose employment is terminated without "cause" during the
Cowen Continuation Period will be entitled to severance benefits in
accordance with the Cowen Severance Policy described on _Section 7.6(a)_ of
the Cowen Disclosure Schedule. Nothing herein shall prohibit any changes to
the Cowen Benefit Plans or the Ramius Benefit Plans that may be (i) required
by applicable laws, (ii) necessary as a technical matter to reflect the
transactions contemplated hereby or (iii) required for New Parent to provide
for or permit investment in its securities.

  

## 

  

### (b) With respect to any benefit plans in which any New Parent Employees
who are employees of Cowen or Exchange Sub (or their respective Subsidiaries)
at the Effective Time first become eligible to participate on or after the
Effective Time, and in which such New Parent Employees did not participate
prior to the Effective Time (the " _New Plans_ "), New Parent shall (i) waive
all pre-existing conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect
to participation and coverage requirements applicable to the New Parent
Employees and their eligible dependents under any New Plans in which such
employees may be eligible to participate after the Effective Time, except to
the extent such preexisting conditions, exclusions or waiting periods would
apply under the analogous Cowen Benefit Plan or Ramius Benefit Plan, as the
case may be; (ii) provide each New Parent Employee and his or her eligible
dependents with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid prior to the
Effective Time under a Cowen Benefit Plan or Ramius Benefit Plan (to the same
extent that such credit was given under the analogous Benefit Plan prior to
the Effective Time) in satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket
requirements under any New Plans in which such employees may be eligible to
participate after the Effective Time; and (iii) recognize (in addition to
service with New Parent or its Subsidiaries following the Effective Time) all
service of the New Parent Employees with Cowen or Ramius, respectively, and
their respective affiliates and predecessors, for purposes of eligibility to
participate, vesting credit, entitlement to benefits and levels of benefits
in any New Plan in which such employees may be eligible to participate after
the Effective Time, to the extent such service is taken into account under
the applicable New Plan, except to the extent that such crediting of would
result in duplication of benefits with respect to the same period of service
and provided that no prior service shall be recognized for purposes of
benefit accrual under any final average pay defined benefit plan.

  

### 

  

### (c) As of the Effective Time, New Parent shall honor all Cowen Benefit
Plans and Ramius Benefit Plans (other than the Excluded Ramius Benefits) in
accordance with their terms. As of the Effective Time, New Parent shall take
all action necessary to effectuate the agreements set forth in _Section
7.6(c)_ of the Cowen Disclosure Schedule.

  

### 

  

### (d) New Parent and Ramius hereby acknowledge that the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement constitute a "change of control," "change in
control" or term of similar import within the meaning of the Cowen Benefit
Plans, and _Section 7.6(d) _of the Cowen Disclosure Schedule lists the
material Cowen Benefit Plans containing such term(s).

  

### 

  

### (e) Effective as of the Closing, Exchange Sub shall assume all liability
for making the cash payments in satisfaction of the awards outstanding under
the Ramius LLC Phantom Interest Program as of the Closing that are held by
employees of Ramius and its Subsidiaries who

  



        
   

  

### 

  

### become employees of Exchange Sub or its Affiliates as of the Closing and
that vest immediately prior to the Closing as may be provided by Ramius.

  

### 

  

### (f) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no
provision of this Agreement shall be deemed to (i) guarantee employment for
any period of time for, or preclude the ability of either party to terminate,
any New Parent Employee for any reason, (ii) require New Parent to continue
any Cowen Benefit Plan or Ramius Benefit Plan or prevent the amendment,
modification or termination thereof after the Effective Time to the extent
permitted by their terms and applicable law, (iii) constitute an amendment to
any Cowen Benefit Plan or Ramius Benefit Plan, or (iv) provide any rights to
any Employees, whether as third-party beneficiaries or otherwise, to enforce
any provision of this _Section 7.6_.

  

### 

  

## 7.7 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_.

  

## 

  

### (a) In the event of any threatened or actual claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, arbitration, whether civil, criminal or

Agreement, or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director or officer
of Cowen or any of its Subsidiaries or an officer, manager or managing member
of Ramius or any of its Subsidiaries, including, without limitation, C4S and
Co., LLC and its members, or who is or was serving at the request of Cowen or
any of its Subsidiaries or at the request of Ramius or its Subsidiaries as a
director, manager or officer of another person (the " _Indemnified Parties_
"), is, or is threatened to be, made a party based in whole or in part on, or
arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to (i) the fact that he or
she is or was a director or officer of Cowen or any of its Subsidiaries or
any officer or manager of Ramius or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the
Effective Time or (ii) this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, whether asserted or arising before or after the Effective
Time, the parties shall cooperate and use their reasonable best efforts to
defend against and respond thereto. All rights to indemnification and
exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time now existing in favor of any Indemnified Party as provided
in their respective certificates or articles of incorporation or by-laws (or
comparable organizational documents), and any indemnification agreements
which are existing as of the date hereof, shall survive the Transactions and
shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms, and
shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six (6)
years after the Effective Time in any manner that would adversely affect the
rights thereunder of such individuals for acts or omissions occurring at or
prior to the Effective Time or taken at the request of New Parent pursuant to
_Section 7.4_, it being understood that nothing in this sentence shall
require any amendment to the New Parent Charter or the New Parent By-Laws.

  

### 

  

### (b) From and after the Effective Time, New Parent, the Cowen Surviving
Corporation and Exchange Sub shall to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law jointly and severally, indemnify, defend and hold harmless,
and provide advancement of expenses to, each Indemnified Party against all
losses, claims, damages, costs, expenses, liabilities or judgments or amounts
that are paid in settlement of or in connection with any Claim based in whole
or in part on or arising in whole or in part out of the fact that such person
is or was a director or officer of Cowen or any of its Subsidiaries or a
manager or officer of Ramius or any of its Subsidiaries, as applicable, and
pertaining to any matter existing or occurring, or any acts or omissions
occurring,

  



         
 

  

### 

  

### at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to,
or at or after, the Effective Time (including matters, acts or
omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement and
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby) or taken at the
request of New Parent pursuant to _Section 7.4_.

  

### 

  

### (c) New Parent shall cause the individuals serving as officers and
directors of Cowen or any of its Subsidiaries or officers and managers of
Ramius or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time to
be covered for a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time by the
directors and officers liability insurance policy maintained by Cowen or
Ramius, as applicable ( _provided_ that New Parent may substitute therefor
policies of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and
conditions that are not less advantageous than such policy) with respect to
acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time that were committed
by such officers and directors in their capacity as such; _provided_ that in
no event shall New Parent be required to expend annually in the aggregate an
amount in excess of 200% of the annual premiums currently paid by Cowen or
Ramius, as applicable (which current amount is set forth in _Section 7.7(c)_
of the Cowen Disclosure Schedule and the Ramius Disclosure Schedule) for such
insurance (the " _Insurance Amount_ "), and _provided_ _further_ that if New
Parent is unable to maintain such policy (or such substitute policy) as a
result of the preceding proviso, New Parent shall obtain as much comparable
insurance as is available for the Insurance Amount. New Parents obligations
under this _Section 7.7(c)_ may be satisfied by Cowen purchasing a "tail"
policy prior to the Closing from an insurer with substantially the same or
better credit rating as the current carriers for Cowens and
Ramiuss respective existing directors and officers insurance policies in
effect as of the date of this Agreement (collectively, the " _Existing
Policies_ "), which (i) has an effective term of six (6) years from the
Effective Time, (ii) covers each Person covered by the Existing Policies for
actions and omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time, and (iii)
contains terms that are no less favorable in the aggregate than the Existing
Policies.

  

###

Common Stock or conversion of any derivative securities in respect of such
shares of Cowen Common Stock or any deemed acquisition of shares of New
Parent Class A Common Stock by an individual who after the Transactions is

resulting from or arising out of a breach of this _Section 7.10_ that
constitutes a Superior Proposal and such Superior Proposal has not been
withdrawn;

  

#####

counsel), that in light of a Superior Proposal the failure to effect such
Change of Recommendation would cause it to violate its fiduciary duties to
Cowen stockholders under applicable Law;

##### (3) Ramius has received written notice from Cowen (a " _Change of
Recommendation Notice_ ") at least five (5) Business Days prior to such

a Change of Recommendation and the manner in which it intends or may intend
to do so and (2) include the identity of the person making such Cowen
Alternative Proposal and a copy (if in writing) and summary of material terms
of such Cowen Alternative Proposal; _provided_ that any material amendment to
the terms of such Cowen Alternative Proposal shall require a new Change of
Recommendation Notice and at least two (2) Business Days prior to such Change
of Recommendation; and

  

##### 

  

##### (4) during any such notice period, Cowen and its advisors have
negotiated in good faith with Ramius (provided that Ramius desires to
negotiate) to make adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement
such that such Cowen Alternative Proposal would no longer constitute a
Superior Proposal.

Representatives to furnish or cause to be furnished nonpublic information or
data and participate in such negotiations or discussions with any third party
who has made a Cowen Alternative Proposal not resulting from or arising out
of a breach of this _Section 7.10_,  _provided_ that Cowen and its Board of
Directors concludes in good faith that such Cowen Alternative Proposal is
reasonably likely to result in a Superior Proposal, _provided_ _further_ that
any nonpublic information to be provided shall be provided pursuant to a
confidentiality agreement entered into with such third party on terms no less
favorable than the Confidentiality Agreement. Cowen shall promptly provide
to Ramius any non-public information concerning Cowen provided to any other
Person in connection with any Cowen Alternative Proposal that was not
previously provided to Ramius.  The Board of Directors of Cowen shall
promptly consider in good faith (in consultation with its outside legal

## 7.16 _Tax Matters_. Following the date hereof and prior to the Effective

be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation." Words defined in
the singular have the parallel meaning in the plural and vice versa. Words of
one gender shall be construed to apply to each gender and the neutral gender.
 The term "party: refers to a party to this Agreement and the term
"parties" refers to the parties to this Agreement.  This Agreement shall not
be interpreted or construed to require any person to take any action, or fail
to take any action, if to do so would violate any applicable law. The parties
hereto acknowledge that each party hereto has reviewed, and has had an
opportunity to have its counsel review, this Agreement and that any rule of
construction to the effect that any ambiguities are to be resolved against
the drafting party, or any similar rule operating against the drafter of an
agreement, shall not be applicable to the construction or interpretation of
this Agreement. The phrases "known" or "knowledge" mean, with respect to
either party to this Agreement, the actual knowledge of, in the case of
Cowen, the individuals set forth on _Section 10.4_ of the Cowen Disclosure
Schedule, and in the case of Ramius, the individuals set forth on _Section
10.4_ of the Ramius Disclosure Schedule.

  

## 

  

## 10.5 _Disclosure Schedules_. The statements in the Cowen
Disclosure Schedule and the Ramius Disclosure Schedule relate to the
provisions in the section of this Agreement to which they expressly relate;
provided, however, that any information set forth in one section of the Cowen
Disclosure Schedule or the Ramius Disclosure Schedule, as the case may be,
shall also be deemed to apply to each other section to which its relevance is
reasonably apparent. In the Cowen Disclosure Schedule and the Ramius
Disclosure Schedule, (a) all capitalized terms used but not defined therein
shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Agreement; (b) the section
numbers correspond to the section numbers in this Agreement; (c) inclusion of
any item in a disclosure letter (i) does not represent an admission that such
item represents a material exception or material fact, event or circumstance
or that such item has had or would be reasonably likely to have a Material
Adverse Effect on Cowen or Ramius, as applicable; (ii) does not represent a
determination that such item did not arise in the Ordinary Course of
Business; and (iii) shall not constitute, or be deemed to be, an admission to
any third party concerning such item. The Cowen Disclosure Schedule and the
Ramius Disclosure Schedule, as well as all other schedules and all exhibits
hereto, shall be deemed part of this Agreement and included in any reference
to this Agreement.

  



        
   

  

## 

  

## 10.6 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or
more counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same
agreement and shall become effective when counterparts have been signed by
each of the parties and delivered to the other party, it being understood
that each party need not sign the same counterpart.

  

## 

  

## 10.7 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the documents and the
instruments referred to in this Agreement), together with the Confidentiality
Agreement, constitutes the entire agreement and supersedes all prior
agreements and understandings, both written and oral, between the
parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement, other than
the Confidentiality Agreement.

  

## 

  

## 10.8 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement which is
invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that
jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or
unenforceability and, unless the effect of such invalidity or
unenforceability would prevent the parties from realizing the major portion
of the economic benefits of the Transactions that they currently anticipate
obtaining therefrom, shall not render invalid or unenforceable the remaining
terms and provisions of this Agreement in any other jurisdiction. If any
provision of this Agreement is so broad as to be unenforceable, the provision
shall be interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable.

  

## 

  

## 10.9 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction_. This Agreement shall be governed
and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of
Delaware applicable to contracts made and wholly performed within such state,
without regard to any applicable conflicts of law principles. The parties
hereto agree that any suit, action or proceeding brought by either party to
enforce any provision of, or based on any matter arising out of or in
connection with, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall
be brought in any federal or state court located in the State of Delaware.
Each of the parties hereto submits to the jurisdiction of any such court in
any suit, action or proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or based
on any matter arising out of, or in connection with, this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby and hereby irrevocably waives the benefit of
jurisdiction derived from present or future domicile or otherwise in such
action or proceeding. Each party hereto irrevocably waives, to the fullest
extent permitted by law, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to
the laying of the venue of any such suit, action or proceeding in any such
court or that any such suit, action or proceeding brought in any such court
has been brought in an inconvenient forum.

  

## 

  

## 10.10 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVES TRIAL
BY JURY IN ANY JUDICIAL PROCEEDING INVOLVING, DIRECTLY, IN ANY MATTERS
(WHETHER SOUNDING IN TORT, CONTRACT OR OTHERWISE) IN ANY WAY ARISING OUT OF,
RELATED TO, OR CONNECTED WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY.

  

## 

  

## 10.11 _Publicity_. Neither Cowen nor Ramius shall, and neither Cowen nor
Ramius shall permit any of its Subsidiaries to, issue or cause
the publication of any press release or other public announcement with
respect to, or otherwise make any public statement concerning, the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement without the prior consent of
Ramius, in the case of a proposed announcement or statement by Cowen, or
Cowen, in the case of a proposed announcement or statement by Ramius;
_provided_ , _however_ , that either party may, without the

  



        
   

  

## 

  

## prior consent of the other party (but after prior consultation with the
other party to the extent practicable under the circumstances) issue or cause
the publication of any press release or other public announcement to the
extent required by law or by the rules and regulations of the NASDAQ or other
Regulatory Agency.

  

## 

  

## 10.12 _Enforcement_. The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur
in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed
in accordance with their specific terms on a timely basis or were otherwise
breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an
injunction or other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement
and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in any
court identified in the _Section 10.9_ hereto, this being in addition to any
other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity (except as
limited by _Section 9.2(c)_ hereof).

  

## 

  

## 10.13 _Assignment; Third Party Beneficiaries_. Neither this Agreement nor
any of the rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be
assigned by either of the parties (whether by operation of law or otherwise)
without the prior written consent of the other party. Subject to the preceding
sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and
be enforceable by each of the parties and their respective successors and
assigns. Except as otherwise specifically provided in _Section 7.7_, this
Agreement (including the documents and instruments referred to in
this Agreement) is not intended to and does not confer upon any person other
than the parties hereto any rights or remedies under this Agreement.
