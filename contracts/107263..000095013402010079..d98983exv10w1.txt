Employee is obligated under any  contract (including licenses, covenants or
commitments of any nature)  or other agreement, or subject to any judgment,
decree or order of any  court or administrative agency, that would interfere
with the use of  such employee\'s efforts to promote the interests of the
Company or the  Buyer or that would conflict with the Company\'s or its
Subsidiaries\'  business as conducted or proposed to be conducted.   (c)
None of the employees who provide services to  the Company or its
Subsidiaries are covered by collective bargaining  agreements and, to the
Seller\'s knowledge, there are no union or labor  organization efforts

determined, in the case  of property, ad valorem or franchise Taxes (which
are not measured by,  or based upon, net income), on a per     26   
diem basis and, in the case of other Taxes, by assuming that the  Pre-Closing
Period is a separate taxable period and by taking into  account the taxable
events during such period.   (b) The Seller shall prepare and timely file
(or  cause to be prepared and timely filed), on a basis consistent with 
prior Tax Returns, all Tax Returns with the appropriate Federal, state,

arrangement.   (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this 
Section 4.11, all excise, sales, use, transfer (including real property

similar taxes, together with any interest, additions or penalties with 
respect thereto and any interest in respect of such additions or  penalties,
resulting directly from the transactions contemplated by  this Agreement (the

for Federal income tax  purposes as distributions of the assets and
liabilities of MAPCO to  WNGL pursuant to Section 332 of the Code. The
parties agree to treat  the purchase of the Subject Membership Interest
hereunder for Federal  income tax purposes as a purchase by the Buyer from
the Seller of an  undivided 98% interest in the assets and liabilities of the
Company and  the Subsidiaries (other than the membership interests in the 
Subsidiaries) followed immediately by a contribution by the Buyer and  the
Seller to the Company of their respective undivided 98% and 2%  interests in

agree within 90 days after the Closing to an allocation of the  Purchase
Price and the amount paid pursuant to Section 1.4(b), any  assumed
