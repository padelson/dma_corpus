AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER 

   

 THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this "Agreement"), dated as of January 12, 2009, is among The Medicines Company, a Delaware corporation (the "Parent"), Boxford Subsidiary Corporation, a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Parent (the "Purchaser"), and Targanta Therapeutics Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"). 

  

 WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of the Parent, the Purchaser and the Company have determined that it would be advisable and in the best interests of their respective stockholders for the Parent to acquire the Company upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement; 

  

 WHEREAS, in furtherance of such acquisition, the Purchaser will make a tender offer (as it may be amended from time to time as permitted under this Agreement, the "Offer") to purchase, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, all of the Companys issued and outstanding shares of common stock, $0.0001 par value per share (the "Company Common Stock"), for consideration of (a) $2.00 per share of Company Common Stock to be paid promptly after the Acceptance Time (as defined in Section 1.3(a)), net to the seller in cash, without interest thereon (the "Closing Payment"), plus (b) one contingent payment right per share of Company Common Stock (a "CPR"), which shall represent the right to receive the EMEA CPR Payment Amount, the FDA CPR Payment Amount, the Single Dose CPR Payment Amount and the Net Sales CPR Payment Amount (as such terms are defined in the Contingent Payment Rights Agreement in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit A_ (the "CPR Agreement") to be entered into between Parent and American Stock Transfer and Trust Company (the "Rights Agent")), if any, in cash, at the times provided for in the CPR Agreement; 

  

 WHEREAS, to effectuate such acquisition, following consummation of the Offer, the Purchaser will be merged with and into the Company, with the Company continuing as the surviving corporation in such merger (the "Merger"); 

  

 WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and as a condition and inducement to the Parents willingness to enter into this Agreement, each of the stockholders of the Company listed on _Schedule A_ has entered into a tender and support agreement, dated as of the date of this Agreement, in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit B_ (collectively, the "Stockholder Agreements"); and 

  

 WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company has (i) determined that the Offer and the Merger are fair to, and in the best interest of, the Company and its stockholders; (ii) approved this Agreement and the Stockholder Agreements and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, including the Offer and the Merger, in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the "DGCL") and (iii) declared the advisability of this Agreement and resolved to recommend that the holders of the Company Common Stock tender their shares into and accept the Offer and adopt this Agreement; 

   ##### 

  

  

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein, the Parent, the Purchaser and the Company agree as follows: 

  

ARTICLE I 

   

 _THE TENDER OFFER_   

  

 1.1 _The Offer_. 

  

 (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, within ten business days of the day on which the Purchasers intention to make the Offer is publicly announced (which announcement will be made by the Parent on January 12, 2009), the Purchaser shall commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act")), the Offer to purchase any and all outstanding shares of Company Common Stock for consideration per share equal to (a) the Closing Payment plus (b) one CPR (the "Offer Consideration"). On the terms and subject to the prior satisfaction or waiver of the conditions of the Offer and this Agreement, the Purchaser shall accept for payment all shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer as soon as practicable after the expiration of the Offer and shall pay the Closing Payment for all such shares of Company Common Stock promptly after acceptance. The obligation of the Parent and the Purchaser to commence the Offer and to accept for payment and pay the Offer Consideration for shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered in the Offer and not properly withdrawn shall be subject to the conditions set forth in _Annex I_ to this Agreement. 

   

 (b) The initial expiration date of the Offer shall be the 20th business day after commencement of the Offer (determined in accordance with Rules 14d-1(g)(3) and 14d-2 under the Exchange Act). If on or prior to any then scheduled expiration date of the Offer, all of the conditions to the Offer (including the Minimum Condition and all other conditions and requirements set forth in  _Annex I_ ) shall not have been satisfied, or waived by the Parent or the Purchaser if permitted hereunder, the Purchaser shall (and the Parent shall cause the Purchaser to) extend the Offer for periods of up to 10 business days each until the earlier of (x) the date on which the Minimum Condition has been met and all of the conditions and requirements set forth in _Annex I_ are satisfied or waived or (y) the date on which this Agreement is terminated in accordance with Section 9.1. The Purchaser expressly reserves the right, subject to compliance with the Exchange Act, to waive, amend or modify any term or condition of the Offer in its sole discretion;  _provided_ , _however_ , that, without the prior written consent of the Company, the Purchaser shall not:

 1.3 _Directors_. 

  

 (a) Promptly after the first time at which the Purchaser accepts for payment any shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer (the "Acceptance Time"), and from time to time thereafter as shares of Company Common Stock are accepted for payment and the Closing Payment is paid by the Purchaser, the Purchaser shall be entitled to designate such number of members of the Company Board (the "Purchaser Designees"), rounded up to the nearest whole number, as will give the Purchaser representation on the Company Board equal to the product of the total number of members of the Company Board (after giving effect to the directors elected pursuant to this sentence) multiplied by the percentage that the number of shares of Company Common Stock beneficially owned by the Parent or the Purchaser at such time (including shares of Company Common Stock so accepted for payment) bears to the total number of shares of Company Common Stock then outstanding; provided that in no event shall the Purchaser Designees constitute less than a majority of the Company Board. In furtherance thereof, the Company shall, upon the request of the Purchaser, use its best efforts promptly (and in any event within one business day) either to increase the size of the Company Board or to secure the resignations of such number of the Companys incumbent directors (and such incumbent directors have agreed to resign if required in order for the Company to comply with this Section 1.3(a)), or both, as is necessary to enable the Purchaser Designees to be so elected or appointed to the Company Board and the Company shall take all actions available to the Company to cause the Purchaser Designees to be so elected or appointed. At such time, the Company shall, if requested by the Purchaser, also take all action necessary to cause persons designated by the Purchaser to constitute at least the same percentage (rounded up to the next whole number) as is on the Company Board of (i) each committee of the Company Board, (ii) each board of directors (or similar body) of each Subsidiary (as defined in Section 4.3(a) hereof) of the Company and (iii) each committee (or similar body) of each such board. The provisions of this Section 1.3 are in addition to and shall not limit any rights which the Purchaser, the Parent or any of their Affiliates may have as a holder or beneficial owner of shares of Company Common Stock as a matter of applicable law with respect to the election of directors or otherwise. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (b) The Company shall take all actions required in order to fulfill its obligations under Section 1.3(a), including mailing to its stockholders the information required by Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder as part of the Schedule 14D-9. The Parent and the Purchaser shall supply to the Company in writing any information with respect to the Parent and the Purchaser and the Purchaser Designees to the extent required by such Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1. 

   

 (c) Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 1.3, the parties hereto shall use their respective best efforts to ensure that at least two of the members of the Company Board shall, at all times prior to the Effective Time (as defined in Section 2.3 hereof), be directors of the Company who were directors of the Company on the date hereof (the "Independent Directors"), provided that, (i) the person listed in Section 1.3(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule shall not constitute an Independent Director under this Section 1.3 and (ii) if there shall be in office less than two Independent Directors for any reason, the Company Board shall cause the person designated by the remaining Independent Director to fill such vacancy who shall be deemed to be an Independent Director for all purposes of this Agreement, or if no Independent Directors then remain, the other directors of the Company then in office shall designate two persons to fill such vacancies who will not be directors, officers, employees or Affiliates of the Parent or the Purchaser and such persons shall be deemed to be Independent Directors for all purposes of this Agreement. From and after the time, if any, that the Purchaser Designees constitute a majority of the Company Board and prior to the Effective Time, subject to the terms hereof, any amendment or modification of this Agreement, any termination of this Agreement by the Company, any extension of time for performance of any of the obligations of the Parent or the Purchaser hereunder, any waiver of any condition to the Companys obligations hereunder or any of the Companys rights hereunder or any amendment to the Companys certificate of incorporation or bylaws may be effected only if (in addition to the approval of the Company Board as a whole) there are in office one or more Independent Directors and such action is approved by a majority of the Independent Directors then in office.

 2.7 _Top-Up Option_. 

  

 (a) Subject to Section 2.7(b) and Section 2.7(c), the Company grants to the Purchaser an assignable and irrevocable option (the "Top-Up Option") to purchase from the Company the number of shares of Company Common Stock (the "Top-Up Option Shares") 

   ##### 

  

    

equal to the lesser of (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock that,
when added to the number of shares of Company Common Stock owned by the
Purchaser as of immediately prior to the exercise of the Top-Up Option,
constitutes one share more than 90% of the number of shares of Company Common
Stock then outstanding on a fully diluted basis (determined in accordance
with _Annex I_ ) (assuming the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares) or (ii)
the aggregate of the number of shares of Company Common Stock held
as treasury shares by the Company and its Subsidiaries and the number of
shares of Company Common Stock that the Company is authorized to issue under
its certificate of incorporation but that are not issued and outstanding (and
are not reserved for issuance pursuant to the exercise of Company Stock
Options or Company Warrants) as of immediately prior to the exercise of the
Top-Up Option. 

  

 (b) The Top-Up Option may be exercised by the Purchaser, in whole or in part, at any time at or after the Acceptance Time. The purchase price payable for each Top-Up Option Share shall consist of (i) an amount equal to the Closing Payment (the "Initial Top-Up Payment") plus (ii) a CPR. The aggregate Initial Top-Up Payment may be paid by the Purchaser, at its election, either in cash or by executing and delivering to the Company a promissory note having a principal amount equal to such payment, or by any combination of cash and such promissory note. Any such promissory note shall bear interest at the applicable federal rate determined under Section 1274(d) of the Code, shall mature on the first anniversary of the date of execution and delivery of such promissory note and may be prepaid without premium or penalty. The CPR shall be payable, in cash, at the times provided for in the CPR Agreement. 

   

 (c) In the event that the Purchaser wishes to exercise the Top-Up Option, it shall deliver to the Company a notice setting forth (i) the number of Top-Up Option Shares that it intends to purchase pursuant to the Top-Up Option, (ii) the manner in which it intends to pay the Initial Top-Up Payment and (iii) the place and time at which the closing of the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares by the Purchaser is to take place. At the closing of the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares, the Purchaser shall cause to be delivered to the Company the consideration required to be delivered in exchange for such Top-Up Option Shares, and the Company shall cause to be issued to the Purchaser a certificate representing such shares. 

   

 (d) The Parent and the Purchaser acknowledge that the Top-Up Option Shares that the Purchaser may acquire upon exercise of the Top-Up Option will not be registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), and will be issued in reliance upon an exemption thereunder for transactions not involving a public offering. The Parent and the Purchaser represent and warrant to the Company that the Purchaser is, or will be upon the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares, an "Accredited Investor", as defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D under the Securities Act. The Purchaser agrees that the Top-Up Option and the Top-Up Option Shares to be acquired upon exercise of the Top-Up Option are being and will be acquired by the Purchaser for the purpose of investment and not with a view to, or for resale in connection with, any distribution thereof in violation of the Securities Act.

ARTICLE III 

   

 _CONVERSION OF SECURITIES IN THE MERGER_   

  

 3.1 _Effect of Merger of Capital Stock_. 

  

 (a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of the capital stock of the Company or capital stock of the Purchaser: 

    

 (i) each share of the Purchasers capital stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of the same class of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation; 

   

 (ii) each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that is owned by the Parent, the Purchaser or the Company or any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Parent, the Purchaser or the Company, including all shares of Company Common Stock held by the Company as treasury stock, shall automatically be cancelled, and no payment shall be made with respect thereto; and 

   

 (iii) each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares of Company Common Stock to be cancelled pursuant to clause (ii) above and any Dissenting Shares (as defined in Section 3.1(b) hereof)) shall be automatically cancelled and extinguished and be converted into and become the right to receive from the Surviving Corporation or the Parent (A) $2.00 in cash per share (such amount, or such higher price per share that may be paid as the Closing Payment in the Offer, the "Closing Merger Consideration"), which amount shall be paid promptly after the Effective Time in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, plus (B) one CPR or such higher contingent payments that may be offered in the Offer, in each case without any interest thereon (collectively, the "Merger Consideration"). As of the Effective Time, all such shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall be automatically cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such shares of Company Common Stock (a "Certificate"), and each holder of record of uncertificated shares of Company Common Stock represented by book-entry as of immediately prior to the Effective Time ("Book-Entry Shares"), shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Section 3.1(a)(iii) upon the surrender of such Certificate (or upon receipt of an agents message in the case of Book-Entry 

   ##### 

  

    

Shares) in accordance with Section 3.2, without interest and subject to
any applicable withholding rights in accordance with Section 3.2(g). 

  

 (b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by any holder who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such shares (the "Dissenting Shares") pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL ("Section 262") shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 3.1(a)(iii), but instead such holder shall be entitled to payment of the fair value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262\. At the Effective Time, all Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of Dissenting Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the fair value of such shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262\. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under Section 262 or a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not entitled to the relief provided by Section 262, then the right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such holders Dissenting Shares under Section 262 shall cease and such Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to have been converted at the Effective Time into, and shall have become, the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 3.1(a)(iii), without interest. The Company shall give the Parent and the Purchaser prompt notice of any demands for payment, or notices of intent to demand payment, received by the Company with respect to shares of Company Common Stock, and the Parent and the Purchaser shall have the right to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of the Parent and the Purchaser, make any payment with respect to, or settle, or offer to settle, any such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing. 

   

 (c) At the Effective Time, the Companys 2007 Stock Option and Incentive Plan, as amended (the "2007 Option Plan"), shall be assumed by the Parent. The Parent shall not assume any other stock option plans or other equity-related plans of the Company (such plans and the 2007 Option Plan are collectively referred to herein as the "Company Stock Plans"). The Company shall cause each outstanding option to purchase Company Common Stock (each, a "Company Stock Option" and collectively, the "Company Stock Options") issued under the Companys 2005 Stock Option Plan, as amended, to the extent not exercised prior to the Closing, to be terminated as of immediately prior to the Effective Time without any payment or Merger Consideration issuable with respect thereto. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause all outstanding Company Stock Options issued under the 2007 Option Plan and the Companys Re-Amended and Restated Stock Option Plan (the "1995 Option Plan") not set forth on Section 4.2(g) of the Company Disclosure Schedule to terminate as of immediately prior to the Effective Time without any payment or Merger Consideration payable with respect thereto. All Company Stock Options issued under the 2007 Option Plan and the 1995 Option Plan and not terminated as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (the "Carryover Options"), whether 

   ##### 

  

    

vested or unvested, shall be assumed by the Parent and after the Effective
Time shall become an option to acquire with respect to each share of Company
Common Stock that the holder of such Carryover Option would have been
entitled to receive had such holder exercised such Carryover Option in full
immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Merger Consideration
and shall otherwise be on the same terms and conditions as were applicable
under such Carryover Option immediately prior to the Effective Time,
including without limitation the same exercise price per share of Company
Common Stock. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, the Parent
shall deliver to all holders of Carryover Options an appropriate notice
setting forth such participants rights pursuant to such Carryover Options,
as provided in this Section 3.1(c). 

  

 (d) The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause each warrant or other outstanding right (other than Company Stock Options) to purchase shares of Company Common Stock (such outstanding warrants or other rights, the "Company Warrants") not set forth on Section 4.2(h) of the Company Disclosure Schedule to terminate as of immediately prior to the Effective Time without any payment or Merger Consideration payable with respect thereto. All Company Warrants not terminated prior to the Effective Time (the "Carryover Warrants"), whether vested or unvested, shall be assumed by the Parent and after the Effective Time shall become a warrant to acquire with respect to each share of Company Common Stock that the holder of such Carryover Warrant would have been entitled to receive had such holder exercised such Carryover Warrant in full immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Merger Consideration and shall otherwise be on the same terms and conditions as were applicable under such Carryover Warrant immediately prior to the Effective Time, including without limitation the same exercise price per share of Company Common Stock. 

  

 3.2 _Surrender of Certificates_. The procedures for exchanging outstanding shares of Company Common Stock for the Merger Consideration pursuant to the Merger are as follows: 

  

 (a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Parent shall select a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as agent (the "Paying Agent") for the payment after the Effective Time of the Closing Merger Consideration upon surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. From time to time after the Effective Time, the Parent shall provide, or cause the Surviving Corporation to provide, to the Paying Agent, on a timely basis as and when needed, cash necessary for payment of the Closing Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 3.1(a)(iii) upon surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the "Payment Fund"). 

   

 (b) _Exchange Procedures_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the Paying Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a Certificate and each holder of record of Book-Entry Shares (i) a letter of transmittal (which, in the case of shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by a Certificate, shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificate shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificate to the Paying Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as the Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the 

   ##### 

  

    

Certificate or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration.
Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent or to
such other agent or agents as may be appointed by the Parent (or upon receipt
of an agents message in the case of Book-Entry Shares), together with such
letter of transmittal, duly completed and properly executed, and such other
documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of
such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor the Merger Consideration that such holder has the right to
receive pursuant to Section 3.1(a)(iii) and the Certificate or Book-Entry
Shares so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. In the event of
a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock that is not registered in the
stock transfer records of the Company, the Merger Consideration that such
holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of Section
3.1(a)(iii) may be paid to a person other than the person in whose name
the Certificate or Book-Entry Shares so surrendered is or are registered if,
in the case of shares formerly represented by a Certificate, such Certificate
shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and,
in the case of shares formerly represented by a Certificate or any Book-Entry
Shares, the person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other
taxes required by reason of the payment to a person other than the registered
holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares or establish to the
satisfaction of the Parent that such tax has been paid or is not applicable.
Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 3.2, each Certificate and
all Book-Entry Shares shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive upon such surrender, in each case without
interest, the Merger Consideration that such holder has the right to receive
pursuant to Section 3.1(a)(iii). 

  

 (c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. All Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock, and from and after the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any Certificate (or an agents message in respect of Book-Entry Shares) is presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent for any reason, it shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Article III. 

   

 (d) _Termination of Payment Fund_. Any portion of the Payment Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares for six months after the Effective Time shall be delivered by the Paying Agent to the Parent, upon demand, and any holder of a Certificate who has not theretofore complied with this Article III (or delivered an agents message, in the case of Book-Entry Shares) shall thereafter look only to the Parent for payment of the Merger Consideration which such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of Section 3.1(a)(iii), but shall have no greater rights against the Parent than may be accorded to general unsecured creditors of the Parent under applicable law. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (e) _No Liability_. None of the Parent, the Purchaser, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of any Merger Consideration for such shares delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. If any Certificate has not been surrendered (or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares, an agents message has not been delivered) prior to two years after the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which the Merger Consideration in respect of such Certificate would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity (as defined in Section 4.4(c))), any such Merger Consideration shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto. 

   

 (f) _Investment of Payment Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest any cash included in the Payment Fund as directed by the Parent. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to and be the property of the Parent. 

   

 (g) _Withholding Rights_. The Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as any of them reasonably determines that it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any other applicable law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority by the Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent. 

   

 (h) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent shall pay to such holder the Closing Merger Consideration required pursuant to Section 3.1(a)(iii) in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof with such assurances as the Parent or Paying Agent, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment of the Closing Merger Consideration, may require of the holder of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate. __

taken as a whole, in a disproportionate manner as compared to the Companys
industry peers);

 (vii) any Change to the extent resulting from changes in GAAP (in each case other than Changes that affect the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, in a disproportionate manner as compared to the Companys industry peers); 

   

 (viii) any Change to the extent resulting from changes in the Companys stock price or the trading volume of the Companys stock, in and of itself (it being understood that the facts or occurrences giving rise or contributing to such changes may be deemed to constitute, or be taken into account in determining whether there has been, or would be, a Company Material Adverse Effect); 

   

 (ix) any Change to the extent resulting from any failure by the Company to meet any public estimates or expectations of the Companys revenue, earnings or other financial performance or results of operations for any period, in and of itself (it being understood, in each case, that the facts or occurrences giving rise or contributing to such failure may be deemed to constitute, or be taken into account in determining whether there has been, or would be, a Company Material Adverse Effect); and 

   

 (x) any Change to the extent resulting from the pendency or announcement of the Offer, the Merger or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any loss of employees but not, for the avoidance of doubt, any direct legal or contractual consequence of the Companys execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

Terms defined in this Section 4.14(a) by reference to the meaning given to such term in a provision of ERISA or the Code refer to all plans, agreements or arrangements that fall within such meaning, regardless of whether the plan, agreement or arrangement in question is itself subject to ERISA or the Code. 

  

 (b) With respect to each Company Employee Plan, the Company has made available to the Parent a complete and accurate copy of (i) such Company Employee Plan (or a written summary of any unwritten plan), (ii) the most recent annual report (Form 5500) filed with the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS"), (iii) each trust agreement, group annuity contract and summary plan description, if any, relating to such Company Employee Plan, (iv) the most recent financial statements for each Company Employee Plan that is funded, (v) all personnel, payroll and employment manuals and policies, (vi) all employee handbooks, (vii) all reports regarding the satisfaction of the nondiscrimination requirements of Sections 410(b), 401(k) and 401(m) of the Code for the last three plan years, (viii) all other reports, returns and similar documents filed or required to be filed with any Governmental Entity for the last three plan years and all schedules and attachments thereto, and (ix) for the four most recent years, all actuarial valuation reports and all schedules and attachments thereto.

The Company, each Subsidiary of the Company, each ERISA Affiliate and each Company Employee Plan are in compliance in all material respects with the currently applicable provisions of ERISA and the Code and the regulations thereunder 

   #####

corresponding or similar provisions of any applicable Canadian federal or
provincial laws. All filings and reports as to each Company Employee Plan
required to have been submitted to the IRS or to the United States Department
of Labor have been timely submitted. With respect to the Company Employee
Plans, no event has occurred, and there exists no condition or set of
circumstances in connection with which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
could be subject to any material liability (other than claims made in the
ordinary course) under ERISA, the Code or any other applicable law. 

  

 (d) With respect to the Company Employee Plans, each of the Company, the Companys Subsidiaries and their ERISA Affiliates has made all required contributions thereto and there are no benefit obligations for which contributions have not been made or properly accrued and there are no benefit obligations which have not been accounted for by reserves or otherwise properly footnoted in accordance with GAAP, on the financial statements of the Company. The assets of each Company Employee Plan which is funded are reported at their fair market value on the books and records of such Employee Benefit Plan. 

  

 (e) All the Company Employee Plans that are intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code have received determination letters from the IRS to the effect that such Company Employee Plans are qualified and the plans and trusts related thereto are exempt from federal income taxes under Sections 401(a) and 501(a), respectively, of the Code, no such determination letter has been revoked and revocation has not been threatened, and no such Employee Benefit Plan has been amended or operated since the date of its most recent determination letter or application therefor in any respect, and no act or omission has occurred, that would reasonably be expected to adversely affect its qualification or materially increase its cost. Each Company Employee Plan which is required to satisfy Section 401(k)(3) or Section 401(m)(2) of the Code has been tested for compliance with, and satisfies the requirements of Section 401(k)(3) and Section 401(m)(2) of the Code, as the case may be, for each plan year ending prior to the Closing Date. All the Company Employee Plans that are intended or required to be qualified under applicable Canadian federal or provincial laws are so qualified.

No Company Employee Plan is funded by, associated with or related to a "voluntary employees beneficiary association" within the meaning of Section 501(c)(9) of the Code. No Company Employee Plan holds securities issued by the Company, any of the Companys Subsidiaries or any of their ERISA Affiliates. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (g) Each Company Employee Plan is amendable and terminable unilaterally by the Company and any of the Companys Subsidiaries which are a party thereto or covered thereby at any time without liability to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a result thereof (other than for benefits accrued through the date of termination or amendment and reasonable administrative expenses related thereto) and no Company Employee Plan, plan documentation or agreement, summary plan description or other written communication distributed generally to employees by its terms prohibits the Company or any of its Subsidiaries from amending or terminating any such Company Employee Plan. The investment vehicles used to fund the Company Employee Plans may be changed at any time without incurring a sales charge, surrender fee or other similar expense. 

  

 (h) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any oral or written (i) agreement with any stockholders, director, executive officer or other key employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (A) the benefits of which are contingent, or the terms of which are altered, upon the occurrence of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (B) providing any term of employment or compensation guarantee or (C) providing severance benefits or other benefits after the termination of employment of such stockholder, director, executive officer or key employee; (ii) agreement, plan or arrangement under which any person may receive payments from the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that may be subject to the tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code or included in the determination of such persons "parachute payment" under Section 280G of the Code, without regard to Section 280G(b)(4); or (iii) agreement or plan binding the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, including any stock option plan, stock appreciation right plan, restricted stock plan, stock purchase plan or severance benefit plan, any of the benefits of which shall be increased, or the vesting of the benefits of which shall be accelerated, by the occurrence of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the value of any of the benefits of which shall be calculated on the basis of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Company has made available to the Parent the information necessary to accurately calculate any excise tax due under Section 4999 of the Code as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement for which the Company or the Parent may directly or indirectly become liable and the amount of deductions that may be disallowed under Section 280G of the Code as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

 (i) None of the Company Employee Plans promises or provides retiree medical or other retiree welfare benefits to any person, except as required by applicable law. 

  

 (j) Each Company Employee Plan that is a "nonqualified deferred compensation plan" (as defined in Code Section 409A(d)(1)) (i) has been operated in good faith compliance with Code Section 409A, the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder and any other guidance issued with respect to Code Section 409A (the "Section 409A Guidance") at all times since January 1, 2005 through December 31, 2008, (ii) has been operated in compliance with Code Section 409A and the Section 409A Guidance at all times since December 31, 2008, and (iii) has been in documentary compliance within the meaning of Code Section 409A and the 

   ##### 

  

    

Section 409A Guidance at all times on or after December 31, 2008. No Company
Employee Plan that is a "nonqualified deferred compensation plan" that was in
existence as of October 3, 2004 has been materially modified (as determined
under Code Section 409A and the Section 409A Guidance) after October 3, 2004,
except to the extent that such modifications comply in all material respects
with Section 409A. No event has occurred that would be treated by
Code Section 409A(b) as a transfer of property for purposes of Code Section
83\. No stock option or equity unit option granted under any Company Employee
Plan had an exercise price that was or may have been less than the fair
market value of the underlying stock or equity units (as the case may be) as
of the date such option was granted, or has any feature for the deferral of
compensation other than the deferral of recognition of income until the later
of exercise or disposition of such option. The Companys past and current
stock option grant practices (i) complied with all applicable Company Stock
Plans, stock exchange rules and applicable laws, (ii) have been
fairly presented in accordance with GAAP in the Companys financial
statements, and (iii) are not and have not been the subject of any internal
investigation, review or inquiry. The Company has not granted, and there is
no and has been no Company policy or practice to grant, stock options
prior to, or otherwise coordinate the grant of stock options with, the
release or other public announcement of material information regarding the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or their financial results or prospects.

 (c) Each of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries has all Registrations from the FDA or any other comparable Governmental Entity required to conduct their respective businesses. Each of the Registrations is valid and subsisting in full force and effect, and shall not cease to be in full force and effect as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

   ##### 

  

    

Companys knowledge, there is no false or misleading information or
significant omission in any product application or other submission to FDA or
any other comparable Governmental Entity. The Company and its Subsidiaries
have fulfilled and performed their obligations under each Registration in all
material respects, and no material event has occurred or condition or state
of facts exists which would constitute a breach or default or would cause
revocation, suspension, limitation or termination of any such Registration or
would result in any other impairment of the rights of the holder of any such
Registration. No loss or expiration of any Registration is pending or, to the
Companys knowledge, threatened, other than expiration of any Registration in
accordance with the terms thereof, and there is no circumstance that would
reasonably be expected to cause such Registration to not be renewable upon
expiration to the extent permitted by law, as needed. To the
Companys knowledge, any third party that is a supplier, manufacturer, or
contractor for the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is in compliance with
all Registrations of the FDA or any comparable Governmental Entity. For

licenses, permits, certificates, or exemptions issued by any Governmental
Entity (including, without limitation, pre-market approval applications, pre-
market notifications, investigational new drug applications, new drug
applications, biologic license applications, manufacturing approvals and

their foreign equivalent) held by the Company or its Subsidiaries that are

sale and provision of the products and services of the Company and its
Subsidiaries.

The descriptions of, protocols for, and data and other results of, the pre-clinical and clinical trials conducted or currently being conducted by or on behalf of the Company or its Subsidiaries, and, to the Companys knowledge, the clinical trials conducted by Lilly with respect to Oritavancin, that have been made available to the Parent are complete and accurate in all material respects.

The Parent Disclosure Schedule shall be arranged in paragraphs corresponding to the numbered and lettered paragraphs contained in this Article V and the disclosure in any paragraph of the Parent Disclosure Schedule shall qualify (1) the corresponding paragraph in this Article V and (2) the other paragraphs in this Article V only to the extent that it is reasonably apparent from a reading of such disclosure that it also qualifies or applies to such other paragraphs.  

  

 5.1 _Organization, Standing and Power_. 

  

 (a) Each of the Parent and the Purchaser is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation, has all requisite corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and assets and to carry on its business as now being conducted, and is duly qualified to do business and is in good standing as a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction where the failure to be so qualified or in good standing would reasonably be expected to result in a Parent Material Adverse Effect. 

   

 (b) For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Parent Material Adverse Effect" means any Change that, individually or in the aggregate with all other Changes occurring or existing prior to the determination of a Parent Material Adverse Effect, has a material adverse effect on (i) the business, assets, liabilities, capitalization, condition (financial or other) or results of operations of the Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole or (ii) the ability of the Parent 

    ##### 

  

    

or the Purchaser to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement;  _provided_ , _however_ , that, in the case of clause (i) of the
definition of Parent Material Adverse Effect, none of the following (to the
extent arising after the date hereof) shall be deemed to be or constitute a
Parent Material Adverse Effect, or taken into account when determining
whether a "Parent Material Adverse Effect" has occurred or would occur: 

    

 (i) any Change to the extent resulting from general economic conditions in the United States or any other country or region in the world (in each case other than Changes that affect the Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, in a disproportionate manner as compared to the Parents industry peers); 

   

 (ii) any Change to the extent resulting from conditions in the industries in which the Parent and its Subsidiaries conduct business (in each case other than Changes that affect the Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, in a disproportionate manner as compared to the Parents industry peers); 

   

 (iii) any Change to the extent resulting from acts of war, sabotage or terrorism in the United States or any other country or region in the world (in each case other than Changes that affect the Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, in a disproportionate manner as compared to the Parents industry peers); 

   

 (iv) any Change to the extent resulting from the taking of any action required by this Agreement, or the failure to take any action prohibited by this Agreement; 

   

 (v) any Change to the extent resulting from any actions taken, or failure to take action, in each case which the Company has requested in writing or approved in writing or to which the Company has consented in writing; 

   

 (vi) any Change to the extent resulting from changes in law or other legal or regulatory conditions (in each case other than Changes that affect the Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, in a disproportionate manner as compared to the Parents industry peers); 

   

 (vii) any Change to the extent resulting from changes in GAAP (in each case other than Changes that affect the Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, in a disproportionate manner as compared to the Parents industry peers); 

   

 (viii) any Change to the extent resulting from changes in the Parents stock price or the trading volume of the Parents stock, in and of itself (it being understood that the facts or occurrences giving rise or contributing to such 

   ##### 

  

    

changes may be deemed to constitute, or be taken into account in
determining whether there has been, or would be, a Parent Material Adverse
Effect); 

   

 (ix) any Change to the extent resulting from any failure by the Parent to meet any public estimates or expectations of the Parents revenue, earnings or other financial performance or results of operations for any period, in and of itself (it being understood, in each case, that the facts or occurrences giving rise or contributing to such failure may be deemed to constitute, or be taken into account in determining whether there has been, or would be, a Parent Material Adverse Effect); 

   

 (x) any Change to the extent resulting from the pendency or announcement of the Offer, the Merger or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (but not, for the avoidance of doubt, any direct legal or contractual consequence of the Parents execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby); and 

   

 (xi) any Changes with respect to (i) a potential patent term extension for the Parents U.S. patent with respect to Angiomax or the agreements between the Parent and the Parents licensor pertaining to Angiomax or (ii) the development or potential commercialization of Cangrelor.

shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer (the "Specified Time"),
the Company may, to the extent required by the fiduciary obligations of the
Company Board, as determined in good faith by the Company Board
after consultation with outside counsel, in response to a bona fide,
unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal made or received after the date of
this Agreement that the Company Board reasonably determines in good faith

business days after providing the notice contemplated by Section 7.1(c), (x)

foregoing, prior to the Specified Time, the Company may, to the extent

of the Company Board, as determined in good faith by the Company Board after
consultation with outside counsel, grant a waiver or release under any
confidentiality, standstill or similar agreement to which the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries is a party for the sole purpose of allowing the other
party to such agreement to submit an Acquisition Proposal that constitutes,
or is reasonably likely to lead to, a Superior Proposal, in each case that
did not result from a breach by the Company of this Section 7.1. Without
limiting the foregoing, it is agreed that any violation of the restrictions
set forth in this Section 7.1(a) by any Representative of the Company or any

 (i) except as set forth in this Section 7.1(b), withdraw or modify, or propose to withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to the Parent or the Purchaser, the approval or recommendation by the Company Board or any such committee of this Agreement, the Offer or the Merger or that the stockholders of the Company tender their shares into and accept the Offer; 

   

 (ii) cause or permit the Company to enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement or similar agreement (an "Acquisition Agreement") constituting or relating to any Acquisition Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement referred to in Section 7.1(a) entered into in the circumstances referred to in Section 7.1(a)); 

   

 (iii) withdraw or modify, or propose to withdraw or modify, the approval by the Compensation Committee of the Company Compensation Arrangements as Approved Company Compensation Arrangements for purposes of satisfying the requirements of the non-exclusive safe-harbor in accordance to Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act; or 

   

 (iv) adopt, approve or recommend, or propose to adopt, approve or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal. 

 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, _provided_ the Company shall not have breached
its obligations under Section 7.1(a), the Company Board may withdraw or
modify the recommendation by the Company Board or any committee thereof of
this Agreement, the Offer or the Merger in circumstances in which the Company
Board has determined that a Superior Proposal is outstanding, if: 

   

(A) the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with
outside counsel, that its fiduciary obligations require it to do so, but only
at a time that is prior to the Specified Time and is after the fourth
business day following the Parents receipt of written notice (an "Adverse
Recommendation Notice") advising the Parent that the 

   ##### 

  

 

Company Board intends to withdraw or modify the recommendation (and the manner
and timing in which it intends to do so); 

   

(B) the Company provides the Parent with a reasonable opportunity to make
adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement and negotiates in
good faith with the Parent with respect thereto during the four business day
period after the Parent has received the Adverse Recommendation Notice, in
each case as would enable the Company Board or committee thereof to maintain
in effect its recommendation in favor of this Agreement, the Offer and the
Merger; 

  

(C) such withdrawal is due to the existence of a Superior Proposal, and the
Company has complied with the requirements of Section 7.1(c), including
specifying the material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal and
identifying the person making such Superior Proposal; and 

  

(D) the Parent shall not have within four business days of the receipt of the
Adverse Recommendation Notice made an offer or proposal that the Company
Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial and
legal advisors) to be at least as favorable to the Companys stockholders
from a financial point of view as such Superior Proposal. 

 

In addition, and notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to the
Specified Time, the Company Board may in response to a material development
or change in circumstances occurring or arising after the date hereof that
was neither known to the Company Board nor reasonably foreseeable as of or
prior to the date hereof (and not relating to any Acquisition Proposal)
(such material development or change in circumstances, an "Intervening
Event"), withdraw or modify its recommendation of this Agreement, the Offer
or the Merger if the Company Board has concluded in good faith, after
consultation with its outside counsel, that, in light of such Intervening
Event, its fiduciary obligations require it to take such action; _provided_
that, the Company Board shall not be entitled to take such action pursuant to
this sentence unless the Company has (x) provided to the Parent at least four
business days prior written notice advising the Parent that the Company
Board intends to take such action and specifying the reasons therefor in
reasonable detail and (y) during such four business day period, if requested
by the Parent, engaged in good faith negotiations with the Parent to amend
this Agreement in such a manner that obviates the need for taking such action
as a result of the Intervening Event. Any Company Adverse
Recommendation Change shall not change the approval of this Agreement or any
other approval of the Company Board, nor shall any Company Adverse
Recommendation Change have the effect of causing any state
(including Delaware) corporate takeover statute or other similar statute to
be applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, including
the Offer and the Merger. 

   

 (c) The Company shall promptly, and in any event within one business day, advise the Parent orally, with written confirmation to follow within 24 hours, of any Acquisition Proposal or any request for nonpublic information in connection with any Acquisition Proposal, 

    ##### 

  

    

or any inquiry with respect to, or that may reasonably be expected to lead to
any Acquisition Proposal, the material terms and conditions of any such
Acquisition Proposal or inquiry and the identity of the person making any
such Acquisition Proposal or inquiry. The Company shall (i) keep the Parent
reasonably informed, on a current basis, of the status and details (including
any change to the terms) of any such Acquisition Proposal or inquiry, (ii)
provide to the Parent as soon as reasonably practicable after receipt or
delivery thereof copies of all correspondence and other written material sent
or provided to the Company, including those provided by electronic mail,
from any third party in connection with any Acquisition Proposal or sent or
provided by the Company to any third party in connection with any Acquisition
Proposal and (iii) if the Parent shall make a counterproposal, consider in
good faith the terms of such counterproposal. Contemporaneously
with providing any information to a third party in connection with any such
Superior Proposal or inquiry, the Company shall furnish a copy of such
information to the Parent. 

   

 (d) Nothing contained in Section 7.1 shall be deemed to prohibit the Company from taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position with respect to a tender offer contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making any required disclosure to the Companys stockholders if, in the good faith judgment of the Company Board, after consultation with outside counsel, failure so to disclose would be inconsistent with its obligations under applicable law;  _provided_ , _however_ , that, in no event shall the Company Board or any committee thereof take, or agree or resolve to take, any action prohibited by Section 7.1(b). 

   

 (e) The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their Representatives to, cease immediately all discussions and negotiations regarding any proposal that constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall promptly request the return or destruction of all copies of nonpublic information it or its Subsidiaries and its and their Representatives have distributed on or prior to the date of this Agreement to other potential purchasers returned to the Company as soon as possible. 

   

 (f) For purposes of this Agreement: 

   

 "Acquisition Proposal" means (i) any inquiry, proposal or offer for a license or collaboration transaction involving Oritavancin, or for a merger, amalgamation, consolidation, dissolution, sale of substantial assets, tender offer, recapitalization, share exchange or other business combination involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) any proposal for the issuance by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of 15% or more of its equity securities or (iii) any proposal or offer to acquire in any manner, directly or indirectly, 15% or more of the equity securities or consolidated total assets of the Company, in each case other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

   

 "Superior Proposal" means any unsolicited, bona fide written proposal made by a third party to acquire all the equity securities or all or substantially all of the assets of the Company, pursuant to a tender or exchange offer, a merger, a sale of its assets or by entry into an 

    ##### 

  

    

exclusive, worldwide license of Oritavancin for the term of the patents and
patent applications covered by the Lilly License Agreement (including any
extensions or renewals of the terms of such patents or patent applications),
which license contains no limitations on the field of use other than any such
limitations required by the terms of the Lilly License Agreement, (i) on terms
which the Company Board determines in its good faith judgment to be
materially more favorable from a financial point of view to the holders of
Company Common Stock than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(after consultation with the Financial Advisor or another nationally
recognized independent financial advisor), taking into account all the terms
and conditions of such proposal and this Agreement (including any proposal by
the Parent to amend the terms of this Agreement) and (ii) that is reasonably
capable of being completed on the terms proposed, taking into account
all financial, regulatory, legal and other aspects of such proposal;
_provided_ , _however_ , that no Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be a
Superior Proposal if any financing required to consummate the Acquisition
Proposal is not committed. 

   

 7.2 _Access to Information_. The Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries and the Companys and such Subsidiaries Representatives to, afford to the Parent and its Representatives complete access, at all reasonable times, during the period prior to the Effective Time, to all of the Companys and any of its Subsidiaries properties, books, records, agreements and personnel and shall furnish the Parent all financial, operating and other data and information as the Parent may reasonably request. Unless otherwise required by law, the Parent will hold any such information which is nonpublic in confidence in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company shall, within two business days of any request therefor, provide to the Parent the information described in Rule 14a-7(a)(2)(ii) under the Exchange Act and any information to which a holder of Company Common Stock would be entitled under Section 220 of the DGCL (assuming such holder met the requirements of such section). The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to secure for the Company access to and copies of the workpapers of its independent public accountants. No information or knowledge obtained in any investigation pursuant to this Section 7.2 or otherwise shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty contained in the Agreement or the conditions to the obligations of the parties to consummate the Offer or the Merger. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not be obligated to disclose any information if doing so would (a) violate any applicable laws, rules or regulations, (b) result in the loss of attorney-client privilege with respect to such information ( _provided_ that such privilege cannot be reasonably sufficiently protected using a joint defense or other similar agreement) or (c) result in a breach of an agreement to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or result in the disclosure of trade secrets of third parties. 

  

 7.3 _Legal Conditions to the Merger_. 

  

 (a) Subject to the terms hereof, including Section 7.3(b), the Company and the Parent shall each use its reasonable best efforts to (i) take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated 

    ##### 

  

    

hereby as promptly as practicable, (ii) as promptly as practicable, obtain
from any Governmental Entity or any other third party any consents, licenses,
permits, waivers, approvals, authorizations, or orders required to be
obtained or made by the Company or the Parent or any of their Subsidiaries in
connection with the authorization, execution and delivery of this
Agreement and the consummation of the Offer, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby, (iii) as promptly as practicable, make all
necessary filings, and thereafter make any other required submissions, with
respect to this Agreement, the Offer and the Merger required under (A)
the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, and any other applicable federal or
state securities laws, (B) the HSR Act and any related governmental request
thereunder, and (C) any other applicable law and (iv) execute or deliver any
additional instruments necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated
by, and to fully carry out the purposes of, this Agreement. The Company and
the Parent shall cooperate with each other in connection with the making of
all such filings and shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to
furnish to each other all information required for any application or other
filing to be made pursuant to the rules and regulations of any applicable law
(including all information required to be included in the Offer Documents) in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. For the
avoidance of doubt, the Parent and the Company agree that nothing contained
in this Section 7.3(a) shall modify or affect their respective rights and
responsibilities under Section 7.3(b). 

   

 (b) Subject to the terms hereof, the Parent and the Company agree, and shall cause each of their respective Subsidiaries, to cooperate and to use their respective reasonable best efforts to obtain any government clearances or approvals and the expiration of any waiting periods required for consummation of the Offer under the HSR Act, the Sherman Antitrust Act, as amended, the Clayton Act, as amended, the Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, and any other federal, state, provincial or foreign law or, regulation or decree designed to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions for the purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint of trade (collectively "Antitrust Laws"), and to respond to any government requests for information under any Antitrust Law. The parties hereto will consult and cooperate with one another, and consider in good faith the views of one another, in connection with any analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any party hereto in connection with proceedings under or relating to any Antitrust Law. The Parent shall be entitled to direct any proceedings or negotiations with any Governmental Entity relating to any of the foregoing, _provided_ that it shall afford the Company a reasonable opportunity to participate therein. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, neither the Parent nor any of its Affiliates shall be under any obligation to (i) make proposals, execute or carry out agreements or submit to orders providing for the sale or other disposition or holding separate (through the establishment of a trust or otherwise) of any assets of the Parent or any of its Affiliates or the Company or any of its Affiliates or the holding separate of the shares of Company Common Stock (or shares of stock of the Surviving Corporation) or imposing or seeking to impose any limitation on the ability of the Parent or any of its Affiliates to conduct their business or own such assets or to acquire, hold or exercise full rights of ownership of the shares of Company Common Stock (or shares of stock of the Surviving Corporation) or (ii) take any action under this Section 7.3 if the United States Department of Justice or the United States 

    ##### 

  

    

Federal Trade Commission authorizes its staff to seek a preliminary injunction
or restraining order, or otherwise initiate administrative litigation, to
enjoin consummation of the Merger, if in either case, Parent believes in good
faith that such action would have more than a _de minimus_  adverse effect on
the business or operations of the Parent and its subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, or the business or operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole. 

   

 (c) The Company shall confer with the Parent on a regular and frequent basis as reasonably requested by the Parent concerning operational matters and promptly advise the Parent orally and in writing of any Change having, or which, insofar as reasonably can be foreseen, would reasonably be expected to result in, a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company shall promptly deliver to the Parent (or its counsel) complete and accurate copies of all filings made by the Company with any Governmental Entity in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. 

   

 (d) Neither the Company nor any of its Affiliates shall make any settlement offers or, except as directed by the Parent, negotiate any consent decree or consent order with any Governmental Entity relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Parent alone shall be responsible for making any settlement offers and negotiating any consent decree or consent order with any Governmental Entity relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Parent shall promptly communicate to the Company if any Governmental Entity suggests or proffers any settlement, consent decree or consent order, including the material terms thereof (and any written documentation provided by such Governmental Entity reflecting the same). The Parent may accept or reject any settlement, consent decree or consent order proposed by any Governmental Entity in its sole discretion if Parent believes in good faith that such settlement, consent decree or consent order would have more than a _de minimus_ adverse effect on the business or operations of the Parent and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or the business or operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. 

   

 (e) Without limiting the generality of Section 7.3(a), if any "fair price" or "control share acquisition" or "anti-takeover" statute, or other similar statute or regulation or any state "blue sky" statute shall become applicable to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or by the Stockholder Agreements (or any schedule or exhibit hereto or thereto), the Company and the Company Board shall grant such approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and thereby, and otherwise act to minimize the effects of such statute or regulation on the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. 

   

 7.4 _Notification of Certain Matters_. 

  

 (a) The Company shall give prompt notice to the Parent if, at any time prior to the Acceptance Time: 

    ##### 

  

      

 (i) any Change occurs or exists that would result in any representation or warranty of the Company contained in this Agreement that is qualified as to materiality not being true and accurate in any respect as if such representation or warranty were made at such time, or any such representation or warranty that is not so qualified not being true and accurate in any material respect as if such representation or warranty were made at such time, or 

   

 (ii) the Company fails to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement; 

   

 _provided_ , _however_ , that no such notification shall be deemed to cure
any breach or otherwise affect the representations, warranties, covenants
or agreements of the Company or the conditions to the obligations of the
parties hereunder. Without limiting the foregoing, the Company shall, within
24 hours after it has notice of any of the following, notify the Parent of: 

   

(A) any notice or other communication from any person alleging that the
consent of such person is or may be required in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; 

   

(B) any notice or other communication from any Governmental Entity in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and 

   

(C) any actions, suits, claims, investigations or proceedings commenced or,
to the best of its knowledge, threatened against, relating to or involving or
otherwise affecting the Company or any of its Subsidiaries which, if pending
on the date of this Agreement, would have been required to have been
disclosed pursuant to this Agreement or which relate to the consummation of
the transaction contemplated hereby. 

  

 (b) The Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company if, at any time prior to the Acceptance Time: 

    

 (i) any Change occurs or exists that would result in any representation or warranty of the Parent or the Purchaser contained in this Agreement that is qualified as to materiality not being true and accurate in any respect as if such representation or warranty were made at such time, or any such representation or warranty that is not so qualified not being true and accurate in any material respect as if such representation or warranty were made at such time, or 

   ##### 

  

   

 (ii) the Parent or the Purchaser fails to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by them under this Agreement; 

   

 _provided_ , _however_ , that no such notification shall be deemed to cure
any breach or otherwise affect the representations, warranties, covenants
or agreements of the Parent or the Purchaser or the conditions to the
obligations of the parties hereunder. 

  

 7.5 _Company Stockholder Approval of the Merger_. 

  

 (a) If the adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders of the Company is required under the DGCL in order to consummate the Merger, the Company shall, acting through the Company Board, at the Parents request, as soon as practicable following the acceptance for payment of, and payment for, shares of Company Common Stock by the Purchaser in the Offer (coordinating the timing thereof with the Parent), duly call, give notice of, convene and hold the Company Meeting for the purpose of obtaining such stockholder approval. Subject to Section 7.1, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the Company shall, through the Company Board, recommend to its stockholders that they adopt this Agreement and approve the Merger. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company agrees that its obligations pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 7.5(a) shall not be affected by (i) the commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or communication to the Company of any Acquisition Proposal or (ii) the withdrawal or modification by the Company Board of its approval or recommendation of this Agreement, the Offer or the Merger. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Purchaser or any other subsidiary of the Parent shall acquire at least 90% of the outstanding shares of the Company Common Stock, the parties shall take all necessary and appropriate action to cause the Merger to become effective as soon as practicable after the expiration of the Offer without a stockholders meeting in accordance with Section 253 of the DGCL. 

   

 (b) If the adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders of the Company is required under the DGCL in order to consummate the Merger, the Company shall, at the Parents request, as soon as practicable following the acceptance for payment of, and payment for, shares of Company Common Stock by the Purchaser in the Offer, prepare and file with the SEC the Proxy Statement in accordance with the Exchange Act and any other applicable laws, and will use its all reasonable efforts to respond to any comments of the SEC or its staff and to cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Companys stockholders as promptly as practicable after responding to all such comments to the satisfaction of the staff. The Company shall notify the Parent promptly upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC or its staff or any other government officials and of any request by the SEC or its staff or any other government officials for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement or for additional information, and shall supply the Parent with copies of all correspondence between the Company or any of its representatives, on the on hand, and the SEC, or its staff, or any other government officials on the other hand with respect to the Proxy Statement. The Company shall consult with the Parent 

    ##### 

  

    

and its counsel prior to responding to any comments from the SEC or its staff
or any other government officials. If at any time prior to the Company
Stockholders Meeting there shall occur any event that should be set forth in
an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, the Company shall promptly
prepare and mail to its stockholders and file with the SEC any such amendment
or supplement. The Company shall not mail any Proxy Statement, or any
amendment or supplement thereto, to the Companys stockholders unless it has
first obtained the consent of the Parent to such mailing, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. 

   

 (c) The Parent shall cause all shares of Company Common Stock purchased by the Purchaser pursuant to the Offer and all other shares of Company Common Stock owned by the Parent or the Purchaser or any other subsidiary of the Parent to be voted in favor of the adoption of this Agreement. 

   

 7.6 _Public Disclosure_. Except as may be required by law or stock market regulations, (a) the press release announcing the execution of this Agreement shall be issued only in such form as shall be mutually agreed upon by the Company and the Parent and (b) the Parent and the Company shall each use reasonable best efforts to consult with the other party before issuing, and provide each other with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon, any other press release or otherwise making any public statement with respect to this Agreement, including the Offer and the Merger, _provided_ , _however_ , that these restrictions shall not apply to any Company communications regarding either (i) an Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel and the Financial Advisor or another independent nationally recognized financial advisor) constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal, or (ii) a Company Adverse Recommendation Change, in each case made in accordance with the provisions of Section 7.1 of this Agreement. 

  

 7.7 _Indemnification_. 

  

 (a) From and after the Effective Time, the Parent and the Purchaser shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, cause the Surviving Corporation, for a period of six years from the Effective Time, to honor all of the Companys obligations to indemnify and hold harmless each present and former director and officer of the Company (the "Indemnified Parties"), against any costs or expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities or amounts paid in settlement incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the extent that such obligations to indemnify and hold harmless exist on the date of this Agreement. 

   

 (b) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, the Parent and the Purchaser shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain (to the extent available in the market) in effect a directors and officers liability insurance policy covering those persons who are currently covered by the Companys directors and officers liability insurance policy (a 

    ##### 

  

    

complete and accurate copy of which has been made available to the Parent
prior to the date of this Agreement) with coverage in amount and scope at
least as favorable to such persons as the Companys existing coverage;
_provided_ that in no event shall the Parent or the Surviving Corporation be
required to expend in excess of 200% of the annual premium currently paid by
the Company for such coverage. At the Parents option, the Parent may
purchase prior to the Effective Time a six-year prepaid "tail policy"
covering those persons who are currently covered by the Companys directors
and officers liability insurance policy, in which case the Parent and
the Purchaser shall be relieved of their obligations pursuant to the
immediately preceding sentence. The Company represents and warrants that the
annual premium currently paid by the Company for directors and officers
liability insurance coverage is as set forth on Section 7.7(b) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule. 

   

 (c) The provisions of this Section 7.7 are intended to be in addition to the rights otherwise available to the current officers and directors of the Company by law, certificate of incorporation, by-law or agreement, and shall operate for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties, their heirs and their representatives. 

   

 7.8 _401(k) Plan_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board or, if appropriate, any committee administering the Targanta Therapeutics Corporation 401(k) Plan, shall adopt such resolutions or take such other actions as are required to terminate such plan prior to the Effective Time. 

  

 7.9 _Stockholder Litigation_. Until the earlier of the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms or the Effective Time, the Company shall give the Parent the opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any stockholder litigation against the Company or the Company Board relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and shall not settle any such litigation without the Parents prior written consent. 

  

 7.10 _Transfer Restrictions_. The Company agrees, with respect to each stockholder that is a party to any Stockholder Agreement, that if any such stockholder attempts to Transfer (as defined in the Stockholder Agreements), vote or provide any other person with the authority to vote any of the shares of Company Common Stock owned by such stockholder other than in compliance with the Stockholder Agreements, the Company shall not (a) permit any such Transfer on the Companys books and records, (b) issue a new certificate representing any of the shares of Company Common Stock or permit any book entries for any such Transfer with respect to any shares of Company Common Stock that are in uncertificated form or (c) record such vote, in each case, unless and until Stockholder shall have complied with the terms of the Stockholder Agreements.

to the notice described in clause (D) continues to be a Superior Proposal;
_provided_ that any amendment, supplement or modification to the financial
terms or other material terms of any Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed a

Acquisition Proposal; (F) the Company concurrently pays to the Parent the fee

 10.4 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Other than the provisions of Section 7.7, this Agreement is not intended, and shall not be deemed, to confer any rights or remedies upon any other person other than the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns, to create any agreement of employment with any person or to otherwise create any third-party beneficiary hereto. 

  

 10.5 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement may be assigned or delegated, in whole or in part, by operation of law or 

   ##### 

  

    

otherwise by any of the parties hereto without the prior written consent of

If the final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision hereof is invalid or unenforceable, the parties hereto agree that the court making such determination shall have the power to limit the term or provision, to delete specific words or phrases, or to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified. In the event such court does not exercise the power granted to it in the prior sentence, the parties hereto agree to replace such invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a valid and enforceable term or provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of such invalid or unenforceable term. 

  

 10.7 _Counterparts and Signature_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but all of which together shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become effective when counterparts have been signed by each of the parties hereto and delivered to the other parties, it being understood that all parties need not sign the same counterpart. This Agreement may be executed and delivered by facsimile or "PDF" transmission.

Any reference to any federal, state, provincial, local or foreign statute or law shall be deemed also to refer to all rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, unless the context requires otherwise. Whenever the words "include", "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, including _Annex I_ , they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation."

meaning, means the actual knowledge (after reasonable investigation) of
the individuals identified in Section 10.8 of the Company Disclosure

 10.9 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of Delaware without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of laws of any jurisdictions other than those of the State of Delaware. 

  

 10.10 _Remedies_. Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy.

   ##### 

  

    

Agreement or any of the transaction contemplated by this Agreement in any
other court. Each of the parties hereto waives any defense or inconvenient
forum to the maintenance of any action or proceeding so brought and waives
any bond, surety or other security that might be required of any other party
with respect thereto. To the extent permitted by applicable law, any party
hereto may make service on another party by sending or delivering a copy of
the process to the party to be served at the address and in the manner

 Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Offer or the Agreement, the Purchaser shall not be required to accept for payment or, subject to any applicable rules and regulations of the Commission, including Rule 14e-1(c) under the Exchange Act, to pay for any shares of Company Common Stock tendered pursuant to the Offer, and (so long as permitted by the terms of the Agreement) may terminate or amend the Offer, and may postpone the acceptance of, or payment for, any shares of Company Common Stock, if:

 (2) immediately prior to the expiration of the Offer (as extended in accordance with the Agreement), any requisite waiting period (and any extension thereof) under the HSR Act shall not have expired or been terminated; 

  

 (3) at any time on or after the date of the Agreement and before the Specified Time, any of the following shall occur and shall continue to exist: 

  

 (a) there shall be instituted, pending or threatened in writing any suit, action or proceeding by any Governmental Entity: 

   

 (i) challenging, making illegal or otherwise restraining or prohibiting, or seeking to challenge, make illegal or otherwise restrain or prohibit, the transactions contemplated by the Agreement, including the Offer and the Merger, or seeking to obtain from the Company or (to the extent it relates to the transactions contemplated by the Agreement or the Stockholder Agreements, including the Offer and the Merger) the Parent or any of its Affiliates, any material damages; 

   

 (ii) seeking to prohibit or materially limit the ownership or operation by the Company, the Parent or the Purchaser of all or any material portion of 

   ##### 

  

    

the business or assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries or (to the
extent it relates to the transactions contemplated by the Agreement,
including the Offer and the Merger) of the Parent and its Affiliates; 

   

 (iii) seeking to compel the Company, the Parent or the Purchaser to dispose of or to hold separate all or any material portion of the business or assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (to the extent it relates to the transactions contemplated by the Agreement, including the Offer and the Merger) of the Parent or any of its Affiliates; 

   

 (iv) seeking to impose any material limitation on the ability of the Company, the Parent or Purchaser to conduct the business or own the assets or the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (to the extent it relates to the transactions contemplated by the Agreement, including the Offer and the Merger) of the Parent or any of its Affiliates; 

   

 (v) seeking to impose material limitations on the ability of the Parent or Purchaser to acquire or hold, or to exercise full rights of ownership of any shares of Company Common Stock, including the right to vote such Shares on all matters properly presented to the Companys stockholders; or 

   

 (vi) seeking to require divestiture by the Parent or Purchaser of all or any of the shares of Company Common Stock; 

  

 (b) there shall be instituted, pending or threatened in writing any suit, action or proceeding by any third party that would reasonably be expected to succeed and with respect to which a judgment adverse to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries would reasonably be expected to result in a Company Material Adverse Effect; 

  

 (c) the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in Sections 4.1(a), 4.4(a) and clause (i) of Section 4.7 of the Agreement shall not be true and correct as of the date of the Agreement and as of the date of determination as though made on the date of determination, except to the extent such representations and warranties are specifically made as of a particular date, in which case such representations and warranties shall not be true and correct as of such date; 

  

 (d) the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in Section 4.2 of the Agreement shall not be true and correct as of the date of the Agreement and as of the date of determination as though made on the date of determination, except for any de minimis inaccuracy therein, and except to the extent such representations and warranties are specifically made as of a particular date, in which case such representations and warranties shall not be true and correct as of such date; 

   ##### 

  

  

 (e) any other representations and warranties of the Company set forth in the Agreement shall not be true and correct as of the date of the Agreement, and as of the date of determination as though made on the date of determination, except (A) to the extent such representations and warranties are specifically made as of a particular date, in which case such representations and warranties shall not be true and correct as of such date, and (B) where the failure to be true and correct (without regard to any materiality or Company Material Adverse Effect qualifications contained therein), has not had, and would not reasonably be expected to result in, a Company Material Adverse Effect; 

  

 (f) the Company shall have failed to perform in any material respect any obligation or to comply in any material respect with any agreement or covenant of the Company to be performed or complied with by it under the Agreement; 

  

 (g) since the date of the Agreement, there shall have occurred any Change that has had or would reasonably be expected to result in a Company Material Adverse Effect; 

  

 (h) there shall have occurred any Company Adverse Recommendation Change; or 

  

 (i) the Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its terms; 

 

which in the reasonable judgment of the Parent and the Purchaser, in any such
case and regardless of the circumstances giving rise to any such condition,
makes it inadvisable to proceed with the Offer or with acceptance for payment
or payment for Shares. 

   

 The foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of the Parent and the Purchaser and may be asserted by the Parent and the Purchaser regardless of the circumstances giving rise to any such condition and may be waived by the Parent or the Purchaser (except for the Minimum Condition), in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time, in their respective sole discretion. The failure by the Parent or the Purchaser at any time to exercise any of the foregoing rights will not be deemed a waiver of any such right, the waiver of any such right with respect to any particular facts and circumstances shall not be deemed a waiver with respect to any other facts and circumstances and each such right will be deemed an ongoing right that may be asserted at any time and from time to time. Any determination by the Parent or the Purchaser concerning the events described in this _Annex I_ shall be final and binding upon all parties.

 CONTINGENT PAYMENT RIGHTS 

   

Section 2.1. CPRs. 

   

 The CPRs represent the right of Holders to receive contingent cash payments pursuant to Sections 1.1(a) and 3.1(a)(iii) of the Merger Agreement and this Agreement. Each Holder shall be entitled to one CPR for each share of Company Common Stock (a) the Purchaser accepts for payment from such Holder pursuant to the Offer or (b) owned by such Holder immediately prior to the Effective Time. 

  

Section 2.2. Nontransferable. 

   

 The CPRs shall not be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged, encumbered or in any other manner transferred or disposed of, in whole or in part, other than through a Permitted Transfer. 

  

Section 2.3. No Certificate; Registration; Registration of Transfer; Change of
Address. 

   

 (a) The CPRs shall not be evidenced by a certificate or other instrument. 

  

 (b) The Rights Agent shall keep a register (the "CPR Register") for the purpose of registering CPRs and transfers of CPRs as herein provided. The CPR Register will show one position for Cede and Co representing all the shares of Company Common Stock held by DTC on behalf of the street holders of the shares of Company Common Stock tendered by such holders in the Offer or held by such holders as of immediately prior to the Effective Time. The Rights Agent will have no responsibility whatsoever directly to the street holders with respect to transfers of CPRs unless and until such CPRs are transferred into the name of such street holders in accordance with Section 2.2 of this Agreement. With respect to any payments to be made under Section 2.4 below, the Rights Agent will accomplish the payment to any street holders of shares of Company Common Stock by sending one lump payment to DTC. The Rights Agent 

   ##### 

  

    

will have no responsibilities whatsoever with regards to distribution of
payments by DTC to such street holders. 

  

 (c) Subject to the restrictions on transferability set forth in Section 2.2, every request made to transfer a CPR must be in writing and accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form reasonably satisfactory to the Rights Agent, pursuant to Securities Transfer Association, Inc. guidelines, duly executed by the Holder thereof, his attorney duly authorized in writing, personal representative or survivor and setting forth in reasonable detail the circumstances relating to the transfer. Upon receipt of such written notice, the Rights Agent shall, subject to its reasonable determination that the transfer instrument is in proper form and the transfer otherwise complies with the other terms and conditions herein (including the provisions of Section 2.2), register the transfer of the CPRs in the CPR Register. All duly transferred CPRs registered in the CPR Register shall be the valid obligations of Parent, evidencing the same right, and shall entitle the transferee to the same benefits and rights under this Agreement, as those held by the transferor. No transfer of a CPR shall be valid until registered in the CPR Register, and any transfer not duly registered in the CPR Register will be void ab initio. Any transfer or assignment of the CPRs shall be without charge (other than the cost of any transfer tax) to the Holder. 

  

 (d) A Holder may make a written request to the Rights Agent to change such Holders address of record in the CPR Register. The written request must be duly executed by the Holder. Upon receipt of such written notice, the Rights Agent shall promptly record the change of address in the CPR Register.

   ##### 

  

  

 (d) If the Net Sales CPR Payment Event shall occur, then within 30 days following the occurrence of the Net Sales CPR Payment Event Parent shall deliver to the Rights Agent (i) a certificate (the "Net Sales CPR Payment Compliance Certificate") certifying the date of the satisfaction of the Net Sales CPR Payment Event and that the Holders are entitled to receive the Net Sales CPR Payment Amount and (ii) the aggregate amount of the Net Sales CPR Payment payable to the Holders.

 (e) If the EMEA CPR Payment Event has not occurred on or before December 31, 2013, then on or before January 31, 2014 Parent shall deliver to the Rights Agent a certificate (the "EMEA CPR Payment Non-Compliance Certificate") certifying that the EMEA CPR Payment Event has not occurred, and as a result the Holders are not entitled to receive the EMEA CPR Payment Amount. 

  

 (f) If the FDA CPR Payment Event has not occurred on or before the Outside Payment Date, then on or before the date that is 30 days after the Outside Payment Date Parent shall deliver to the Rights Agent a certificate (the "FDA CPR Payment Non-Compliance Certificate") certifying that the FDA CPR Payment Event has not occurred, and as a result the Holders are not entitled to receive the FDA CPR Payment Amount. 

  

 (g) If the Single Dose CPR Payment Event has not occurred on or before the Outside Payment Date, then on or before the date that is 30 days after the Outside Payment Date Parent shall deliver to the Rights Agent a certificate (the "Single Dose CPR Payment Non-Compliance Certificate") certifying that the Single Dose CPR Payment Event has not occurred, and as a result the Holders are not entitled to receive the Single Dose CPR Payment Amount.

 (i) The Rights Agent shall, within ten Business Days of receipt, send each Holder at its registered address a copy of each certificate delivered by Parent pursuant to this Section 2.4. If in any such certificate Parent certifies that a CPR Payment Amount is payable to the Holders, then at the time the Rights Agent sends a copy of such certificate to the Holders, the Right Agent shall also pay the applicable CPR Payment Amount to each of the Holders (the amount to which each Holder is entitled to receive will be based on the applicable CPR Payment Amount multiplied by the number of CPRs held by such Holder as reflected on the CPR Register) by check mailed to the address of each Holder as reflected in the CPR Register as of the close of business on the last Business Day prior to such CPR Payment Date. 

  

 (j) Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause to be deducted or withheld, from each CPR Payment Amount otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement, such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to or deposited with the relevant Governmental Entity, such withheld 

   ##### 

  

    

amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the Holder in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made. Prior to making any such tax withholdings or causing any such tax
withholdings to be made with respect to any Holder, the Rights Agent shall,
to the extent practicable, provide notice to the Holder of such potential
withholding and a reasonable opportunity for the Holder to provide any
necessary tax forms (including an IRS Form W-9 or an applicable IRS Form W-8)
in order to avoid or reduce such withholding amounts. 

  

 (k) Parent agrees to treat, and to cause the Rights Agent to treat, all payments on the CPRs as representing consideration for the sale of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement for all tax and tax reporting purposes, except to the extent that a portion of such payments is required to be treated as imputed interest. Parent and the Rights Agent will determine and report imputed interest amounts pursuant to Section 483 or 1274 of the Code. The CPRs shall not be treated as an interest in a joint venture or partnership for tax purposes. 

  

 (l) Any portion of any CPR Payment Amount that remains undistributed to the Holders for six months after any CPR Payment Date shall be delivered by the Rights Agent to Parent, upon demand, and any Holder shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of such CPR Payment Amount, but shall have no greater rights against Parent than may be accorded to general unsecured creditors of Parent under applicable law. 

  

 (m) Neither Parent nor the Rights Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of any CPR Payment Amount delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. If any CPR Payment Amount has not been paid prior to two years after the applicable CPR Payment Date (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which the CPR Payment Amount would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity), any such CPR Payment Amount shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, become the property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto. 

  

Section 2.5. No Voting, Dividends Or Interest; No Equity Or Ownership Interest
In Parent.

Section 2.6. Ability To Abandon The CPR.
