</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of the Parent, the Purchaser and the Company have
determined that it would be advisable and in the best interests of their respective stockholders

this Agreement;
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, in furtherance of such acquisition, the Purchaser will make a tender offer (as it may
be amended from time to time as permitted under this Agreement, the &#147;Offer&#148;) to purchase, upon the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, all of the Company&#146;s issued and
outstanding shares of common stock, $0.0001 par value per share (the &#147;Company Common Stock&#148;), for
consideration of (a) $2.00 per share of Company Common Stock to be paid promptly after the
Acceptance Time (as defined in Section&nbsp;1.3(a)), net to the seller in cash, without interest thereon
(the &#147;Closing Payment&#148;), plus (b)&nbsp;one contingent payment right per share of Company Common Stock (a
&#147;CPR&#148;), which shall represent the right to receive the EMEA CPR Payment Amount, the FDA CPR Payment

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, to effectuate such acquisition, following consummation of the Offer, the Purchaser
will be merged with and into the Company, with the Company continuing as the surviving corporation
in such merger (the &#147;Merger&#148;);
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and as a condition and
inducement to the Parent&#146;s willingness to enter into this Agreement, each of the stockholders of
the Company listed on <U>Schedule&nbsp;A</U> has entered into a tender and support agreement, dated as
of the date of this Agreement, in the form attached hereto as <U>Exhibit&nbsp;B</U> (collectively, the
&#147;Stockholder Agreements&#148;); and
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company has (i)&nbsp;determined that the Offer and the
Merger are fair to, and in the best interest of, the Company and its stockholders; (ii)&nbsp;approved
this Agreement and the Stockholder Agreements and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby,
including the Offer and the Merger, in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of
