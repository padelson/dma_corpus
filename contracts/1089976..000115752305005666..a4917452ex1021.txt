                            STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT

         STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT dated as of June 23, 2005 (this "Agreement"),

and collectively as the "Sellers"), and PFP Holding II Corporation, a Delaware

                              W I T N E S S E T H:

         WHEREAS, Sellers own directly or indirectly all of the issued and
outstanding shares of capital stock or other equity interests (collectively, the
"Shares") of the companies set forth on Annex A hereto (each a "Company" and
collectively the "Companies"); and

         WHEREAS, Sellers conduct their global protective packaging ("GPP")
business and their European flexible packaging ("EFP") business (each a
"Business" and collectively the "Businesses") through the Companies;

         WHEREAS, Sellers desire to sell to Purchaser, and Purchaser desires to
purchase from Sellers, the Shares for the consideration and upon the terms and
conditions hereinafter set forth; and

         WHEREAS, certain terms used in this Agreement are defined in
Section 11.1;


         NOW, THEREFORE, Sellers and Purchaser agree as follows:

                                   ARTICLE I

                           SALE AND PURCHASE OF SHARES

        1.1 Sale and Purchase of Shares. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions contained herein and in the Local Agreements, on the Closing Date
each Seller shall (in respect of the Shares which are set forth next to such
Seller's name on Annex A hereto) sell, assign, transfer, convey and deliver to
Purchaser, and Purchaser shall purchase and accept from each Seller the transfer
of, the Shares indicated as owned by such Seller on Annex A hereto. The purchase
and sale of the Shares pursuant to this Agreement shall be effective as of the
Effective Time.

        1.2 Purchaser Designees. At any time prior to the Closing Date,
Purchaser may designate one or more of its Affiliates to participate in the
purchase of all or any portion of the Shares provided that (a) any such
designation would not delay the Closing or require the procurement of any
additional consents or approvals, (b) no such designation shall relieve
Purchaser of any of its obligations under this Agreement, and (c) all such
designees agree in writing to be bound by this Agreement as if they were parties
hereto, and shall be jointly and severally liable with Purchaser for all of
Purchaser's obligations hereunder.

                                   ARTICLE II

                           PURCHASE PRICE AND PAYMENT

        2.1 Initial Purchase Price.

        (a) The purchase price for the Shares payable at Closing shall be $529.5
million (the "Initial Purchase Price"). The Initial Purchase Price paid at
Closing may be adjusted as set forth in Section 2.1(b) and Section 2.6(c).

        (b) Within 75 days following the date hereof, Seller shall deliver to
Purchaser (i) a copy of the audited financial statements of each of the
Businesses, consisting of a balance sheet, income statement and statement of
cash flows and the related footnotes as of and for the periods ending December
31, 2002, 2003, and 2004, together with the related auditors' reports (the
"Audited Financial Statements"), and (ii) a copy of the unaudited combined
financial statement of the Business, consisting of a balance sheet, income
statement and statement of cash flows and the related footnotes as of and for
the periods ending March 31, 2005, with a SAS 100 Review prepared by the
Companies' auditors (the "SAS 100 Reviewed Financial Statements").

                (i) Schedule 4.8 sets forth a computation of EBITDA for the
        12-month period ending December 31, 2004, as determined from the
        Unaudited Financial Statements (the "Benchmark EBITDA"). If the EBITDA
        for the 12-month period ending December 31, 2004, as determined from the
        Audited Financial Statements (the "Audited EBITDA"), computed consistent
        with Schedule 4.8, is less than $76,888,896, the following provisions
        shall apply:

                        (A) If Audited EBITDA is greater than $74,388,896, the
                Initial Purchase Price shall be reduced by an amount equal to
                ($76,888,896 less Audited EBITDA) times 7.

                        (B) If Audited EBITDA is below $74,388,896, the parties
                shall negotiate in good faith to attempt to agree upon a revised
                Initial Purchase Price, and if the parties cannot agree, either
                party may terminate this Agreement.

                (ii) For purposes of the above formula, difference between the
        Benchmark EBITDA and the Audited EBITDA resulting from the following
        matters will not be considered: (i) timing/cut-off issues that move
        income/expenses between calendar periods to the extent that the latest
        twelve-month EBITDA (for the period ending March 31, 2005) is not
        impacted, and (ii) expenses for items which relate to liabilities

        2.2 Final Purchase Price and Working Capital Adjustment. Subsequent to
the Closing, the Initial Purchase Price shall be adjusted (the "Working Capital
Adjustment") as follows:

        (a) the Initial Purchase Price shall be increased to the extent Final
Working Capital for the GPP Business is greater than GPP Baseline Working
Capital, or decreased if Final Working Capital for the GPP Business is less than
GPP Baseline Working Capital, in each case by the amount of such increase or
decrease, and

        (b) the Initial Purchase Price shall be increased to the extent Final
Working Capital for the EFP Business is greater than EFP Baseline Working
Capital, or decreased if Final Working Capital for the EFP Business is less than
EFP Baseline Working Capital, in each case by the amount of such increase or
decrease

The Working Capital Adjustment shall be determined in accordance with Section
2.3 and paid in accordance with Section 2.4(b). The Initial Purchase Price, as
adjusted by the Working Capital Adjustment and the provisions of Section 2.6, is
the "Final Purchase Price."

        2.3 Preparation of the Working Capital Statements.

        (a) Sellers shall prepare and deliver to Purchaser, within 60 days after
the Closing Date, two unaudited statements (the "Closing Working Capital
Statements"), one setting forth Sellers' calculation of the net Working Capital
of the GPP Business and one setting forth Sellers' calculation of the net
Working Capital of the EFP Business, each as of the Effective Time. Each Closing
Working Capital Statement shall be prepared in accordance with US GAAP applied
on a basis consistent with the methodology used in preparing the Latest Balance
Sheets and each shall present fairly in all material respects the Current Assets
and Current Liabilities of the GPP Business or the EFP Business, as the case may
be, as of the Effective Time, shall include line items for Current Assets and
Current Liabilities substantially consistent with those in the Latest Balance
Sheets, and shall be prepared in accordance with accounting policies and
practices (including methods for determining reserves) consistent with those
used in the preparation of the Latest Balance Sheets. The Closing Working
Capital Statements for the GPP Business shall be computed in U.S. Dollars, and
the Closing Working Capital Statements for the EFP Business shall be computed in
Euros. For purposes hereof, "Working Capital" shall mean the Current Assets of
the Businesses less the Current Liabilities of the Businesses excluding all (i)
cash and cash equivalents, (ii) Indebtedness, (iii) income Tax assets and income
Tax liabilities, (iv) receivables and payables between Sellers or their
Affiliates, on one hand, and any Company, on the other hand, and (v) LIFO
reserves. The Baseline Working Capital for each of the GPP Business and the EFP
Business is set forth on Schedule 2.3.

                                       3
<PAGE>

        (b) The Closing Working Capital Statements shall be final and binding on
the parties unless Purchaser shall, within 60 days following the delivery of a
Closing Working Capital Statement, deliver to Sellers written notice of
objection (the "Objection Notice"), specifying in reasonable detail each
disputed item on such Closing Working Capital Statement (each, a "Disputed
Item") and describing in reasonable detail the basis for each Disputed Item,
including the data that forms the basis thereof and the amount in dispute.
Notwithstanding the delivery of an Objection Notice, a Closing Working Capital
Statement shall be final and binding to the extent any item is not a Disputed
Item. If the Objection Notice is delivered, the parties shall consult with each
other with respect to the Disputed Items and use commercially reasonable efforts
to resolve the dispute. If the parties are unable to reach agreement on all
Disputed Items within 30 days (subject to extension by mutual agreement) after
delivery of the Objection Notice, either Purchaser or Sellers may refer any
unresolved Disputed Items to PricewaterhouseCoopers (the "Unrelated Accounting
Firm"). The Unrelated Accounting Firm shall be directed to render a written
report as promptly as practicable and, in any event within 30 days of the
Unrelated Accounting Firm's engagement, on only the Disputed Items and to
resolve those unresolved Disputed Items set forth in the Objection Notice. The
Unrelated Accounting Firm, acting as an expert and not an arbitrator, shall
resolve such Disputed Items in accordance with this Agreement. The resolution of
all Disputed Items by the Unrelated Accounting Firm shall be final and binding
on the parties. The fees and expenses of the Unrelated Accounting Firm shall be
borne proportionately by Purchaser and Sellers based on the extent to which
Purchaser's and Sellers' respective determinations differ from such Unrelated
Accounting Firm's determination. "Final Working Capital" shall mean (i) if
Purchaser does not timely deliver an Objection Notice, the amount of Working
Capital set forth on the Closing Working Capital Statements, or (ii) if
Purchaser timely delivers an Objection Notice, the amount (A) as agreed to by
Sellers and Purchaser, or (B) as determined by the Unrelated Accounting Firm.

        (c) Each of Sellers and Purchaser shall give the other(s) and its or
their respective advisors and accountants and other appropriate personnel such
assistance and access to the assets and books and records, including workpapers
and other data, and relevant personnel of the Companies as it or they may
reasonably request during normal business hours in order to enable it or them to
prepare or review the Closing Working Capital Statements or any objections or
proposed changes thereto, as applicable.

        (d) The Working Capital Adjustment is meant only to adjust the Initial
Purchase Price based on changes in Working Capital from December 31, 2004, to
the Effective Time, and it is not a basis for, nor a procedure to seek
compensation for, claims for breach of representations and warranties or other
indemnification claims, which shall be settled exclusively pursuant to the terms
of Article IX.

        2.4 Payment of Initial Purchase Price and Working Capital Adjustment.

        (a) At the Closing, Purchaser shall pay to Pactiv in U.S. dollars (as
agent for Sellers) the Initial Purchase Price by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account or accounts designated by Pactiv in writing at
least one Business Day prior to the Closing Date.

<PAGE>

        (b) Within three Business Days after the determination of the Final
Working Capital in accordance with Section 2.3, the Working Capital Adjustment
shall be paid (i) by Purchaser to Pactiv (as agent for Sellers) if the Working
Capital Adjustment is positive; or (ii) by Pactiv (as agent for Sellers) to
Purchaser if the Working Capital Adjustment is negative. The Working Capital
Adjustment for the GPP Business shall be paid in U.S. Dollars, and t he Working
Capital Adjustment for the EFP Business shall be paid in Euros, in each case by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated in writing
by Pactiv or Purchaser, as the case may be, and shall be accompanied by a
payment of interest on the Working Capital Adjustment from and including the
Closing Date to, but excluding, the date of payment at the Reference Rate. Such
interest shall be payable at the same time as the payment to which it relates
and shall be calculated daily on the basis of a 365-day year and the actual
number of days elapsed, without compounding.

        2.5 Allocation of Final Purchase Price.

        (a) Sellers and Purchaser shall allocate the Initial Purchase Price
among the Companies as set forth on Schedule 2.5. Within 30 days following (i)
the determination of the Working Capital Adjustment, or (ii) the making of an
indemnification payment pursuant to Article IX or (iii) the making any payment
pursuant to Section 2.6, Sellers and Purchaser shall revise the purchase price
allocation to reflect such payments in accordance with the nature of each such
adjustment.

        (b) Neither Sellers, Purchaser nor any of their respective Affiliates
shall file any Tax Return or other document or otherwise take, or agree to take,
any position on any Tax Return which is inconsistent with the allocation
determined pursuant to this Section 2.5, unless otherwise required by Law.

        2.6 Treatment of Cash and Indebtedness.

        (a) As of the Effective Time, the Companies shall have no cash or cash
equivalents and no Indebtedness except for cash not to exceed the amounts set
forth below, or Indebtedness in or under the bank accounts or overdraft
facilities listed on Schedule 2.6 (the "Transferred Accounts"). Within 30 days
after Closing, Pactiv and Purchaser, based on the statements from the respective
financial institutions, shall determine the net balance in the Transferred
Accounts as of the Effective Time, and if such balance is positive, Purchaser
shall pay Pactiv such amount, and if such balance is negative, Pactiv shall pay
Purchaser such amount, in each case in accordance with the procedures set forth
in Section 2.4 and with interest from the Closing Date to the date of payment,
computed as provided in Section 2.4(b). For purposes of this Section 2.6(a), the
amount of cash in the Transferred Accounts shall not exceed $5 million in
aggregate, and of this amount (x) not more than $1 million shall be located in
any country other than the United States or the United Kingdom, and (y) not more
than $500,000 in Egypt. Pactiv shall withdraw all cash (either through dividends
or repayments of loans from each of the Companies) within 10 Business Days prior
to Closing; it being further agreed that the cash then remaining in the
Transferred Accounts at the Closing Date will reflect only cash received by the
Companies is in the normal course of operations.

        (b) If prior to the determination of the Final Working Capital it is
determined that the Companies had Indebtedness as of the Effective Time in
excess of the overdraft facilities listed on Schedule 2.6 or cash on hand as of
the Effective Time in excess of the amounts in the Transferred Accounts, Pactiv
shall promptly pay Purchaser an amount equal to such Indebtedness or Purchaser
shall pay or cause the Companies to pay to Pactiv an amount equal to such cash
on hand, provided that the Companies are not prevented by Law from transferring
such cash from its location to a location requested by Pactiv, and provided
further that Pactiv shall reimburse the Companies for any Taxes or other costs
resulting from such cash transfer, in each case in accordance with the
procedures set forth in Section 2.4 and with interest from the Closing Date to
the date of payment, computed as provided in Section 2.4(b). The payments
contemplated by this Section 2.6(b) shall not include any amounts considered in
the computation and payments pursuant to Section 2.6(a).

        (c) Notwithstanding Section 2.6(a), provided that Pactiv notifies
Purchaser at least three Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Sengewald
Klinikprodukte GmbH & Co. KG ("Klinik") may have at Closing up to $25 million of
Indebtedness, provided that the terms of such Indebtedness shall provide that
such Indebtedness may be prepaid by Klinik after Closing without penalty or
premium. The Initial Purchase Price shall be reduced at Closing by the amount of
such Klinik Indebtedness.

                                   ARTICLE V

                   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PURCHASER

         Purchaser (and, if Purchaser has designated any Affiliate to
participate in the purchase of all or any portion of the Shares in accordance
with Section 1.2 hereof, such designee) hereby represents and warrants (jointly
and severally, if more than one Person) to Sellers as follows:

        5.1 Organization and Good Standing. Purchaser is a corporation or other
entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing (if such concept or
its equivalent exists under relevant Law) under the Laws of the jurisdiction of
its organization.

        5.2 Authorization of Agreement. Purchaser has all requisite corporate or
other applicable organizational power and authority to execute and deliver this
Agreement, each Local Agreement, and each other agreement, document, instrument
or certificate contemplated by this Agreement to be executed by Purchaser in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby (together with this Agreement, the "Purchaser Documents"), and to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. The execution,
delivery and performance by Purchaser of the Purchaser Documents has been duly
authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of Purchaser. This
Agreement has been, and each other Purchaser Document will be at or prior to the
Closing duly executed and delivered by Purchaser and (assuming the due
authorization, execution and delivery by the other parties hereto and thereto)
this Agreement constitutes, and each Purchaser Document when so executed and
delivered will constitute, legal, valid and binding obligations of Purchaser,
enforceable against Purchaser in accordance with their respective terms, subject
to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and similar
Laws affecting creditors' rights and remedies generally, and subject, as to
enforceability, to general principles of equity, including principles of
commercial reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing (regardless of whether
enforcement is sought in a proceeding at law or in equity).

        5.3 Conflicts; Consents of Third Parties.

        (a) None of the execution and delivery by Purchaser of the Purchaser
Documents, the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby,
or compliance by Purchaser with any of the provisions hereof or thereof will (i)
conflict with, or result in the breach of, any provision of the certificate of
incorporation or by-laws or comparable organizational documents of Purchaser;
(ii) conflict with, violate, result in the breach of or termination, or
constitute a default of, or result in the acceleration of payment or performance
under any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, license, agreement or other
obligation to which Purchaser is a party or by which Purchaser or its properties
or assets are bound; or (iii) subject to receipt of the consents referred to in
Section 5.3(b), violate any Law or Order of any Governmental Body by which
Purchaser is bound, except, in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii), for such
violations, breaches or defaults as would not, individually or in the aggregate,
prevent or materially delay Purchaser from consummating the transactions
contemplated hereby.

        (b) Except (i) for filings under the HSR Act, and (ii) as set forth on
Schedule 5.3(b), no consent, waiver, approval, Order, Permit or authorization
of, or declaration or filing with, or notification to, any Person is required on
the part of Purchaser in connection with the execution and delivery of the
Purchaser Documents or the compliance by Purchaser with any of the provisions
hereof or thereof.

        5.4 Litigation. There are no Legal Proceedings pending or, to the
Knowledge of Purchaser, threatened that are reasonably likely to prohibit or
adversely affect the ability of Purchaser to enter into the other Purchaser
Documents or consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.

        5.5 Investment Intention. Purchaser is acquiring the Shares for its own
account, for investment purposes only and not with a view to the distribution
(as such term is used in Section 2(11) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended
(the "Securities Act")) thereof. Purchaser is an "accredited investor" as such
term is defined in the Securities Act and Ontario Securities Commission Rule
45-501. Purchaser understands that the Shares have not been registered under the
Securities Act or under the laws of any other jurisdiction and cannot be sold
unless subsequently registered under the Securities Act or an exemption from
such registration is available.

        5.6 Financial Advisors. Except as set forth on Schedule 5.6, no Person
has acted, directly or indirectly, as a broker, finder or financial advisor for
Purchaser in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
and no other Person is entitled to any fee or commission or like payment in
respect thereof through Purchaser. Purchaser shall be responsible for the fees
or commissions of any Person listed on Schedule 5.6.

        5.7 Sufficiency of Funds. Purchaser has sufficient funds, from cash on
hand or committed lines of credit, to pay the Final Purchase Price and otherwise
consummate the transactions contemplated by the Purchaser Documents. To the
extent any portion of such funds will be provided by third-party investors or
lenders, Purchaser has delivered to Sellers copies of all commitment letters and
accompanying term sheets and equity commitment letters (the "Financing
Commitments"), all of which are listed on Schedule 5.7. Assuming that the
amounts contemplated to be provided by the Financing Commitments are provided,
the aggregate proceeds of the financing to be provided thereunder, together with
Purchaser's funds on hand, will be in an amount sufficient to purchase the
Shares and pay all fees and expenses incurred by Purchaser in connection with
the transactions contemplated hereby and by the Financing Commitments. The
Financing Commitments are in full force and effect, have not been withdrawn,
terminated or modified, and no Person extending such Financing Commitment has
advised Purchaser or any Affiliate of Purchaser, and Purchaser has no Knowledge,
that the financing contemplated by the Financing Commitments will not be made
available to Purchaser. Purchaser will not agree to any amendment or termination
of the Financing Commitments, if such amendment would impair Purchaser's ability
to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, without the prior
written consent of Pactiv.

        5.8 Condition of the Companies. Notwithstanding anything contained in
this Agreement or any of the other Seller Documents to the contrary, Purchaser
acknowledges and agrees that neither any Seller nor any of their respective
Affiliates is making any representations or warranties whatsoever, express or
implied, beyond those expressly given by Sellers in Article IV hereof (as
modified by the Schedules hereto) and the rest of this Agreement and the Seller
Documents. Any claims Purchaser may have for breach of representation or
warranty shall be based solely on the representations and warranties of Sellers
set forth in Article IV hereof (as modified by the Schedules hereto) and shall
be subject to Article IX hereof. Purchaser further represents that neither any
Seller nor any Affiliate of any Seller nor any other Person has made any
representation or warranty, express or implied, as to the accuracy or
completeness of any information regarding any Seller, any Company, the Shares,
the Businesses, or the transactions contemplated by the Seller Documents not
expressly set forth herein, and none of the Sellers, any of their respective
Affiliates, or any other Person will have or be subject to any liability to
Purchaser or any other Person resulting from the distribution to Purchaser or
its representatives or Purchaser's use of, any such information, including any
confidential memoranda or other documents distributed by or on behalf of Sellers
relating to the Shares, the Businesses or other publication or data room
information provided to Purchaser or its representatives, including any vendor
due diligence report or any other document or information in any form provided
to Purchaser or its representatives in connection with the sale of the Shares,
the Businesses and each of the transactions contemplated by the Seller
Documents.

        5.9 No Knowledge of Breach. To Purchaser's Knowledge, as of the date
hereof, and after taking into account the matters set forth in the Schedules and
Purchaser's due diligence review (assuming, for purposes of Sellers'
representations and warranties in Section 4.23, completion by Sellers of the
Reorganization), there exists no breach of any representation or warranty by
Sellers in this Agreement.

representatives of the Companies as Purchaser may request. It is understood
that, as a general rule, such access will be limited to discussions with or
presentations by senior management personnel of the Companies. Purchaser shall

expenses incurred by Sellers or the Companies in complying with requests made by
Purchaser in connection with this Section 6.1.

        (c) Terms of Employment.

                (i) Salary and Wage and Benefit Levels. For a period of one year
        immediately following the Closing Date Purchaser shall provide, and

        benefit pension benefits) which, in the aggregate, are substantially
        similar to the benefits such Current Employees were receiving
        immediately prior to the Closing Date, in each case subject to
        applicable Law, contracts or collective bargaining agreements. Purchaser
        shall or shall cause the Companies to assume all liabilities and
        obligations with respect to regular bonus plans sponsored or maintained
        by Sellers or any of their Affiliates covering any Current Employees on
        the same terms and conditions as set forth in such plans, and Sellers

        in this Section 6.3, Purchaser shall cause the Companies to honor, or
        assume where applicable, the obligations of Sellers and the Companies
        under the provisions of (x) the collective bargaining agreements
        (including any benefit plans maintained pursuant to such collective
        bargaining agreements), and "social plans," set forth on Schedule 4.17
        of the Disclosure Schedule, and (y) the employment agreements for the
        Current Employees who are employees of Seller's affiliated Mexican
        service company, and Sellers and Purchaser shall take all steps
        necessary or appropriate so that, effective immediately following the
        Closing Date, Purchaser or the Companies have assumed all obligations
        and liabilities of Sellers under such collective bargaining agreements,
        social plans, and employment agreements, and neither Sellers nor their
        Affiliates shall have any further obligation or liability with respect
        to any such agreements. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
        the contrary, neither Purchaser nor any Company shall be responsible for
        (A) any obligations arising under or related to the agreements listed on
        Schedule 6.3(c)(ii), including stay bonuses and pension enhancements
        thereunder, or (B) any benefit or compensation arrangements which
        benefit employees In the United States of America or Canada other than,
        or in addition to, Current Employees or former employees of the
        Companies, whether such obligations arise or such amounts are payable
        prior to, on or following the Closing Date.

                (iii) Employee Benefit Plans.

                        (A) Purchaser shall cause the Companies to assume and
                discharge all liabilities and obligations of Pactiv relating to
                accrued but unused sick pay and vacation pay owed to Transferred
                Employees who accept such offer of employment from Purchaser.
                All such employee benefit plans, programs and arrangements
                covering or otherwise benefiting any of the Current Employees on
                or after the Closing Date shall, as applicable, grant credit for
                amounts paid by Current Employees during the applicable plan
                year, shall not exclude pre-existing conditions to the extent
                such conditions are covered by Sellers' plans, shall waive any
                evidence of insurability provisions, waiting period requirements
                or any similar provision, in each case to the extent waived or
                otherwise not applicable under the Sellers' plans, and shall
                count service with the Companies for purposes of eligibility to
                participate, vesting and level of benefits (but not accrual of
                benefits) with respect to pension, retirement and other benefit
                plans, and vacation and severance, to the same extent such
                service was counted under the corresponding employee benefit
                plans, programs, or arrangements of the Companies prior to the
                Closing Date and, in the case of Non-U.S. Employees, further to
                the extent and in the manner provided for under applicable Law,
                except, in each case, to the extent that such credit would
                result in duplication of benefits for such period of service.

                        (B) Purchaser and Sellers acknowledge and agree that (i)
                Sellers shall be responsible for all liabilities and obligations
                for medical, dental, health and life insurance benefits pursuant
                to the terms of their and their Affiliates' plans with respect
                to any claims incurred by Current U.S. Employees and their
                dependents on or before the Closing Date, whether or not
                reported as of the Closing Date, and (ii) Purchaser shall be
                responsible for all liabilities and obligations for medical,
                dental, health and life insurance benefits pursuant to the terms
                of its plans with respect to any claims incurred by Current U.S.
                Employees and their dependents after the Closing Date. For
                purposes of this Section 6.3, a claim shall be deemed to have
                been incurred upon the incurrence by a Current U.S. Employee or
                dependent of a qualified expense for which reimbursement or
                payment is sought.

                (iv) Severance. Purchaser shall provide, or cause the Companies
        to provide, at a minimum, severance benefits to Current Employees that
        are not covered under any collective bargaining agreement who are
        terminated (other than for cause) on or before the first anniversary of
        the Closing Date as follows: to salaried Current Employees, two weeks of
        base pay per year of service (including service with Sellers and/or any
        of their Affiliates), and any prior employer to the extent recognized by
        Sellers and/or their Affiliates, up to maximum of 52 weeks base pay; and
        to hourly Current Employees that are not covered under any collective
        bargaining agreement, one week of base pay per year of service
        (including service with Sellers and/or any of their Affiliates, and any
        prior employer to the extent recognized by Sellers and/or their
        Affiliates), up to maximum of 16 weeks base pay (provided, in all
        instances, the severance benefits shall not be less than those required
        by applicable Law). Any such salaried or hourly Current Employee shall
        receive a minimum of four weeks base pay as severance benefits. In
        addition, any such Current Employee who is terminated on or before the
        first anniversary of the Closing Date (other than for cause) shall be
        permitted to continue coverage under the Purchaser's medical and life
        insurance plans at the active employee rate for the period of weeks for
        which severance benefits are paid to such Current Employee (the
        "Severance Period"). Continuation coverage under the Purchaser's medical
        plan pursuant to the Consolidated Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1985 or
        similar Law or program, if elected, shall commence at the expiration of
        the Current Employee's Severance Period. In addition, any salaried
        Current Employee who is terminated (other than for cause) on or before
        the first anniversary of the Closing Date shall be provided outplacement
        assistance during his or her Severance Period. The severance benefits
        set out in this Section shall be paid in addition to any contractual
        entitlements during any period of notice of termination of employment.
        To the extent Purchaser obtains a release from a severed Current
        Employee, Purchaser shall obtain from each severed Current Employee a
        release of claims which includes a release of claims against Sellers and
        their Affiliates in exchange for the severance benefits provided for
        herein, provided that Purchaser need not do so if Purchaser determines
        in good faith that to obtain a release of claims against Sellers and
        their Affiliates would jeopardize Purchaser's ability to release or
        increase the cost to Purchaser or the Companies of doing so.

        (d) No Participation in Sellers' Plans/Defined Contribution Plans.

                (i) From and after the Effective Time, other than as set forth
        in the Transition Service Agreement, the Current Employees shall not
        participate in, or have any rights under, any of Pactiv's or its
        Affiliates' benefit plans, except to the extent of accrued benefits
        payable to such Current Employees under such plans. Pactiv and/or its
        Affiliates shall retain sponsorship of its plans (other than the Non-US
        Plans), and neither Purchaser nor any of the Companies shall be entitled
        to any of the assets of such plans nor have any liability thereunder.

                (ii) As of the Closing Date, the Companies shall cease to be
        sponsoring or participating employers under the Pactiv Hourly 401(k)
        Plan and the Pactiv Salaried 401(k) Savings Plan (the "Pactiv Savings
        Plans"). As of the Closing, Sellers or their Affiliates shall have
        caused all Current U.S. Employees to become vested in their accrued
        benefits under the Pactiv Savings Plans. Prior to the Closing Date,
        Sellers shall cause employer matching contributions for Current U.S.
        Employees to be made under the Pactiv Savings Plans for the period up to
        and including the Closing Date. Any defined contribution plan
        established for Current Employees by Purchaser or its Affiliates shall,
        subject to applicable Law, provide for receipt (in the form of an
        eligible rollover distribution) of lump-sum cash distributions
        (including outstanding loans) from the qualified defined contribution
        plans maintained by Pactiv and/or its Affiliates which such Current
        Employees elect to rollover to Purchaser's defined contribution plan.

        (e) Defined Benefit Pension Plans. As of the Closing Date, the Companies
shall cease to be sponsoring or participating employers under the Pactiv
Retirement Plan (the "Seller's U.S. Pension Plan").

        (f) Obligation to Provide Benefits. Except as expressly provided in this
Section 6.3, nothing in this Agreement shall (i) require Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates to continue the employment of any Current Employee after the Closing
Date, (ii) to establish or continue any particular employee benefit plan,
practice, program or policy for any particular period of time after the Closing
Date or (iii) prohibit or in any way limit Purchaser's ability to amend or
terminate any such plan, practice, program or policy. Purchaser and its
Affiliates shall not assume any obligation to Current Employees that is not
expressly provided for herein.

                                       31
<PAGE>

        (g) Communications. Prior to the Closing Date, Sellers and their
Affiliates shall make no communications to employees of Sellers or their
Affiliates regarding benefits to be provided to employees of the Businesses
after the Closing Date without the prior written consent of Purchaser, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, except that Sellers and their
Affiliates may communicate regarding such matters with employees of the
Businesses to the extent necessary in connection with obtaining any approval or
consent required in connection with the transaction contemplated hereby,
including any union representatives, trustees or pension funds, or works
councils.

        (h) Non-U.S. Plans. Notwithstanding any other provisions in this Section
6.3, the Non-U.S. Plans shall continue in full force and effect after the
Closing. Purchaser shall use all its reasonable efforts to cause the Companies
to (1) maintain the Baldwin Group Limited Pension Scheme and The Baldwin
Executive Pension Scheme (the "Baldwin Schemes") for the benefit of Current
Employees who are members or will on completion of a waiting period become
eligible for membership in the Baldwin Schemes for a period of not less than one
year from the Closing Date, and (2) not agree to any voluntary and material
adverse amendments to future service benefits under the Baldwin Schemes during
the one year following the Closing Date. Purchaser shall cause the Companies to
(a) maintain the Pactiv (UK) Limited Pension Scheme (formerly the Tenneco
Packaging (UK) Pension Scheme), and the Stanplan A arrangement for employees of
Pactiv UK Limited (the "Pactiv UK Schemes") for the benefit of Current Employees
who are members or will on completion of a waiting period become eligible for
membership of the Pactiv UK Schemes for a period of not less than one year from
the Closing Date; (b) not agree to any voluntary and material adverse amendments
to future service benefits under the Pactiv UK Schemes during the one year
following the Closing Date; and (c) continue employer contributions to the Legal
& General Group Personal Pension Schemes for employees of Pactiv (UK) Limited at
the level at which employer contributions were being made immediately before the
Closing Date during the one year following the Closing Date.

        (i) Non-Hire. Except for the Purchaser or the Companies hiring of the
Transferred Employees as provided herein, for a period ending two years after
the Closing Date, (i) Purchaser shall not, and shall not permit the Companies
to, solicit for hire, or hire, any salaried employees of Sellers or their
Affiliates, provided that Purchaser and the Companies may place advertisements
for employment in media of general circulation not specifically directed at
Seller's or Sellers' Affiliates' employees and hire any persons who responds to
such a general solicitation, and (ii) Sellers shall not, and shall not permit
their Affiliates to, solicit for hire, or hire, any salaried employees of the
Companies, provided that Sellers and or Sellers' Affiliates may place
advertisements for employment in media of general circulation not specifically
directed at the Companies' employees and hire any persons who responds to such a
general solicitation.

        (j) The Companies are responsible for all pending workers' compensation
benefits and claims for any Current Employees. Seller will pay all workers'
compensation benefits with respect to injuries occurring to any Transferred
Employee prior to the Closing Date. Purchaser or the Companies will pay all
workers' compensation benefits with respect to injuries occurring to any
Transferred Employee after the Closing Date.


                                       32

        (k) Seller shall indemnify and hold harmless the Companies, Purchaser
and its Affiliates from and against all costs, obligations and liabilities
arising by reason of any Company being an ERISA Affiliate of any Seller or any
ERISA Affiliate thereof (other than a Company).

        6.4 Preservation of Records; Cooperation.

        (a) Subject to Section 9.5(d)(ii) hereof (relating to the preservation
of Tax records), Sellers and Purchaser shall preserve and keep the records held
by it relating to the business of the Companies (and, in the case of Purchaser,
shall cause the Companies to preserve and keep their records for so long as such
Companies are an Affiliate of Purchaser) for a period of seven years from the
Closing Date (or such longer period as may be required by Law) and shall make
such records and appropriate personnel available to the other as may be
reasonably required by such party in connection with, among other things, any
insurance claim by, Legal Proceedings against or governmental investigations of,
Sellers or Purchaser or any of their Affiliates or in order to enable Sellers or
Purchaser to comply with their respective obligations under this Agreement, the
other Seller Documents, or the other Purchaser Documents. If Sellers, Purchaser
or the Companies wishes to destroy such records within seven years of the
Closing Date, such party shall first give 90 days prior written notice to the
other parties, and the other parties shall have the right at its option and
expense, upon prior written notice given to such party within that 90 day
period, to take possession of the records subject to any applicable
confidentiality restrictions.

        (b) In the event that any action, suit, proceeding or investigation
relating to the Businesses or to this Agreement is commenced, whether before or
after the Closing, where the parties to this Agreement are not adverse, the
parties hereto agree to cooperate and use reasonable efforts to vigorously
defend against and respond thereto and make reasonably available to each other
such personnel, witnesses, books, records, documents or other information within
its control that are necessary or appropriate for such defense (except for trade
secrets, documents subject to any confidentiality agreement, attorney-client
privilege or other applicable privilege and such items which may not be made
available pursuant to a court order). A party requesting cooperation under this
Section 6.4(b) shall reimburse the other party or parties for out-of-pocket
costs incurred in connection therewith.

        (c) Purchaser acknowledges that all information provided or made
available to it or any of its Affiliates, agents and representatives by Seller
and its Affiliates, agents and representatives is subject to the Confidentiality
Agreement. Effective upon, and only upon, the Closing, the Confidentiality
Agreement shall terminate. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is understood and
agreed that Purchaser may disclose information (i) to any potential co-investor
pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement not less restrictive of the
other party than the Confidentiality Agreement, and (ii) as reasonably necessary
in order for Purchaser to satisfy the conditions and obligations contained in
the Financing Commitments, including, without limitation, as part of any "road
shows" contemplated by the Financing Commitments.

        (d) After the Closing Date, Seller shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to, and to cause its directors, officers, employees, advisors,
representatives and Affiliates to, keep the Purchaser Information (as defined
below) confidential following the Closing Date, except that any such Purchaser
Information required by Law or legal process to be disclosed may be disclosed
without violating the provisions of this Section 6.4(d); provided, however, in
such event Seller shall provide Purchaser with prompt notice of such requirement
in order to enable Purchaser to seek an appropriate protective order or other
remedy. In the event that such protective order or other remedy is not timely
obtained, Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to disclose only that
portion of the Purchaser Information which Seller's counsel advises Seller it is
legally required to disclose. Upon the request and at the expense of Purchaser,
Seller shall promptly make all disclosures, execute all instruments and papers
and perform all acts reasonably necessary to vest and confirm in Purchaser or
any Company, fully and completely, all rights created or contemplated by this
Section 6.4(d). For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Purchaser Information"
shall mean all confidential information concerning the Businesses, the Purchaser
and the Companies, including any assets, liabilities, goodwill, employees, trade
secrets, know-how and other confidential technical business and financial
information, including any information concerning past, present or prospective
customers, marketing data or other confidential information (whether or not
known with the knowledge and permission of any Company and whether or not at any
time prior to the Closing developed, devised, or otherwise created in whole or
in part by the efforts of Seller), other than information that (x) does not
relate exclusively to the Businesses, (y) is otherwise used in the ordinary
course of business of Sellers' Businesses, or (z) is available to the public on
the Closing Date, or thereafter becomes available to the public other than as a
result of a breach of this Section 6.4(d).

                                       33
<PAGE>

        6.5 Publicity. Neither Sellers or their Affiliates, on the one hand, nor
Purchaser or its Affiliates, on the other hand, shall issue any press release or
public announcement concerning this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby without obtaining the prior written approval of the other party hereto,
which approval will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed,
unless, based upon advice of their respective legal counsel, disclosure is
otherwise required by applicable Law or by the applicable rules of any stock
exchange on which a party or its Affiliates lists securities, provided that, to
the extent disclosure is required by applicable Law, the party intending to make
such release shall use its commercially reasonable efforts consistent with such
applicable Law to consult with the other party with respect to the text thereof.

        6.6 Intercompany Agreements. Prior to or at Closing, except (i) with
regard to those arrangements provided for in the Ancillary Agreements, (ii) with
regard to the provisions of Section 6.7 hereof, or (iii) as set forth on
Schedule 6.6 each Seller shall, and shall cause each Company to, cause all
intercompany agreements between any Company, on the one hand, and/or such Seller
or any of its Affiliates (other than the Companies), on the other hand, to be
terminated as of the Effective Time, and all obligations thereunder and all
other intercompany trading accounts to be cancelled and released.

        6.7 Use of Name.

        (a) Purchaser shall cause the Companies (i) as soon as practicable after
the Closing Date and in any event within 90 days following the Closing Date, to
cease production of any and all products and other materials inscribed with the
name "Pactiv" or any other service marks, trademarks, trade names, identifying
symbols, logos, emblems, signs or insignia related thereto or containing or
comprising the foregoing, including any name or mark confusingly similar thereto
(collectively, the "Seller Marks"), provided that the foregoing shall not
require the Purchaser to cause the Companies to cease production of products or
other materials using molds inscribed with any of the Seller Marks which shall
be the subject of Section 6.7(b), (ii) immediately after the Closing, to cease
to hold themselves out as having any affiliation with any Seller or any of their
Affiliates, and (iii) as promptly as practicable but in no event later than 30
days following the Closing Date, in the case of any Company whose name includes
the name "Pactiv" or any variation or derivative thereof, to change its
corporate name to a name that does not include the name "Pactiv" or any
variation or derivative thereof, and make any necessary legal filings with the
appropriate Governmental Body to effect such change.

                                       34
<PAGE>

        (b) In furtherance of Section 6.7(a), as promptly as practicable but in
no event later than 9 months following the Closing Date, Purchaser shall cause
the Companies to remove, strike over or otherwise obliterate all Seller Marks
from all materials owned by any Company, including molds, vehicles, business
cards, schedules, stationery, packaging materials, displays, and signs.

        (c) For the purpose of complying with this Section 6.7, Sellers grant to
Purchaser a limited non-exclusive transition trademark license solely for the
purpose of the Companies' transitioning use of the Seller Marks after Closing.
Neither Purchaser nor any Company shall acquire any rights whatsoever in the
Seller Marks by virtue of its use during this transition period and all use of
the Seller Marks by Purchaser or the Companies during this period and all
goodwill arising out of such use shall inure to the benefit of Sellers.

        (d) Purchaser may extend the time periods to comply with this Section
6.7 with Pactiv's consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld) by
delivering notice to Pactiv no later than ten business days prior to the
expiration of the relevant period set forth in Section 6.7(a) or (b), provided
that if the aggregate amount of the extensions for any relevant period is equal
to or exceeds the initial time allowed (i.e., 90 days, 30 days, or 9 months),
then any such further extensions shall be at Pactiv's sole discretion.

        6.8 Insurance.

        (a) The insurance policies listed on Schedule 6.8 hereof are owned by
one or more of the Companies (the "Company Policies"), and will continue in
force following the Closing (subject to the Companies' continued compliance with
the terms of such policies, including paying all applicable premiums).

        (b) Purchaser acknowledges that, upon Closing, all insurance coverage
provided in relation to the Businesses pursuant to policies maintained by any
Sellers or their Affiliates other than the Company Policies, whether such
policies are maintained in whole or in part with third-party insurers or with
Seller or its Affiliates, shall cease and no further coverage shall be available
to any Company under any such policies or programs to the extent that such are
"claims made" basis policies but (subject to the terms of any relevant policy)
without prejudice to any accrued claims which a Company or any Seller or
Affiliate (in the latter case in relation to the Businesses) may have at
Closing. Sellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts to allow the
Businesses to retain the benefit of "occurrence" based policies of insurance in
relation to events occurring prior to Closing but in respect of which no claim
has yet arisen at the time of Closing; it being understood and agreed that the
retention by the Businesses of the benefit of such "occurrence" based policies
of insurance shall, to the extent such coverage also exists with respect to
Pactiv or any of its current or former Affiliates (other than any Company), be
without prejudice to the rights of Pactiv or such other current or former
Affiliates (other than any Company) to continue to retain the benefit of such
"occurrence" based policies of insurance at and after the Closing Date as such
policies were in effect on the date prior to the Closing Date.


                                       35
<PAGE>

        (c) Any claims made under the insurance policies referred to in Section
6.8(a) in respect of the Businesses and as to which coverage remains available
after Closing shall be administered and collected by Sellers (or by a claims
handler appointed by Sellers) who shall use their commercially reasonable
efforts to collect any proceeds under such insurance policies for the benefit of
Purchaser. Purchaser shall cooperate fully with Sellers to enable Sellers to
comply with the requirements of the relevant insurer, and Purchaser shall
provide such information and assistance as Sellers may reasonably request in
connection with any such claim. Any monies received by Sellers as a result of
such claims shall be paid over to Purchaser, net of all reasonable costs and
expenses of recovery (including all reasonable handling and collection charges
by any claims handler appointed by Sellers).

        (d) With regard to all other claims filed or pending in respect of the
insurance policies referred to in Section 6.8(b) prior to the Closing Date and
relating to the Businesses and/or the Companies, Sellers will be responsible for
and will be entitled to retain any monies received relating thereto, provided
that Sellers shall pay such amounts to the applicable Company if and to the
extent that such claim is reflected as an account receivable in the
determination of Final Working Capital.

        6.9 Cooperation. (a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, each party shall use its reasonable commercial efforts
to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and
to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary,
proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious
manner practicable, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement including:
(i) satisfying conditions to Closing as promptly as practicable, (ii) obtaining
all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents and Governmental
Approvals and the making of all necessary registrations and filings, if any
(including filings with Governmental Bodies), and taking all steps as may be
necessary, proper or advisable to obtain an approval or waiver from, or to avoid
an action or proceeding in connection with any Governmental Approval, (iii)
obtaining all necessary consents, approvals or waivers from third parties, (iv)
defending any lawsuits or other Legal Proceedings, whether judicial or
administrative, challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, including seeking to have any stay or
temporary restraining order entered by any court or other Governmental Body in
connection with any Governmental Approval vacated or reversed, and (v) executing
and delivering any additional instruments necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated by, and to fully carry out the purposes of, this
Agreement.

        (b) The Sellers and the Companies shall cooperate with Purchaser and its
agents and representatives, at Purchaser's expense, in order for Purchaser to
satisfy the conditions and obligations contained in the Financing Commitments,
including providing reasonable access to the books and records, officers,
directors, agents and other representatives of the Companies, providing any
financial statements required in connection with such debt financing, assistance
and cooperation with the preparation of standard confidential memorandum,
providing customary certification to placement agents and auditors,
participating in any "road shows", causing the Company's accountants to provide
comfort letters, and marketing any securities.

                                       36

        (c) It is understood by Purchaser and Sellers that, as set forth in the
Schedules, as of the date of this Agreement, certain assets, rights, properties
or interests that relate to, or are primarily used in the Businesses, are
legally owned by a Seller or an Affiliate of Seller. Seller covenants to
transfer these assets, rights, properties or interests to a Company prior to
Closing (the "Reorganization"). If after Closing Purchaser or Sellers shall
identify any assets, rights, properties or interests (other than the Corporate
Licenses) that primarily relate to the Businesses but which were not legally
owned by a Company but instead were legally owned by a Seller or an Affiliate of
a Seller, Sellers shall transfer, or cause such Affiliates to transfer, such
assets, rights, properties or interests to a Company as directed by Purchaser
without further consideration.

        6.10 Governmental Filings and Approvals.

        (a) Without limiting the generality of Section 6.9, each of Purchaser
and Sellers will promptly, and in any event within ten Business Days after
execution of this Agreement (or such shorter period of time as is required under
applicable Law), make all filings or submissions as are required under the HSR
Act and, as promptly as possible, make all filings or submissions as are
required to obtain all other Governmental Approvals. If European Commission
approval is required or sought, a notification or submission to the European
Commission shall be made within 3 Business Days of the parties having agreed
with the European Commission that it will be accepted as complete or sufficient.
For the purposes of this Agreement, the term "Governmental Approval" means any
consent, filing, approval, clearance or Order of, with or to any Governmental
Body necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including filing under the HSR Act and those listed on Schedule 6.10. Each of
Purchaser and Sellers will promptly furnish to the other such necessary
information and reasonable assistance as the other may request in connection
with its preparation of any filing, notification, or submission which is
necessary under the HSR Act or to obtain any Governmental Approval. Each of
Purchaser and Sellers will promptly provide the other with drafts and will allow
reasonably adequate time for comment by the other party regarding the contents
of all communications in connection with any Governmental Approval, and copies
of all written communications (and memoranda setting forth the substance of all
oral communications) between each of them or their representatives, on the one
hand, and any Governmental Body, on the other hand, in connection with any
Governmental Approval required by this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby. Purchaser will, unless expressly prohibited by the relevant
Governmental Body, allow persons nominated by Sellers to attend and make oral
submissions at all meetings and conference calls with Governmental Bodies.
Without limiting the foregoing, each of Purchaser and Sellers will promptly
notify the other of the receipt and content of any inquiries or requests for
additional information made by any Governmental Body in connection with any
Governmental Approval and promptly provide the other with drafts of all
submissions setting out the information to be provided to any Governmental Body
with respect to any such inquiry or request and allow reasonably adequate time
for comment by the other. In addition, each of Purchaser and Sellers will keep
the other apprised of the status of any such inquiry or request. Each party
hereto agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause a termination
of the waiting period under the HSR Act without entry by a court of competent
jurisdiction of an order enjoining the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby as early a date as possible, and to obtain all other
Governmental Approvals. Purchaser will be responsible for the filing fees and
charges associated with filings under the HSR Act and in connection with other
Government Approvals.

sales to Purchaser or to accept any terms that would be less advantageous to
Sellers than would be available to Sellers on a stand-alone basis, and Sellers
shall not condition its purchases of resins from any supplier on the terms on

        Spain" on Schedule 4.18, provided that Sellers shall retain all rights
        to any insurance proceeds, rights of contribution, or other rights

                (i) the failure of any representations and warranty of Purchaser

<PAGE>

                (iii) any and all Losses arising out of, based upon or relating

        the Shares from and after the Effective Time.

        (d) In determining indemnification obligations under this Article IX,
Sellers and Purchaser hereby agree that

                (i) For purposes of determining whether there has been a failure
        of any representation or warranty to be true and correct and the amount
        of Losses sustained or incurred by Purchaser, for purposes of Section
        9.1(b)(i) and Section 9.1(c)(i), such representations and warranties
        shall be interpreted without giving effect to the words "material,"
        "materially," "Company Material Adverse Effect" or similar
        qualifications (other than in Section 4.9, where such terms shall be
        given full effect);

                (ii) In the event indemnification is sought as a breach of the
        representation and warranty in Section 4.9 for a matter which is the
        subject matter of another breach of a representation and warranty of
        Sellers under this Agreement, Seller's sole obligation with respect to
        such matter shall be determined under such other Section and not Section
        4.9;

                (iii) Should Sellers or any of their Affiliates incur any
        liability to any third party with respect to any liability or obligation
        of any Company (other than a matter for which Sellers have agreed to
        indemnify Purchaser hereunder or under the terms of that certain side
        letter agreement, dated as of the date hereof, between Pactiv and
        Purchaser), Sellers shall be entitled to obtain contribution from the
        Companies for such amounts; and

                (iv) Purchaser shall not be entitled to indemnification for a
        breach of the representations and warranties in Section 4.8 with respect
        to the Unaudited Financial Statements or the Interim Financial
        Statements to the extent such matter resulted in an adjustment to the
        Initial Purchase Price under Section 2.1(b) or is taken into account in
        the Working Capital Adjustment.

        9.2 Limitations on Indemnification for Breaches of Representations and
Warranties. Other than the representations and warranties set forth in Sections
4.1-4.3, 4.7, 4.16(g), 4.16(h), and 4.21 hereof, a party shall not have any
liability under Section 9.1(b)(i) for any Losses (i) for any individual item
where the Loss relating thereto is less than $150,000, (ii) in respect of each
individual item where the Loss relating thereto is equal to or greater than
$150,000, unless and until the total amount of Losses to the indemnified parties
finally determined to arise thereunder based upon, attributable to or resulting
from the breach of all representations and warranties, exceeds, in the
aggregate, one percent (1%) of the Initial Purchase Price (the "Deductible"),
and then only to the extent that such Losses exceed the Deductible, and (iii) in
the aggregate not to exceed fifteen percent (15%) of the Initial Purchase Price
(the "Cap").

        9.3 Survival of Representations and Warranties and Covenants.

        (a) The representations and warranties of Purchaser and Sellers
contained in this Agreement shall survive the Closing solely for purposes of
Article IX and such representations and warranties shall terminate at the close
of business on the date that is 12 months after the Closing Date; provided,
however, that (i) the representations and warranties contained in Sections
4.1-4.3, 4.7, 4.16(g), 4.16(h), 4.21, and Article V shall survive the Closing
and remain in effect until the expiration of the statute of limitations for
written contracts; (ii) the representations and warranties contained in Section
4.11 shall survive the Closing until 30 days after the expiration of the last
day on which any Tax may be validly assessed by the Internal Revenue Service or
any Governmental Body against a Company or any of its properties and (iii) the
representations and warranties contained in Section 4.20 shall survive the
Closing and remain in effect until the close of business on the date that is
three years after the Closing Date. Any claim for indemnification with respect
to any of such matters which is not asserted by notice containing sufficient
detail as to allow the claim to be evaluated (and including, to the extent
reasonably possible, the amount of such claim) given as herein provided relating
thereto within such specified period of survival may not be pursued and is
hereby irrevocably waived after such time.

                                       45
<PAGE>

        (b) Unless a specified period is set forth in this Agreement (in which
event such specified period will control), the covenants in this Agreement will
survive the Closing and remain in effect until the expiration of the statute of
limitations for written contracts.

9.4      General Indemnification Procedures.

        (a) In the event that any Legal Proceedings shall be instituted or any
claim or demand ("Claim") shall be asserted or threatened by any Person in
respect of which payment may be sought under Section 9.1 (regardless of the
Deductible or the Cap referred to above), the indemnified party shall reasonably
and promptly cause written notice of the assertion of any Claim of which it has
knowledge which is covered by this indemnity to be forwarded to the indemnifying
party. Such notice shall (i) identify specifically the basis under which
indemnification is sought pursuant to Section 9.1, (ii) identify the
provision(s) of this Agreement applicable to, and upon which such
indemnification claim is based and the facts surrounding the alleged breach or
noncompliance by the indemnifying part of such provision(s), to the extent then
known, and (iii) enclose true and correct copies of any written document
furnished to the indemnified party by the Person that instituted the Claim. The
indemnified party shall thereafter provide the indemnifying party reasonable
access to the books, records, properties and personnel of the indemnified party
as it reasonably requests for the purpose of investigating such Claim. The
indemnifying party shall have the right, at its sole option and expense, to be
represented by counsel of its choice (which shall be reasonably acceptable to
the indemnified party) and to defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise
deal with any Claim which relates to any Losses indemnified against hereunder.
If the indemnifying party is obligated to or elects to defend against,
negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with any Claim which relates to any Losses
indemnified against hereunder, it shall within 30 days (or sooner, if the nature
of the Claim so requires) notify the indemnified party of its intent to do so
and will conduct the defense, negotiation and settlement of such Claim in good
faith, in a reasonable manner. If the indemnifying party elects not to defend
against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with any Claim which relates to any
Losses indemnified against hereunder or fails to notify the indemnified party of
its election as herein provided, the indemnified party may defend against,
negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with such Claim; provided that if the
indemnified party defends any Claim under such circumstances, the indemnified
party shall not settle any Claim or make any admission of guilt or liability
without the consent of the indemnifying party, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld. If the indemnifying party assumes the defense of any
Claim, the indemnified party may participate, at his or its own expense, in the
defense of such Claim, provided that such indemnified party shall be entitled to
participate in any such defense with separate counsel at the expense of the
indemnifying party if so requested by the indemnifying party to participate;
provided further that the indemnifying party shall not be required to pay for
more than one such counsel for all indemnified parties in connection with any
Claim. With respect to any claim involving (i) equitable relief restricting the
operations of the Businesses, (ii) any criminal liability against Purchaser or
any Company, or (iii) damages which would, together with damages awarded in any
prior claims, exceed the Cap, or (iv) which would materially adversely affect
the business or reputation of the indemnified party, the indemnifying party
shall not settle any Claim or make any admission of guilt without the prior
written consent of the indemnified party, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld. The parties shall cooperate fully with each other in
connection with the defense, negotiation or settlement of any such Claim.
Whichever party defends against, negotiates, settles or otherwise deals with any
Claim which relates to any Losses indemnified against hereunder, such party
shall promptly supply to the other parties copies of all correspondence and
documents relating to or in connection with such Claim and keep the other
parties fully informed of all developments relating to or in connection with
such Claim (including, without limitation, providing to the other parties, on
request, updates and summaries as to the status thereof).

        (b) After any final judgment or award shall have been rendered by a
court, arbitration board or administrative agency of competent jurisdiction and
the expiration of the time in which to appeal therefrom, or a settlement shall
have been consummated, or the indemnified party and the indemnifying party shall
have arrived at a mutually binding agreement with respect to a Claim hereunder,
the indemnified party shall forward to the indemnifying party notice of any sums
due and owing by the indemnifying party pursuant to this Agreement with respect
to such matter.

        (c) The failure of the indemnified party to give reasonably prompt
notice of any Claim shall not release, waive or otherwise affect the
indemnifying party's obligations with respect thereto except to the extent that
the indemnifying party can demonstrate actual loss or prejudice as a result of
such failure.

        (d) Sellers shall not have any liability under this Article IX for any
Losses:

                (i) in respect of any fact, matter, event or circumstance to the
        extent that an accrual therefor has been made in computation of the
        Final Working Capital or such matter was specifically identified in the
        Unaudited Financial Statements (including the notes thereto); or

                (ii) to the extent that any Claim is attributable to, or such
        Claim is increased as a result of, any legislation not in force on the
        date hereof or to any change of Law, including any change in the
        interpretation or application of any Law, or any change in rates of Tax,
        which in each case is not in force on the date hereof.

                9.5 Tax Matters.


                (a) Tax Indemnification.

        (i) Sellers shall indemnify Purchaser and its Affiliates (including the
Companies) and hold them harmless from all Losses arising in connection with (1)
any liability, obligation or commitment, whether or not accrued, assessed or
currently due and payable, for any Taxes of or imposed upon the Companies for
any Pre-Closing Tax Period, except to the extent reflected as a liability on
Final Working Capital, (2) any liability for corporate income taxes, trade taxes
and solidarity surcharges in connection with the sale of Sengewald
Klinikprodukte GmbH & Co. KG (LP) and the sale of Kobusch-Sengewald GmbH & Co.
KG, and (3) any breach of a representation set forth in Section 4.11 and any
breach by Sellers of their obligations under this Agreement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Sellers shall not indemnify and hold harmless Purchaser and its
Affiliates (including the Companies) from any liability for (A) Taxes
attributable to any action taken outside of the ordinary course of business on
or after the Closing Date by Purchaser, any of its Affiliates (including the
Companies), or any transferee of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (other than
any such action required by applicable Law or by this Agreement or pursuant to a
legally binding commitment entered into by Sellers or the Companies made before
the Closing) that directly increase the Tax liabilities of the Sellers or the
Companies with respect to Pre-Closing Tax Periods (a "Purchaser Tax Act"), or
(B) Taxes attributable to a breach by Purchaser of its obligations under this
Agreement.

        (ii) Purchaser shall, and shall cause the Companies to, indemnify
Sellers and their Affiliates and hold them harmless from (1) all liability for
Taxes of the Companies for any Post-Closing Tax Period, (2) all liability for
Taxes accrued on the Final Working Capital Statements, and (3) all liability for
Taxes attributable to a Purchaser Tax Act or to a breach by Purchaser of its
obligations under this Agreement.

        (iii) Liability for real estate transfer taxes, stamp duty and all other
Transfer Taxes arising from the transactions will be determined under the
applicable tax law governing such tax in each applicable taxing jurisdiction.

        (iv) In the case of any taxable period that includes (but does not end
on) the Closing Date (a "Straddle Period"):

                        (1) the Taxes of the Companies allocable to the
                Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be computed as if such taxable
                period ended as of the close of business on the Closing Date,
                provided that (A) real property, personal property, and other
                Taxes calculated on a periodic basis, and (B) exemptions,
                allowances or deductions that are calculated on a periodic basis
                (including, but not limited to, depreciation and amortization
                deductions) shall be allocated between the period ending on the
                Closing Date and the period after the Closing Date in proportion
                to the number of days in each period; and


                                       48
<PAGE>

                        (2) notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the
                preceding sentence, the parties agree that for U.S. federal
                income Tax purposes, Tax items for any Straddle Period shall be
                apportioned between Pre-Closing Tax Periods and Post-Closing Tax
                Periods in accordance with U.S. Treasury Regulations Section
                1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B), which regulations shall be reasonably
                interpreted by the parties in a manner intended to achieve the
                method of apportionment described in the preceding sentence; and

                        (3) the taxable period of any partnership or other
                pass-through entity in which any of the Companies hold a
                beneficial interest shall be deemed to terminate on the Closing
                Date.

        (b) Procedures Relating to Indemnification of Tax Claims.

        (i) If one party is responsible for the payment of Taxes pursuant to
Section 9.5(a) (the "Tax Indemnifying Party"), and the other party (the "Tax
Indemnified Party") receives notice of any deficiency, proposed adjustment,
assessment, audit, examination, suit, dispute or other claim (a "Tax Claim")
with respect to such Taxes, the Tax Indemnified Party shall promptly notify the
Tax Indemnifying Party in writing of such Tax Claim. If notice of a Tax Claim is
not given to the Tax Indemnifying Party within a sufficient period of time to
allow such party effectively to contest such Tax Claim, or in reasonable detail
to apprise such party of the nature of the Tax Claim, the Tax Indemnifying Party
shall not be liable to the Tax Indemnified Party (or any of its Affiliates or
any of their respective officers, directors, employees, stockholders, agents or
representatives) to the extent that the Tax Indemnifying Party position is
actually prejudiced as a result thereof.

        (ii) With respect to any Tax Claim, the Tax Indemnifying Party shall, at
its own expense, assume and control all proceedings taken in connection with
such Tax Claim (including selection of counsel) and, without limiting the
foregoing, may in its sole discretion pursue or forego any and all
administrative proceedings with any Taxing Authority with respect thereto, and
may, in its sole discretion, either pay the Tax claimed and sue for a refund or
contest the Tax Claim in any permissible manner; provided, however, that Sellers
and Purchaser shall jointly control all proceedings taken in connection with any
such Tax Claim if such Tax Claim relates (A) to Taxes of a Company for a
Straddle Period, or (B) to Taxes for which the Purchaser or the Companies are
liable and any Seller or any of its Affiliates is also liable; provided,
however, that the Tax Indemnified Party shall be entitled to participate in any
Tax Claim the settlement of which could reasonably be expected to have an
adverse effect on such Tax Indemnified Party. The Tax Indemnifying Party shall
keep the Tax Indemnified Party informed of the progress of all Tax Claims and
shall provide copies of all written communications with any Governmental Body
related to such Tax Claims.

        (iii) The Tax Indemnified Party and each of its respective Affiliates
shall cooperate with the Tax Indemnifying Party in contesting any Tax Claim,
which cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the Tax Indemnifying
Party's request) the provision to the Tax Indemnifying Party of records and
information which are reasonably relevant to such Tax Claim, and making
employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional
information or explanation of any material provided hereunder or to testify at
proceedings relating to such Tax Claim.
                                       49
<PAGE>

        (iv) In no case shall the Tax Indemnified Party, any Company or any of
their respective officers, directors, employees, stockholders, agents or
representatives settle or otherwise compromise any Tax Claim without the Tax
Indemnifying Party's prior written consent. Neither party shall settle a Tax
Claim relating to Taxes of a Company for a Straddle Period without the other
party's prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld
or delayed. The Tax Indemnifying Party shall not settle a Tax Claim without the
consent of the Tax Indemnified Party if such settlement could reasonably be
expected to have an adverse effect on the Purchaser in a Post-Closing Tax
Period. No such consent shall be necessary if the settlement of the Tax Claim
reduces or limits, or has the effect of reducing or limiting, the use of any net
operating losses, net capital losses or other Tax benefits that are attributable
to any Pre-Closing Tax Period and that may be allocated to any of the Companies
and such settlement would not otherwise have an adverse effect on Purchaser or
the Companies.

        (c) Responsibility for Preparation and Filing of Tax Returns and
Amendments.

        (i) For any taxable period of the Companies that includes (but does not
end on) the Closing Date, Purchaser shall timely prepare and file with the
appropriate authorities all Tax Returns required to be filed and shall pay all
Taxes due with respect to such Tax Returns; provided that, with respect to such
Tax Returns, (A) Sellers shall reimburse Purchaser for any amount owed by
Sellers pursuant to Section 9.5(a)(i) and the last sentence of this paragraph,
and (B) except to the extent reflected as an asset on Final Working Capital,
Purchaser shall reimburse Sellers for any overpayment of Taxes (determined in
accordance with Section 9.5(a)(iv)), including by reason of the payment of any
estimated Taxes or otherwise, paid by Sellers to the extent such overpayment is
not governed by Section 9.5(f). All such Tax Returns shall be prepared on a
basis consistent with past practice, except as required by law. Purchaser shall
furnish such Tax Returns to Sellers for their approval (which approval shall not
be unreasonably delayed or withheld) at least twenty (20) days prior to the due
date for filing such Tax Returns, and Sellers shall remit to Purchasers the
amount of Taxes that is the responsibility of Sellers with respect to such Tax
Return at least three (3) days prior to such due date.

        (ii) For any Pre-Closing Tax Period, Sellers shall timely prepare and
Purchaser or Sellers, as appropriate, shall timely file with the appropriate
authorities all Tax Returns required to be filed. All such Tax Returns shall be
prepared on a basis consistent with past practice, except as required by law,
and not in a manner designed to defer income to the period for which the
Purchaser is liable or accelerate deductions into a period for which Seller is
liable. Purchaser shall timely furnish tax workpapers to Sellers upon request in
accordance with Sellers' past custom and practice. Taxes due with respect to
such Tax Returns shall be the responsibility of Sellers and/or Purchaser as
determined under Section 9.5(a). Any Tax Return to be filed by Purchaser or a
Company shall be furnished by Sellers to Purchaser or the appropriate Company,
as the case may be, for signature and filing at least twenty (20) days prior to
the due date for filing such Tax Return and Purchaser or applicable Company, as
the case may be, shall promptly sign and timely file any such Tax Return, unless
(x) such Tax Return reflects a position not previously taken on Tax Returns in
prior taxable periods and such position could reasonably be expected to have an
adverse effect on the Purchaser or the Companies in a taxable period beginning
after the Closing Date, or (y) there is no reasonable basis for the Tax
treatment of any material item reported on such Tax Return. Purchaser and
Sellers agree to cause the Companies to file all Tax Returns for the period
including the Closing Date on the basis that the relevant taxable period ended
as of the close of business on the Closing Date, unless the relevant Taxing
Authority will not accept a Tax Return filed on that basis.


                                       50
<PAGE>

        (iii) Sellers shall be responsible for filing any amended consolidated,
combined or unitary Tax Returns with respect to which Pactiv is the parent of
the consolidated, combined or unitary Tax group for any Pre-Closing Tax Period.
For those jurisdictions in which separate Tax Returns are filed by the
Companies, any amended Tax Returns shall be prepared by Sellers and furnished to
Purchaser or the Companies, as the case may be, at least twenty (20) days prior
to the due date for filing such amended Tax Returns, and Purchaser or applicable
Company, as the case may be, shall promptly sign and timely file any such
amended Tax Return, unless (x) such amended Tax Return could reasonably be
expected to have an adverse effect on the Purchaser or the Companies in a
taxable period (or portion thereof) beginning after the Closing Date, or (y)
there is no reasonable basis for the Tax treatment of any material item reported
on such amended Tax Return. All amended returns filed pursuant to this paragraph
shall be prepared on a basis consistent with past practice, except as required
by law.

        (d) Cooperation.

        (i) Each of Sellers, the Companies, and Purchaser shall reasonably
cooperate, and shall cause their respective Affiliates, officers, employees,
agents, auditors and representatives reasonably to cooperate, in preparing and
filing all Tax Returns, including maintaining and making available to each other
all records necessary in connection with Taxes and in resolving all disputes and
audits with respect to all taxable periods.

        (ii) Such cooperation shall include the retention and, at the time and
place mutually agreed upon by the parties, the provision of records and
information that are reasonably relevant to any such audit, litigation or other
proceeding and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to
provide additional information and explanation of any material provided
hereunder, to the extent such information and/or explanation is readily
available and within the control of the party to which such request is made. The
responsibility to retain records and information shall include the
responsibility to (i) retain such records and information as are required to be
retained by any applicable Taxing Authority, and (ii) retain such records and
information in machine-readable format where appropriate (to the extent such
records and information are in such format as of the Closing Date) such that the
requesting party shall be able to readily access such records and information.
Purchaser and Sellers shall (i) retain all books and records with respect to Tax
matters pertinent to each of the Companies relating to any taxable period
beginning before the Closing Date until the expiration of the statute of
limitations (and, to the extent notified by Purchaser or Sellers, any extensions
thereof) of the respective taxable periods, and to abide by all record retention
arrangements entered into with any Taxing Authority, and (ii) give the other
party reasonable written notice prior to transferring, destroying or discarding
any such books and records and, if the other party so requests, Purchaser, or
Seller, as the case may be, shall allow the other party to take possession of
such books and records at its sole cost and expense. Any information or
explanation obtained pursuant to this Section 9.5(d)(ii) ------------------
shall be maintained in confidence, except (i) as may be legally required in
connection with claims for refund or in conducting or defending any Tax audit or
other proceeding, (ii) to the extent the disclosing party provides written
permission for such disclosure, or (iii) to the extent such information relates
to the tax structure or tax treatment of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

                                       51
<PAGE>

        (e) Section 338(g). Purchaser shall not be permitted to make an election
pursuant to Section 338(g) of the Code with respect to any Company that is not a
U.S. person within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code.

        (f) Refunds and Credits.

                (i) If Purchaser receives a refund or credit with respect to
        Taxes arising in the a Pre-Closing Tax Period, Purchaser shall pay
        within the 30 days following the receipt of such Tax refund, net of any
        Tax costs of the receipt of such refund, the amount of such Tax refund
        to Sellers, except to the extent that such refund or credit is reflected
        as an asset on Final Working Capital.

                (ii) If a Seller receives a Tax refund with respect to Taxes
        arising in any Post-Closing Tax period, within 30 days following the
        receipt of such Tax refund, such Seller will pay the amount of such Tax
        refund to Purchaser, net of any Tax costs of the receipt of such refund.

                (iii) Any refunds or credits of Taxes of the Companies for any
        Straddle Period shall be equitably apportioned between Sellers and
        Purchaser in accordance with Section 9.5(a)(iii). Purchaser shall, at
        Sellers' reasonable request and at Sellers' expense, file for and obtain
        any refunds or credits, or cause the Companies to file for and obtain
        any refunds or credits, to which Sellers are entitled under this Section
        9.5(e). Purchaser shall permit Sellers to control the prosecution of any
        such refund claim insofar as they relate to a Pre-Closing Tax Period.

                (iv) Purchaser shall cause each Company to elect, where
        permitted by applicable Law, to carry forward any Tax asset loss or
        credit arising in a Post-Closing Tax Period that would, absent such
        election, be carried back to a Pre-Closing Tax Period in which the
        Company was included in a consolidated, combined or unitary return with
        Sellers or their Affiliates other than the Companies.

                (v) To the extent that any Tax loss or credit of a Company
        arising in a Post-Closing Tax Period is required to be carried back
        under local tax law to a Pre-Closing Tax Period that was reflected in a
        consolidated, combined or unitary Tax Return that included a Company and
        Seller or their Affiliates (other than the Companies) , and such
        carryback results in a tax refund of Taxes arising in the Pre-Closing
        Tax Period such refund shall be for the benefit of Purchaser, provided,
        however that (a) such refund shall be for the benefit of Sellers to the
        extent of amounts previously paid by Sellers on account of Taxes
        pursuant to this Section 9.5 (net of amounts received by Sellers on
        account of Taxes pursuant to this Section 9.5) and (b) to the extent any
        such refund is received by Purchaser or its Affiliates, including any
        Company, such refund shall reduce the amount of any indemnity payment to
        be made by Sellers on account of Taxes pursuant to this Section 9.5.

                                       52
<PAGE>

                (vi) Any tax loss or credit arising in a Pre-Closing Tax Period
        will be available to the Seller to reduce any tax liability in the
        Pre-Closing Tax Period as a result of a tax audit or any other
        adjustment to the tax liability in the Pre-Closing Tax Period.

        9.6 Remedial Actions.

        (a) Indemnification Procedures.

        (i) Pactiv shall have the right, but not the obligation, to conduct and
control the management of a Remedial Action subject to indemnification pursuant
to this Article IX, at any Company Property. Pactiv must notify Purchaser,
within 30 days of receipt of notice of Purchaser's claim for indemnification for
such matter, that (i) Pactiv intends to undertake such responsibility, or (ii)
that more information is needed from Purchaser before Pactiv can reasonably
determine that Purchaser's claim is subject to indemnification pursuant to this
Agreement. Purchaser shall promptly respond to such requests for information (to
the extent such information is reasonably available to Purchaser) and, within 30
days of receipt of such information, Pactiv shall notify Purchaser as to whether
it shall undertake the Remedial Action. Prior to a determination by Pactiv that
it will undertake a Remedial Action pursuant to this Section 9.6(a), Purchaser
shall take only those actions necessary to comply with applicable Environmental
Laws or address conditions that pose a threat to human health or the environment
(unless additional actions are approved by Pactiv).

        (ii) In undertaking a Remedial Action pursuant to this Section 9.6,
Pactiv shall retain a qualified independent and nationally or internationally
recognized environmental consultant, which consultant shall be subject to
Purchaser's approval (such approval not to be unreasonably delayed or withheld).
Pactiv shall undertake such Remedial Action in a prompt and expeditious fashion
and shall not cause, through its own inaction, any undue delay in obtaining
written notice from the appropriate Governmental Body that no further
investigation or remediation is necessary under Environmental Laws with respect
to the matter that is the subject of the indemnification claim or, provided no
Governmental Body is required by applicable Environmental Laws to be involved in
such matter, a good faith determination subject to Purchaser's approval (such
approval not to be unreasonably delayed or withheld) from Pactiv's environmental
consultant that no further investigation or remediation is required under
Environmental Laws. Pactiv shall comply with all applicable Laws, including all
applicable Environmental Laws, with respect to its performance pursuant to this
Section 9.6. Pactiv shall provide copies to Purchaser of all written notices,
draft and final submissions, plans, and reports and shall give Purchaser a
reasonable opportunity (at Purchaser's own expense) to comment in advance on any
submissions Pactiv intends to deliver or submit to the appropriate Governmental
Body prior to said submission. Pactiv shall indemnify and hold Purchaser
harmless from and against any Losses caused by Pactiv in exercising its rights
under this Section 9.6(a). Purchaser may, at its own expense, hire its own
consultants, attorneys or other professionals to participate in or monitor the
Remedial Action, including any field work undertaken by Pactiv, and Purchaser
shall provide Pactiv with the results of all such monitoring. Notwithstanding
the above, Purchaser shall not take any actions that shall unreasonably
interfere with Pactiv's performance of the Remedial Action. Pactiv shall
undertake any such work required herein in a manner designed to minimize any
disruption, to the greatest extent possible, of the conduct of operations at the
affected Company. Purchaser shall allow Pactiv reasonable access to conduct any
of the work contemplated herein and shall fully cooperate with Pactiv in the
performance of the Remedial Action, including providing Pactiv with reasonable
access to employees and documents as necessary.

                                       53
<PAGE>

        (iii) If Pactiv declines to undertake the performance of a Remedial
Action as provided in Section 9.6(a), Purchaser shall be entitled to undertake
the Remedial Action in a Commercially Reasonable Manner. Purchaser shall
promptly provide copies to Pactiv of all notices, correspondence, draft and
final reports, submissions, and work plans and shall give Pactiv a reasonable
opportunity (at Pactiv's own expense) to comment on any submissions Purchaser
intends to deliver or submit to any appropriate Governmental Body prior to said
submission. Pactiv may, at its own expense, hire its own consultants, attorneys
or other professionals to monitor the Remedial Action, including any field work
undertaken by Purchaser, and Pactiv shall provide to Purchaser the results of
all such field work. Notwithstanding the above, Pactiv shall not take any
actions that shall unreasonably interfere with Purchaser's performance of the
Remedial Action. Pactiv's decision to allow Purchaser to undertake Remedial
Action hereunder shall not limit or affect Pactiv's obligation to indemnify
Purchaser for said Remedial Action to the extent conducted in a Commercially
Reasonable Manner.

        (iv) Pactiv's election to assume or not to assume control of the conduct
of the management of a Remedial Action under this Section 9.6 shall not expand
or diminish its indemnification obligations, if any, under Section 9.1 hereof
with respect to the matter underlying such Remedial Action.

        (b) Limitation on Indemnification for Remedial Action. Pactiv shall be
responsible for Losses incurred in connection with a Remedial Action only to the
extent necessary to meet the most commercially reasonable standard required by
applicable Environmental Law and consistent with the industrial/commercial use
of the applicable Company Property as of the Closing Date (determined from the
perspective of a reasonable business person acting without regard to the
availability of indemnification hereunder), provided such standard is acceptable
to the relevant Governmental Body making a claim for Remedial Action or with
jurisdiction over such Remedial Action ("Commercially Reasonable Manner") (it
being understood that, where applicable and appropriate, such Commercially
Reasonable Manner shall include (x) obtaining (i) a covenant not to sue or a no
further action letter or other release from a Governmental Body from an asserted
violation of, or liability under, Environmental Laws, or (ii) a release by an
unaffiliated third-party claimant, and/or (y) implementing risk-based remedies
or remedial standards, institutional or engineering controls or deed
restrictions on real property). Pactiv shall not be responsible for any Losses
incurred in connection with a Remedial Action to the extent such Losses arise
from or are exacerbated by negligent actions of Purchaser or Releases of
Hazardous Materials after the Effective Time. Further, Pactiv shall not be
responsible for Losses incurred in connection with a Remedial Action (xx) unless
such Remedial Action is required (i) by any Order of a Governmental Body or any
judgment in a Legal Proceeding (but excluding any such Order or judgment in any
Legal Proceeding brought by an affiliate or successor-in-interest of Purchaser
except to the extent any such Losses arising from such Order or judgment in a
Legal Proceeding would independently satisfy one of the conditions in
(xx)(i)-(iv), (yy) or (zz) of this Section 9.6); (ii) to respond to a condition
that presents a substantial and imminent endangerment to human health or the
environment; (iii) to avoid the issuance of an Order that has been threatened by
any Governmental Body; or (iv) to correct an on-going violation of Environmental
Laws; or (yy) unless otherwise approved by Pactiv; or (zz) if such Remedial
Action arises from or is caused by physically invasive tests or investigations
of soil, groundwater or other environmental media unless such tests or
investigations would satisfy the requirements of (xx) or (yy) above.

        9.7 Exclusive Remedies.

        (a) The respective remedies under Section 6.3(k) and Article IX of this
Agreement are the parties' exclusive remedies under this Agreement and the Local
Agreements, from and after the Closing Date, including without limitation, any
matter based on the inaccuracy, untruth, incompleteness or breach of any
representation or warranty of any party hereto contained herein or therein or
based on the failure of any covenant, agreement or undertaking herein or
therein, and the parties hereto hereby waive any claims with respect to any
other right of contribution or indemnity available against any indemnifying
party hereunder or thereunder in such capacity on the basis of Law or otherwise
beyond the express terms of this Agreement; provided, however, that this
exclusive remedy for damages does not preclude a party from bringing an action
for specific performance or other equitable remedy to require a party to perform
its obligations under this Agreement or any Seller Document or Purchaser
Document and provided further that nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to
constitute a waiver of any claims for remedies with respect to fraud. The
applicability of Article 7.17 of the Dutch Civil Code is hereby excluded.

        (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the liability
for indemnification of any indemnifying party under this Agreement shall not
exceed the actual damages of the party entitled to indemnification and shall not
otherwise include (other than in respect of third-party Claims) incidental,
consequential, indirect, special, punitive, exemplary or other similar damages.

        9.8 Adjustments for Insurance and Taxes. Any indemnification payable in
accordance with this Article IX shall be net of any (i) amounts actually
recovered (after deducting related costs and expenses) by the indemnified party
for the Losses for which such indemnification payment is made under any
insurance policy, warranty or indemnity from any Person other than a party
hereto, and (ii) Tax benefits actually realized by the indemnified party in
respect to any Losses for which such indemnification payment is made. Each party
agrees to use, and to cause the Companies to use, commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain the benefits of any insurance coverage, warranty, or indemnity
from any other party with respect to any matter that might give rise to a claim
for indemnification hereunder. Any indemnification payable in accordance with
this Article IX shall be increased on account of any Tax cost to the indemnified
party in connection with the receipt of such indemnification. Tax benefits and
Tax costs shall be determined based on positions taken by the Purchaser and the
Companies on their Tax Returns. The indemnifying party shall pay the indemnified
party if, and to the extent that, any such Tax benefit is finally determined not
to have been realized by the indemnified party. Likewise, in calculating the
applicability of the Deductible and the Cap, the Losses counted toward the
Deductible and the Cap shall be reduced by any recoveries received from
insurance to which the indemnifying party has access and any Tax benefits of the
indemnified party attributable to such Losses.

restrict or limit the general obligation at law of any party hereto to mitigate
any loss or damage which it may suffer in consequence of any breach by any other
parties hereto of the terms of this Agreement or any fact, matter, event or
circumstance giving rise to a Claim.

conflict between this Agreement and any Local Agreement or other document
executed in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, the terms of
this Agreement shall prevail. If the text of any documents is written in, or

of this Section 11.15 to the attention of any relevant court, tribunal,
arbitrator or expert.
