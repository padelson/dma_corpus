               AMENDED AND RESTATED AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

     THIS AMENDED AND RESTATED AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of
September 20, 2000 (this "Agreement"), is entered into by and among Metawave
Communications Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("Acquiror"), Malibu
Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of
Acquiror ("Sub"), and Adaptive Telecom, Inc., a California corporation
("Target").

                                   RECITALS

     A.   On September 5, 2000, Acquiror, Sub and Target entered into an
Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Prior Merger Agreement") through a
                                   ----------------------
transaction in which Sub will merge with and into Target, Target will become a
wholly owned subsidiary of Acquiror and the shareholders of Target will become
stockholders of Acquiror (the "Merger");

     B.   Each of Acquiror, Sub and Target deem it advisable and in the best
interests of each corporation and their respective stockholders and shareholders
that the Prior Merger Agreement be amended and restated in its entirety as set
forth herein.

     C.   The Boards of Directors of Acquiror, Sub and Target deem it advisable
and in the best interests of each corporation and their respective stockholders
and shareholders that Acquiror and Target combine their respective businesses
upon the terms and conditions set forth herein;

     D.   The combination of Acquiror and Target shall be effected by the terms
of this Agreement through a transaction in which Sub will merge with and into
Target, Target will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Acquiror and the
shareholders of Target will become stockholders of Acquiror (the "Merger");

     E.   For Federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the Merger shall
qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") and the regulations promulgated
thereunder;

     F.   For accounting purposes, it is intended that the Merger shall be
treated as a "purchase"; and

     G.   As a condition and inducement to Acquiror's willingness to enter into
this Agreement, certain Target shareholders holding no less than a majority of
the issued and outstanding Preferred Stock of Target and no less than a majority
of the issued and outstanding Common Stock of Target, have, concurrently with
the execution of this Agreement, executed and delivered Voting Agreements in the
form attached hereto as Exhibit A (the "Voting Agreements"), pursuant to which
                        ---------
such shareholders have, among other things, agreed to vote their shares of
Target capital stock in favor of the Merger and to grant Acquiror irrevocable
proxies to vote such shares.

     NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth below, the
parties agree as follows:

                                      -1-

                                  ARTICLE II

                           CONVERSION OF SECURITIES

     Section 2.1    Conversion of Capital Stock.  At the Effective Time, by
                    ---------------------------
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any
shares of capital stock of Target or capital stock of Sub:

             (a)    Capital Stock of Sub.  Each issued and outstanding share
                    --------------------
of the capital stock of Sub shall be converted into and become one fully paid
and nonassessable share of Common Stock, $0.001 par value, of the Surviving
Corporation.

             (b)    Cancellation of Acquiror-Owned and Target-Owned Stock.  Any
                    -----------------------------------------------------
shares of Series A Preferred Stock, $0.001 par value, of Target (the "Target
Preferred Stock"), or shares of Common Stock, $0.001 par value, of Target
("Target Common Stock", and together with the Target Preferred Stock, the
"Target Stock"), that are owned by Acquiror, Sub, Target or any other direct or
indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary (as defined below) of Acquiror or Target shall
be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist and no stock of Acquiror or
other consideration shall be delivered in exchange. As used in this Agreement,
the word "Subsidiary" means, with respect to any other party, any corporation or
other organization, whether incorporated or unincorporated, of which (i) such
party or any other Subsidiary of such party is a general partner (excluding
partnerships, the general partnership interests of which held by such party or
any Subsidiary of such party do not have a majority of the voting interest in
such partnership) or (ii) at least a majority of the securities or other
interests having by their terms ordinary voting power to elect a majority of the
Board of Directors or others performing similar functions with respect to such
corporation or other organization or a majority of the profit interests in such
other organization is directly or indirectly owned or controlled by such party
or by any one or more of its Subsidiaries, or by such party and one or more of
its Subsidiaries.

             (c)    Exchange Ratio.
                    --------------

                    (i)  Subject to Sections 2.2 and 2.4, each issued and
outstanding share of Target Common Stock (other than shares to be canceled in
accordance with Section 2.1(b) and any Dissenting Shares as defined in and to
the extent provided in Section 2.3) shall, by virtue of the Merger and without
any action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into the right to
receive a fraction of a fully paid and nonassessable share of Acquiror Common
Stock (as defined in Section 4.2) equal to the "Exchange Ratio", as defined in
and determined in accordance with the provisions of this Section 2.1(c). All
such shares of Target Common Stock, when so converted, shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to
exist, and each holder of a certificate representing any such shares shall cease
to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the shares
of Acquiror Common Stock to be issued in consideration therefor upon the
surrender of such certificate in accordance

                                      -3-
<PAGE>

with Section 2.4. The number of shares of Acquiror Common Stock to be issued to
each Target shareholder shall be determined by multiplying (1) the number of
shares of Target Common Stock held by such shareholder (or which will be held
immediately prior to the Effective Time by such shareholder upon the conversion
of its shares of Target Preferred Stock into Target Common Stock in accordance
with Section 2.1(f) and the Target Articles of Incorporation) by (2) the
Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole share.

               (ii)    For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Total
Consideration Shares" shall be equal to 5,500,000 shares of Acquiror Common
Stock, minus the result obtained by dividing (x) the amount by which Transaction
                                    --------
Expenses exceeds the Budgeted Amount (as defined in Section 9.3(b)) by (y) the
average of the last reported sales prices of Acquiror Common Stock on the Nasdaq
National Market for the ten (10) trading days immediately preceding the Closing
Date (the "Acquiror Average Stock Price"). The "Exchange Ratio" shall be equal
to the quotient determined by dividing (x) the Total Consideration Shares, by
                              --------
(y) the sum without duplication of (A) the number of shares of Target Common
Stock issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time, plus (B) the number of
                                                       ----
shares of Target Common Stock subject to issuance upon the exercise in full of
all Target Options issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time, whether vested or unvested, plus (C) the number of shares of Target Common
                                  ----
Stock issuable upon the conversion of all issued and outstanding shares of
Target Preferred Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time plus (D) the
                                                               ----
aggregate number of shares of Target Common Stock (if any) issuable upon the
exercise of any other outstanding right to acquire Target Common Stock or Target
Preferred Stock or the conversion thereof in each case outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time. In no event will the total number of shares of
Acquiror Common Stock issuable by Acquiror pursuant to the Merger (including
shares of Acquiror Common Stock issuable upon exercise of Target Options assumed
by Acquiror in the Merger) exceed the Total Consideration Shares. A schedule
setting forth the allocation of the Total Consideration Shares among each holder
of Target Stock and Target Options (or any other rights to acquire Target Common
Stock or Target Preferred Stock) based upon the capitalization of Target as of
the Effective Time will be prepared by Target and delivered to Acquiror prior to
the Closing Date.

               (iii)   If, on or after the date of this Agreement and prior to
the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Acquiror Common Stock or Target
capital stock shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a
different class by reason of any reclassification, split-up, stock dividend or
stock combination, then the Exchange Ratio shall be correspondingly adjusted.

          (d)  Target Stock Options. At the Effective Time, all then outstanding
               --------------------

               -----------------
subject to repurchase by Target in the event the holder thereof ceases to be
employed or retained by Target ("Target Restricted Shares") shall be converted
into Acquiror Common Stock on the same basis as provided in subsection (c) above
and shall be registered in such holder's name, but shall be held by the
Surviving Corporation or Acquiror pursuant to the existing agreements in effect

                                      -4-

Restricted Shares, together with a summary of the vesting schedules for such
shares, are identified on Schedule 2.1(e) of the Target Disclosure Schedule.

                  ----------------------
Preferred Stock to convert into Target Common Stock in accordance with the

     Section 2.2  Escrow Agreement.  At the Effective Time or such later time as
                  ----------------
determined in accordance with Section 2.3(b), Acquiror will, on behalf of the
holders of Target Common Stock, deliver to Chase Manhattan Trust Company, N.A.
(the "Escrow Agent") that number of shares of Acquiror Common Stock representing
seven and one-half percent (7.5%) of the Total Consideration Shares issued at
the Closing. Such shares shall be held in escrow on behalf of the persons who
are the holders of Target Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time
(the "Former Target Shareholders"), in accordance with the portion of Total
Consideration Shares allocable to each such Former Target Shareholder based upon
the Exchange Ratio ("Pro Rata Portion"). Such shares (collectively, the "Escrow
Shares") shall be held and applied pursuant to the provisions of an escrow
agreement (the "Escrow Agreement") to be executed pursuant to Section 7.6. All
calculations to determine the number of Escrow Shares to be delivered by each
Former Target Shareholder into escrow as aforesaid shall be rounded down to the
nearest whole share. The Escrow Shares shall be deposited with the Escrow Agent
and disbursed in accordance with Article X.

     Section 2.3  Dissenting Shares.
                  -----------------

             (a)  Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, any shares of Target Stock held by a holder who has exercised such
holder's appraisal rights in accordance with Chapter 13 of California Law, and
who, as of the Effective Time, has not effectively withdrawn or lost such
appraisal rights ("Dissenting Shares"), shall not be converted into or represent
a right to receive Acquiror Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.1, but the holder
of the Dissenting Shares shall only be entitled to such rights as are granted by
California Law.

             (b)  Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 2.3(a), if any
holder of shares of Target Stock who demands his appraisal rights with respect
to such shares under Section 2.1 shall effectively withdraw or lose (through
failure to perfect or otherwise) his rights to receive payment for the fair
market value of such shares under California Law then, as of the later of the
Effective Time or the occurrence of such event, such holder's shares shall
automatically be converted into and represent only the right to receive Acquiror
Common Stock as provided in Section 2.1(c), without interest, upon surrender of
the certificate or certificates representing such shares; provided that if such
                                                          --------
holder effectively withdraws or loses his right to receive payment for the fair
market value of such shares after the Effective Time, then, at such time
Acquiror will deposit in the escrow created pursuant to the Escrow Agreement
additional certificates representing such holder's Pro Rata Portion of the
Escrow Shares.

                                      -5-

             (c)    Target shall give Acquiror (i) prompt notice of any written
demands for payment with respect to any shares of capital stock of Target
pursuant to Chapter 13 of California Law, withdrawals of such demands, and any
other instruments served pursuant to California Law, and received by the Target
and (ii) the opportunity to participate at its own expense in all negotiations
and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal rights under California
Law. Target shall not, except with the prior written consent of Acquiror,
voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal rights
with respect to Target Stock or offer to settle or compromise any such demands.

     Section 2.4    Exchange of Certificates.
                    ------------------------

             (a)    As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Acquiror
shall make available to each holder of Target Stock immediately prior to the
Effective Time a letter of transmittal in customary form (the "Letter of
Transmittal") and instructions for such holder's use in effecting the surrender
of the certificates or certificates evidencing Target Stock (the "Certificates")
and the exercise of the rights of such holder to obtain its Total Consideration
Shares.

             (b)    From and after the Effective Time, each holder of an
outstanding Certificate or Certificates shall have the right to surrender each
Certificate to Acquiror (or at Acquiror's option, an exchange agent to be
appointed by Acquiror), and receive promptly in exchange for all Certificates
held by such holder a certificate representing the number of whole shares of
Acquiror Common Stock (other than the Escrow Shares) into which the Target
Common Stock or Target Preferred Stock (if a certificate representing the number
of shares of Target Common Stock into which such Target Preferred Stock shall
have been converted pursuant to Section 2.1(f) shall not have been issued)
evidenced by the Certificates so surrendered shall have been converted pursuant
to the provisions of Article II of this Agreement. The surrender of Certificates
shall be accompanied by duly completed and executed Letters of Transmittal.
Until surrendered, each outstanding Certificate, which prior to the Effective
Time represented shares of Target Common Stock or Target Preferred Stock, shall
be deemed for all corporate purposes to evidence ownership of the number of
whole shares of Acquiror Common Stock into which the shares of Target Common
Stock have been converted but shall, subject to applicable appraisal rights
under California Law and Section 2.3, have no other rights. Subject to
applicable appraisal rights under California Law and Section 2.3, from and after
the Effective Time, the holders of shares of Target Stock shall cease to have
any rights in respect of such shares and their rights shall be solely in respect
of the Acquiror Common Stock into which such shares of Target Stock have been
converted. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the records of Target of shares of Target Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.

             (b)    If any shares of Acquiror Common Stock are to be issued in
the name of a person other than the person in whose name the Certificate(s)
surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a condition to the
issuance of such shares that (i) the Certificate(s) so surrendered shall be
transferable, and shall be properly assigned, endorsed or accompanied by
appropriate stock powers, (ii) such transfer shall otherwise be proper and (iii)
the person requesting such transfer shall pay Acquiror, or its exchange agent,
any transfer or other taxes payable by reason of the foregoing or establish to
the satisfaction of Acquiror that such taxes

                                      -6-
<PAGE>

have been paid or are not required to be paid. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
neither Acquiror nor Target shall be liable to a holder of shares of Target
Stock for shares of Acquiror Common Stock issuable to such holder pursuant to
the provisions of Article II of this Agreement that are delivered to a public
official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.

             (c)  In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, Acquiror shall issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the shares of Acquiror
Common Stock issuable in exchange therefor pursuant to the provisions of Article
II of the Agreement.  The Board of Directors of Acquiror may in its discretion
and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the owner of such
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate to provide to Acquiror an indemnity
agreement or bond against any claim that may be made against Acquiror with
respect to the Certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

     Section 2.5  Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares. No dividends
                  ------------------------------------------------
or other distributions declared or the holder of record of such Certificate
shall surrender such Certificate. Subject to the effect of applicable laws,
following surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be paid to the record
holder of the certificates representing whole shares of Acquiror Common Stock
issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) at the time of such
surrender, the amount of any dividends or other distributions with a record date
after the Effective Time which, but for the non-surrender of such Certificate,
would have been paid with respect to such whole shares of Acquiror Common Stock,
and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to surrender
and a payment date subsequent to surrender payable with respect to such whole
shares of Acquiror Common Stock.

     Section 2.6  Tax and Accounting Consequences.
                  -------------------------------

             (a)  It is intended by the parties hereto that the Merger shall
constitute a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368 of the Code.
The parties hereto adopt this Agreement as a "plan of reorganization" within the
meaning of Sections 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a) of the United States Income Tax
Regulations.

             (b)  It is intended by the parties hereto that the Merger shall
qualify for financial accounting treatment as a "purchase."

250,500 shares of Target Common Stock reserved for future issuance pursuant to
Target Options granted and outstanding as of the date of this Agreement under
the Target 1997 Stock Option Plan and no shares available for grant thereunder.
The Target 1997 Stock Option Plan is referred to herein as the "Target Stock
Option Plan."  The issued and outstanding shares of Target Common Stock and of
Target Preferred Stock are held of record by the shareholders of Target as set
forth and identified on Schedule 3.2(a) of the Target Disclosure Schedule.  The
issued and outstanding Target Options are held of record by the option holders

<PAGE>

authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. All outstanding shares
of Target Common Stock, Target Preferred Stock and outstanding Target Options
(collectively "Target Securities") were issued in compliance with applicable
federal and state securities laws. There are no obligations, contingent or
otherwise, of Target to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any shares of
Target Stock or make any investment (in the form of a loan, capital contribution
or otherwise) in any other entity. An updated Schedule 3.2(a) reflecting changes
permitted by this Agreement in the capitalization of Target between the date
hereof and the Effective Time shall be delivered by Target to Acquiror on the
Closing Date.

             (b)  Except as disclosed in Schedule 3.2, there are no equity
securities of any class or series of Target, or any security exchangeable into
or exercisable for such equity securities, issued, reserved for issuance or
outstanding.  Except as disclosed in Schedule 3.2, there are no options,
warrants, equity securities, calls, rights, commitments, understandings or
agreements of any character to which Target is a party or by which it is bound
obligating Target to issue, deliver or sell, or cause to be issued, delivered or
sold, additional shares of capital stock of Target or obligating Target to
grant, extend, accelerate the vesting of or enter into any such option, warrant,
equity security, call, right, commitment or agreement.  Except as set forth in
the Target Disclosure Schedule, Target is not in active discussion, formal or
informal, with any person or entity regarding the issuance of any form of
additional Target equity that has not been issued or committed to prior to the
date of this Agreement.  Except as provided in this Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents (as defined in Section 3.3(a)) or any transaction
contemplated hereby or thereby, there are no voting trusts, proxies or other
agreements or understandings with respect to the voting of the shares of capital
stock of Target.

             (c)  All Target Options and Restricted Target Stock have been
issued in accordance with the terms of the Target Option Plan and pursuant to
the standard forms of option agreement or stock purchase agreement, as the case
may be, previously provided to Acquiror or its representatives. Except as
disclosed on Schedule 3.2(a) and for such adjustments as are contemplated by
Section 6.4, no Target Option or Restricted Target Stock will by its terms
require an adjustment in connection with the Merger. Neither the consummation of
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents,
nor any action taken or to be taken by Target in connection with such
transactions will result in (i) any acceleration of vesting in favor of any
optionee under any Target Option or Restricted Target Stock; (ii) any additional
benefits for any optionee under any Target Option or Restricted Target Stock; or
(iii) the inability of Acquiror after the Effective Time to exercise any right
or benefit held by Target prior to the Effective Time with respect to any Target
Option or Restricted Target Stock assumed by Acquiror, including, without
limitation, the right to repurchase an optionee's unvested shares on termination
of such optionee's employment. The assumption by Acquiror of Target Options and
Restricted Target Stock in accordance with Section 6.5 hereunder will not (i)
give the optionees additional benefits which they did not have under their
options prior to such assumption (after taking into account the existing
provisions of the options, such as their respective exercise prices and vesting
schedules) and (ii) constitute a breach of the Target Option Plan or any
agreement entered into pursuant to such plan.

          (a)    Target has delivered to Acquiror copies of Target's unaudited
consolidated balance sheet as of July 31, 2000 (the "Most Recent Balance Sheet")

          (b)    The Target Financial Statements are in accordance with the
books and records of Target and present fairly in all material respects, subject

results of operations and cash flows of Target as of their historical dates and
for the periods indicated. The Target Financial Statements have been prepared in

were or are subject to normal and recurring year-end adjustments which were not
or are not expected to be material in amount).

the Most Recent Balance Sheet or that would not reasonably be required, in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles applied on a basis
consistent with prior periods, to be included in a balance sheet or the notes
thereto. All debts, liabilities, and obligations incurred after the date of the
Most Recent Balance Sheet were incurred in the ordinary course of business and
are not material both individually and in the aggregate to Target or its
business.

     Section 3.5 Tax Matters.
                 -----------

                                      -11-
<PAGE>

          (a)    For purposes of this Section 3.5 and other provisions of this
Agreement relating to Taxes, the following definitions shall apply:

                 (i)  The term "Taxes" shall mean all taxes, however
denominated, including any interest, penalties or other additions to tax that
may become payable in respect thereof, (A) imposed by any federal, territorial,
state, local or foreign government or any agency or political subdivision of any
such government, which taxes shall include, without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, all income or profits taxes (including but not limited to,
federal income taxes and state income taxes), payroll and employee withholding
taxes, unemployment insurance, social security taxes, sales and use taxes, ad
valorem taxes, excise taxes, franchise taxes, gross receipts taxes, business
license taxes, occupation taxes, real and personal property taxes, stamp taxes,
environmental taxes, ozone depleting chemicals taxes, transfer taxes, workers'
compensation, Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation premiums and other
governmental charges, and other obligations of the same or of a similar nature
to any of the foregoing, which are required to be paid, withheld or collected,
(B) any liability for the payment of amounts referred to in (A) as a result of
being a member of any affiliated, consolidated, combined or unitary group, or
(C) any liability for amounts referred to in (A) or (B) as a result of any
obligations to indemnify another person.

                 (ii) The term "Returns" shall mean all reports, estimates,
declarations of estimated tax, information statements and returns relating to,
or required to be filed in connection with, any Taxes, including information
returns or reports with respect to backup withholding and other payments to
third parties.

          (b)    All Returns required to be filed prior to the date hereof by or
on behalf of Target have been duly filed on a timely basis, and such Returns are
true, complete and correct in all material respects. All Taxes shown to be
payable on such Returns or on subsequent assessments with respect thereto, and
all payments of estimated Taxes required to be made prior to the date hereof by
or on behalf of Target under Section 6655 of the Code or comparable provisions
of state, local or foreign law, have been paid in full on a timely basis. No
Taxes are payable by Target with respect to items or periods covered by such
Returns (whether or not shown on or reportable on such Returns) in excess of the
reserves for Taxes on the Most Recent Balance Sheet, or reserves for Taxes that
have been established in the ordinary course of business for periods subsequent
to the date of the Most Recent Balance Sheet. Target has withheld and paid over
all Taxes required to have been withheld and paid over prior to the date hereof
, and complied with all information reporting and backup withholding
requirements, including maintenance of required records with respect thereto, in
connection with amounts paid or owing to any employee, creditor, independent
contractor, or other third party. There are no liens on any of the assets of
Target with respect to Taxes, other than liens for Taxes not yet due and payable
or for Taxes that Target is contesting in good faith through appropriate
proceedings and for which appropriate reserves have been established on the Most
Recent Balance Sheet. Target has not at any time been (i) a member of an
affiliated group of corporations filing consolidated, combined or unitary income
or franchise tax returns, or (ii) a member of any partnership or joint venture
for a period for which the statue of limitations for any Tax potentially
applicable as a result of such membership has not expired.

                                      -12-
<PAGE>

          (c)  The amount of Target's liability for unpaid Taxes (whether
actual or contingent) for all periods through the date of the Most Recent
Balance Sheet does not, in the aggregate, exceed the amount of the accruals for
Taxes reflected on the Most Recent Balance Sheet, and the Most Recent Balance
Sheet reflects proper accrual in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles applied on a basis consistent with prior periods of all liabilities
for Taxes payable after the date of the Most Recent Balance Sheet attributable
to transactions and events occurring prior to such date. No liability for Taxes
has been incurred (or prior to Closing will be incurred) since such date other
than in the ordinary course of business.

          (d)  Acquiror has been furnished by Target with true and complete
copies of (i) relevant portions of income tax audit reports, statements of
deficiencies, closing or other agreements received by or on behalf of Target
relating to Taxes, and (ii) all federal and state income or franchise tax
Returns and state sales and use tax Returns for or including Target for all
periods since the inception of Target.

          (e)  The Returns of or including Target have never been audited by a
government or taxing authority, nor is any such audit in process, pending or, to
Target's knowledge, threatened. No deficiencies exist or have been asserted, and
Target has not received notice that it has not filed a Return or paid Taxes
required to be filed or paid. Target is neither a party to any action or
proceeding for assessment or collection of Taxes, nor has such event been
asserted or threatened against Target or any of its assets. No waiver or
extension of any statute of limitations is in effect with respect to Taxes or
Returns of Target. Target has disclosed on its federal and state income and
franchise tax Returns all positions taken therein that could give rise to a
substantial understatement penalty within the meaning of Code Section 6662 or
comparable provisions of applicable state, local, foreign or other tax laws.

          (f)  Except as may be required as a result of the Merger, Target
will not be required to include any material adjustment in Taxable income for
any Tax period (or portion thereof) after the Closing Date pursuant to Section
481 of the Code or any comparable provision under state or foreign Tax laws as a
result of transactions, events or accounting methods employed prior to the
Closing.

          (g)  Target is not, nor has it ever been, a party to any tax sharing
agreement.

          (h)  Target is not, nor has it been, a United States real property
holding corporation within the meaning of Section 897(c)(2) of the Code during
the applicable period specified in Section 897(c)(1)(A)(ii) of the Code, and
Acquiror is not required to withhold tax by reason of Section 1445 of the Code.
Target is not a "consenting corporation" under Section 341(f) of the Code. Other
than as set forth on Schedule 3.5 of the Target Disclosure Schedule, Target has
not entered into any compensatory agreements with respect to the performance of
services which payment thereunder would result in a nondeductible expense to
Target pursuant to Section 280G of the Code or an excise tax to the recipient of
such payment pursuant to Section 4999 of the Code. Target is not, nor has it
been, a "reporting corporation" subject to the information reporting and record
maintenance requirements of Section 6038A and the regulations thereunder. Target
is in compliance with the terms and conditions of any applicable tax exemptions,
agreements or orders of any foreign government to which it may be

                                      -13-

subject or which it may have claimed, and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement will not have any adverse effect on such compliance.

free and clear of all mortgages, liens, pledges, charges or encumbrances of any
kind or character, except the lien of current taxes not yet due and payable and
minor imperfections of and encumbrances on title, if any, as do not materially

affected thereby. The equipment of Target used in the operation of its business
is, taken as a whole, (i) adequate for the business conducted by Target and (ii)
in good operating condition and repair, ordinary wear and tear excepted. All
personal property leases to which Target is a party are valid, binding,
enforceable against the parties thereto and in effect in accordance with their
respective terms, except to the extent that enforceability may be limited by
applicable bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, moratorium, or other laws
affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and by principles of
equity, regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding
at law or in equity. To the knowledge of Target, there is not under any of such
leases any existing default or event of default or event which, with notice or
lapse of time or both, would constitute a default by Target. The Target
Disclosure Schedule contains a description of all items of personal property

including such Web sites, the "Target Products"), free and clear of all liens,
claims and encumbrances (including without limitation, licensing and
distribution rights) (all of which rights are referred to as "Target Proprietary
Rights"). The Target Disclosure Schedule contains an accurate and complete (i)
list of all patents (with separate listings of issued and pending patents),
trademarks (with separate listings of registered and unregistered trademarks),
trade names, Internet domain names and registered copyrights in or related to

all applications and registration statements therefor, including the
jurisdictions in which each such Target Proprietary Right has been issued or
registered or in which any such application of such issuance and registration
has been filed, (ii) list of all licenses and other agreements with third
parties (the "Third Party Licenses") relating to any material patents,
copyrights, trade secrets, software, inventions, technology, know-how, processes
or other proprietary rights that Target is licensed or otherwise authorized by
such third parties to use, market, distribute or incorporate in Target Products
(such patents, copyrights, trade secrets, software, inventions, technology,
know-how, processes or other proprietary rights are collectively referred to as
the "Third Party Technology"), (iii) list of all licenses and other agreements
with third parties relating to any material information, compilations, data
lists or databases that Target is licensed or otherwise authorized by such third
parties to use, market, disseminate distribute or incorporate in Target Products

and effect, and consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
will not alter or impair any such rights. No claims have been asserted or
threatened against Target (and Target is not aware of any claims which are
likely to be asserted or threatened against Target or which have been asserted
or threatened against others relating to Target Proprietary Rights or Target
Products) by any person challenging Target's use, possession, manufacture, sale
or distribution of Target Products under any Target Proprietary Rights
(including, without limitation, the Third Party Technology) or challenging or
questioning the validity or effectiveness of any material license or agreement
relating thereto (including, without limitation, the Third Party Licenses) or
alleging a violation of any person's or entity's privacy, personal or
confidentiality rights. Target knows of no valid basis for any claim of the type
specified in the immediately preceding sentence which could in any material way
relate to or interfere with the continued enhancement and exploitation by Target

                                      -16-
<PAGE>

Products or any portion thereof. Except with respect to the rights of third
parties to the Third Party Technology, no third party has any express right to
reproduce, distribute, market or exploit any works or materials of which any of
the Target Products are a "derivative work" as that term is defined in the
United States Copyright Act, Title 17, U.S.C. Section 101.

          (c)    All material designs, drawings, specifications, source code,
object code, scripts, documentation, flow charts, diagrams, data lists,
databases, compilations and information incorporating, embodying or reflecting
any of the Target Products at any stage of their development (the "Target

employees of Target without the assistance of any third party or entity or were
created by third parties who assigned ownership of their rights to Target by
means of valid and enforceable confidentiality and invention assignment
agreements, copies of which have been delivered to Acquiror. Target has at all
times used commercially reasonable efforts customary in its industry to treat
the Target Proprietary Rights related to Target Products and Target Components
as containing trade secrets and has not disclosed or otherwise dealt with such
items in a manner intended or reasonably likely to cause the loss of such trade
secrets by release into the public domain.

          (d)    No employee, contractor or consultant of Target is in violation
in any material respect of any term of any written employment contract, patent
disclosure agreement or any other written contract or agreement relating to the
relationship of any such employee, consultant or contractor with Target or any
other party because of the nature of the business conducted by Target or
proposed to be conducted by Target. Schedule 3.8(d) of the Target Disclosure
Schedule lists all employees, contractors and consultants who have participated
in any way in the development of any material portion of the Target Products or
the Target Proprietary Rights.

Schedule, each person presently or previously employed by Target (including
independent contractors, if any) has executed a confidentiality, non-disclosure
and proprietary inventions assignment agreement pursuant to the form of
agreement previously provided to Acquiror or its representatives.

          (f)    No product liability or warranty claims have been communicated
in writing to or threatened against Target.

          (g)    Target is not aware of any material unauthorized use,
disclosure, infringement or misappropriation of any Target Proprietary Rights,
or any Third Party Technology to the extent licensed by or through Target, by
any third party, including any employee, former employee or independent
contractor of Target. Target has not entered into any agreement to indemnify any
other person against any charge of infringement of any Target Proprietary Rights
or any other rights.

          (h)    Target has taken all steps customary and reasonable in its
industry to protect and preserve the confidentiality and proprietary nature of
all Intellectual Property and other confidential information not otherwise
protected by patents, patent applications or copyright.

     Section 3.9  Employee Benefit Plans.
                  ----------------------

          (a)     The Target Disclosure Schedule lists, with respect to Target
and any trade or business (whether or not incorporated) which is treated as a
single employer with Target (an "ERISA Affiliate") within the meaning of Section
414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code, (i) all employee benefit plans (as defined
in Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as
amended ("ERISA"), (ii) each loan to a non-officer employee, loans to officers
and directors and any stock option, stock purchase, phantom stock, stock
appreciation right, supplemental retirement, severance, sabbatical, medical,
dental, vision care, disability, employee relocation, cafeteria benefit (Code
Section 125) or dependent care (Code Section 129), life insurance or accident
insurance plans, programs or arrangements, (iii) all bonus, pension, profit
sharing, savings, deferred compensation or incentive plans, programs or
arrangements, (iv) other fringe or employee benefit plans, programs or
arrangements that apply to senior management of Target and that do not generally
apply to all employees, and (v) any current or former employment or executive
compensation or severance agreements, written or otherwise, for the benefit of,
or relating to, any present or former employee, consultant or director of Target
as to which (with respect to any of items (i) through (v) above) any potential
liability is borne by Target (together, the "Target Employee Plans").

          (b)     Target has made available to Acquiror or its representatives a
copy of each of the Target Employee Plans and related plan documents (including
trust documents, insurance policies or contracts, employee booklets, summary
plan descriptions and other authorizing documents, and, to the extent still in
its possession, any material employee communications relating thereto) and has,
with respect to each Target Employee Plan which is subject to ERISA reporting
requirements, provided copies of any Form 5500 reports filed for the last plan
year. Any Target Employee Plan intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of
the Code has either obtained from the Internal Revenue Service a favorable
determination letter as to its qualified status under the Code, including all
amendments to the Code effected by the Tax Reform Act of 1986 and subsequent
legislation, or may timely make application to the Internal Revenue Service for
such a determination letter prior to the expiration of the requisite period
under applicable Treasury Regulations or Internal Revenue Service pronouncements
in which to apply for such determination letter and to make any amendments
necessary to obtain a favorable determination. Target has also furnished
Acquiror with the most recent Internal Revenue Service determination letter
issued with respect to each such Target Employee Plan, and nothing has occurred
since the issuance of each such letter which could reasonably be expected to
cause the loss of the tax-qualified status of any Target Employee Plan subject
to Code Section 401(a).

          (c)     Except as set forth in the Target Disclosure Schedule, (i)
none of the Target Employee Plans promises or provides retiree medical or other
retiree welfare benefits to any person, except as may be required by law; (ii)
there has been no "prohibited transaction," as such term is defined in Section
406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code, with respect to any Target Employee
Plan that will result in a material effect on the financial statements of
Acquiror; (iii) each Target Employee Plan has been administered in accordance
with its terms and in material compliance with the requirements prescribed by
any and all statutes, rules and regulations (including ERISA and the Code), and
Target and each subsidiary or ERISA Affiliate have performed all material
obligations required to be performed by them under, are not in any material
respect in default, under or violation of, and have no knowledge of any material
default

                                      -18-
<PAGE>

or violation by any other party to, any of the Target Employee Plans; (iv)
neither Target nor any subsidiary or ERISA Affiliate is subject to any liability
or penalty under Sections 4976 through 4980 of the Code or Title I of ERISA with
respect to any of the Target Employee Plans; (v) all contributions required to
be made by Target or any subsidiary or ERISA Affiliate to any Target Employee
Plan have been made on or before their due dates and a reasonable amount has
been accrued for contributions to each Target Employee Plan for the current plan
years; (vi) with respect to each Target Employee Plan, no "reportable event"
within the meaning of Section 4043 of ERISA (excluding any such event for which
the thirty (30) day notice requirement has been waived under the regulations to
Section 4043 of ERISA) nor any event described in Section 4062, 4063 or 4041 of
ERISA has occurred; and (vii) no Target Employee Plan is covered by, and neither
Target nor any subsidiary or ERISA Affiliate has incurred or expects to incur
any material liability under Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code. With
respect to each Target Employee Plan subject to ERISA as either an employee
pension plan within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA or an employee welfare
benefit plan within the meaning of Section 3(1) of ERISA, Target has prepared in
good faith and timely filed all requisite governmental reports (which were true
and correct as of the date filed) and has properly and timely filed and
distributed or posted all notices and reports to employees required to be filed,
distributed or posted with respect to each such Target Employee Plan, except as
would not have a material effect on the financial statements of Acquiror. No
suit, administrative proceeding, action or other litigation has been brought, or
to the knowledge of Target is threatened, against or with respect to any such
Target Employee Plan, including any audit or inquiry by the IRS or United States
Department of Labor. Neither Target nor any ERISA Affiliate is a party to, or
has made any contribution to or otherwise incurred any obligation under, any
"multi-employer plan" as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA.

          (d)    With respect to each Target Employee Plan, Target has complied
with (i) the applicable health care continuation and notice provisions of the
Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 ("COBRA") and the
proposed regulations thereunder, (ii) the applicable requirements of the Family
Leave Act of 1993 and the regulations thereunder, and (iii) the applicable
requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996
("HIPAA") and the temporary regulations thereunder, except as would not have a
material effect on the financial statements of Acquiror.

          (e)    The consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement will not (i) entitle any current or former employee or other service
provider of Target or any other ERISA Affiliate to severance benefits or any
other payment (including, without limitation, unemployment compensation, golden
parachute or bonus), except as expressly provided in this Agreement, or (ii)
accelerate the time of payment or vesting of any such benefits, or (iii)
increase or accelerate any benefits or the amount of compensation due any such
employee or service provider.

          (f)    There has been no amendment to, written interpretation or
announcement (whether or not written) by Target or other ERISA Affiliate
relating to, or change in participation or coverage under, any Target Employee
Plan which would materially increase the expense of maintaining such Plan above
the level of expense incurred with respect to that Plan for the most recent
fiscal year included in the Target Financial Statements.

prior to the Effective Time:

             (a)  by mutual written consent of Acquiror and Target;

other party, if a court of competent jurisdiction or other Governmental Entity

<PAGE>

             (d)  by Acquiror, by giving written notice to Target, if the
Closing shall not have occurred on or before September 25, 2000 by reason of the
failure of any condition precedent under Section 8.1 or 8.2 (unless the failure
results primarily from a breach by Acquiror of any representation, warranty, or
covenant of Acquiror contained in this Agreement or Acquiror's failure to
fulfill a condition precedent to closing or other default);

             (e)  by Target, by giving written notice to Acquiror, if the
Closing shall not have occurred on or before September 25, 2000 by reason of the
failure of any condition precedent under Section 8.1 or 8.3 (unless the failure
results primarily from a breach by Target of any representation, warranty, or
covenant of Target contained in this Agreement or Target's failure to fulfill a
condition precedent to closing or other default);

             (f)  by Acquiror, by giving written notice to Target, if the

shall not have been obtained by reason of the failure to obtain the required
consents or votes upon a vote taken by written consent or at a meeting of

is more than 33% higher than the relative decline in the Market Index Average,
calculated by comparing the Market Index Average to the Ten Day Market Index
Average.  For purposes of this Section 9.1:

(9) on the date of such calculation.

                  (B)  Ten Day Market Index Average means the quotient
calculated by dividing (i) the sum of the Market Index Average for the ten

void and there shall be no liability or obligation on the part of Acquiror,
Target, Sub or their respective officers, directors, stockholders or Affiliates,
except as set forth in Section 9.3 and except to the extent that such
termination results from the willful breach by any such party of any of its

             (b)  If the Merger is consummated, all legal, accounting,

the Escrow Fund in accordance with Section 10.4, provided that no such delivery
                                                 --------
may be made if the Securityholder Agent shall object in a written statement to

     Section 10.8  Resolution of Conflicts.

             (a)   In case the Securityholder Agent shall so object in writing
to any claim or claims by Acquiror made in any Officer's Certificate, Acquiror
shall have thirty (30) days to respond in a written statement to the objection
of the Securityholder Agent. If after such thirty (30) day period there remains
a dispute as to any claims, the Securityholder Agent and Acquiror shall attempt
in good faith for thirty (30) days to agree upon the rights of the respective
parties with respect to each of such claims. If the Securityholder Agent and
Acquiror should so agree, a memorandum setting forth such agreement shall be
prepared and signed by both parties and shall be furnished to the Escrow Agent.
The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely on any such memorandum and shall
distribute the Escrow Shares from the Escrow Fund in accordance with the terms
of the memorandum.

             (b)   If no such agreement can be reached after good faith
negotiation, either Acquiror or the Securityholder Agent may, by written notice
to the other, demand arbitration of the matter unless the amount of the damage
or loss is at issue in pending litigation with a third party, in which event
arbitration shall not be commenced until such amount is ascertained or both
parties agree to arbitration; and in either such event the matter shall be
settled by arbitration conducted by three arbitrators. Within fifteen (15) days
after such written notice is sent, Acquiror (on the one hand) and the
Securityholder Agent (on the other hand) shall each select one arbitrator, and
the two arbitrators so selected shall select a third arbitrator. The decision of
the arbitrators as to the validity and amount of any claim in such Officer's
Certificate shall be binding and conclusive upon the parties to this Agreement,
and notwithstanding anything in Section 10.4, the Escrow Agent shall be entitled
to act in accordance with such decision and make or withhold payments out of the
Escrow Fund in accordance with such decision.

             (c)   Judgment upon any award rendered by the arbitrators may be
entered in any court having jurisdiction. Any such arbitration shall be held in
Seattle, Washington under

                                      -44-
<PAGE>

the commercial rules then in effect of the American Arbitration Association. The
non-prevailing party to an arbitration shall pay its own expenses, the fees of
each arbitrator, the administrative fee of the American Arbitration Association,
and the expenses, including, without limitation, the reasonable attorneys' fees
and costs, incurred by the prevailing party to the arbitration.

                   --------------------

             (a)   In the event that the Merger is approved by Target's
shareholders, effective upon such vote, and without any further act of any
Target shareholder, Albert Jordan shall be constituted and appointed as agent

Former Target Shareholders to give and receive notices and communications, to
authorize delivery to Acquiror of the Escrow Shares or other property from the
Escrow Fund in satisfaction of claims by Acquiror, to object to such deliveries,
to agree to, negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of, and demand
arbitration and comply with orders of courts and awards of arbitrators with
respect to such claims, and to take all actions necessary or appropriate in the
judgment of the Securityholder Agent for the accomplishment of the foregoing.
All actions of the Securityholder Agent shall be taken jointly, not
individually. Such agency may be changed by the holders of a majority in
interest of the Escrow Shares from time to time upon not less than twenty (20)
days' prior written notice to Acquiror. No bond shall be required of the
Securityholder Agent, and the Securityholder Agent shall receive no compensation
for services. Notices or communications to or from the Securityholder Agent
shall constitute notice to or from each of the Former Target Shareholders.

             (b)   The Securityholder Agent shall not be liable for any act done
or omitted hereunder as Securityholder Agent while acting in good faith, and any
act done or omitted pursuant to the advice of counsel shall be conclusive
evidence of such good faith. The Former Target Shareholders shall severally and
pro rata, in accordance with their Pro Rata Portion, indemnify the
Securityholder Agent and hold harmless against any loss, liability or expense
incurred without gross negligence or bad faith on the part of the Securityholder
Agent and arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration
of duties under this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement.

             (c)   The Securityholder Agent shall have reasonable access to
information about Target and Acquiror and the reasonable assistance of Target's
and Acquiror's officers and employees for purposes of performing its duties and
exercising its rights under this Article X, provided that the Securityholder
                                            --------
Agent shall treat confidentially and not disclose any nonpublic information from
or about Target or Acquiror to anyone (except on a need to know basis to
individuals who agree to treat such information confidentially).

                   -----------------------------------
or instruction of the Securityholder Agent shall constitute a decision of all of
the Former Target Shareholders for whom shares of Acquiror Common Stock
otherwise issuable to them are deposited in the Escrow Fund and shall be final,
binding and conclusive upon each such Former Target Shareholder, and the Escrow
Agent and Acquiror may rely upon any decision, act, consent or instruction of
the Securityholder Agent as being the decision, act, consent or instruction of
each and every such Former Target Shareholder. The Escrow Agent and Acquiror

                                      -45-

are hereby relieved from any liability to any person for any acts done by them
in accordance with such decision, act, consent or instruction of the
Securityholder Agent.

     Section 10.11  Claims. In the event Acquiror becomes aware of a third-party
                    ------
claim which Acquiror believes may result in a demand against the Escrow Fund,
Acquiror shall promptly notify the Securityholder Agent of such claim, and the
Securityholder Agent and the Former Target Shareholders for whom shares of
Acquiror Common Stock otherwise issuable to them are deposited in the Escrow
Fund, shall be entitled, at their expense, to participate in any defense of such
claim; provided, however, Acquiror shall have the right in its sole discretion
to settle any such claim.

                   ----------------------------------------------
Agreement (including the documents and the instruments referred to herein), the

     Section 11.6  Governing Law; Jurisdiction. This Agreement shall be governed
                   ---------------------------
and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware without

and unconditionally consents and submits to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue

hereto, at any time before or after approval of matters presented in connection

of shareholders without obtaining such further approval. This Agreement may not
be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the
parties hereto.

the performance of any of the obligations or the other acts of the other parties
hereto, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the representations or warranties
contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (iii) waive
compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein. Any

they are entitled at law or in equity.

     Section 11.11  Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is held to
                    ------------
be illegal, invalid or unenforceable under any present or future law or
regulation, and if the rights or obligations of any party hereto under this
Agreement will not be materially and adversely affected thereby, (a) such
provision will be fully severable, (b) this Agreement will be construed and
enforced as if such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision had never
comprised a part hereof, (c) the remaining provisions of this Agreement will
remain in full force and effect and will not be affected by the illegal, invalid
or unenforceable provision or by its severance from this Agreement and (d) in
lieu of such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision, there will be added
automatically as a part of this Agreement a legal, valid and enforceable
provision as similar in terms to such illegal, invalid or unenforceable
provision as may be possible.
