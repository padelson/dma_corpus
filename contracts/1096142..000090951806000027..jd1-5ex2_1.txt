      EFFECT ON CAPITAL STOCK, COMPANY STOCK OPTIONS AND COMPANY WARRANTS;
      --------------------------------------------------------------------
                 PAYMENT AND ADJUSTMENT OF MERGER CONSIDERATION
                 ----------------------------------------------

           2.1. Effect on Capital Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holders of any shares of common
stock, par value $0.001, of the Company ("Company Common Stock"), any shares of
preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Company ("Company Preferred
Stock" and together with the Company Common Stock, the "Company Stock") or any
shares of capital stock of Merger Sub:

           (a) Capital Stock of Merger Sub. Each issued and outstanding share of
capital stock of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable
share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

           (b) Cancellation of Treasury Stock. Any shares of Company Stock that
are owned by the Company as treasury stock shall be automatically canceled and
shall cease to exist and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange
therefor.

           (c) Conversion of Company Stock.

                (i) Each issued and outstanding share of Company Stock
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Dissenting Shares pursuant
to Section 2.1(c)(iii) and shares to be canceled in accordance with Section
2.1(b)) shall be converted into the right to receive an amount, payable in
accordance with Section 2.2, equal to the Adjusted Final Total Merger
Consideration divided by the Total Company Share Amount (the "Merger
Consideration"). For purposes of this Agreement, (A) "Final Total Merger
Consideration" means the Estimated Total Merger Consideration plus or minus the
True-Up Amounts, (B) "Adjusted Final Total Merger Consideration" means the Final
Total Merger Consideration plus the aggregate exercise prices of all unexercised
Company Stock Options and Company Warrants, (C) the "Total Company Share Amount"
means, as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (and immediately prior to
any cancellation of Company Stock Options and Company Warrants pursuant to
Section 2.4), the sum of (1) the number of issued and outstanding shares of
Company Stock and (2) the number of shares of Company Stock issuable upon the
exercise of outstanding Company Stock Options and Company Warrants (whether or
not then vested or exercisable), and (D) the "Total Principal Share Amount"
means, as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (and immediately prior to
any cancellation of Company Stock Options and Company Warrants pursuant to
Section 2.4), the sum of (1) the number of issued and outstanding shares of
Principal Capital Stock and (2) the number of shares of capital stock issuable
upon the exercise of outstanding Principal Options and Principal Warrants
(whether or not then vested or exercisable). Annex A attached hereto sets forth
a complete list of all Securityholders and identifies those Securityholders who
are Principal Stockholders and/or Principal Securityholders.

<PAGE>
                (ii) As of the Effective Time, all shares of Company Stock
converted pursuant to clause (c)(i) above, shall no longer be outstanding and
shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a
certificate (or evidence of shares in book-entry form) which immediately prior
to the Effective Time represented any such shares of Company Stock (each, a
"Certificate") shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the
right to receive the Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of any fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to
Section 2.2, in each case to be issued or paid in consideration therefor upon
surrender of such Certificate in accordance with Section 2.3, without interest.

                (iii) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, shares of Company Stock that are issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time and which are held by a stockholder who did not vote
in favor of the Merger or consent thereto in writing and who is entitled to
demand and properly demands appraisal of such shares pursuant to, and who
complies in all respects with, the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL (the
"Dissenting Stockholders"), shall not be converted into or be exchangeable for
the right to receive the Merger Consideration (the "Dissenting Shares"). Instead
such holder shall be entitled to payment of the fair value of such shares in
accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL (and at the Effective
Time, such Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and such holder shall cease
to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the fair
value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262
of the DGCL), unless and until such holder shall have failed to perfect or shall
have effectively withdrawn or lost rights to appraisal under the DGCL. If any
Dissenting Stockholder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively
withdrawn or lost such right, such holder's shares shall thereupon be treated as
if they had been converted into and become exchangeable for the right to
receive, as of the Effective Time, the Merger Consideration for each such share,
in accordance with this Article II, without any interest thereon. The Company
shall give Parent (A) prompt notice of any written demands for appraisal of any
shares of Common Stock, attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other
instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company relating to
stockholders' rights of appraisal, and (B) the opportunity to participate in all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the
DGCL. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent,
voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle, or offer or agree to
settle, any such demand for payment.

           2.2. Payment of Merger Consideration.

           (a) Estimated Total Merger Consideration. The amount to be paid by
Parent at the Closing (the "Estimated Total Merger Consideration") is equal to
(i) $450,000,000 plus (ii) fifty percent (50%) of the transaction expenses and
debt prepayment expenses incurred by the Company in connection with the Merger,
up to a maximum of $4,000,000, less (iii) the amounts set forth on Schedule
2.2(a), less (iv) the Estimated Net Debt (as defined in Section 2.5(c) below)
plus or minus (v) the Estimated Working Capital Adjustment, if any (as defined
in Section 2.5(c) below). "Adjusted Estimated Total Merger Consideration" is
equal to the Estimated Total Merger Consideration plus the aggregate exercise
prices of all unexercised Company Stock Options and Company Warrants held by
Securityholders. Transaction expenses and debt prepayment expenses incurred by
the Company will be paid as of the Closing Date.

           (b) Payment of Liquidation Preference.

               (i) At the Closing, for each share of Company Preferred Stock to
          be converted pursuant to Section 2.1(c), Parent shall deliver to the
          holders of the Company Preferred Stock an amount in cash equal to (A)
          $3,600,000 (the "Liquidation Preference"), divided by (B) the number
          of shares of Company Preferred Stock and the number of shares of
          Company Stock subject to Company Warrants to be converted in the
          Merger; and

               (ii) At the Closing, for each Company Warrant to be terminated
          pursuant to Section 2.4, Parent shall deliver to the holders of the
          Company Warrants an amount in cash equal to (A) the Liquidation
          Preference, divided by (B) the number of shares of Company Preferred
          Stock and the number of shares of Company Stock subject to Company
          Warrants to be converted in the Merger, multiplied by (C) the number
          of shares of Company Stock subject to any such Company Warrants.

                (c) Conversion of Company Stock held by Principal Stockholders.
At the Closing, for each share of Company Stock to be converted pursuant to
Section 2.1(c), Parent shall deliver to such holder of Company Stock listed on
Annex A hereto and identified as a Principal Stockholder thereon (the "Principal
Stockholders" and together with the holders of Principal Warrants and Principal
Options, the "Principal Securityholders"), or, with respect to any amounts to be
deposited into escrow, to the Escrow Agent on behalf of each such Principal
Stockholder:

               (i) an amount in cash equal to (A) (1) eighty percent (80%) of
          the Estimated Total Merger Consideration less (2) the Liquidation
          Preference less (3) the aggregate amount of cash payable pursuant to
          Sections 2.2(e) and (f), plus (4) the aggregate exercise prices of all
          unexercised Company Stock Options and Company Warrants held by
          Principal Securityholders divided by (5) (a) the aggregate number of
          shares of Company Stock held by Principal Stockholders (the "Principal
          Capital Stock"), plus (b) the aggregate number of shares of Company
          Stock subject to Company Stock Options held by Principal
          Securityholders (such Company Stock Options, the "Principal Options"),
          plus (c) the aggregate number of shares of Company Stock subject to
          Company Warrants held by Principal Securityholders (such Company
          Warrants, the "Principal Warrants", collectively with the Principal
          Capital Stock and the Principal Options, the "Principal Securities")
          minus (B) (1) such Principal Stockholder's proportionate share (based
          on the Total Company Share Amount) of the Working Capital Reserve (as
          defined in Section 9.6), divided by (2) (a) the number of shares of
          Company Stock held by such Principal Stockholder, plus (b) the number
          of shares of Company Stock subject to Company Stock Options held by


                                       5
<PAGE>
          such Principal Stockholder, plus (c) the aggregate number of shares of
          Company Stock subject to Company Warrants held by such Principal
          Stockholder minus (C) (1) such Principal Securityholder's
          proportionate share (based on the Total Principal Share Amount) of
          $5,000,000 in cash (the "Cash Escrow Amount"), divided by (2) (a) the
          number of shares of Company Stock held by such Principal Stockholder,
          plus (b) the number of shares of Company Stock subject to Company
          Stock Options held by such Principal Stockholder, plus (c) the
          aggregate number of shares of Company Stock subject to Company
          Warrants held by such Principal Stockholder plus (D) any cash due to
          such Principal Stockholder in lieu of fractional shares that otherwise
          would have been issued under Section 2.2(c)(ii) in accordance with
          Section 2.2(h); and

               (ii) a number of validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable
          shares of common stock, par value $.10 per share, of Parent ("Parent
          Common Stock") equal to (A) (1) twenty percent (20%) of the Estimated
          Total Merger Consideration minus (B) (1) the Principal Stockholder's
          proportionate share (based on the Total Principal Share Amount) of a
          number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to $30,000,000 valued at
          the Parent Per Share Value (the "Stock Escrow Amount"), divided by (2)
          the number of shares of Company Stock held by such holder, divided by
          (C) the Parent Per Share Value minus (D) any cash due to such
          Principal Stockholder in lieu of fractional shares in accordance with
          Section 2.2(h), subject to adjustment in accordance with Section

          Common Stock (the "Parent Per Share Value") shall be equal to the
          average of the average per share closing price of Parent Common Stock
          on the Nasdaq (as reported by The Wall Street Journal, Eastern

          for (i) the ten (10) trading days ending with the second trading day
          immediately preceding the date hereof, and (ii) the ten (10) trading
          days ending with the second trading day immediately preceding the
          Closing Date, as equitably adjusted for any Organic Change to Parent
          Common Stock that occurs after the date hereof, but prior to the
          Effective Time.

           (d) Conversion of Company Stock Options and Company Warrants held by
Principal Securityholders. At Closing, for each Company Stock Option and Company
Warrant held by Principal Securityholders to be terminated pursuant to Section

behalf of such holder:

               (i) an amount in cash equal to (A) the excess of (1) (a) eighty
          percent (80%) of the Estimated Total Merger Consideration less (b) the

          Principal Securityholder's proportionate share (based on the Total
          Company Share Amount) of the Working Capital Reserve, divided by the


                                       6
<PAGE>
          number of shares of Company Stock subject to such Company Stock Option
          or Company Warrant held by such Principal Stockholder minus (4) such
          Principal Securityholder's proportionate share (based on the Total
          Principal Share Amount) of the Cash Escrow Amount, divided by the
          number shares of Company Stock subject to such Company Stock Option or
          Company Warrant held by such Principal Securityholder plus (5) any
          cash due to such Principal Securityholder in lieu of fractional shares
          that otherwise would have been issued under Section 2.2(d)(ii) in
          accordance with Section 2.2(h), multiplied by (B) the number of shares
          subject to such Company Stock Option or Company Warrant; and

               (ii) a number of validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable
          shares of Parent Common Stock equal to (A) the excess of (1) (a)
          twenty percent (20%) of the Estimated Total Merger Consideration,
          divided by (b) the number of shares of Company Stock subject to such
          Company Stock Option or Company Warrant, over (2) the per-share
          exercise price of such Company Stock Option or Company Warrant minus
          (3) such Principal Securityholder's proportionate share (based on the
          Total Principal Share Amount) of the Stock Escrow Amount, divided by
          the number of shares of Company Stock subject to such Company Stock
          Option or Company Warrant held by such Principal Securityholder,
          divided by (4) the Parent Per Share Value, minus (5) any cash due to
          such Principal Securityholder in lieu of fractional shares in
          accordance with Section 2.2(h), subject to adjustment in accordance

           (e) Conversion of Company Stock held by Securityholders (other than

Securityholders (other than the Principal Stockholders) or, with respect to any
amounts to be deposited into escrow, to the Escrow Agent on behalf of such
Securityholder, an amount in cash equal to (i) (A) the Adjusted Estimated Total
Merger Consideration, less (B) the Liquidation Preference, divided by (ii) the
Total Company Share Amount less (iii) such Securityholder's proportionate share
(based on the Total Company Share Amount) of the Working Capital Reserve,
divided by the number of shares of Company Stock held by such Securityholder. In
addition, Parent shall deliver to the Escrow Agent such Securityholder's
proportionate share (based on the Total Company Share Amount) of the Working
Capital Reserve.

           (f) Conversion of Company Stock Options held by Securityholders
(other than the Principal Securityholders). At Closing, for each Company Stock
Option to be terminated pursuant to Section 2.4 below, Parent shall deliver to
such holder (other than holders of Company Stock Options that are Principal
Securityholders) or, with respect to any amounts to be deposited into escrow, to
the Escrow Agent on behalf of such holder, an amount in cash equal to (i) the
excess of (A) (1) the Adjusted Estimated Total Merger Consideration, less (2)
the Liquidation Preference, divided by (3) the Total Company Share Amount, over
(B) the per-share exercise price of such Company Stock Option, multiplied by
(ii) the number of shares subject to such Company Stock Option minus (iii) such

of the Working Capital Reserve, divided by the number of shares of Company Stock
subject to Company Stock Options held by such Securityholder and to be converted
in the Merger.


                                       7
<PAGE>
           (g) Payment of True-Up Amounts. The True-Up Amounts, if any, owed
after the Closing by either Parent or the Securityholders under Section 2.5
shall be paid at such times and in such manner as provided for in Section
2.5(d).

           (h) Fractional Shares. No fractional shares of Parent Common Stock
shall be issued in the Merger. Each record holder of Principal Securities shall
be entitled to receive in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock
to which such holder otherwise would have been entitled pursuant to this
Agreement (after taking into account all shares of Principal Securities then
held of record by such holder) a cash payment in an amount equal to the product
of (i) the fractional interest in a share of Parent Common Stock to which such
holder otherwise would have been entitled and (ii) the Parent Per Share Value.

           (i) Withholding Taxes. Parent shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to a holder of Company Stock
or Company Warrants pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as may be required
to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the
Code, or under any provision of Tax Law. To the extent amounts are so withheld
and paid over to the appropriate Taxing Authority, Parent shall be treated as
though it withheld from the type of consideration from which withholding is
required, an appropriate amount otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to
any holder of Company Stock or Company Warrants in order to provide for such
withholding obligation and such withheld amounts shall be treated for the
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the former holder of Company
Stock or Company Warrants. If withholding is required from shares of Parent
Common Stock, Parent shall be treated as having sold such consideration for an
amount of cash equal to the fair market value of such consideration at the time
of such deemed sale and paid such cash proceeds to the appropriate Taxing
Authority.

           (j) Adjustments. If at the Effective Time, (x) the sum of (i) the
number of shares of Parent Common Stock delivered to the Principal
Securityholders or deposited into escrow pursuant to Section 2.2(c)(ii) and
(d)(ii) exceeds (y) twenty percent of the aggregate number of shares of Parent
Common Stock then issued and outstanding, then the number of shares of Parent
Common Stock delivered to the Principal Securityholders pursuant to Section
2.2(c)(ii) and (d)(ii) shall be reduced so that clause (x) above equals 19.9% of
clause (y) above and the amount of cash delivered to the Principal
Securityholders pursuant to Section 2.2(c)(i) and (d)(i) shall be increased
proportionately so the Principal Stockholders shall receive the same economic
effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such action.

           2.3. Delivery of Certificates.

           (a) Delivery Procedures. At the Effective Time or promptly
thereafter, each record holder of shares of Company Stock (other than Dissenting
Shares) shall surrender to Parent, all Certificates held by such holder which
immediately prior to the Effective Time evidenced issued and outstanding shares
of Company Stock. No interest shall accrue or be paid on any amount payable upon


                                       8
<PAGE>
surrender of the certificates. Parent shall distribute a letter of transmittal,
a form of Joinder Agreement and other customary documents to all stockholders of
record of the Company at least five (5) Business Days in advance of the
scheduled Closing Date. As promptly as practicable following surrender of a
Certificate to Parent, together with such letter of transmittal and the Joinder
Agreement, each duly executed, and such other customary documents as may be
required by applicable Laws, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration, paid in accordance with
Section 2.2. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, in
lieu of delivering such Certificate, a record holder may make an affidavit of
that fact claiming such Certificate is lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by Parent, post a bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct,
as indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent on account of the
alleged loss, theft or destruction of any such Certificate.

           (b) No Further Rights in Company Stock, Company Stock Option or
Company Warrant. All shares of Parent Common Stock issued and cash paid in
accordance with Section 2.2 upon conversion of the shares of Company Stock
(other than Dissenting Shares) and cancellation of the Company Stock Options and
the Company Warrants in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have
been issued or paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares
of Company Stock, such Company Stock Options and Company Warrants.

           (c) No Liability. Neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall
be liable to any holder of shares of Company Stock, Company Stock Option or
Company Warrant for any shares of Parent Common Stock (or dividends or
distributions with respect thereto) or any cash to be paid in accordance with
Section 2.2, which is delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

           2.4. Company Stock Options and Company Warrants.

           (a) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each then outstanding
warrant to purchase Company Preferred Stock (a "Company Warrant") and each then
outstanding option to purchase Company Common Stock (a "Company Stock Option"
and, together with the Company Warrants and the Company Stock, collectively, the
"Company Securities"), whether or not then exercisable, shall be cancelled by
the Company, and in consideration of such cancellation (and except to the extent
that Parent or Merger Sub and the holder of any such Company Warrant or Company
Stock Option otherwise agree), such holder shall be entitled to receive for each
Company Warrant or Company Stock Option an amount, payable in accordance with
Section 2.2, equal to (i) the excess of (A) Adjusted Final Total Merger
Consideration, divided by the Total Company Share Amount over (B) the per-share
exercise price of such Company Warrant or Company Stock Option multiplied by
(ii) the number of shares subject to such Company Warrant or Company Stock
Option.


                                       9

           (b) The Company shall take all actions necessary and appropriate so
that all stock option or other equity based plans maintained with respect to the
Company Stock (each, a "Company Stock Option Plan"), shall terminate as of the
Effective Time and the provisions in any other benefit plan providing for the
issuance, transfer or grant of any capital stock of the Company or any interest
in respect of any capital stock of the Company shall be deleted as of the
Effective Time, and the Company shall take all actions to ensure that following
the Effective Time no holder of a Company Warrant or a Company Stock Option or
any participant in any Company Stock Option Plan shall have any right thereunder
to acquire any stock of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving
Corporation.

           2.5. Merger Consideration Adjustment.

           (a) Set forth on Schedule 2.5(a)(i) is a reasonably detailed
calculation of the target $13,100,000 in working capital (the "Working Capital")
of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis as of the
Closing Date (the "Target Working Capital"), prepared in accordance with (i) the
books and records of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and (ii) the
accounting principles set forth in Schedule 2.5(a)(i) (the "Accounting
Principles"). For the avoidance of doubt, for purposes of this Agreement,
Working Capital shall not include cash or short-term Indebtedness.

           (b) For purposes of this Agreement, "Net Debt" shall mean the amount
of Indebtedness (including any prepayment penalty) of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis less the amount of cash held by the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Closing. For the
avoidance of doubt, any asset or liability included in the calculation of
Working Capital will not be included in the calculation of Net Debt so that the
calculation of Working Capital and Net Debt do not double count any asset or
liability.

           (c) At least two days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall
prepare and deliver to Parent a statement setting forth a reasonably detailed
calculation of the Company's good faith estimate of: (i) the Working Capital of
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis as of the
Closing Date (or, if the Closing Date occurs after February 28, 2006 and on or
before March 3, 2006, then such amount shall be calculated as of February 28,
2006) ("Estimated Working Capital") prepared in accordance with (A) the books
and records of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and (B) the Accounting
Principles; (ii) the amount by which Estimated Working Capital is greater than
or less than Target Working Capital (such amount, if and to the extent it
exceeds $1,000,000, the "Estimated Working Capital Adjustment") and (iii) the
Net Debt of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis as
of the Closing Date (the "Estimated Net Debt") prepared in accordance with (A)
the books and records of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and (B) the
Accounting Principles. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Parent disagrees with
such working capital calculations, then there shall not be an Estimated Working
Capital Adjustment.


                                       10
<PAGE>
           (d) Post-closing adjustment. Parent shall prepare and deliver to the
Stockholder Representative, within ninety (90) days following the Closing Date,
a statement (the "Closing Statement") setting forth a reasonably detailed
calculation of:

                (i) the Working Capital of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis (the "Final Working Capital") as of the
Closing Date (or February 28, 2006, as the case may be) prepared in accordance
with (A) the books and records of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and
(B) the Accounting Principles;

                (ii) the Net Debt of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries on
a consolidated basis (the "Final Net Debt") as of the Closing Date, prepared in
accordance with (A) the books and records of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries and (B) the Accounting Principles;

                (iii) the "Working Capital True-Up Amount", which for purposes
of this Agreement, shall be defined as follows: (A) to the extent that there was
an Estimated Working Capital Adjustment, the amount by which Final Working
Capital is greater than or less than Estimated Working Capital, or (B) to the
extent that there was not an Estimated Working Capital Adjustment, the amount by
which Final Working Capital is greater than or less than Target Working Capital
(provided that for purposes of (B) only, there shall only be a True-Up Amount if
and to the extent that such amount exceeds $1,000,000);

                (iv) an aggregate adjustment to the Estimated Total Merger
Consideration (such adjustment, the "Net Debt True-Up Amount", and together with
the Working Capital True-Up Amount, the "True-Up Amounts"), which may be
positive or negative, and which shall be equal to the Final Net Debt minus the
Estimated Net Debt.

           (e) The Stockholder Representative shall have thirty (30) days from
its receipt of the Closing Statement (the "Objection Period") to review the
Closing Statement. Parent shall grant the Stockholder Representative and his
Affiliates and representatives access at reasonable times and places and upon
reasonable advance notice to all books, records and employees of the Surviving
Corporation that is reasonably requested by the Stockholder Representative in
connection with his review of the Closing Statement. Upon the expiration of the
Objection Period, the Stockholder Representative, on behalf of all
Securityholders, shall be deemed to have accepted, and shall be bound by, the
Closing Statement and the calculation therein of the True-Up Amounts, unless the
Stockholder Representative shall have informed Parent in writing of its
disagreement with the Closing Statement prior to the expiration of the Objection
Period (the "Objection"), specifying each disputed item and setting forth in
reasonable detail the basis for each such dispute (each, a "Disputed Item").
Parent shall have thirty (30) days from the date on which it receives the
Objection (the date on which such thirty (30) day period ends, the "Response
Date") to review and respond to such Objection. If Parent and the Stockholder
Representative are able to negotiate a mutually agreeable resolution of each
Disputed Item, and each signs a certificate to that effect, the Closing
Statement and the calculation therein of the True-Up Amounts, as adjusted to


                                       11
<PAGE>
reflect such resolution, shall be deemed final, non-appealable and binding for
purposes of this Agreement. If within thirty (30) days of the Response Date any
Disputed Items have not been resolved, Parent and the Stockholder Representative
shall refer such Disputed Items to the New York office of Deloitte & Touche LLP
(the "Accounting Referee") (or if unable or unwilling to accept such mandate, an
independent accounting firm to be mutually agreed upon by the Stockholder
Representative and Parent) and who shall accept its appointment within seven (7)
days after such referral, to make a final, non-appealable and binding
determination as to such remaining Disputed Items pursuant to the terms hereof.
If Parent and the Stockholder Representative cannot agree on the selection of an
independent accounting firm to act as the Accounting Referee within sixty (60)
days of the Response Date, Parent and the Stockholder Representative shall
petition a court of competent jurisdiction, to appoint such an independent
accounting firm (which must be a nationally recognized accounting firm with
substantial experience with complex financial transactions of the type set forth
in this Agreement) and such appointment shall be conclusive and binding on the
Parties. The Accounting Referee shall be directed to make a determination in
accordance with Section 2.5(f) below of the Disputed Items promptly, but no
later than sixty (60) days, after acceptance of its appointment. Parent and the
Stockholder Representative agree to use their commercially reasonable efforts to
effect the selection and appointment of the Accounting Referee pursuant to this
Section 2.5(e), including executing an engagement agreement with the Accounting
Referee providing for reasonable and customary compensation and other terms of
such engagement. Parent and the Stockholder Representative shall make readily
available to the Accounting Referee all relevant books, records and employees of
the Company and the Surviving Corporation that are reasonably requested by the
Accounting Referee in connection with the Accounting Referee's review of any
Disputed Items; provided that Parent, the Stockholder Representative and their
respective Affiliates shall not be obligated to provide any information the
disclosure of which would jeopardize any privilege available to such Person
relating to such information or which would cause such Person to breach a
confidentiality obligation to which it is bound; and provided further that
Parent, the Stockholder Representative and their respective Affiliates shall use
their best efforts to minimize the effects of any such limitations.

           (f) If Disputed Items are referred to the Accounting Referee for
resolution pursuant to Section 2.5(e) above, the Accounting Referee (i) shall
determine only with respect to the Disputed Items submitted whether and to what
extent, if any, the True-Up Amounts set forth in the Closing Statement requires
adjustment, (ii) shall utilize the Accounting Principles without modification
and (iii) shall not assign a value to any item greater than the greatest value
for such item claimed by either Party or less than the smallest value for such
item claimed by either Party. Any finding by the Accounting Referee shall be a
reasoned award stating in reasonable detail the findings of fact on which it is
based, shall be final, non-appealable and binding upon the Parties and shall be
the sole and exclusive remedy between the Parties regarding the Disputed Items
so presented. The fees and expenses of the Accounting Referee shall be borne by
Parent and the Securityholders in the same proportion that the dollar amount of
Disputed Items which are not resolved in favor of Parent or the Securityholders,
as applicable, bears to the total dollar amount of Disputed Items resolved by
the Accounting Referee.


                                       12
<PAGE>
For illustration purposes only, (A) if the total amount of Disputed Items by the
Stockholder Representative is $1,000, and the Stockholder Representative, on
behalf of all Securityholders, is awarded $500 by the Accounting Referee, Parent
and the Securityholders shall bear the Accounting Referee's fees and expenses
equally; or (B) if the total amount of Disputed Items by the Stockholder
Representative is $1,000, and the Stockholder Representative, on behalf of all
Securityholders, is awarded $250 by the Accounting Referee, the Securityholders
shall bear seventy five percent (75%) and Parent shall bear twenty five percent
(25%) of the Accounting Referee's fees and expenses. Each of Parent and the
Securityholders shall bear the fees, costs and expenses of its own accountants
and all of its other expenses incurred in connection with matters contemplated
by this Section 2.5.

           (g) Payment of the True-Up Amounts.

                (i) Payment of the True-Up Amounts shall be made (i) if no
Objection is made by the Stockholder Representative during the Objection Period,
within five (5) Business Days following the expiration of the Objection Period
or (ii) if the Stockholder Representative submits an Objection within the
Objection Period, within five (5) Business Days following final resolution of
all Disputed Items by either Parent and the Stockholder Representative or the
Accounting Referee.

                (ii) If the True-Up Amounts, when added together, yield a
positive number, then Parent shall pay such net amount in cash to the
Securityholders in the same proportion as the payment of the Estimated Merger
Consideration pursuant to Section 2.2 hereof.

                (iii) If the True-Up Amounts, when added together, yield a
negative number, then the Securityholders shall pay such net amount to Parent in
accordance with the provisions of Section 9.6 hereof.

                (iv) In addition, if the True-Up Amounts, when added together,
yield a positive number, then the Escrow Agent shall release to the Stockholder
Representative for benefit of the Securityholders all cash in the Working
Capital Reserve in their proportionate share (based on the Total Company Share
Amount) of such amount. If the True-Up Amounts, when added together, yield a
negative number but less than the Working Capital Reserve, then the Escrow Agent
shall release to the Stockholder Representative for benefit of the
Securityholders all cash in the Working Capital Reserve Account in excess of the
net True-Up Amounts and such amounts shall be released to the Securityholders in
their proportionate share (based on the Total Company Share Amount) of such
amount.

                (v) Prior to payment being made in accordance with this Section
2.5, the True-Up Amounts shall be adjusted to include interest accruing on such
True-Up Amounts from and including the Closing Date through and including the
day before the date of such payment, at a per annum rate equal to the prime
lending rate as reported in The Wall Street Journal, Eastern Edition (under the
heading "Money Rates") as at the Closing Date, calculated on the basis of a year
of 365 days and the actual number of days elapsed.

of any Permit.

Business.

           (g) To the Company's Knowledge, no Trade Secret of the Company or any

           (i) To the Knowledge of the Company and the Principal
Securityholders, no Person is infringing, violating, misusing or
misappropriating any material Intellectual Property of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary, and no such claims have been made against any Person by the
Company or any Company Subsidiary. There are no Orders to which the Company is a
party or by which the Company is bound which restrict, in any material respect,
the right to use any of the Intellectual Property.

           (j) The consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will not
result in the loss or impairment of Parent's right to own or use any of the
Intellectual Property.

right, title, or interest, directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, in any

such employee's, consultant's or independent contractor's engagement by the
Company, in material default or breach of any material term of any employment
agreement, non-disclosure agreement, assignment of invention agreement or

Intellectual Property or Software of the Company to a third party.

           (n) The Company has complied in all material respects with all (i)
applicable Laws relating to privacy, data protection and the collection and use
of personal information and user information gathered or accessed in the course
of its operations and (ii) rules, policies and procedures established by the

           (b) Each of the Material Contracts is in full force and effect and is
the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company or any Company Subsidiary
which is party thereto, and, to the Knowledge of the Company, of the other
parties thereto enforceable against each of them in accordance with its terms,
except as enforcement may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally
and by general principles of equity (regardless of whether considered in a
proceeding in equity or at law) and, upon consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, shall, except as otherwise stated in Schedule
4.14(b), continue in full force and effect without material penalty or other
material adverse consequence. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is
in material default under any Material Contract, nor, to the Knowledge of the
Company, is any other party to any Material Contract in breach of or default
thereunder, and no event has occurred that with the lapse of time or the giving

any Company Subsidiary or any other party thereunder. No party to any of the

except in the Ordinary Course of Business, and no party has given notice of any

contribute thereunder for current or former employees of the Company or any of
the Company Subsidiaries (the "Employees") or to which the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries has any obligation or liability, contingent or otherwise
(collectively, the "Company Plans"). No Company Plan is an "employee pension
plan" (as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA and subject to Title IV of ERISA or
Section 412 of the Code (a "Title IV Plan"), nor does the Company have any
obligation or liability, contingent or otherwise, to a Title IV Plan, including
any "multiemployer plan" (as defined in Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA (a
"Multiemployer Plan")), or is or has been subject to Sections 4063 or 4064 of
ERISA.

           (b) Correct and complete copies of the following documents, with

<PAGE>
           (c) The Company Plans have been maintained in all material respects
in accordance with their terms and with all provisions of ERISA, the Code
(including rules and regulations thereunder) and other applicable Federal and
state Laws and regulations.

           (d) The Company Plans intended to qualify under Section 401 of the
Code have received a determination from the IRS that they are so qualified and
any trusts intended to be exempt from Federal income taxation under Section 501
of the Code are so exempt, and nothing has occurred with respect to the
operation of the Company Plans that could cause the loss of such qualification
or exemption or the imposition of any liability, penalty or tax under ERISA or
the Code.

           (e) All contributions (including all employer contributions and
employee salary reduction contributions) required to have been made under any of
the Company Plans have been timely made.

           (f) There are no pending actions, claims or lawsuits that have been
asserted or instituted relating to or arising from the Company Plans, the assets
of any of the trusts under the Company Plans or the sponsor or administrator of
any of the Company Plans, or against any fiduciary of the Company Plans with
respect to the operation of any of the Company Plans (other than routine benefit
claims), nor does the Company have any Knowledge of facts that could reasonably
be expected to form the basis for any such claim or lawsuit.

           (g) None of the Company Plans provides for post-employment life
insurance or health insurance, benefits or coverage for any participant or any
beneficiary of a participant, except as may be required under the Consolidated
Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended ("COBRA"), and at the
expense of the participant or the participant's beneficiary.

           (h) Except as set forth on Schedule 4.15(h), neither the execution
and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby will (i) result in any payment becoming due to any Employee,
(ii) increase any benefits otherwise payable under any Company Plan or (iii)
result in the acceleration of the time of payment or vesting of any rights with
respect to such benefits under any Company Plan.

           (i) Any individual who performs services for the Company (other than
through a contract with an organization other than such individual) and who is
not treated as an employee of the Company for Federal income tax purposes by the
Company is not an employee for such purposes.

respect to their business activities on behalf of the Company), or to which the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries is otherwise a party before any

and of record all of the outstanding capital stock of Merger Sub. Merger Sub was
formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the Merger, has engaged in no other
business activities and has conducted its operations only as contemplated

           5.7. Parent SEC Documents.

           (a) Parent has filed all registration statements, reports, forms,
proxy statements and information statements required to be filed by it with the
SEC pursuant to applicable securities statutes, regulations, policies and rules
since March 29, 2002 (the registration statements, reports, forms, proxy
statements and information statements filed and furnished since March 29, 2002
collectively, and in each case including all exhibits and schedules thereto and
documents incorporated by reference therein, the "Parent SEC Documents"). As of
their respective effective dates (in the case of Parent SEC Documents that are
registration statements filed pursuant to the requirements of the Securities
Act) and as of their respective dates of being filed with the SEC (in the case
of all other Parent SEC Documents), the Parent SEC Documents complied as to form
in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act
and the Securities Act (including the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder). As of their respective dates (and, if amended, as of the date of
such amendment), the Parent SEC Documents did not contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

           (b) Each of the consolidated financial statements of Parent included
in or incorporated by reference into the Parent SEC Documents have been prepared
in accordance with GAAP (except, in the case of unaudited interim statements, as
indicated in the notes thereto) applied on a consistent basis during the periods
involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto) and fairly present in
all material respects the consolidated financial position of Parent and its
consolidated Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the consolidated results
of their operations and cash flows for the periods then ended (subject, in the
case of unaudited interim statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments).

           (c) All books, records, and accounts of Parent and Parent
Subsidiaries are accurate and complete in all material respects and are
maintained in all material respects in accordance with good business practice
and all applicable Laws. Parent maintains a system of internal accounting
controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that (i) transactions are
executed in accordance with management's general or specific authorization; (ii)
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in conformity with GAAP and to maintain accountability for assets;
(iii) access to assets is permitted only in accordance with management's general


                                       45
<PAGE>
or specific authorization; and (iv) the recorded accountability for assets is
compared with the actual levels at reasonable intervals and appropriate action
is taken with respect to any differences. Except as described in Parent's most
recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC, since the end of
Parent's most recent fiscal quarter end, there has been (i) no material weakness
in Parent's internal control over financial reporting (whether or not
remediated) and (ii) no change in Parent's internal control over financial
reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially
affect, Parent's internal control over financial reporting.

           5.8. Financing. Schedule 5.8 sets forth complete and correct copies
of a commitment letter and related terms sheets from Lehman Brothers Inc.
(collectively, the "Financing Commitment") for the debt financing to be used in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby (the "Financing"). The
amount of the Financing will provide sufficient funds for Parent to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

           5.9. No Parent Material Adverse Effect. Since January 2, 2005, there
has not been a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

                                   ARTICLE VI

          the Principal Securityholder Documents or any of the Company Documents
          untrue or incorrect in any material respect or could result in any of
          the conditions to the Closing not being satisfied or (C) that would be
          reasonably expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

           (c) Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement or with
the prior written consent of Parent, between the date hereof and the Closing,
each Principal Securityholder shall not (i) sell, assign, encumber, convey,
transfer or otherwise dispose of any of its Company Securities other than for
estate planning purposes, (ii) take any action which would adversely affect the
ability of the Parties to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, or (iii) agree to do any of the foregoing.

           6.2. Access to Information; Confidentiality. The Parties shall afford
to the Parties and their accountants, counsel, financial advisors and other
representatives, and to prospective lenders, placement agents and other
financing sources and each of their respective representatives, full access
(subject to such persons being subject to appropriate non-disclosure agreements
with the Company), during normal business hours upon reasonable notice
throughout the period prior to the Closing, to the Parties' properties and
facilities (including all owned or leased real property and the buildings,
structures, fixtures, appurtenances and improvements erected, attached or
located thereon), books, financial information (including working papers and
data in the possession of the Parties' independent public accountants, internal
audit reports, and "management letters" from such accountants with respect to
the Parties' systems of internal control), Contracts and records of the Parties,
during such period, shall furnish promptly such information concerning the
businesses, properties and personnel of the Parties, as the Parties shall
reasonably request; provided, however, such investigation shall not unreasonably
disrupt the Parties operations. Prior to the Closing, the Parties shall
generally keep the Parties informed as to all material matters involving the
operations and businesses of the Parties. The Company shall authorize and direct
its directors, managers and employees to discuss matters involving the
operations and business of the Company with representatives of Parent and its
prospective lenders or placement agents and other financial sources. All
nonpublic information provided to, or obtained by, the Parties in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby shall be "Confidential Information"
for purposes of the Non-Disclosure Agreement dated June 27, 2005, by and between
Parent and the Company (the "Confidentiality Agreement"), the terms of which
shall continue in force until the Closing; provided that Parent and the Company
may disclose such information as may be necessary in connection with (i) seeking
necessary consents and approvals as contemplated hereby and (ii) the Financing.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be required to disclose any


                                       50
<PAGE>
information if such disclosure would contravene any applicable Law. No
information provided to or obtained by the Parties pursuant to this Section 6.2
shall limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to the Parties
(including Parties' right to seek indemnification under this Agreement), or the
representations or warranties of, or the conditions to the obligations of, the
Parties hereto.

           6.3. Regulatory Approvals. The Parties shall make all filings
required of each of them or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates
under any Antitrust Laws and other applicable Laws with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable and, in any event,
within fifteen (15) days of the date hereof.

           6.4. Further Assurances. Subject to, and not in limitation of,
Section 6.3, each of Parent and the Company shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to (i) take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary or
appropriate to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
(ii) cause the fulfillment at the earliest practicable date of all of the
conditions to their respective obligations to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. The Parties shall use their commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain at the earliest practicable date all consents and
approvals required to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the consents and approvals, if any, referred to in Section
4.3(a) or 5.3(a) hereof. The Company shall provide such assistance and
cooperation in connection with obtaining the Financing as Parent and its
Affiliates may reasonably request.

           6.5. No Shop.

           (a) The Principal Securityholders and the Company shall not, and
shall not permit any of the Subsidiaries, Affiliates, directors, officers,
employees, representatives or agents of the Principal Securityholders, or the
Company (collectively, the "Representatives") to, directly or indirectly, (i)
discuss, encourage, negotiate, undertake, initiate, authorize, recommend,
propose or enter into, whether as the proposed surviving, merged, acquiring or
acquired corporation or otherwise, any transaction involving a merger,
consolidation, business combination, purchase or disposition of any material
amount of the assets of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries or any capital
stock or other ownership interests of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries
other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (an "Acquisition
Transaction"), (ii) facilitate, encourage, solicit or initiate discussions,
negotiations or submissions of proposals or offers in respect of an Acquisition
Transaction, (iii) furnish or cause to be furnished, to any Person, any
information concerning the business, operations, properties or assets of the
Company or the Company Subsidiaries in connection with an Acquisition
Transaction, or (iv) otherwise cooperate in any way with, or assist or
participate in, facilitate or encourage, any effort or attempt by any other
Person to do or seek any of the foregoing.


                                       51
<PAGE>
           (b) The Company shall and shall cause its Representatives to, and the
Company shall cause the Company Subsidiaries and its and their Representatives
to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing discussions or
negotiations with any Persons (other than Parent) conducted heretofore with
respect to any Acquisition Transaction. The Company agrees not to, and the
Company agrees to cause the Company Subsidiaries not to, release any third party
from the confidentiality and standstill provisions of any agreement to which the
Company is a party.

           6.6. Confidentiality.

           (a) From and after the Closing Date, the Principal Securityholders
shall not and shall cause their directors, officers, employees and Affiliates
not to, directly or indirectly, disclose, reveal, divulge or communicate to any
Person other than authorized officers, directors and employees of Parent or use
or otherwise exploit for its own benefit or for the benefit of anyone other than
Parent, any Confidential Information (as defined below). The Principal
Securityholders shall not have any obligation to keep confidential (or cause any
of their officers, directors or Affiliates to keep confidential) any
Confidential Information if and to the extent disclosure thereof is specifically
required by applicable Law; provided, however, that in the event disclosure is
required by applicable Law, the Principal Securityholders shall, to the extent
reasonably possible, provide Parent with prompt notice of such requirement prior
to making any disclosure so that Parent may seek an appropriate protective
order. For purposes of this Section 6.6(a), "Confidential Information" means any
information with respect to the Company, including methods of operation,
customer lists, products, prices, fees, costs, Technology, inventions, Trade
Secrets, know-how, Software, marketing methods, plans, personnel, suppliers,
competitors, markets or other specialized information or proprietary matters;
provided, however, that Confidential Information does not include, and there
shall be no obligation hereunder with respect to, information that (i) is
generally available to the public on the date of this Agreement or (ii) becomes
generally available to the public other than as a result of a disclosure not
otherwise permissible hereunder.

           (b) The covenants and undertakings contained in this Section 6.6
relate to matters which are of a special, unique and extraordinary character and
a violation of any of the terms of this Section 6.6 will cause irreparable
injury to Parent, the amount of which will be impossible to estimate or
determine and which cannot be adequately compensated. Accordingly, the remedy at
law for any breach of this Section 6.6 will be inadequate. Therefore, Parent
will be entitled to a temporary and permanent injunction, restraining order or
other equitable relief from any court of competent jurisdiction in the event of
any breach of this Section 6.6 without the necessity of proving actual damage or
posting any bond whatsoever. The rights and remedies provided by this Section
6.6 are cumulative and in addition to any other rights and remedies which Parent
may have hereunder or at law or in equity. In the event that Parent were to seek
damages for any breach of this Section 6.6, the portion of the consideration
delivered to the Principal Securityholders hereunder which is allocated by the
Parties to the foregoing covenant shall not be considered a measure of or limit
on such damages.

           (c) The Parties agree that, if any court of competent jurisdiction
determines that a specified time period, a specified geographical area, a
specified business limitation or any other relevant feature of this Section 6.6
is unreasonable, arbitrary or against public policy, then a lesser period of
time, geographical area, business limitation or other relevant feature which is
determined by such court to be reasonable, not arbitrary and not against public
policy may be enforced against the applicable party.


                                       52
<PAGE>
           (d) To the extent the terms of any other agreement of the Company
conflicts with, or is inconsistent with, the terms of this Section 6.6, the
terms of this Agreement shall supersede such conflicting or inconsistent terms.

           6.7. Public Announcements. None of the Parties shall issue any press
release, public announcement, circular or notice concerning this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby without obtaining the prior written
approval (which approval will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) of the
other Parties hereto (provided, that the Stockholder Representative may provide
approval for and on behalf of all Securityholders), unless in the reasonable
judgment of the Party intending to make such issuance, disclosure is otherwise
required by applicable Law or by any applicable listing agreement with Nasdaq or
a national securities exchange, provided that, to the extent required by
applicable Law, the Party intending to make such release or announcement shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts consistent with such applicable Law to
consult with the other Parties with respect to the text thereof. Each of the
Parties agrees that the terms of this Agreement shall not be disclosed or
otherwise made available to the public and that copies of this Agreement shall
not be publicly filed or otherwise made available to the public, except where
such disclosure, availability or filing is required by applicable Law and only
to the extent required by such Law. In the event that such disclosure,
availability or filing is required by applicable Law, each Party agrees to use
its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain confidential treatment of this
Agreement with any Governmental Body and to redact such terms of this Agreement
the other Parties shall request. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent may
disclose this Agreement to the extent required by applicable Law, Nasdaq, any
national securities exchange or Regulatory Body in connection with any public
offering of securities of Parent or its Affiliates.

           6.8. Notification of Certain Matters. The Company shall give prompt
notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company, of (i) any
notice or other communication received by such party from any Governmental Body
in connection with the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or may
be required in connection with the Merger or the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, if the subject matter of such communication or the failure of
such party to obtain such consent could be material to the Company, the
Surviving Corporation or Parent, (ii) any actions, suits, claims, investigations
or proceedings commenced or, to such party's knowledge, threatened against,
relating to or involving or otherwise affecting such party or any of the Company
Subsidiaries which relate to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, (iii) the discovery of any fact or circumstance that, or the
occurrence or non-occurrence of any event the occurrence or non-occurrence of
which, would cause any representation or warranty made by such party contained
in this Agreement (A) that is qualified as to materiality or Material Adverse
Effect to be untrue and (B) that is not so qualified to be untrue in any
material respect, and (iv) any material failure of such party to comply with or
satisfy any covenant or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it
hereunder; provided, however, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this
Section 6.8 shall not (x) cure any breach of, or non-compliance with, any other
provision of this Agreement or (y) limit the remedies available to the party
receiving such notice.

           6.9. Related-Party Transactions with Non-Management Affiliates. On or
prior to the Closing Date, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries shall (a)
terminate all Contracts with any of the Principal Securityholders or their
respective Affiliates (other than (i) those Contracts set forth on Schedule 6.9
and (ii) Contracts between the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and their
respective officers and employees and Contracts the continuation of which Parent
has approved in writing) and (b) deliver releases executed by such Affiliates
with whom the Company has terminated such Contracts pursuant to this Section 6.9
providing that no further payments are due, or may become due, under or in
respect of any such terminated Contracts; provided that in no event shall the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries pay any fee or otherwise incur any
expense or financial exposure with respect to any such termination or release
without the prior written consent of Parent.

           6.10. Parent Board. Immediately following the Closing Date, Parent
shall nominate, or cause to be nominated, and appointed, Rodney D. Windley to
Parent's Board of Directors as a Class II director and as Vice-Chairman thereof.

           6.11. Actions with Respect to Financing. In order to assist with
obtaining the Financing contemplated by the Financing Commitment, the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries shall provide such assistance and cooperation as
Parent may reasonably request, including (i) assisting in the preparation of any
prospectus, offering memorandum or similar document or marketing material, and,
cooperating with lenders, (ii) making senior management of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries reasonably available for customary "road show" or
syndication, presentations, lender or proposed financing source meetings and
ratings agencies presentations, (iii) cooperating with prospective lenders and
their respective advisors in performing their due diligence, (iv) entering into
customary agreements with lenders and their respective advisors, and (v) helping
procure other definitive financing documents or other reasonably requested
certificates or documents, including pledge and security documents, comfort
letters, customary certificates (including a certificate of the chief financial
officer of the Company with respect to solvency matters), legal opinions and
real estate title documentation.

           6.12. Certain Litigation Recoveries. If after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation recovers any amount arising out of the Four Seasons

Windley v. Willis Insurance Services of Georgia, Inc., Superior Court of Fulton
County, Georgia, Civil Action File No. 2003-cv-67895 lawsuit (the "Willis

           6.13. Payment under CHMG Agreement. The Principal Securityholders
shall not be obligated to make any payments under this Agreement in the event
that the Parent or the Company is obligated to make a payment pursuant to
Section 11(c)(ii) of the Stock Option and Purchase Agreement, dated as of May
18, 2005, by and between Michael S. Brown, Todd D. Wiebusch, and Wayne Morehead,

payments made to the Company by Medicare for hospice services in excess of the
annual cap amounts for the Medicare cap year ended October 31, 2005 ("Excess

the Company, dollar-for-dollar, the amount of such excess. Such reimbursement
payment may be satisfied by release to Parent of Escrowed Property from the
Escrow Account in accordance with Section 9.5 hereof. If and to the extent that
Excess Medicare Payments are less than $1,100,000, the Company shall pay the
Stockholder Representative, for the benefit of the Principal Securityholders,
dollar-for-dollar, the amount of such difference. Any payments required to be
made pursuant to this Section 6.14 shall be made promptly (and in no event later

provide that in the event that such executive would receive payments in
connection with the Merger that would constitute "excess parachute payments"

meaning of Section 280G of the Code.

           (m) Letter of Instruction. The Stockholder Representative shall have
prepared and delivered to Parent a letter of instruction setting forth the

                                       57
<PAGE>
in all material respects, in each case as of the date of this Agreement and as
of the Closing Date as though made on the Closing Date, except to the extent

failure of any condition set forth in Section 7.1, 7.2 or 7.3, as the case may
be, to be satisfied if such failure was caused by such party's failure to use
its commercially reasonable efforts to consummate the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby, as required by and subject to Section 6.4.

                                  ARTICLE VIII

                                   TERMINATION
                                   -----------

           8.1. Termination. This Agreement may be terminated and the
transactions contemplated hereby abandoned at any time prior to the Effective
Time:

           (a) by the mutual written consent of the Company and Parent duly
authorized by each of their respective Boards of Directors; or

           (b) by either of the Company or Parent:

               (i) if the Merger shall not have been consummated on or before
          March 3, 2006 (the "Outside Date"); provided, however, that the right
          to terminate this Agreement under this Section 8.1(b)(i) shall not be
          available to a party if the failure of the Merger to have been
          consummated on or before the Outside Date was primarily due to the
          material breach of such party under this Agreement or Parent's failure
          to receive the financing required to consummate the transactions
          contemplated hereby; provided, further that such date shall be
          automatically extended for up to two successive thirty (30) day
          periods if (i) the conditions to Closing set forth in Section 7.1(b)
          remain unsatisfied or unwaived or (ii) if Parent shall not have
          obtained the Financing due to the failure of Parent to satisfy the
          material closing conditions in the Financing Commitment (provided that
          the Financing Commitment remains in full force and effect and each of
          the parties thereto continues to act in good faith to consummate the
          transactions contemplated thereby and Parent delivers a certificate to
          the Stockholder Representative to such effect which shall include a
          letter to such effect from Parent's financing source); or

               (ii) if there shall be in effect any law prohibiting consummation
          of the Merger, or a final non-appealable Order of a Governmental Body
          of competent jurisdiction restraining, enjoining or otherwise
          prohibiting the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated
          hereby; it being agreed that the Parties shall promptly appeal any
          adverse determination which is not non-appealable (and pursue such
          appeal with reasonable diligence); provided, however, that the right
          to terminate this Agreement under this Section 8.1(b)(ii) shall not be
          available to a party if such Order was primarily due to the failure of
          such party to perform any of its obligations or other material breach
          by such party under this Agreement.

           (c) by Parent (if Parent is not in material breach of this
Agreement):

               (i) if the Company or the Principal Securityholders shall have
          breached or failed to perform any of their respective representations,
          warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement (or if
          any of the representations or warranties of the Company or the
          Principal Securityholders set forth in this Agreement shall fail to be
          true), which breach or failure (A) would (if it occurred or was


                                       59
<PAGE>
          continuing as of the Closing Date) give rise to the failure of a
          condition set forth in Section 7.2(a) or 7.2(b) and (B) is incapable
          of being cured, or is not cured, by the Company or the Principal
          Securityholders within twenty (20) days following receipt of written
          notice from Parent detailing such breach or failure; or

               (ii) if there has been or occurred any event, fact or
          circumstance that would reasonably be expected to constitute a Company
          Material Adverse Effect; or

               (iii) if the Company shall fail to deliver to Parent within
          twenty-four (24) hours of the date of this Agreement written consents
          of Securityholders representing a majority of the outstanding Company
          Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock (voting on an as converted
          basis), voting together as a single class, in a form reasonably
          satisfactory to Parent, approving the Merger and the transactions
          contemplated hereby (the "Stockholder Approval"); or

           (d) by the Company (if the Company is not in material breach of this
Agreement):

               (i) if Parent or Merger Sub shall have breached or failed to
          perform any of their respective representations, warranties, covenants
          or agreements set forth in this Agreement (or if any of the
          representations or warranties of Parent or Merger Sub set forth in
          this Agreement shall fail to be true), which breach or failure (A)
          would (if it occurred or was continuing as of the Closing Date) give
          rise to the failure of a condition set forth in Section 7.3(a) or
          7.3(b) and (B) is incapable of being cured, or is not cured, by Parent
          or Merger Sub within twenty (20) days following receipt of written
          notice from the Company of such breach or failure; or

               (ii) by the Company (if the Company is not in material breach of
          this Agreement) if there has been or occurred any event, fact or
          circumstance that would reasonably be expected to constitute a Parent
          Material Adverse Effect.

           8.2. Procedure Upon Termination. In the event of termination and
abandonment by Parent and/or the Company pursuant to Section 8.1 hereof, written
notice thereof shall forthwith be given to the other Parties, and this Agreement
shall terminate, and the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereunder shall be abandoned, without further action by Parent or the Company.

           8.3. Termination Fee. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement
to the contrary, if the Merger shall not have been consummated on or before the
Outside Date (but only if at such time Parent would be prohibited from
terminating this Agreement by application of Section 8.1), then Parent shall pay
to the Company a fee of $10,000,000 in cash and Parent shall have no further
liability with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby
to the Company or the Securityholders.

           8.4. Effect of Termination. In the event that this Agreement is
validly terminated as provided herein, then each of the Parties shall be
relieved of their duties and obligations arising under this Agreement after the
date of such termination and such termination shall be without liability to the
Parties; provided, however, that the obligations of the Parties set forth in
this Section 6.7, Section 8.3 and Section 8.4, Article XII and, to the extent
necessary to effectuate the foregoing enumerated provisions, Article XI hereof,
shall survive any such termination and shall be enforceable hereunder; provided
further, however, that nothing in this Section 8.4 shall relieve the Parties of
any liability for fraud or any breach of this Agreement prior to the effective
date of termination.

                                   ARTICLE IX

                                 INDEMNIFICATION
                                 ---------------

           9.1. Survival of Representations and Warranties. The representations
and warranties of the Parties contained in this Agreement (other than the
representations and warranties contained in Section 4.10 (Taxes), which shall be
covered by Article X), any certificate delivered pursuant hereto or any Company
Document, Principal Securityholder Document or Parent Document, shall survive
the Closing through and including the second anniversary of the Closing Date,
except for the representations and warranties of the Company, which will expire
at the Effective Time; provided, however, that the representations and
warranties (a) (i) of the Principal Securityholders set forth in Sections 3.1
(Authorization), 3.3 (Ownership), 3.5 (Financial Advisors), 3.6 (Investment
Representations); (ii) of the Company set forth in Sections 4.1 (Organization),
4.2 (Authorization), 4.4 (Capitalization), 4.5 (Subsidiaries and Affiliated
Entities), 4.25 (Financial Advisors); and (iii) of Parent set forth in Sections
5.1 (Organization) and 5.2 (Authorization) shall survive the Closing
indefinitely and (b) of the Company set forth in Sections 4.15 (Employee Benefit
Plans), 4.16 (Labor and Employment Matters), 4.19 (Environmental Matters) and
4.26 (Certain Regulatory Matters) hereof shall survive until the expiration of
the statute of limitation applicable to the matter to which such representation
or warranty relates (in each case, the "Survival Period"); provided, however,
that any obligations under Sections 9.2(a)(i), 9.2(a)(ii) and 9.2(b)(i) shall
not terminate with respect to any Losses as to which the Person to be
indemnified shall have given written notice (stating in reasonable detail the
basis of the claim for indemnification) to the indemnifying party in accordance
with Section 9.3(a) before the termination of the applicable Survival Period.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein or elsewhere in this
Agreement, the representations, warranties and covenants of the Parties
contained in the Registration Rights Agreement executed in connection with the
Merger shall not be subject to the terms and conditions of this Article IX
(inclusive) as to survival or otherwise, and the Parties shall be entitled to
exercise all remedies available to them under the Registration Rights Agreement.

           9.2. Indemnification.

           (a) Subject to Sections 9.1 and 9.4 hereof, each Principal
Securityholder other than the Stockholder Representative hereby severally and
not jointly agrees, and the Stockholder Representative hereby jointly and
severally agrees (except with respect to Section 9.2(a)(ii), which shall be
several, but not joint), to indemnify and hold Parent, the Surviving
Corporation, and their respective directors, officers, employees, Affiliates,
stockholders (excluding the Securityholders after the Closing in such capacity),
agents, attorneys, representatives, successors and assigns (collectively, the
"Parent Indemnified Parties") harmless from and against, and pay to the
applicable Parent Indemnified Parties the amount of (without duplication), any
and all losses, Liabilities, obligations, deficiencies, demands, judgments,
damages (including incidental and consequential damages actually paid by
Parent), interest, fines, penalties, claims, suits, actions, causes of action,
assessments, awards, costs and expenses (including reasonable costs of
investigation and defense and attorneys' and other professionals' fees), whether
or not involving a third party claim ("Losses"):

               (i) based upon, attributable to or resulting from the failure of
          any of the representations or warranties made by the Company or the
          Principal Securityholders in this Agreement (other than in Article III
          or Section 4.10) or in any Principal Securityholder Document or
          Company Document to be true and correct in all respects at and as of
          the date hereof and at and as of the Closing Date (except to the
          extent that any such representation expressly speaks as of an earlier
          date in which case such representation shall be true and correct as of
          such earlier date);

               (ii) based upon, attributable to or resulting from the failure of
          any of the representations or warranties made by the Principal
          Securityholders in Article III to be true and correct in all respects
          at and as of the date hereof and at and as of the Closing Date;

               (iii) based upon, attributable to or resulting from the breach of
          any covenant or other agreement on the part of the Principal
          Securityholders or (prior to the Closing) the Company under this
          Agreement or any Principal Securityholder Document or Company Document
          (other than any covenant or agreement relating to Taxes); or

               (iv) based upon, attributable to or resulting from

                    (A) any Legal Proceeding, to the extent existing on or prior
               to the Closing Date, or

                    (B) any Liability relating to medical malpractice or
               workers' compensation arising from or related to any condition,
               act, omission or occurrence, whether known or unknown, accrued or
               contingent, to the extent existing on or prior to the Closing
               Date, regardless of when such claim of Liability is asserted.


                                       62
<PAGE>
           (b) Subject to Sections 9.1 and 9.4, Parent hereby agrees to
indemnify and hold the Principal Securityholders and their respective
Affiliates, stockholders, agents, attorneys, representatives, successors and
permitted assigns (collectively, the "Principal Securityholder Indemnified
Parties") harmless from and against, and pay to the applicable Principal
Securityholder Indemnified Parties the amount of any and all Losses:

               (i) based upon, attributable to or resulting from the failure of
          any of the representations or warranties made by Parent or Merger Sub
          in this Agreement or in any Parent Document to be true and correct in
          all respects at and as of the date hereof and at and as of the Closing
          Date (except to the extent that any such representation expressly
          speaks as of an earlier date in which case such representation shall
          be true and correct as of such earlier date); and

               (ii) based upon, attributable to or resulting from the breach of
          any covenant or other agreement on the part of Parent or Merger Sub
          prior to the Effective Time or the Surviving Corporation after the
          Effective Time under this Agreement or any Parent Document.

           (c) The indemnification provisions of this Article IX are the sole
and exclusive post-Closing remedy of Parent (or Surviving Corporation) and the
Principal Securityholders for a breach or nonperformance of any representations,
warranties and covenants in this Agreement. To the extent that any claim by
Parent for indemnification hereunder is satisfied by the Working Capital
adjustment, there shall be no duplicative recovery under this Article IX. The
right to indemnification or any other remedy based on representations,
warranties and covenants and agreements in this Agreement, or any Principal
Securityholder Documents, Company Document or Parent Document shall not be
affected by any investigation conducted at any time, or any knowledge acquired
(or capable of being acquired) at any time, whether before or after the
execution and delivery of this Agreement or the Closing Date, with respect to
the accuracy or inaccuracy of, or compliance with, any such representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement. The waiver of any condition based on the
accuracy of any such representation or warranty, or on the performance of or
compliance with any such covenant or agreements, will not affect the right to
indemnification or any other remedy based on such representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements.

           9.3. Indemnification Procedures.

           (a) Any claim for indemnification for any matter not involving a
Third Party Claim shall be asserted by written notice to the party from whom
indemnification is sought within the applicable period as set forth in Section
9.1.

           (b) In the event that any Legal Proceedings shall be instituted or
that any claim or demand shall be asserted by any third party within the
applicable period as set forth in Section 9.1 in respect of which
indemnification may be sought under Section 9.2 hereof (regardless of the
limitations set forth in Section 9.4) (a "Third Party Claim"), the indemnified
party shall promptly cause written notice of the assertion of any Third Party
Claim of which it has knowledge which is covered by this indemnity to be
forwarded to the indemnifying party. The failure of the indemnified party to


                                       63
<PAGE>
give reasonably prompt notice of any Third Party Claim shall not release, waive
or otherwise affect the indemnifying party's obligations with respect thereto
except to the extent that the indemnifying party can demonstrate actual loss and
prejudice as a result of such failure. Subject to the provisions of this Section
9.3, the indemnifying party shall have the right, at its sole expense, to be
represented by counsel of its choice, which must be reasonably satisfactory to
the indemnified party, and to defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise
deal with any Third Party Claim which relates to any Losses indemnified against
hereunder; provided that the indemnifying party shall have acknowledged in
writing to the indemnified party its unqualified obligation to indemnify the
indemnified party as provided hereunder. If the indemnifying party elects to
defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with any Third Party Claim
which relates to any Losses indemnified by it hereunder, it shall within five
Business Days of the indemnified party's written notice of the assertion of such
Third Party Claim (or sooner, if the nature of the Third Party Claim so
requires) notify the indemnified party of its intent to do so; provided, that
the indemnifying party must conduct the defense of the Third Party Claim
diligently and in good faith thereafter in order to preserve its rights in this
regard. If the indemnifying party elects not to defend against, negotiate,
settle or otherwise deal with any Third Party Claim which relates to any Losses
indemnified against hereunder, fails to notify the indemnified party of its
election as herein provided or contests its obligation to indemnify the
indemnified party for such Losses under this Agreement, the indemnified party
may defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with such Third Party
Claim. If the indemnified party defends any Third Party Claim, then the
indemnifying party shall reimburse the indemnified party for the reasonable
expenses of defending such Third Party Claim upon submission of periodic bills.
If the indemnifying party shall assume the defense of any Third Party Claim, the
indemnified party may participate, at his or its own expense, in the defense of
such Third Party Claim; provided, however, that such indemnified party shall be
entitled to participate in any such defense with separate counsel at the expense
of the indemnifying party if (i) so requested by the indemnifying party to
participate or (ii) in the reasonable opinion of counsel to the indemnified
party, a conflict or potential conflict exists between the indemnified party and
the indemnifying party that would make such separate representation advisable;
and provided, further, that the indemnifying party shall not be required to pay
for more than one such counsel for all indemnified Parties in connection with
any Third Party Claim. The Parties agree to provide reasonable access to the
other to such documents and information as may be reasonably requested in
connection with the defense, negotiation or settlement of any such Third Party
Claim.

           (c) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 9.3 to the contrary,
neither the indemnifying party nor the indemnified party shall, without the
written consent of the other party, settle or compromise any Third Party Claim
or permit a default or consent to entry of any judgment unless the claimant or
claimants and such party provide to such other party an unqualified release from
all liability in respect of the Third Party Claim and unless such settlement
does not include any statement as to an admission of fault, culpability or
failure to act by or on behalf of such indemnified party or provide for any
ongoing restriction on the business of the indemnified party. If the
indemnifying party makes any payment on any Third Party Claim, the indemnifying


                                       64
<PAGE>
party shall be subrogated, to the extent of such payment, to all rights and
remedies of the indemnified party to any insurance benefits or other claims of
the indemnified party with respect to such Third Party Claim. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, (i) if a Third Party Claim seeks the issuance of an injunction,
the specific election of an obligation or similar remedy against the indemnified
party or (ii) if the subject matter of a Third Party Claim relates to the
ongoing business of any indemnified party, which Third Party Claim, if decided
against any indemnified party, would materially adversely affect the ongoing
business or reputation of any indemnified party, the indemnified party alone
will be entitled to settle such Third Party Claim in the first instance and, if
the indemnified party does not settle such Third Party Claim, the indemnifying
party will then have the right to contest and defend (but not settle without the
consent of the indemnified Party) such Claim.

           (d) After any final decision, judgment or award shall have been
rendered by a Governmental Body of competent jurisdiction and the expiration of
the time in which to appeal therefrom, or a settlement shall have been
consummated, or the indemnified party and the indemnifying party shall have
arrived at a mutually binding agreement, in each case with respect to an Third
Party Claim hereunder, the indemnified party shall forward to the indemnifying
party notice of any sums due and owing by the indemnifying party pursuant to
this Agreement with respect to such matter and the indemnifying party shall pay
all of such remaining sums so due and owing to the indemnified party in
accordance with Section 9.5.

           9.4. Limitations on Indemnification for Breaches of Representations
and Warranties.

           (a) An indemnifying party shall not have any liability under Section
9.2(a)(i) or Section 9.2(b)(i) hereof unless the aggregate amount of Losses
incurred by the indemnified Parties and indemnifiable thereunder based upon,
attributable to or resulting from the failure of any of the representations or
warranties to be true and correct exceeds $1,500,000 (the "Indemnification
Basket") and, in such event, the indemnifying party shall be required to pay the
entire amount of all such Losses, in excess of $1,500,000; provided that the
Indemnification Basket limitation shall not apply to Losses related to the
failure to be true and correct of any of the representations and warranties set
forth in Sections 3.1 (Authorization), 3.4 (Ownership), 3.5 (Financial
Advisors), 3.6 (Investor Representations), 4.1 (Organization), 4.2
(Authorization), 4.4 (Capitalization), 4.5 (Subsidiaries and Affiliated
Entities), 4.15 (Employee Benefit Plans), 4.25 (Financial Advisors), 5.1
(Organization) and 5.2 (Authorization) hereof.

           (b) The Principal Securityholders shall not be required to indemnify

Escrowed Shares, the "Escrowed Property") with the Escrow Agent to be held in an
escrow account (the "Escrow Account") pursuant to and in accordance with this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement to be executed as of the Closing Date. Any
payment the Principal Securityholders are obligated to make to any Parent
Indemnified Parties pursuant to this Article IX (other than Sections 9.2(a)(ii)
and 9.6) or Article X (at Parent's option) shall be paid (i) if the payment is
to be made in cash, by reducing the amount of the cash in the Escrow Account in
an amount equal to such payment and releasing such cash to Parent or (ii) if the
payment is to be made in Escrowed Shares, by reducing the number of Escrowed
Shares in the Escrow Account in an amount equal to (x) the amount of such
payment divided by (y) the average closing price of Parent Common Stock on the
Nasdaq (as reported by The Wall Street Journal, Eastern Edition, or, if not
reported thereby, any other authoritative source) for the ten (10) trading days
ending with the second trading day immediately preceding the date such Escrowed
Shares are released and returning and releasing such Escrowed Shares to Parent.
The first $5,000,000 of Escrowed Property required to be paid by the Principal
Securityholders shall be paid out of the Escrowed Shares. The next $5,000,000 of
Escrowed Property required to paid the by Principal Securityholders shall be out
of the Cash Escrow Amount. Any remaining amounts of Escrowed Property required
to be paid by the Principal Securityholders shall be paid out of the remaining
Escrowed Property.

           (b) To the extent that there is an insufficient amount of remaining
Escrowed Property to pay any remaining sums due pursuant to this Article IX
(other than Sections 9.2(a) (ii) and 9.6) or Article X, then the Principal
Securityholders shall be required to pay all of such additional sums due and
owing to the Parent Indemnified Parties by wire transfer of immediately
available funds within thirty (30) days after the date of notice any sums then
due and owing is given to the Stockholder Representative (with a copy to the
Escrow Agent) by the applicable Parent Indemnified Party. Any indemnification
owed by a Principal Securityholder pursuant to Section 9.2(a)(ii) shall be paid
by such Principal Securityholder to the Parent Indemnified Parties by wire
transfer of immediately available funds within ten (10) Business Days after the
date of notice any sums then due and owing is given to such Principal
Securityholder (with a copy to the Stockholder Representative) by the applicable
Parent Indemnified Party.


                                       67
<PAGE>
           (c) On December 31, 2006, the Escrow Agent shall release one-third of
the Escrowed Shares (based upon the number of Escrowed Shares originally
deposited with Escrow Agent or the proceeds thereof pursuant to Section 9.5(d))
less the number of such Escrowed Shares as may be necessary to satisfy in full
all unpaid Escrow Claims and less all Escrowed Shares previously disbursed to
Parent; on June 30, 2007, the Escrow Agent shall release two-thirds of the
Escrowed Shares (based upon the number of Escrowed Shares originally deposited
with Escrow Agent or the proceeds thereof pursuant to Section 9.5(d)), less the
number of such Escrowed Shares as may be necessary to satisfy in full all unpaid
Escrow Claims and less the aggregate of all Escrowed Shares previously disbursed
to Parent or released; and on the second anniversary of the Closing Date, the
Escrow Agent shall release the remaining Escrowed Property and earnings thereon
(in each case, to the extent not utilized to pay Parent for any indemnification
claim), except that the Escrow Agent shall retain an amount of Escrowed Property
equal to the amount of claims for indemnification under this Article IX or
Article X. The Escrowed Property retained for unresolved claims for
indemnification shall be released by the Escrow Agent (to the extent not
utilized to pay Parent for any such claims resolved in favor of Parent) upon
their resolution in accordance with this Article IX, Section 2.5 or Article X.
For the avoidance of doubt, the release of the Escrow Property to the Principal
Securityholders after the second anniversary of the Closing Date pursuant to
this Section 9.5 shall not prejudice any of the rights of the Parent Indemnified
Parties to seek indemnification from the Principal Securityholders under this
Agreement.

           (d) If and to the extent permitted under the Registration Rights
Agreement, the Principal Securityholders may, at their option, instruct the
Escrow Agent to sell all or any portion of the Escrowed Shares on their behalf
and the Escrow Agent shall sell such Escrowed Shares and deposit the proceeds
from any such sales in the Escrow Account.

           9.6. Working Capital Reserve.

deposit $2,000,000 (the "Working Capital Reserve") with the Escrow Agent to be
held in an escrow account (the "Working Capital Reserve Account") pursuant to
and in accordance with this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement to be executed as
of the Closing Date. The True-Up Amounts, if negative, shall be paid by reducing
the amount of cash in the Working Capital Reserve Account in an amount equal to
such payment and releasing such cash to Parent.

           (b) To the extent that the Working Capital Reserve is not sufficient
to pay all additional sums due pursuant to Section 2.5(g), then such sums due
and owing to Parent shall be paid from the Escrowed Property in the Escrow
Account in an amount equal to such payment and releasing such cash or shares to
Parent in accordance with the provisions of Section 9.5. To the extent that the
Working Capital Reserve and the Escrowed Property released to Parent are not
sufficient to pay all additional sums due pursuant to Section 2.5(g),
Securityholders shall be required to pay all of such additional sums due and
owing to Parent pursuant to Section 2.5(g)(i).


                                       68
<PAGE>
           (c) On the date that the True-Up Amounts is finally determined
pursuant to Section 2.5(g)(i), the Escrow Agent shall release to the Stockholder
Representative for the benefit of the Securityholders all cash in the Working
Capital Reserve Account in excess of the True-Up Amounts.

           9.7. Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments. The Principal
Securityholders and Parent agree to treat any indemnity payment made pursuant to
this Article IX or Article X as an adjustment to the Merger Consideration for
all income tax purposes. If, notwithstanding the treatment required by the
preceding sentence, any indemnification payment under Article IX or Article X is
determined to be taxable to the party receiving such payment by any Taxing
Authority, the paying party shall also indemnify the party receiving such
payment for any Taxes incurred by reason of the receipt of such payment
(including by reason of the receipt of any payment under this Section 9.7) and
any Losses incurred by the party receiving such payment in connection with such
Taxes (or any asserted deficiency, claim, demand, action, suit, proceeding,
judgment or assessment, including the defense or settlement thereof, relating to
such Taxes).

                                   -----------

Losses in respect of (i) all Taxes of or imposed against the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries (or any predecessor thereof) (A) for any taxable period
ending on or before the Closing Date, and (B) for the portion of any Straddle
Period ending on the Closing Date (in each case determined as provided in
Section 10.3); (ii) any and all Taxes imposed on any member of a consolidated,
combined or unitary group of which the Company or any Company Subsidiary (or any
predecessor thereof) is or was a member on or prior to the Closing Date, by
reason of the liability of the Company or any Company Subsidiary (or any
predecessor thereof), pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6(a) (or
any predecessor or successor thereof or any analogous or similar provision under
state, local or foreign Law); and (iii) the failure of any of the
representations and warranties contained in Section 4.10 to be true and correct
in all respects (determined without regard to any qualification related to
materiality contained therein) or the failure to perform any covenant contained
in this Agreement with respect to Taxes. To the extent that any claim by Parent
for indemnification hereunder is satisfied by the Working Capital adjustment,
there shall be no duplicative recovery under this Section 10.1.

           10.2. Filing of Tax Returns; Payment of Taxes.

           (a) The Company shall, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries to
timely file all Tax Returns required to be filed by it on or prior to the
Closing Date and shall pay or cause to be paid all Taxes shown due thereon. The
Stockholder Representative shall cause to be prepared all other Tax Returns of
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries for all taxable periods ending on or


                                       69
<PAGE>
before Closing (all such Tax Returns described in the first and second sentence
of this Section 10.2(a), "Pre-Closing Returns"). All such Pre-Closing Returns
shall be prepared in a manner consistent with prior practice. The Company or the
Stockholder Representative as the case may be shall provide Parent with copies
of such completed Pre-Closing Returns at least thirty days prior to the filing
thereof, along with supporting workpapers, for Parent's review and approval,
which shall not be unreasonably withheld; provided that Parent's approval shall
not be considered unreasonably withheld if it fails to approve any position
which would adversely affect the Parent, the Company or any Company Subsidiary
in any taxable period ending after the Closing. The Stockholder Representative
and Parent shall attempt in good faith to resolve any disagreements regarding
such Tax Returns prior to the due date for filing. In the event that the
Stockholder Representative and Parent are unable to resolve any dispute with
respect to such Tax Return at least ten days prior to the due date for filing,
such dispute shall be resolved pursuant to Section 10.5, which resolution shall
be binding on the Parties. Parent shall file or cause to be filed all such
Pre-Closing Returns to the extent such returns are due following the Closing
Date.

           (b) Following the Closing, Parent shall cause to be timely filed all
Tax Returns required to be filed by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
after the Closing Date with respect to Straddle Periods and, subject to the
rights to payment from the Principal Securityholders under Section 10.2(c), pay
or cause to be paid all Taxes shown due thereon.

           (c) Not later than ten days prior to the due date for the payment of
Taxes on any Tax Returns which Parent has the responsibility to cause to be
filed pursuant to Section 10.2(b), the Principal Securityholders shall pay to
Parent the amount of Taxes owed by the Principal Securityholders pursuant to the
provisions of Section 10.1. No payment pursuant to this Section 10.2(c) shall
excuse the Principal Securityholders from its indemnification obligations
pursuant to Section 10.1 if the amount of Taxes, as ultimately determined by a
Taxing Authority or pursuant to the provisions of Section 10.5 exceeds the
amount of the Principal Securityholders' payment under this Section 10.2(c).

           (d) Special Payment in Respect of Stock Options. The Principal
Securityholders shall pay to Parent on the later of (i) the date of the filing
of any federal income Tax Return of the Company for any taxable period ending
prior to or including the Closing Date or, (ii) the Closing Date, an amount
equal to the product (the "Product") of (A) the excess of (I) the federal
taxable income for the taxable period to which such Tax Return relates (or in
the case of a Tax Return that relates to a Straddle Period, the portion of the
Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date) without taking into account any
deductions resulting from the exercise or cancellation of the options to
purchase Company Common Stock set forth on Schedule 10.2(d) and without regard
to any net operating loss carryforwards not actually taken into account in
computing actual federal taxable income, over (II) the actual federal taxable
income for the period ending prior to or including the Closing Date or the
portion of the Straddle Period, as the case may be, multiplied by (B) 39%, but
only to the extent the Product exceeds the amount deducted in calculating the


                                       70
<PAGE>
Estimated Total Merger Consideration in respect of such Product pursuant to
Section 2.2(a). Parent shall be responsible for the employer's share of any
payroll taxes attributable to the exercise or cancellation of the options to
purchase Company Common Stock set forth on Schedule 10.2(d). Any payments
payable to Parent under this Section 10.2(d) shall be reduced by the amount of
the employer's share of any payroll taxes paid by the Company prior to the
Closing that are attributable to the exercise or cancellation of the options to
purchase Company Common Stock set forth on Schedule 10.2(d), and shall be
further reduced by any refund of Taxes which is attributable to the exercise of
such options and retained by the Company under Section 10.8.

           10.3. Straddle Period. The Company will, unless prohibited by
applicable law, close the taxable period of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries as of the close of business on the Closing Date. If applicable law
does not permit the Company (or a Subsidiary) to close its taxable year on the
Closing Date or in any case in which a Tax is assessed with respect to a taxable
period which includes the Closing Date (but does not begin or end on that day)
(a "Straddle Period"), the Taxes, if any, attributable to a Straddle Period
shall be allocated (i) to the Principal Securityholders for the period up to and
including the close of business on the Closing Date, and (ii) to Parent for the
period subsequent to the Closing Date. Any allocation of income or deductions
required to determine any Taxes attributable to a Straddle Period shall be made
by means of a closing of the books and records of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries as of the close of the Closing Date, provided that exemptions,
allowances or deductions that are calculated on an annual basis (including, but
not limited to, depreciation and amortization deductions) shall be allocated
between the period ending on the Closing Date and the period after the Closing
Date in proportion to the number of days in each such period.

           10.4. Tax Audits.

           (a) If any written claim or demand for indemnified Taxes in respect
of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to this Article X is asserted against
Parent, any of its Affiliates or, effective upon the Closing, the Company or any
Company Subsidiary, Parent and the Stockholder Representative shall notify the
other of such claim or demand within ten (10) days of receipt thereof and each
of them shall give the other such information with respect thereto as any of
them may reasonably request of the other. Stockholder Representative shall
assume and control at its own expense, and Parent shall take all steps
reasonably requested by Stockholder Representative in order to fully effectuate
Stockholder Representative's assumption and control of, the conduct of any
contest or proceeding (including, without limitation, a Tax audit) relating to
Taxes for which indemnification may be sought from Stockholder Representative
under this Article X; provided that the Stockholder Representative shall not
settle any such contest or proceeding in a manner that would adversely affect
the Parent, the Company or any Company Subsidiary in a taxable period ending
after the Closing Date without Parent's prior written consent, which shall not
be unreasonably withheld. Parent shall have the right, but not the duty, to
participate in such contest or proceeding at its own expense. Stockholder
Representative shall not be liable under this Article X for any amount arising
out of a contest or proceeding of which Parent failed to notify the Stockholder
Representative as required under this Article X to the extent that the
Stockholder Representative can demonstrate actual loss and prejudice as a result
of such failure.

           (b) If a Taxing Authority makes an adjustment which increases the
obligations of Principal Securityholders and Stockholder Representative under
Section 10.1 and (i) the Principal Securityholders pay the increased amount
pursuant to this Agreement, and (ii) the adjustment results in a decrease in the
Taxes of the Parent, its Affiliates, the Company or the Company Subsidiaries in
any taxable period beginning after the Closing Date, Parent shall be obligated
to make a payment or payments to the Stockholder Representative in an amount
equal to the lesser of (x) the amounts paid by the Stockholder Representative
pursuant to Section 10.1 as a result of the adjustment; or (y) the amount of the
reduction in the Taxes of the Parent, its Affiliates, the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries. If a Taxing Authority makes an adjustment which decreases the
obligations of Principal Securityholders and Stockholder Representative under
Section 10.1 or results in a refund or credit which is payable to the
Stockholder Representative under Section 10.8 and the adjustment results in an
increase in the Taxes of the Parent, its Affiliates, the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries in any taxable period beginning after the Closing Date, the
Stockholder Representative shall be obligated to make a payment or payments to
the Parent in an amount equal to the lesser of (x) the decrease in the amounts
paid by the Stockholder Representative pursuant to Section 10.1 or the amount of
the refund or credit payable to the Stockholder Representative under Section
10.8, as the case may be, as a result of the adjustment; or (y) the amount of
the increase in the Taxes of the Parent, its Affiliates, the Company or the
Company Subsidiaries. Any such payment or payments shall be made by the Parent
or the Stockholder Representative as the case may be within thirty (30) days of
the date that any Tax refund is received with respect to any amended returns or
the date that the Tax Return evidencing such reduction or increase is due with
respect to current and future Tax Returns. The Parent shall file any amended Tax
Returns reasonably necessary to obtain the allowable amount of the reduction in
its Tax liability, except to the extent that Parent, its Affiliates, the
Company, or any Company Subsidiary would be adversely affected by the filing of
such amended Tax Return.

           10.5. Disputes. Any dispute as to any matter covered hereby shall be
resolved by an independent accounting firm mutually acceptable to the
Stockholder Representative and Parent. The fees and expenses of such accounting
firm shall be borne equally by the Principal Securityholders, on the one hand,
and Parent on the other. If any dispute with respect to a Tax Return is not
resolved prior to the due date of such Tax Return, such Tax Return shall be
filed in the manner which the party responsible for preparing such Tax Return
deems correct.

           10.6. Time Limits. Any claim for indemnity under this Article X may
be made at any time prior to 60 days following the expiration of the applicable
statute of limitations.


                                       72
<PAGE>
           10.7. Exclusivity. The indemnification provided for in this Article X
and the provisions in Sections 9.2(c), 9.4(d), 9.5, 9.6 and 9.7 shall be the
sole remedy for any claim in respect of Taxes, including any claim arising out
of or relating to a breach of Section 4.10. In the event of a conflict between
the provisions of this Article X, on the one hand, and the provisions of Article
IX (other than Sections 9.2(c), 9.4(d), 9.5, 9.6 and 9.7), on the other, the
provisions of this Article X shall control.

           10.8. Refunds and Tax Credits. Any Tax refunds that are actually
received by Parent or the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, and any amounts
of credits against post-Closing Taxes actually obtained by Parent or the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries that relate to Taxes of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries for Tax periods or portions thereof ending on or before the Closing
Date shall be for the account of Stockholder Representative, and Parent shall
pay over to Stockholder Representative any such refund or the amount of any such
credit (net of any Taxes or other expenses) within 15 days after receipt or
entitlement thereto. No payment shall be required under this Section 10.8 for
any Tax refund or credit attributable to a refund or credit which was taken into
account in computing the Working Capital adjustment or is attributable to the
exercise or cancellation of the options to purchase Company Common Stock set
forth on Schedule 10.2(d).

                                  MISCELLANEOUS

           12.1. Stockholder Representative.

           (a) Each Securityholder hereby irrevocably appoints Rodney D. Windley
as such Securityholder's representative, attorney-in-fact and agent, with full
power of substitution to act in the name, place and stead of such Securityholder
with respect to the transactions contemplated under this Agreement and the
Company Documents and to act on behalf of such Securityholder in any amendment
of, or consent or waiver under, or dispute or litigation involving, this
Agreement and the Company Documents and to do or refrain from doing all such
further acts and things, and to execute all such documents, as such Stockholder
Representative shall deem necessary or appropriate in conjunction with any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Company Documents,
including the power:

               (i) to take all action necessary or desirable in connection with
          the waiver of any condition to the obligations of the Securityholders
          to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

               (ii) to negotiate, execute and deliver all ancillary agreements,
          statements, certificates, statements, notices, approvals, extensions,
          waivers, undertakings, amendments and other documents required or
          permitted to be given in connection with the consummation of the
          transactions contemplated by this Agreement including without
          limitation, calculation of the True Up and any matters with respect to
          the Escrow Agreement (it being understood that such Securityholder
          shall execute and deliver any such documents which the Stockholder
          Representative agrees to execute);


                                       82
<PAGE>
               (iii) to give and receive all notices and communications to be
          given or received under this Agreement and to receive service of
          process in connection with the any claims under this Agreement,
          including service of process in connection with arbitration; and

               (iv) to take all actions which under this Agreement may be taken
          by the Securityholders and to do or refrain from doing any further act
          or deed on behalf of the Securityholder which the Stockholder
          Representative deems necessary or appropriate in his sole discretion
          relating to the subject matter of this Agreement as fully and
          completely as such Securityholder could do if personally present.

           (b) If Rodney D. Windley becomes unable to serve as Stockholder
Representative, such other Person or Persons as may be designated by a majority
in ownership interest of the Securityholders shall succeed as the Stockholder
Representative. Each Stockholder agrees that such agency is coupled with an
interest and, therefore, are irrevocable without the consent of the Stockholder
Representative, shall survive the death, incapacity, bankruptcy, dissolution or
liquidation of any Securityholder.

           (c) In furtherance of his obligations hereunder, the Stockholder
Representative is expressly authorized to retain accountants, legal counsel and
other agents. All fees and expenses incurred by the Stockholder Representative
hereunder, including fees and costs of accountants, legal counsel or other
agents retained by the Stockholder Representative, and all fees, expenses,
losses and other obligations of the Securityholders pursuant to this Agreement,
shall be allocated among the Principal Securityholders based on their respective
pro rata shares. Stockholder Representative may, to the extent that any funds
are payable to the Principal Stockholders, pursuant to the Indemnification
Agreement, cause the applicable Escrow Agent to pay to the Stockholder
Representative out of such amounts, any reimbursement for fees, expenses,
disbursements and advances due to the Stockholder Representative under this
Section.

           (d) Neither the Stockholder Representative nor any agent employed by
it shall incur any liability to any Securityholder relating to the performance
of its duties hereunder except for actions or omissions constituting fraud,
gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Securityholders severally (based on
their pro rate ownership interests) hereby agree to indemnify the Stockholder
Representative and any agent employed by him for, and hold them harmless
against, any loss, liability or expense incurred without fraud or bad faith on
the part of the Stockholder Representative arising out of or in connection with
his serving as Stockholder Representative.

           (e) Each Securityholder acknowledges that such Securityholder has had
opportunity to consult with an attorney of its choice regarding the contents,
subject matter, and desirability of entering into this Agreement and each has
either received or waived such advice.


                                       83

           12.2. Fees and Expenses. Except as otherwise expressly provided
herein, whether or not the Merger is consummated, Parent, the Company and the
Securityholders shall each bear their own expenses incurred in connection with
the negotiation and execution of this Agreement, the Company Documents, the
Principal Securityholder Documents, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby.

           12.3. Amendment or Supplement. At any time prior to the Effective
Time, this Agreement may be amended or supplemented in any and all respects by
written agreement of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company and the Stockholder
Representative, by action taken by their respective Boards of Directors, if
applicable, so long as no amendment that requires stockholder approval under
applicable Laws shall be made without the requisite approval of such
stockholders.

           12.4. Extension of Time, Waiver, Etc. At any time prior to the
Effective Time, any Party may, subject to applicable Law, (a) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of any other Party hereto,
(b) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or acts of any
other Party hereto or (c) waive compliance by any other Party with any of the
agreements contained herein or, except as otherwise provided herein, waive any
of such Party's conditions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or delay
by any Party in exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof
nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further
exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right hereunder. Any agreement on
the part of a Party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only
if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such Party.

           12.5. Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by
operation of Law or otherwise, by any of the Parties without the prior written
consent of the other Parties (provided, that the Stockholder Representative may
provide consent for and on behalf of all Securityholders), except (i) that
Merger Sub may assign, in its sole discretion, any of or all its rights,
interests and obligations under this Agreement to any wholly-owned Subsidiary of
Parent, in which event, all references in this Agreement to Merger Sub shall be
deemed references to such Subsidiary but no such assignment shall relieve Merger
Sub of any of its obligations hereunder, and (ii) that each of Merger Sub and
Parent may collaterally assign its rights and interests (but not its
obligations) under this Agreement to the lenders providing Financing and any
agent for such lenders, as security for the Financing. Subject to the preceding
sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be
enforceable by, the Parties and their respective successors and permitted
assigns. Any purported assignment not permitted under this Section 12.5 shall be
null and void.

           12.6. Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement
(including the Schedules and Exhibits hereto), the Company Documents, the
Principal Securityholder Documents, the Parent Documents and the Confidentiality
Agreement constitute the entire agreement, and supersede all other prior
agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the Parties, or any
of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and are not
intended to and shall not confer upon any Person other than the Parties any
rights or remedies hereunder.

           12.7. Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial.

           (a) This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance
with, the laws of the State of Delaware, applicable to contracts executed in and
to be performed entirely within that State, without regard to conflicts of laws
principles.

           (b) All actions and proceedings arising out of or relating to this
Agreement shall be heard and determined in the Chancery Court of the State of
Delaware or any federal court sitting in the State of Delaware, and the Parties
hereby irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of such court (and, in
the case of appeals, appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any such action
or proceeding and irrevocably waive the defense of an inconvenient forum to the
maintenance of any such action or proceeding. The consent to jurisdiction set
forth in this paragraph shall not constitute general consents to service of
process in the State of Delaware and shall have no effect for any purpose except
as provided in this paragraph and shall not be deemed to confer rights on any
Person other than the Parties. The Parties agree that a final judgment in any
such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by
applicable law.

           (c) Each of the Parties hereby irrevocably waives any and all rights
to trial by jury in any legal proceeding arising out of or related to this
Agreement.

           12.8. Specific Enforcement. The Parties agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It
is accordingly agreed that the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement in the Chancery Court of the State of
Delaware or any federal court sitting in the State of Delaware, without bond or
other security being required, this being in addition to any other remedy to
which they are entitled at law or in equity.

Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed given (i) when delivered

negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the Parties as closely as possible to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law in an acceptable manner to the end that the transactions
contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent possible.

shall constitute one and the same agreement) and shall become effective when one
