through other members of the Buyer Rights Chain Group, as applicable, use

FibroCaps Product in the United States and the European Union and, if either
or both such Regulatory Approvals are obtained, until the expiration of the
Diligence Period set forth in section 1.5(c)(i)(a)(B) below, the Buyer shall
itself and/or with or through other members of the Buyer Rights Chain Group,
as applicable, use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to commercialize the
FibroCaps Product in the United States and/or the European Union, as
applicable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyers obligations under this
Section 1.5(c):

 



 

(a) shall expire (A) as to Milestones #1 and #2, on January 1, 2016 (save as
provided in the chart set forth in Section 1.5(b) above) and (B) as to

First Commercial Sale in the United States or (II) First Commercial Sale in
the European Union;

 



 

(b) shall not include an obligation to seek any additional Regulatory Approval
or label expansion for the Fibrocaps Product (A) in the United States

 



      
 

 



 

following the initial Regulatory Approval in the United States or (B) in the
European Union following the initial Regulatory Approval in the European
Union; and

 



 

(c) shall not include an obligation to conduct any clinical trial or
nonclinical study of the FibroCaps Product, whether or not such studies would
be necessary for any Regulatory Approval other than a post-regulatory approval
pediatric indication study.

 



 

(ii) If the Buyer permanently terminates or abandons all efforts to obtain the
Regulatory Approvals and, if commenced as of such time, commercialization
activities with respect to the FibroCaps Product, the Buyer shall send written
notice thereof to the Representative together with an explanation of the
reasons for such cessation of activities.

 



 

(iii) If the Representative in good faith believes that the Buyer has breached
its obligations under this Section 1.5, then the Representative may provide
the Buyer with written notice thereof, which notice shall specify the alleged
breach. If such notice is given, the Buyer shall designate one or more
representatives to meet with the Representative (in person at the Buyers
offices or by telephone) within fifteen (15) Business Days from the date of
such notice to discuss the Representatives belief that the Buyer has breached
its obligations under this Section 1.5. The discussion between the Buyers
representative(s) and the Representative shall be subject to the
confidentiality obligations of Section 1.7(d) and regarded as for settlement
purposes only, and no statement made in the course of the discussion shall be
admissible in any subsequent Legal Proceeding, although the fact that
something is stated in the course of the discussion will not preclude a party
to a Legal Proceeding from adducing other evidence of an identical or similar
nature that otherwise would be permitted in the Legal Proceeding. In the event
that the Representative and the Buyers representatives are unable to resolve
the Representatives claim of the alleged breach by (A) the date that is
thirty (30) Business Days after such meeting, or (B) the date that is sixty
(60) Business Days after the written notice from the Representative to the
Buyer of the alleged breach if no meeting (whether in person or by telephone)
has been held by such date, then the Representative may pursue any available
remedies in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, subject to Section
1.5(c)(iv), unless the Buyer and the Representative mutually agree to an
extension to the foregoing time periods.

 



 

(iv) Nothing herein shall constitute a guarantee by the Buyer of the
achievement of any or all of the Milestone Events. Save in the event of fraud
or knowing misrepresentation, the Buyers maximum aggregate liability for any
and all breaches by the Buyer of its obligations under this Section 1.5(c)
shall be limited to the unpaid portion(s), if any, of the Milestone Payment(s)
that the Buyer would have become obligated to pay if the Buyer had exercised
the requisite Commercially Reasonable Efforts, together with (A) the Sellers
reasonable legal fees and expenses incurred in enforcing their rights under
this Section 1.5 and (B) interest on such amount from the date the applicable
Milestone Payment became payable

 



      
 

 



 

until the date on which payment is made at an annual rate of [**] percent
([**]%) (accrued daily and compounded monthly).

 



 

(d) _Reporting; Recordkeeping; Audits_.

 



 

(i) _Reporting_. Until the earlier of (A) such time as all Milestone Payments
have been paid by the Buyer pursuant to this Section 1.5 or (B) the end of the
calendar quarter following the expiration of the time period for the
achievement of Milestones #3, 4 and 5, the Buyer shall provide the
Representative, on an annual basis on or about April 1st of each year within
such period, a written summary in reasonable detail regarding the status of
the achievement of the Milestone Events, including a report of Net Sales
generated during such period.

 



 

(ii) _Recordkeeping_. Until the earlier of (A) such time as all Milestone
Payments have been paid by the Buyer pursuant to this Section 1.5 or (B) the
end of the calendar quarter following the expiration of the time period for
the achievement of Milestones #3, 4 and 5 (the " _Audit Period_ "), and
thereafter as needed for any audit requested during the Audit Period with
respect to such Milestone Events, the Buyer shall, and shall cause each other
Person in the Buyer Rights Chain Group to, keep complete and accurate books
and records of Net Sales to the extent necessary to ascertain properly and to
verify the payments owed hereunder.

 



 

(iii) _Audits_. Upon the written request of the Representative, the Buyer
shall, and shall use Reasonable Best Efforts to cause each other Person in the
Buyer Rights Chain Group to, permit a recognized independent accounting firm
(the " _Independent Auditor_ ") selected by the Representative and reasonably
satisfactory to Buyer or, in the case of Persons in the Buyer Rights Chain
Group who are not the Buyer or its Affiliates, selected by the Representative
and reasonably satisfactory to such Person, at the Company Equityholders
expense (and subject to entry into a customary confidentiality agreement), to
have access solely in response to a request made during the Audit Period, upon
reasonable prior notice and during normal business hours, but no more than one
(1) time during any calendar year, to inspect the books and records specified
in Section 1.5(d)(ii) for the two (2) preceding years (but only to the extent
not previously audited pursuant to a previous audit pursuant to this Section
1.5(d)(iii)) and only if in response to a request made during the Audit Period
for the purpose of determining the accuracy of the reports of Net Sales
described in Section 1.5(d)(i).

 



 

(e) _Payments_.

 



 

(i) Each Net Milestone Payment shall, subject to the provisions of Section
7.6, be paid in cash by the Buyer to the Paying Agent for further distribution
to the Company Equityholders within the time period set forth in Section
1.5(b) within which the Buyer is obligated to notify the Representative of the
achievement of the applicable Milestone. Any portion of any Net Milestone
Payment paid to the Paying Agent shall be paid by the Paying Agent (reduced by
any applicable withholding as set forth in Section 1.11) to the Company

 



      
 

 



 

Equityholders in accordance with the Closing Date Allocation Schedule. The
Buyer shall, subject to the provisions of Section 7.6, pay to Barclays the
portion of each Milestone Payment set forth on the Closing Date Allocation
Schedule.

 



 

(ii) For the avoidance of doubt, no Milestone Payment may become payable more
than one time.

 



 

(f) _Non-Transferability_. The right of any Company Equityholder to receive
any amounts with respect to a Net Milestone Payment (i) shall not be evidenced
by a certificate or other instrument, (ii) shall not be assignable or
otherwise transferable by such Company Equityholder, except by will, upon
death or by operation of Law, other than in accordance with this Section
1.5(f), _provided_ , however, that a Company Equityholder who held, as of
immediately prior to Closing, Preferred Shares shall be entitled to assign
having given notice to the Buyer of its intention to assign its rights to
receive any amount with respect to a Net Milestone Payment, disclosing the
identity of the transferee and providing evidence satisfactory to the Buyer
that such assignment is exempt from the registration and qualification
requirements of the Securities Act and other applicable Law, and (iii) does
not represent any right other than the right to receive the consideration set
forth in this Section 1.5. Any attempted transfer of the right to any amounts
with respect to a Net Milestone Payment by any holder thereof (other than as
specifically permitted by the immediately preceding sentence) shall be null
and void.

 



 

1.6 _Adjustment Before and After the Closing_. The Closing Purchase Price
shall be subject to adjustment as follows:

 



 

(a) Not later than ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the
Company shall prepare and deliver to the Buyer a statement (the " _Estimated
Closing Adjustment Statement_ ") setting forth the Companys estimated
calculation of the Closing Adjustment Items and the Estimated Closing
Adjustment resulting therefrom, together with all relevant backup materials,
in detail reasonably acceptable to the Buyer. If within four (4) Business Days
following the Buyers actual receipt of the Estimated Closing Adjustment
Statement, the Buyer has not given the Company notice of its objection to the
amount of the estimated Closing Adjustment Items and the Estimated Closing
Adjustment resulting therefrom, the Closing Purchase Price shall be adjusted
as set forth in the Estimated Closing Adjustment Statement. If the Buyer gives
such notice of objection, the Company and the Buyer will work together in good
faith to resolve the issues in dispute. If all disputed issues are resolved,
the amounts as agreed upon by the Buyer and the Company shall be used to
complete the Estimated Closing Adjustment. If the Buyer and the Company are
unable to resolve all such disputed issues within two (2) Business Days
following the Buyers receipt of the Estimated Closing Adjustment Statement,
the Estimated Closing Adjustment shall be as determined by the Buyer acting
reasonably and in good faith.

 



 

(b) Not later than 60 calendar days after the Closing Date, the Buyer shall
deliver to the Representative the Closing Adjustment Statement setting forth
the Buyers

 



      
 

 



 

calculation of the Closing Adjustment Items. The Closing Adjustment Statement
shall be prepared in accordance with IFRS applied consistently with the
Companys past practices (to the extent such past practices are consistent
with IFRS).

 



 

(c) The Closing Adjustment Statement delivered pursuant to Section 1.6(b)
above shall be accompanied by (i) all relevant backup materials, in detail
reasonably acceptable to the Representative, and (ii) a statement setting
forth the amount, if any, by which the total of the Closing Adjustment Items
set forth therein is greater than, or less than, the amount of the Closing
Adjustment Items used in the determination of the Estimated Closing
Adjustment.

 



 

(d) In the event that the Representative disputes the Closing Adjustment
Statement or the Buyers calculation of the Closing Adjustment Items, the
Representative shall notify the Buyer in writing (the " _Dispute Notice_ ") of
the amount, nature and basis of such dispute, within 60 calendar days after
delivery of the Closing Adjustment Statement. Any such Dispute Notice shall
specify those items or amounts as to which the Representative disagrees, and
the Representative shall be deemed to have agreed with all other items and
amounts contained in the Closing Adjustment Statement and the amount of the
Closing Adjustment Items delivered pursuant to Sections 1.6(b) and 1.6(c). In
the event of such a dispute, the Buyer and the Representative shall meet to
determine whether they can reach agreement on the disputed items or amounts in
order to determine the amount of the Closing Adjustment Items, which amount
shall not be less than the Buyers calculation delivered pursuant to Section
1.6(c) or more than the Representatives calculation delivered (in the event
that the Representative has so delivered a calculation) pursuant to this
Section 1.6(d). If the Buyer and the Representative are unable to resolve the
dispute within 30 calendar days after delivery of the Dispute Notice, then any
remaining items in dispute shall be submitted to an Independent Auditor. All
determinations and calculations pursuant to this Section 1.6(d) shall consider
only those Closing Adjustment Items as to which the Representative has
disagreed, shall be in writing and shall be delivered to the Buyer and the
Representative as promptly as practicable. The determination of the
Independent Auditor as to the resolution of any dispute shall be binding and
conclusive upon all Parties. A judgment on the determination made by the
Independent Auditor pursuant to this Section 1.6 may be entered in and
enforced by the Arbitral Tribunal or any court having jurisdiction thereover.

 



 

(e) The fees and expenses of the Independent Auditor in connection with the
resolution of disputes pursuant to Section 1.6(d) shall be shared equally by
the Company Equityholders (from the Escrow Fund), on the one hand, and the
Buyer, on the other hand; _provided_ that if the Independent Auditor
determines that one such party has adopted a position or positions with
respect to the Closing Adjustment Statement or the amount of the Closing
Adjustment Items that is frivolous or clearly without merit, the Independent
Auditor may, in its discretion, assign a greater portion of any such fees and
expenses to such party.

 



 

(f) Immediately upon the expiration of the 60 calendar day period for giving
the Dispute Notice, if no such notice is given, or upon notification by the
Representative to the

 



      
 

 



 

Buyer that no such notice will be given, or immediately upon the resolution of
disputes, if any, pursuant to this Section 1.6, the Closing Purchase Price
shall be adjusted as follows (the " _Adjusted Purchase Price_ "):

 



 

(i) If the amount of the Final Closing Adjustment exceeds the amount of the
Estimated Closing Adjustment, the Buyer shall be entitled to recover such
deficiency pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement;

 



 

(ii) If the amount of the Final Closing Adjustment is equal to the amount of
the Estimated Closing Adjustment, the Closing Purchase Price shall not be
adjusted; and

 



 

(iii) If the amount of the Estimated Closing Adjustment exceeds the Final
Closing Adjustment, the Buyer shall deliver to the Paying Agent an amount in
immediately available funds equal to the amount of such surplus (the "
_Closing Adjustment Surplus_ "). The percentage of the Closing Adjustment
Surplus, if any, to be distributed to each Company Equityholder by the Paying
Agent shall be as set forth on the Closing Date Allocation Schedule.

 



 

1.7 _Representative_.

 



 

(a) The Company Equityholders hereby appoint the Representative as the
representative, attorney-in-fact and agent of the Company Equityholders in
connection with the sale of the Company Shares and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement and in any litigation
or arbitration involving this Agreement and/or the Escrow Agreement. In
connection therewith, the Representative is authorized to do or refrain from
doing all further acts and things, and to execute all such documents as the
Representative shall deem necessary or appropriate, and, except as otherwise
expressly provided in this Agreement, shall have the power and authority to:

 



 

(i) act for the Company Equityholders with regard to all matters pertaining to
this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement;

 



 

(ii) act for the Company Equityholders to transact matters of arbitration or
litigation;

 



 

(iii) execute and deliver all amendments, waivers, ancillary agreements,
certificates and documents that the Representative deems necessary or
appropriate in connection with the sale of the Company Shares and the
consummation of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the
Escrow Agreement;

 



 

(iv) receive funds, make payments of funds, and give receipts for funds;

 



       
 

 



 

(v) do or refrain from doing any further act or deed on behalf of the Company
Equityholders that the Representative deems necessary or appropriate in its
discretion relating to the subject matter of this Agreement or the Escrow
Agreement as fully and completely as the Company Equityholders could do if
personally present;

 



 

(vi) give and receive all notices required to be given or received by the
Company Equityholders under this Agreement;

 



 

(vii) give any written direction to the Escrow Agent;

 



 

(viii) agree to, negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of and
comply with arbitration awards and court orders with respect to claims for
indemnification made by the Buyer under Article VII; and

 



 

(ix) receive service of process in connection with any claims under this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement.

 



 

(b) All decisions and actions by the Representative shall be binding upon all
Company Equityholders, and no Company Equityholder shall have the right to
object, dissent, protest or otherwise contest the same.

 



 

(c) At the Closing, the Buyer shall pay the Representative Expense Amount to
the Representative, which Representative Expense Amount shall be maintained by
the Representative in a segregated account. The Representative shall be
reimbursed by the Company Equityholders (and not by the Buyer or the Company)
for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in the performance of its
duties (including the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel) under this
Agreement from the Representative Fund and, if such fund is insufficient to
pay such expenses, from the first proceeds from the Escrow Fund or Net
Milestone Payments otherwise available for distribution to the Company
Equityholders. Upon the determination of the Representative that the
Representative Fund is no longer necessary in connection with any claim for
indemnification under Article VII or any dispute regarding Milestone Payments,
the Representative shall distribute to the Company Equityholders (solely out
of the Representative Fund) the Representative Account Payment. The
Representative shall hold, invest, reinvest and disburse the Representative
Fund in trust for all of the Company Equityholders, and the Representative
Fund shall not be used for any other purpose and shall not be available to the
Buyer to satisfy any claims hereunder.

 



 

(d) The Representative shall treat confidentially and not use other than in
the performance of its duties as the Representative and not disclose any
information disclosed to it pursuant to this Agreement to anyone except as
required by Law, provided that (i) the Representative may disclose to legal
counsel and other advisors under an obligation of confidentiality and non-use
in such advisors capacity as such (for the purpose of advising the
Representative and the Company Equityholders on any information disclosed to
the

 



      
 

 



 

Representative pursuant to this Agreement), (ii) the Representative (or legal
counsel or other advisor to whom information is disclosed pursuant to clause
(i) above) may disclose in any Legal Proceeding relating to this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby (or, in either case, discussion in
preparation therefor) any information disclosed to the Representative pursuant
to this Agreement and (iii) the Representative may disclose to its
professional advisers and any member of its board (but not to any other
Person, including any investor in any of the foregoing Persons) any
information disclosed to the Representative, subject to the Persons to whom
the disclosure is to be made agreeing with the Buyer in writing to
restrictions on the disclosure and use of such information consistent with the
restrictions to which the Representative is subject pursuant to this Section
1.7(d).

 



 

(e) The Company Equityholders may from time to time appoint another person to
act as their representative, provided that such appointment shall not take
effect until it has been notified to the Buyer in writing signed by or on
behalf of holders of Company Securities who held, as of immediately prior to
the Closing, a majority (by voting power) of the then outstanding Company
Securities) (the " _Required Sellers_ "), and such substituted representative
shall be deemed to be the Representative for all purposes of this Agreement.
Upon any replacement of the Representative, the Representative being replaced
shall transfer to the new Representative the balance of any unexpended
Representative Expense Amount.

 



 

(f) Each Company Equityholder agrees that:

 



 

(i) the Buyer shall be entitled to rely conclusively on the instructions and
decisions of the Representative as to the determination of the Final Closing
Adjustment and the Adjusted Purchase Price, the settlement of any disputes or
claims under this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, or any other actions
required or permitted to be taken by the Representative hereunder, and no
party hereunder shall have any cause of action against the Buyer for any
action taken by the Buyer in reliance upon the instructions or decisions of
the Representative;

 



 

(ii) the provisions of this Section 1.7 are independent and severable, are
irrevocable and coupled with an interest and shall be enforceable
notwithstanding any rights or remedies that any Company Equityholder may have
in connection with the sale of the Company Shares and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement;

 



 

(iii) remedies available at Law for any breach of the provisions of this
Section 1.7 are inadequate; therefore, the Buyer shall be entitled to
temporary and permanent injunctive relief without the necessity of proving
damages if the Buyer brings an action to enforce the provisions of this
Section 1.7; and

 



 

(iv) the provisions of this Section 1.7 shall be binding upon the executors,
heirs, legal representatives, personal representatives, successor trustees and
successors of each Company Equityholder, and any references in this Agreement
to a Company

 



      
 

 



 

Equityholder shall mean and include the successors to the rights of each
applicable Company Equityholder hereunder, whether pursuant to testamentary
disposition, the Laws of descent and distribution or otherwise.

 



 

1.8 _Payment Fund_. The procedures for the exchange of the outstanding Company
Shares for the consideration to be paid to the Company Equityholders pursuant
to this Agreement are as follows:

 



 

(a) _Paying Agent_. At or prior to the Closing, the Buyer shall deposit the
Payment Fund with the Paying Agent for the payment of the Closing Purchase
Price to the holders of Company Shares through the Paying Agent. Any earnings
from investment of the Payment Fund shall accrue to the benefit of the Buyer.

 



 

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. Each Company Equityholder shall be paid in
accordance with the Closing Date Allocation Schedule (i) promptly after the
Closing, that portion of the Closing Purchase Price that such Company
Equityholder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of this
Agreement, plus (ii) if, as and when payable, the portion of all other Total
Consideration that such Company Equityholder has the right to receive pursuant
to the provisions of this Agreement in respect of all Company Shares held by
such Company Equityholder.

 



 

1.9 _Allocation Schedule_.

 



 

(a) The Initial Allocation Schedule attached hereto as _Exhibit A_ sets forth
a summary of the allocation (estimated as of the date hereof) of the amounts
payable at the Closing to the Company Equityholders. The Company shall deliver
to the Buyer and the Paying Agent, at least four (4) Business Days prior to
the Closing, the Closing Date Allocation Schedule (which schedule shall
reflect the Estimated Closing Adjustment as determined in accordance with
Section 1.6(a)). The Paying Agent shall make all payments and deliveries of
the Closing Purchase Price and the Total Consideration in accordance with the
Closing Date Allocation Schedule.

 



 

(b) It is expressly acknowledged and agreed that the preparation of the
Closing Date Allocation Schedule and the allocation of the Closing Purchase
Price and the Total Consideration set forth therein are the sole
responsibility of the Company Equityholders and that Buyer and the Paying
Agent shall be entitled to rely thereon, without any obligation to investigate
or verify the accuracy or correctness thereof and to make payments in
accordance therewith. None of Buyer, the Paying Agent or any of their
Affiliates shall have any liability in connection with any claims by any
Company Equityholder or any other Person relating to any alleged inaccuracy or
miscalculations in, or otherwise relating to, the preparation of the Closing
Date Allocation Schedule and the allocation of the Total Consideration set
forth therein or payments made in accordance therewith. In consideration for
its receipt of its allocation of Total Consideration in accordance with (and
subject to) the Closing Date Allocation Schedule, each

 



      
 

 



 

Company Equityholder hereby irrevocably waives, releases and promises never to
assert any claims or causes of action, promises or similar rights of any type
(however described and however arising) that such Company Equityholder may
currently have, or may have in the future, whether or not now known, against
the Trust Foundations, the Company, the Buyer or any of their respective
predecessors, successors, parent corporations, subsidiaries, stockholders,
directors, officers, employees, consultants, attorneys, agents, assigns and
employee benefit plans (the " _Released Parties_ ") with respect to any matter
related to the allocation of the Total Consideration in accordance with the
Closing Date Allocation Schedule (the " _Released Claims_ "). Each Company
Equityholder acknowledges that it may hereafter discover facts other than or
different from those that it knows or believes to be true with respect to the
subject matter of the Released Claims, but it hereby expressly agrees that, on
and as of the Closing, such Company Equityholder shall have waived and fully,
finally and forever settled and released any known or unknown, suspected or
unsuspected, asserted or unasserted, contingent or noncontingent claim with
respect to the Released Claims, whether or not concealed or hidden, without
regard to the subsequent discovery or existence of such different or
additional facts.

 



 

(c) Each Company Equityholder hereby acknowledges and agrees that if it should
hereafter make any claim or demand or commence or threaten to commence any
action, claim or proceeding against any Released Party with respect to any
Released Claim, this Section 1.9(c) may be raised as a complete bar to any
such action, claim or proceeding, and the applicable Released Party may
recover from such Company Equityholder all costs incurred in connection with
such action, claim or proceeding, including attorneys fees.

 



 

1.10 _Escrow Arrangements_.

 



 

(a) On the Closing Date, the Buyer shall deliver to the Escrow Agent the
Original Escrow Amount for the purpose of (i) providing security for any
adjustment to the amount of the Closing Purchase Price pursuant to Section 1.6
and (ii) securing the indemnification obligations of the Company Equityholders
set forth in Article VII.

 



 

(b) In the event of the occurrence of the indemnification circumstances set
forth in _Schedule 7.2(e)_ , the Buyer shall be entitled to withhold and shall
deliver to the Escrow Agent $6,000,000 from Milestone Payment #1 (when paid)
(the " _Second Escrow Deposit_ ") solely for the purpose of securing the
indemnification obligations of the Sellers set forth in Section 7.2(e).

 



 

(c) The Escrow Fund shall be held by the Escrow Agent under the Escrow
Agreement pursuant to the terms thereof. The Escrow Fund shall be held as a
trust fund and shall not be subject to any lien, attachment, trustee process
or any other judicial process of any creditor of any party, and shall be held
and disbursed solely for the purposes and in accordance with the terms of the
Escrow Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) The Sellers and the Option Holders named on the signature pages hereto, by
their execution of this Agreement, and the DR Holders, by their execution of
the Adherence Agreement, hereby approve the Escrow Agreement and of all of the
arrangements relating thereto, including the placement of the Original Escrow
Amount and the Second Escrow Deposit in the escrow established pursuant to
this Section 1.10.

 



 

1.11 _Withholding Obligations_. Each of the Buyer, the Company, the Paying
Agent and the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to any provision of this Agreement to
any Person an amount equal to such amounts in respect of Taxes as it is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code, or any other applicable Law. To the extent that amounts are so
withheld by the Buyer, the Company, the Paying Agent or the Escrow Agent, as
the case may be, such withheld amounts shall be accounted for in full to the
relevant taxation authority and shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Persons in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made by the Buyer, the Company, the Paying Agent
or the Escrow Agent, as the case may be. The Buyer, the Paying Agent and the
Escrow Agent shall also have the right to collect Forms W-8 or W-9, or such
other forms relating to withholding obligations as may be applicable, from
such Persons. To the extent that the Buyer, acting reasonably, considers that
a withholding is due from any Milestone Payment payable to a Company
Equityholder, the Buyer shall notify such Company Equityholder before making
such withholding (and, in any event, not less than five (5) Business Days
before making any withholding) and in such event the payment of any amount due
to such Company Equityholder shall be postponed for a period (not exceeding 20
Business Days) during which the Buyer and the relevant Company Equityholder
shall discuss in good faith whether any withholding is required.

pursuant to or as a result of which a material asset owned, purportedly owned

of terms of employment (whether or not conditioned upon the occurrence of any
other event), or (iii) to treat himself or herself as redundant or released

any written or electronic communications from any Governmental Entity with
respect to a Company Plan (including any voluntary correction submissions),
have been made available to the Buyer. All Company Plans comply in all
material respects with all applicable Laws.

 



 

(b) Each Company Plan has been administered in all material respects in
accordance with its terms and applicable Law, and the Company and its
Subsidiaries have met all obligations with respect to each Company Plan and
have timely made all required contributions thereto. All filings and reports
as to each Company Plan required to have been submitted to any Governmental
Entity have been timely submitted.

 



 

(c) There are no Legal Proceedings (except claims for benefits payable in the
normal operation of the Company Plans and proceedings with respect to
qualified domestic relations orders) against or involving any Company Plan or
asserting any rights or claims to benefits under any Company Plan that would
reasonably be expected to give rise to any liability. No Company Plan is or
within the last three (3) calendar years has been the subject of, or has
received notice that it is the subject of, examination by a Governmental
Entity or a participant in a government sponsored amnesty, voluntary
compliance or similar program.

Revenue Service to the effect that such Company Plans are qualified and the
plans and the trusts related thereto are exempt from federal income taxes
under Sections 401(a) and 501(a), respectively, of the Code (or an application
for the same is pending), no such determination letter or opinion letter has
been revoked and, to the Knowledge of the Warrantors, revocation has not been
threatened, and no act or omission has occurred, that would reasonably be
likely to adversely affect its qualification. Neither the Company nor any
Subsidiary has any liability under an Employee Benefit Plan which is subject
to Section 412 of the Code or Title IV of ERISA. Neither the Company nor any
Subsidiary has any liability in respect of any "multiemployer plan" (as
defined in Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA).

which contributions have not been made or properly accrued and there are no

beyond retirement or other termination of employment, other than as applicable
Law requires, and there have been no written or oral commitments inconsistent
with the foregoing. Any welfare benefits required to be provided beyond
retirement or other termination of employment are provided at the former
employees expense, and not at the Companys expense.

 



 

(g) No act or omission has occurred and no condition exists with respect to
any Company Plan that would subject the Buyer, the Company, any Subsidiary, or
any plan participant to (i) any material fine, penalty, Tax or liability of
any kind imposed under any applicable Law or (ii) any contractual
indemnification or contribution obligation protecting any fiduciary, insurer
or service provider with respect to any Company Plan, nor will the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement give rise to any such liability.

 



 

(h) The Company is not liable to any of its employees or former employees on
the basis that it has not properly fulfilled its obligation to arrange for all
such employees and former employees to participate in the kind of Company Plan
in which the Company either agreed or was/is legally bound to have them
participate.

 



 

(i) Each Company Plan is amendable and terminable unilaterally by the Company
and any Subsidiary that is a party thereto or covered thereby at any time
without liability or expense to the Company, any Subsidiary or such Company
Plan as a result thereof (other than for benefits accrued through the date of
termination or amendment and reasonable

 



      
 

 



 

administrative expenses related thereto) and no Company Plan, plan
documentation or agreement, summary plan description or other written
communication distributed generally to employees by its terms prohibits the
Company or any Subsidiary from amending or terminating any such Company Plan,
or in any way limits such action. The investment vehicles used to fund any
Company Plan may be changed at any time without incurring a sales charge,
surrender fee or other similar expense.

employment or compensation guarantee or (C) providing severance benefits or
other benefits after the termination of employment of such stockholder,
shareholder director, executive officer or key employee and (ii) agreement or

stock appreciation right plan, restricted stock plan, stock purchase plan,
severance benefit plan or Company Plan, any of the benefits of which will be
increased, or the vesting of the benefits of which will be accelerated, by the
occurrence of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the

of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

compliance with Code Section 409A and IRS Notice 2005-1 and has been in
documentary compliance since January 1, 2009. No Company Plan that is a
"nonqualified deferred compensation plan" has been materially modified (as
determined under Notice 2005-1) after October 3, 2004. No event has occurred
that would be treated by Code Section 409A(b) as a transfer of property for
purposes of Code Section 83. No share option or unit appreciation right
granted by the Company or any Subsidiary had an exercise or measurement price
that was or may have been less than the fair market value of the underlying
share or equity units (as the case may be) as of the date such option or right
was granted, or has any feature for the deferral of compensation other than
the deferral of recognition of income until the later of exercise or
disposition of such option or right.

5.5 _Notice of Breaches_. During the Pre-Closing Period, the Sellers and the
Warrantors shall promptly deliver to the Buyer supplemental information
concerning events or circumstances occurring subsequent to the date hereof
which would render any representation, warranty or statement of the Sellers or
the Warrantors in this Agreement or the Disclosure Schedule inaccurate or
incomplete in any material respect at any time after the date of this
Agreement until the Closing. No such supplemental information shall be deemed
to avoid or cure any misrepresentation or breach of warranty or constitute an

(a) During the Pre-Closing Period, no Seller shall, and the Sellers shall
cause the Company and each Sellers and the Companys respective officers,

representative or otherwise, (i) initiate, solicit, knowingly encourage or
otherwise knowingly facilitate any inquiry, proposal, offer or discussion with
any party (other than the Buyer or its representatives) concerning any
acquisition, equity or debt financing, joint venture, merger, reorganization,
consolidation, recapitalization, business combination, liquidation,
dissolution, share exchange, sale of stock, sale or license of material assets
or similar business transaction involving the Company or any Subsidiary (each,
an " _Acquisition Transaction_ "), provided that nothing in this _Section
5.6_ shall prevent or restrict the Sellers and/or the Company from taking any
steps or entering into discussions (but not consummating any transaction) with
any Person in relation to an equity and/or convertible debt financing (but
where such equity and/or convertible debt financing involves third parties, no
third party (with its Affiliates) shall be permitted to acquire in excess of
19.9% of the Companys outstanding equity securities) to fund the Companys
operations (whether as part of an initial public offering of the Companys
Shares or otherwise) (ii) other than in the Ordinary Course of Business,
furnish any information concerning the business, properties or assets of the
Company or any Subsidiary or the Company Shares to any party (other than the
Buyer or its representatives), it being agreed that the foregoing exception
shall not permit the furnishing of any information to any party that any
Seller or Warrantor has reason to believe is considering an Acquisition
Transaction, or (iii) engage in negotiations or enter into any agreement with
any Person (other than the Buyer or its representatives) concerning any such
transaction.

 



 

(b) The Sellers shall, and shall cause the Company to, immediately notify any
party with which discussions or negotiations of the nature described in
Section 5.6(a) above were pending that the Sellers and the Company are
terminating such discussions or negotiations. If any Seller or the Company
receives any inquiry, proposal or offer of the nature described in Section
5.6(a) above, such Seller shall, and the Sellers shall cause the Company to,
within one (1) Business Day after such receipt, notify the Buyer of such
inquiry, proposal or offer, including the identity of the other party and the
terms of such inquiry, proposal or offer.

 



      
 

 



 

5.7 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, the Buyer will
pay all fees and expenses (including legal and accounting fees and expenses)
incurred by it in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and the
Unpaid Company Transaction Expenses shall be paid by the Company.

 



 

5.8 _Access to Suppliers_.

 



 

(a) _Discussions with CSL._ The Sellers shall, if requested by the Buyer,
enter into discussions with CSL in relation to, and use their Reasonable Best

confidentiality obligations as may reasonably be required by CSL.

 



 

(b) _Discussions with Quadrant._ The Sellers shall, if requested by the Buyer
and at the expense of the Buyer, cooperate with the Buyer to obtain such
amendments as the Buyer may request to the Quadrant Agreement.

 



 

5.9 _280G Covenant_. Not less than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing
Date, the Sellers shall cause the Company to submit to a shareholder vote, in
a manner that satisfies the shareholder approval requirements under Section
280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and regulations promulgated thereunder (which vote,
for the avoidance of doubt, shall not be made by the Representative), the
right of any "disqualified individual" (as defined in Section 280G(c) of the
Code) to receive any and all payments (or other benefits) contingent on the
consummation of the sale of the Company Shares and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2)(A)(i)
of the Code) to the extent necessary so that no payment received by such
"disqualified individual" would be a "parachute payment" under Section 280G(b)
of the Code (determined without regard to Section 280G(b)(4) of the Code).
Such vote shall establish the "disqualified individuals" right to the payment
or other compensation, and the Sellers shall cause the Company to obtain any
required waivers or consents from the "disqualified individual" prior to the
vote. In addition, the Sellers shall cause the Company to provide adequate
disclosure to Sellers that hold voting Company Shares of all material facts
concerning all payments to any "disqualified individual" that, but for such
vote, could be deemed "parachute payments" to a "disqualified individual"
under Section 280G of the Code in a manner that satisfies Section
280G(b)(5)(B)(ii) of the Code and regulations promulgated thereunder. At least
five (5) Business Days prior to the vote, the Buyer and its counsel shall have
the right to review and comment on all documents to be delivered to the
Sellers in connection with such vote and any required disqualified individual
waivers or consents, and the Sellers shall cause the Company to reflect all
reasonable comments of the Buyer thereon. Buyer and its counsel shall be
provided copies of all documents executed by the shareholders and disqualified
individuals in connection with the vote.

Plans intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code effective not later

of the Company, as well as the consolidated results of operations and cash

with GAAP.

Company to the Buyer. The Buyer Option Payment shall not be repayable by the

misrepresentation by the Sellers or the Warrantors; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that if

 



      
 

 



 

this Agreement is terminated in accordance with the provisions of Section
9.1(b) (provided that (i) references to representations and warranties
therein, shall be deemed to be references to representations and warranties as
given as at the date of this Agreement and not as the same may be repeated,
and (ii) the reference to Section 6.1(d) shall be disregarded) then the amount

interactions as needed with the Companys scientists, clinicians, regulatory,
statistical and other internal experts. During the Collaborative Data
Exploration Period, the Buyer shall be permitted to consult with (and provide
the Company Data Package to) external experts engaged by the Buyer who are
bound under conditions of confidentiality equivalent to those applicable to
the Buyer. Any analyses which are requested by the Buyer outside the scope of
pre-specified analyses will be undertaken with agreement from the Company,
such agreement not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. The
Buyer shall have the Collaborative Data Exploration Period to review the
materials contained in the Company Date Package in conjunction with the
Sellers and, upon the request of the Buyer from time to time but within the
Collaborative Data Exploration Period, the Sellers shall cause the Company to
meet (in person at the Buyers offices or by telephone) with representatives
of the Buyer to discuss the contents thereof and any questions the Buyer may
have with respect thereto.

harmless against, any and all Damages incurred or suffered by the Company, the
Buyer or any Affiliate thereof resulting from, relating to or constituting:

 



 

(a) any breach or inaccuracy, as of the date of this Agreement or as of the

(e) the matters set forth on _Schedule 7.2(_ _e_ _)_ or

7.3 _Indemnification Claims_.

 



 

(a) The Buyer shall give written notification to the Representative of the
commencement of any Third Party Action. Such notification shall be given
within 20 days after receipt by the Buyer of notice of such Third Party
Action, and shall describe in reasonable detail (to the extent then known by
the Buyer) the facts constituting the basis for such Third Party Action and
the amount of the claimed damages. No delay or failure on the part of the
Buyer in so notifying the Representative shall relieve the Company
Equityholders of any liability or obligation hereunder except to the extent of
any damage or liability caused by or arising out of such delay or failure.
Within 20 days after delivery of such notification, the Representative may,
upon written notice thereof to the Buyer, assume control of the defense of
such Third Party Action with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Buyer;
_provided_ that (i) the Representative may only assume control of such defense
if (A) it acknowledges in writing to the Buyer on behalf of all of the Company
Equityholders that any damages, fines, costs or other liabilities that may be
assessed against the Buyer in connection with such Third Party Action
constitute Damages for which the Buyer shall be indemnified pursuant to this
Article VII, (B) the ad damnum in such Third Party Action, taken together with
the estimated costs of defense thereof and the Claimed Amount with respect to
any unresolved claims for indemnification then pending, is less than or equal
to the current balance of the Escrow Fund, and (C) an adverse resolution of
the Third Party Action would not have a material adverse effect on the
goodwill or reputation of the Buyer or the business, operations or future
conduct of the Buyer and (ii) the Representative may not assume control of the
defense of any Third Party Action involving Taxes or criminal liability or in
which equitable relief is sought against the Buyer or any of its subsidiaries.
If the Representative does not, or is not permitted under the terms hereof to,
so assume control of the defense of a Third Party Action, the Buyer shall
control such defense. The Non-controlling Party may participate in such
defense at its own expense. The Controlling Party shall keep the Non-
controlling Party advised of the status of such Third Party Action and the
defense thereof and shall consider in good faith recommendations made by the
Non-controlling Party with respect thereto. The Non-controlling Party shall
furnish the Controlling Party with such information as it may have with
respect to such Third Party Action (including copies of any summons, complaint
or other pleading which may have been served on such party and any written
claim, demand, invoice, billing or other document evidencing or asserting the
same) and shall otherwise cooperate with and assist the Controlling Party in
the defense of such Third Party Action. The fees and expenses of counsel to
the Buyer with respect to a Third Party Action shall be considered Damages for
purposes of this Agreement if (i) the Buyer controls the defense of such Third
Party Action pursuant to the terms of this Section 7.3(a) or (ii) the
Representative

 



      
 

 



 

assumes control of such defense and the Buyer reasonably concludes that the
Company Equityholders and the Buyer have conflicting interests or different
defenses available with respect to such Third Party Action. Neither the
Company Equityholders nor the Representative shall agree to any settlement of,
or the entry of any judgment arising from, any Third Party Action without the
prior written consent of the Buyer, which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed; _provided_ that the consent of the Buyer shall not be
required if the Representative, on behalf of all of the Company Equityholders,
agrees in writing to pay any amounts payable pursuant to such settlement or
judgment and such settlement or judgment includes a complete release of the
Buyer from further liability and has no other adverse effect on the Buyer. The
Buyer shall not agree to any settlement of, or the entry of any judgment
arising from, any such Third Party Action without the prior written consent of
the Representative, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed.

 



 

(b) In order to seek indemnification under this Article VII, the Buyer shall
deliver a Claim Notice to the Representative. Within 30 days after delivery of
a Claim Notice, the Representative shall deliver to the Buyer a Response, in
which the Representative, on behalf of all of the Company Equityholders,
shall: (i) agree that the Buyer is entitled to receive all of the Claimed
Amount (in which case the Response shall be accompanied by a letter from the
Representative instructing the Escrow Agent to disburse to the Buyer from the
Escrow Fund an amount in cash equal to the Claimed Amount), (ii) agree that
the Buyer is entitled to receive the Agreed Amount (in which case the Response
shall be accompanied by a letter from the Representative instructing the
Escrow Agent to disburse to the Buyer from the Escrow Fund an amount in cash
equal to the Agreed Amount) or (iii) dispute that the Buyer is entitled to
receive any of the Claimed Amount. If no Response is delivered by the
Representative within such 30-day period, the Company Equityholders shall be
deemed to have agreed that all of the Claimed Amount is owed to the Buyer.
Acceptance by the Buyer of partial payment of any Claimed Amount shall be
without prejudice to the Buyers right to claim the balance of any such
Claimed Amount.

 



 

(c) Any dispute raised in a Response shall be treated as a Contract Dispute
and shall be resolved by binding arbitration in accordance with Section 11.11.
If the Buyer is seeking to enforce the claim that is the subject of the
Contract Dispute pursuant to the Escrow Agreement, the Representative and the
Buyer shall deliver to the Escrow Agent, promptly following the resolution of
the Contract Dispute (whether by mutual agreement, arbitration, judicial
decision or otherwise), a written notice executed by both parties instructing
the Escrow Agent as to what (if any) portion of the Escrow Fund shall be
distributed to the Buyer (which notice shall be consistent with the terms of
the resolution of the Contract Dispute).

 



 

7.4 _Survival of Representations and Warranties_.

 



 

(a) Unless otherwise specified in this Section 7.4 or elsewhere in this
Agreement, all provisions of this Agreement (other than the Buyers right to
repayment of the Buyer Option Payment as provided in Section 5.13) shall
survive the Closing and the

 



       
 

 



 

consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and shall continue in
full force and effect in accordance with their terms until the expiration of
the applicable statute of limitations; _provided_ , _however_ , that except
for claims based on fraud or a knowing misrepresentation, (i) all

obligations in Section 7.1(a) shall expire 60 days after the expiration of the
longest federal, state, local or foreign statute of limitations (including
extensions) and (ii) all representations and warranties that are covered by
the indemnification obligations in Section 7.2(a) shall expire on the date
that is 18 months after the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that (A)
the representations and warranties set forth in Sections 3.1 (Qualification,
Organization and Corporate Power), 3.2 (Capitalization), 3.3 (Authorization),
3.9 (Tax Matters), 3.20 (Employee Benefits) (to the extent related to Tax) and
3.25 (Brokers; Schedule of Fees and Expenses) (the " _Fundamental
Representations_ ") shall survive until 60 days after the expiration of the
longest federal, state, local or foreign statute of limitations (including
extensions) and (B) the representations and warranties set forth in Section
3.13 (Intellectual Property) shall survive until the second anniversary of the
Closing Date.

 



 

(b) If the Buyer delivers to the Representative, before expiration of a
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement, either a Claim Notice based
upon a breach of such representation, warranty, covenant or agreement or an
Expected Claim Notice based upon a breach of such representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement then the applicable representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement shall survive until, but only for purposes of, the resolution of
the matter covered by such notice. If the legal proceeding or written claim
with respect to which an Expected Claim Notice has been given is definitively
withdrawn or resolved in favor of the Buyer, the Buyer shall promptly so
notify the Representative. The rights to indemnification set forth in this
Article VII shall not be affected by (i) any investigation conducted by or on
behalf of the Buyer or any knowledge acquired (or capable of being acquired)
by the Buyer, whether before or after the date of this Agreement or the
Closing Date, with respect to the inaccuracy or noncompliance with any
representation, warranty, covenant or obligation which is the subject of
indemnification hereunder, or (ii) any waiver by the Buyer of any closing
condition relating to the accuracy of representations and warranties or the
performance of or compliance with agreements and covenants.

 



 

7.5 _Limitations_.

 



 

(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Parties hereto
expressly acknowledge and agree that the Warrantors, given their knowledge of
the Company and its business, are giving the representations and warranties of
the Warrantors contained in Article III of this Agreement for the purposes of
facilitating the transactions contemplated hereby. In the absence of fraud or
a knowing misrepresentation, the Warrantors shall have no personal liability
whatsoever to the Buyer or any other Person in respect of any breach or
inaccuracy of any representation or warranty of the Warrantors contained in
Article III of this Agreement (except insofar as a Warrantor is a Company
Equityholder and is otherwise obligated to provide indemnification to the
Buyer in accordance with the terms of this Agreement) and claims in respect of
such amount shall be realized in accordance with the other provisions of this
Article VII. Each Company Equityholder hereby agrees and acknowledges that the
Buyer is entitled to indemnification in accordance with the provisions of this

 



      
 

 



 

Article VII regardless of whether or not that Company Equityholder is also a
Warrantor.

 



 

(b) With respect to claims for Damages arising under Section 7.2(a), the
Company Equityholders shall not be liable for any such Damages until the
aggregate amount of all such Damages exceeds the Deductible (at which point
the Company Equityholders shall become liable for all Damages under Section
7.2(a)); _provided_ that the limitation set forth in this sentence shall not
apply to (i) claims based on fraud or knowing misrepresentation or (ii) any
claim pursuant to Section 7.2(a) relating to a breach of any of the
Fundamental Representations.

exclusive means for the Buyer to recover any Damages for which it is entitled
to indemnification under this Article VII. In the case of claims (A) based on
fraud or knowing misrepresentation, (B) arising under Section 7.1 and claims
arising under Section 7.2(a) with respect only to a breach of the

Damages directly from any Company Equityholder unless there are insufficient
unclaimed Escrow Funds remaining to satisfy such Damages pursuant to the

(f) The amount of any Damages payable under this Article VII shall be net of
amounts actually recovered by the Company, the Buyer or any Affiliate thereof
under applicable insurance policies (less any increased cost of insurance
which results from such claim). If the Company, the Buyer or any Affiliate
thereof receives any amounts under applicable insurance policies subsequent to
an indemnification payment by the Company Equityholders, and provided the
Buyer has collected all sums due from the Company Equityholders, then the
amount of Damages to be recovered by the Buyer shall be recalculated, taking
into account the limitations

 



      
 

 



 

of this Section 7.5, as if such insurance proceeds (less any increased cost of
insurance which results from such claim) had been received prior to the
collection of any Damages under this Agreement and any excess Damages
previously collected after such recalculation shall be repaid to the Escrow
Fund, or after the release of the Escrow Fund, such amount shall be paid to
the Paying Agent for distribution to the Company Equityholders, as applicable.
Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary set forth herein, in
no event shall the Buyer be required pursuant to this Agreement to pursue any
insurance coverage in order to seek indemnification under this Article VII.

 



 

(g) Except with respect to claims based on fraud or a knowing
misrepresentation, claims arising under Article VIII, and claims for specific
performance and other equitable relief, after the Closing and, save as
provided in Section 5.13, the rights of the Buyer under this Article VII shall
be the exclusive remedy of the Buyer with respect to claims resulting from or
relating to any misrepresentation, breach of warranty or failure to perform
any covenant or agreement of the Company or any Company Equityholder contained
in this Agreement. Except with respect to claims based on fraud or a knowing
misrepresentation, no right of rescission shall be available to the Buyer
after Closing by reason of any breach of this Agreement.

 



 

(h) Any payments made to a Party pursuant to this Article VII or pursuant to
the Escrow Agreement shall be treated as an adjustment to the Total
Consideration for Tax purposes to the extent permitted by Law.

 



 

(i) The Buyer shall not be entitled to bring a claim to the extent that the
matters, facts or circumstances the subject of such claim were taken into
account as a Closing Adjustment Item.

 



 

(j) The Buyer shall not be entitled to bring a claim for Damages or be
indemnified under or in respect of the representation and warranty set out in
Section 3.8 for any matter, fact or circumstance that constitutes or may
constitute a breach of the representations and warranties set out in Section
3.13, and the Buyers only claim for Damages or indemnification for such
matter, fact or circumstance shall be under Section 3.13.

 



 

7.6 _Offset Rights_.

 



 

(a) The Buyer shall have the right and is hereby authorized at any time and
from time to time to set off and apply against any and all Milestone Payments
the amount of any Damages specified in a Claim Notice or Expected Claim Notice
delivered by the Buyer hereunder prior to the date of the Milestone Payment
against which such set off is applied, including the Buyers good faith
estimate of any Damages identified on such Claim Notice or Expected Claim
Notice which have not been liquidated (the amount so withheld and set-off
pursuant to this Section 7.6, the " _Offset Amount_ ").

 



      
 

 



 

(b) The maximum amount of Damages for which the Buyer may exercise such set
off rights shall not exceed:

 



 

(i) [**] percent ([**]%) of any Milestone Payment in the case of any claim for
indemnification under Section 7.2(a); _provided_ that the limitation set forth
in this clause (i) shall not apply to (A) claims based on fraud or knowing
misrepresentation or (B) any claim pursuant to Section 7.2(a) relating to a
breach of any of the Fundamental Representations; and

Any amount set off under this Section 7.6 shall reduce the amount of any Net
Milestone Payment each Company Equityholder is entitled to receive
proportionately based on their respective rights to receive a portion of such
Net Milestone Payment.

 



 

(c) In the event the Buyer exercises its set off rights pursuant to this
Section 7.6 and withholds an Offset Amount from any Milestone Payment, the
Buyer shall notify the Representative thereof in writing (the " _Offset
Notification_ ") no later than five (5) Business Days after such Milestone
Payment is due, which Offset Notification shall describe in particular the
claim for indemnification with respect to which such set off rights have been

Section 7.6 and withholds an Offset Amount from any Milestone Payment with
respect to any Damages specified in the applicable Claim Notice or Expected
Claim Notice, upon the final resolution of the claim for indemnification with
respect to which the Claim Notice or Expected Claim Notice is delivered, the
Buyer shall cause the Company Equityholders to be paid the amount, if any, by
which the Offset Amount exceeds the amount of Damages to which the Buyer has
been finally determined to be entitled in connection with such resolution
together with interest on such amount from the due date of payment until the
date on which payment is made at an annual rate of [**] percent ([**]%)
(accrued daily and compounded monthly).

Information, as well as such information that is the subject of meetings and
discussions and not recorded.

 



 

(b) Section 8.1(a) shall not apply:

 



 

(i) to any Proprietary Information which is in or comes into the public
domain, other than as a result of a breach of any undertaking or duty of
confidentiality by any Seller or any of its Affiliates;

 



 

(ii) to the disclosure of any Proprietary Information to any professional
adviser(s) which any of the Sellers or the Representative have engaged for
themselves or on behalf of the Sellers, which advisors are obligated to
maintain the confidentiality of such Proprietary Information; or

 



 

(c) to the extent that any Seller or any of its Affiliates is required to
disclose any Proprietary Information by any Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that
in the event disclosure is required by Law, the Sellers shall use Reasonable
Best Efforts to provide the Buyer with prompt advance notice of such
requirement so that the Buyer may seek an appropriate protective order.

 



 

(d) Each Seller agrees that the remedy at Law for any breach of this Section
8.1 would be inadequate and that the Buyer shall be entitled to injunctive
relief in addition to any other remedy it may have upon breach of any
provision of this Section 8.1.

 



 

8.2 _No Solicitation or Hiring of Former Employees_. Except as provided by
Law, during the period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the second
(2nd) anniversary of the Closing Date, no Non-Competition Party or Affiliate
thereof shall directly or indirectly recruit, solicit or induce any person who

such Seller or Affiliate. No Seller shall hire or employ or use in any
consulting arrangement any present or former employee of the Buyer, the
Company or any of their respective subsidiaries for a period of one (1) year
from the Closing without the prior written consent of an authorized executive
officer of the Buyer. Nothing in this Section 8.2 shall prevent any Seller or
its Affiliates from publishing any recruitment advertisement in any local or
national newspaper or other publication or on any website or recruiting any
former employee, consultant or vendor of the Buyer, the Company or any of
their respective subsidiaries who has been made redundant by the Buyer, the

otherwise engage in, operate or establish any Competitive Business.

 



 

(b) Section 8.3(a) shall not apply to any Non-Competition Party or Affiliate
thereof who proposes to take up an academic research role, provided that such
Non-Competition Party or Affiliate has obtained the prior written consent of
the Buyer, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed and to be given by the Buyer on a case-by-case basis. For the
avoidance of doubt, the giving of such consent by the Buyer shall not
constitute an amendment to or waiver of this Agreement under Section 11.9 and
shall not therefore require the consent of any Person other than the Buyer.

 



 

(c) Each of the Non-Competition Parties agrees that the duration and scope of
the non-competition provision set forth in this Section 8.3 are reasonable. In
the event that any Arbitral Tribunal or court of competent jurisdiction
determines that the duration or the scope, or both, are unreasonable and that
such provision is to that extent unenforceable, each of the Non-Competition
Parties agrees that the provision shall remain in full force and effect for
the greatest time period and in the greatest area that would not render it
unenforceable. Each of the Non-Competition Parties intends that this non-
competition provision shall be deemed to be a series of separate covenants,
one for each and every jurisdiction where this provision is intended to be
effective. Each of the Non-Competition Parties agrees that damages are an
inadequate remedy for any breach of this provision and that the Buyer shall,
whether or not it is pursuing any potential remedies at Law, be entitled to
equitable relief in the form of preliminary and permanent injunctions without
bond or other security upon any actual or threatened breach of this non-
competition provision.

Shares represents a substantial interest in the Company and each Non-
Competition Party intends to transfer to the Buyer the goodwill reflected in
the Company Securities owned by such Non-Competition Party. The Non-

this Agreement but for the restrictions in this Section 8.3.

11.8 _Governing Law_. Any Legal Proceeding and all other matters arising out
of or relating to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby
(including without limitation its interpretation, construction, performance
and enforcement) shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
internal Laws of the State of New York without giving effect to any choice or
conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of New York or any

hereunder or affect in any way any rights arising by virtue of any prior or

Tribunal or any court of competent jurisdiction declares that any term or
provision hereof is invalid or unenforceable, the Parties agree that the

unenforceability shall have the power to limit the term or provision, to
delete specific words or phrases, or to replace any invalid or unenforceable
term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and

term or provision, and this Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified.

 



 

11.11 _Resolution of Contract Disputes._

 



 

(a) In the event the Buyer or the Representative has a dispute regarding this

or breach of this Agreement (a " _Contract Dispute_ "), such party shall
notify the other party regarding the nature and terms of such dispute. The
Buyer and the Representative shall attempt in good faith to resolve all
Contract Disputes by mutual agreement.

 



 

(b) If any Contract Dispute cannot be resolved by the Buyer and the
Representative pursuant to Section 11.11(a) or otherwise within twenty (20)

either the Buyer or the Representative such Contract Dispute shall be finally
settled under the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of
Commerce by three (3) arbitrators appointed in accordance with the said Rules
(the " _Arbitral Tribunal_ "), each party nominating one (1) arbitrator and
the two (2) party-appointed arbitrators nominating the chairperson. The place
of arbitration shall be London, England. Subject to each partys right to seek
injunctive relief pursuant to Section 11.11(d), the arbitration shall be the
sole and exclusive forum for resolution of any such Contract Dispute, and the
award rendered shall be final and binding. Judgment on the award rendered may
be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.

 



 

(c) The procedures for arbitration pursuant to this Section 11.11 shall be as
follows:

 



 

(i) The arbitration shall be conducted in the English language and any non-
English-language documents presented to the Arbitral Tribunal at such
arbitration shall be accompanied by an English translation thereof.

 



      
 

 



 

(ii) Any award of the Arbitral Tribunal: (A) shall be in writing; and (B)
shall state the reasons upon which such award is based.

 



 

(iii) The Arbitral Tribunal shall have no authority to award punitive damages
or any other damages not measured by the prevailing Partys actual damages.

 



 

(d) Prior to the appointment of the Arbitral Tribunal, the Buyer and the
Representative may seek appointment of an emergency arbitrator pursuant to
said rules or may apply to any court having jurisdiction hereof and seek
injunctive relief in order to maintain the status quo until such time as the
arbitration award is rendered or the Contract Dispute is otherwise resolved.
After the appointment of the Arbitral Panel, the Buyer and the Representative
may make an application to the Arbitral Tribunal seeking injunctive relief to
maintain the status quo until such time as the arbitration award is rendered
or the Contract Dispute is otherwise resolved.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in addition to the right of the Buyer and
the Representative to arbitrate Contract Disputes in this Section 11.11, the
Arbitral Tribunal shall have the power to (i) enter an award or order of
specific performance to enforce the observance and performance of such
covenant or agreement and (ii) grant an injunction restraining such breach or
threatened breach. The non-breaching party shall not be required to provide
any bond or other security in connection with any such award, order or
injunction or in connection with any arbitration or related action or
proceeding. Any arbitration awards, whether preliminary or final, shall be
enforceable in a court of competent jurisdiction.

 



 

11.12 _Construction_.

construction shall be applied against any Party.

 **Schedule 7.2(d)**

 

 **Indemnification Provisions**

 



 

All Damages (including any royalty payable) arising from (including, arising
from inter partes review under 35 USC §311 brought by the Buyer after) a claim
by [**] and/or a licensee of or successor in title to [**] brought under 28
USC §1338 or 19 USC §1337 for infringement by the Fibrocaps Product (in the
form as of the Closing Date) of any patent issued from, or claiming the
benefit of, any of [**].

      
 

 



 

 **Schedule 7.2(e)**

 

 **CSL Amendments and Indemnification Provisions**

 



 

The CSL Amendments shall be as follows:-

 



 

(i) Section 13.1 of the Agreement is hereby amended and restated in its
entirety to read:

 



 

"13.1 **Term**. The term of the Agreement shall be for an initial period of
five (5) years from the Effective Date. Subject to the termination provisions
provided herein, ProFibrix has the option to extend the Agreement for up to
two further periods of five (5) years each, for an aggregate term of up to
fifteen (15) years from the Effective Date, if and as long as it is, directly
or through one or more Affiliates or licensees, diligently pursuing the
obtaining of a BLA for, or the commercialization of, the Product. ProFibrix
may exercise each such option by means of a written notice to CSL at least six
(6) months prior to the end of the then-current term."

 



 

(ii) Clause (i) of Section 13.6 of the Agreement is hereby amended and
restated to read as follows: "(i) ProFibrix has not received marketing
authorization for the Product in at least one of the US or the European Union
on or before January 1, 2017;".

 



 

The Company Equityholders, jointly and severally, shall indemnify the Buyer in
respect of, and hold it harmless against, any and all Damages incurred or
suffered by the Company, the Buyer or any Affiliate thereof in respect of
fifty percent (50%) of the Buyers (and/or its Affiliates) aggregate third
party costs incurred in putting in place commercial supply arrangements with a
person other than CSL or its Affiliates for Materials (as defined in the CSL
Agreement) if (A) at any time following the date of the Agreement an amendment
to the CSL Agreement substantially in the form set forth in (ii) above (or
which otherwise waives, cancels, qualifies, amends or postpones the right of
termination for CSL as set out (at the date of this Agreement) in clause
13.6(i)) has not been executed; and (B) CSL serves notice to terminate the CSL
Agreement pursuant to clause 13.6(i) of the CSL Agreement (or the equivalent
clause at the time notice to terminate is served by CSL) in circumstances
where a member of the Buyer Rights Chain Group has not entered into a new
agreement with CSL or its Affiliates for the supply of Materials (as defined
in the CSL Agreement).

 



 

The total aggregate liability of the Company Equityholders in relation to the
matters set forth in this schedule shall in no event exceed $6m and the
Buyers sole means of securing such liability shall be to withhold and deliver
to the Escrow Agent the amount of $6,000,000 from Milestone Payment #1 (when
paid).

 



 

In the event that a member of the Buyer Rights Chain Group has completed
putting in place alternative commercial supply agreements prior to the expiry
of the 12-month term of the Second Escrow Deposit and at such time any amount
of the Second Escrow Deposit remains standing to the credit of the Escrow
Account then the Buyer and the Representative shall serve a joint written
notice on the Escrow Agent directing the Escrow Agent to release the balance
of the Second Escrow Deposit to the Paying Agent for onward payment to the
Company Equityholders.
