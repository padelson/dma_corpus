AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER 

   

 This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of June 12, 2006 (this " _Agreement_ "), by and between Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria, S.A., a bank organized and existing under the Laws of Spain (" _Parent_ "), and State National Bancshares, Inc., a corporation organized and existing under the Laws of the State of Texas (the " _Company_ " and, together with Parent, the " _Parties_ "). 

  

 WHEREAS, this Agreement provides for the acquisition of the Company by Parent by virtue of the merger of a newly-formed wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent to be organized under the Laws of the State of Texas (" _Merger Sub_ ") with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ "); 

  

 WHEREAS, as a result of the Merger, all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock, par value of $1.00 per share, of the Company (the " _Company Common Stock_ ") shall be converted into and exchanged for cash in the manner provided in this Agreement; 

  

 WHEREAS, the appropriate corporate body of Parent and the Board of Directors of the Company have each approved this Agreement and the proposed transactions contemplated hereby and have authorized the execution hereof, and the Board of Directors of the Company has adopted a resolution recommending that the plan of merger set forth in this Agreement be approved by the shareholders of the Company; and 

  

 WHEREAS, as an inducement for Parent to enter into this Agreement, each of Castle Creek Capital, LLC and certain of the directors and officers of the Company (together, the " _Company Affiliated Shareholders_ "), Franklin Mutual Advisers, LLC and certain other signatories thereto are simultaneously executing and delivering to Parent an agreement (the " _Voting Agreement_ "), a form of which is attached as Exhibit A, providing that, among other things, the signatories thereto will, subject to the terms and conditions therein, vote their shares of Company Common Stock in favor of the transactions contemplated hereby; 

  

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth in this Agreement and intending to be legally bound hereby, the Parties hereby agree as follows: 

  

ARTICLE I 
 THE MERGER 

   

 SECTION 1.01. _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in this Agreement, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company at the Effective Time (as defined below), in accordance with the provisions of Part Five of the Texas Business Corporation Act (the " _TBCA_ ") and the Texas Business Organizations Code (the " _TBOC_ "), and the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease. The Company shall be the surviving corporation in the Merger (sometimes referred to as the " _Surviving Corporation_ ") and shall continue its corporate existence under the Laws of the State of Texas. 

   ##### 

  

  

 SECTION 1.02. _Effective Time_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, at the Closing the Company and Merger Sub shall duly execute and file articles of merger or a certificate of merger, as applicable (collectively, the " _Articles of Merger_ "), with the Secretary of State of the State of Texas under Article 5.04 of the TBCA or Section 10.153 of the TBOC, as required. The Parties will make all other filings or recordings required under the TBCA or the TBOC, as applicable, and the Merger will become effective when the Articles of Merger are filed in the office of the Secretary of State of the State of Texas and a certificate of merger is issued by the office of the Secretary of State of the State of Texas pursuant to Article 5.05 of the TBCA, or at such later date or time as Parent and the Company shall agree and specify in the Articles of Merger in accordance with Article 10.03 of the TBCA (the time the Merger becomes effective, the " _Effective Time_ "). 

  

 SECTION 1.03. _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects provided by this Agreement and as set forth in the TBCA, the TBOC and other applicable Law. 

  

 SECTION 1.04. _Articles of Incorporation; Bylaws_. At the Effective Time, the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Company as they exist immediately before the Effective Time, with such amendments to the Articles of Incorporation as may be specified in the Articles of Merger, and in each case until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or pursuant to applicable Law. 

  

 SECTION 1.05. _Directors and Officers of Surviving Corporation_. At the Effective Time, the initial directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be the directors of Merger Sub, each to hold office in accordance with the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation. The initial officers of the Surviving Corporation shall be the officers of the Company, each to hold office in accordance with the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 SECTION 1.06. _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further action on the part of the Parties or any holder of Company Common Stock or the sole shareholder of Merger Sub: 

  

 (a) Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Dissenting Shares and Treasury Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive, in cash and without interest, $38.50 per share (the " _Per Share Amount_ "). At the Effective Time, all shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any shares of Company Common Stock (a " _Certificate_ ") shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Per Share Amount for each share of Company Common Stock represented by the Certificate (the " _Merger Consideration_ ") or, in the case of Dissenting Shares, the rights set forth in Section 1.07. 

  

 (b) Each share of common stock, par value $1.00 per share, of Merger Sub that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain outstanding and be converted into one (1) share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (c) Any shares of Company Common Stock held directly or indirectly by Parent or the Company, other than those held on behalf of a Company shareholder (other than Parent or the Company) in trust accounts, managed accounts or otherwise in a fiduciary capacity or as a result of debts previously contracted (collectively, " _Treasury Shares_ "), shall be cancelled and retired at the Effective Time, and no consideration shall be issued in exchange therefor. 

  

 (d) At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and no transfer of Company Common Stock theretofore outstanding shall thereafter be made. 

  

 (e) If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock shall have been increased, decreased, changed into or exchanged for a different number or kind of shares or securities as a result of a reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split or otherwise, an appropriate and proportionate adjustment shall be made to the Per Share Amount. 

  

 SECTION 1.07. _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this Agreement, shares of Company Common Stock that are issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time and that are held by a shareholder who has not voted such shares in favor of the Merger and who has otherwise taken all of the steps required by Article 5.12 of the TBCA to properly exercise and perfect such shareholders dissenters rights (any such shares being referred to herein as " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall be deemed to have ceased to represent any interest in the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective Time and shall be entitled to those rights and remedies set forth in Articles 5.11, 5.12 and 5.13 of the TBCA; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the event that a shareholder of the Company fails to perfect, withdraws or otherwise loses any such right or remedy granted by the TBCA, the shares of Company Common Stock held by such shareholder shall be converted into and represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration specified in this Agreement. The Company shall give Parent (a) prompt notice of any notice or demand for appraisal or payment for shares of Company Common Stock received by the Company and (b) the opportunity to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such demands or notices. The Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle, offer to settle or otherwise negotiate any such demands. 

  

 SECTION 1.08. _Company Stock Options_. As of the Effective Time, each issued and outstanding option to acquire Company Common Stock, whether granted pursuant to the Company Stock Option Plan or otherwise (the " _Company Stock Options_ "), whether vested or unvested at the Effective Time, will be cancelled and terminated by the Company in exchange for an amount of cash, without interest, equal to the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option multiplied by the Option Spread less applicable Taxes required to be withheld with respect to such payment (the " _Option Consideration_ "). The " _Option Spread_ " for each share of Company Common Stock subject to a Company Stock Option will be equal to the excess, if any, of (y) the mean between the highest and the lowest selling prices quoted on The Nasdaq National Market for a share of Company Common Stock on the last trading day prior to the Effective Time over (z) the per share exercise price of the Company Stock Option. Any Company Stock Option for which the per share exercise price exceeds the 

   ##### 

  

 

Per Share Amount shall be cancelled as of the Effective Time without the
payment of any consideration therefor. 

   

 SECTION 1.09. _Exchange Procedures_. 

  

 (a) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with The Bank of New York (the " _Paying Agent_ "), for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock, an amount that constitutes the aggregate amount of the Merger Consideration payable in respect of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to Section 1.06(a) upon surrender of Certificates and, for the benefit of the holders of Company Stock Options, the aggregate amount of the Option Consideration payable in respect of Company Stock Options pursuant to Section 1.08 (the " _Exchange Fund_ "), it being understood that any and all interest earned on funds made available to the Paying Agent pursuant to this Agreement shall belong to Parent. At the six (6) month anniversary of the Effective Time, any such cash remaining in the possession of the Paying Agent (together with any dividends or earnings in respect thereof) shall be returned to Parent. Any former holders of Company Common Stock who have not theretofore exchanged their Certificates for the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Article I shall thereafter be entitled only to look exclusively to Parent, and only as general unsecured creditors thereof, for payment of any Merger Consideration to which they are entitled to receive upon exchange of their Certificates pursuant to this Article I, without any interest thereon. 

  

 (b) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, but in no event later than five (5) Business Days after the day on which the Effective Time occurs, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each former holder of record of shares of Company Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time transmittal materials for use in exchanging such shareholders Certificates for the Merger Consideration set forth in this Article I. If practicable, Parent shall make available such transmittal materials to the Company prior to the Closing Date. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent together with the transmittal materials duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the record holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration (after giving effect to any required Tax deductions and withholdings in accordance with Section 1.09(e)), which, if practicable, shall be paid within five (5) Business Days of the later of the Paying Agents receipt of such materials or the Closing Date, and the Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of the Certificates. In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of Company Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, the proper amount of the Merger Consideration may be paid in exchange therefor to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate so delivered is registered if the Certificate formerly representing such shares is presented to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable Taxes have been paid. 

  

 (c) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably required by Parent or the Paying Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent or the Paying Agent may direct, as indemnity against any 

   ##### 

  

 

claim that may be made against either of them with respect to such
Certificate, the Paying Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration to which the holder thereof
is entitled, without any interest thereon. 

   

 (d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Paying Agent nor any Party shall be liable to any former holder of Company Common Stock for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws. 

  

 (e) Parent or the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock or Company Stock Options such amounts as Parent or the Paying Agent is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent or the Paying Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent or the Paying Agent. 

  

 SECTION 1.10. _Alternative Acquisition Structure_. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, Parent shall be permitted, in its sole and absolute discretion, to restructure the method by which Parent accomplishes the acquisition of the Company as contemplated by this Agreement, including by providing for the merger of a direct or indirect Subsidiary of Parent (other than Merger Sub) with and into the Company; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall only be permitted to restructure the proposed transaction to the extent that (i) there is no change in the amount or nature of the Merger Consideration to be received by the shareholders of the Company as contemplated in this Agreement, (ii) there is no change to the federal tax consequences of the Merger to the shareholders of the Company, and (iii) such restructuring is not reasonably expected to materially delay obtaining the required Governmental Approvals.

On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, a closing (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place at 10:00 a.m. Dallas, Texas time on January 3, 2007, or such earlier or later date as the Parties shall mutually agree, at a location designated by Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Company; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that if on such date the conditions set forth in Articles VIII, IX and X have not been satisfied or waived (subject to applicable Law) (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied or waived at the Closing, but in all cases subject to satisfaction thereof), the Closing shall take place on the second Business Day immediately following the date on which such conditions have been so satisfied or waived.

 (f) Since December 31, 2005, (i) through the date hereof, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries nor, to the knowledge of the Company, any director, officer, employee, auditor, accountant or representative of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, has received or otherwise had or obtained knowledge of any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim, whether written or oral, regarding the accounting or auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or methods of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective internal accounting controls, including any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in questionable accounting or auditing practices, and (ii) no attorney representing the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not employed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a material violation of securities laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation by the Company or any of its officers, directors, employees or agents to the Board of Directors of the Company or any committee thereof or to any director or officer of the Company.

Proposal on terms substantially similar to, and no less favorable to
the Company than, those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, to
consider and participate in discussions with respect to a bona fide Company
Alternative Proposal received by the Company, if and only to the extent that
the Board of Directors of the Company reasonably determines in good faith (A)
such Company Alternative Proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to
result in a Superior Proposal and (B) after consultation with outside legal
counsel that failure to do so would cause or be reasonably likely to cause it
to violate its fiduciary duties. 

  

 As used in this Agreement, " _Company Alternative Transaction_ " means any of (i) a transaction pursuant to which any Person (or group of Persons) (other than Parent or its Affiliates), directly or indirectly, acquires or would acquire more than twenty-five percent (25%) of the outstanding shares of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or outstanding voting power or of any new series or new class of preferred stock that would be entitled to a class or series vote with respect to a merger of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, whether from the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or pursuant to a tender offer or exchange offer or otherwise; (ii) a merger, share exchange, consolidation or other business combination involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (other than the Merger); (iii) any transaction pursuant to which any Person (or group of Persons) (other than Parent or its Affiliates) acquires or would acquire control of assets (including for this purpose the outstanding equity securities of Subsidiaries of the Company and securities of the entity surviving any merger or business combination including any of the Companys Subsidiaries) of the Company, or any of its Subsidiaries representing more than twenty-five percent (25%) of the fair market value of all the assets, net revenues or net income of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, immediately prior to such transaction; or (iv) any other consolidation, business combination, recapitalization or similar transaction involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

 For purposes of this Agreement, " _Superior Proposal_ " means a bona fide written Company Alternative Proposal which the Board of Directors of the Company concludes in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and legal advisors, taking into account all legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of the proposal and the Person making the proposal (including any break-up fees, expense reimbursement provisions and conditions to consummation), (x) is more favorable to the shareholders of the Company than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (y) is fully financed or reasonably capable of being fully financed, reasonably likely to receive all required governmental approvals on a timely basis and otherwise reasonably capable of being completed on the terms proposed; _provided_ that, for purposes of this definition of "Superior Proposal," the term Company Alternative Transaction shall have the meaning assigned to such term in this Section 6.04(a), except that the reference to "25%" in the definition of "Company Alternative Transaction" shall be deemed to be a reference to "a majority" and the definition of "Company Alternative Proposal" shall only be deemed to refer to a transaction involving the Company. 

  

 (b) The Company shall notify Parent promptly (but in no event later than forty-eight (48) hours) after receipt of any Company Alternative Proposal, or any material modification of or material amendment to any Company Alternative Proposal, or any request for nonpublic information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or for access to the

Proposal. Such notice to Parent shall be made orally and in writing, and
shall indicate the identity of the Person making the Company Alternative
Proposal or intending to make or considering making a Company Alternative
Proposal or requesting non-public information or access to the books and
records of Company or any Subsidiary, and the material terms of any such
Company Alternative Proposal or modification or amendment to a Company
Alternative Proposal. The Company shall keep Parent fully informed, on a
current basis, of any material changes in the status and any material changes
or modifications in the terms of any such Company Alternative Proposal,
indication or request. The Company shall also promptly, and in any event
within forty-eight (48) hours, notify Parent, orally and in writing, if it
enters into discussions or negotiations concerning any Company Alternative
Proposal in accordance with Section 6.04(a). 

  

 (c) The Company and its Subsidiaries shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing discussions or negotiations with any Persons (other than each other) conducted heretofore with respect to any of the foregoing, and shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause all Persons who have been furnished confidential information regarding itself in connection with the solicitation of or discussions regarding a Company Alternative Proposal, as the case may be, within the twelve (12) months prior to the date hereof promptly to return or destroy such information. The Company agrees not to, and to cause its Subsidiaries not to, release any third party from the confidentiality and standstill provisions of any agreement to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is or may become a party, agrees to, and to cause its Subsidiaries to, enforce any such confidentiality and standstill provision against any third party, and shall immediately take all steps necessary to terminate any approval that may have been heretofore given under any such provisions authorizing any Person to make a Company Alternative Proposal.

 (C) within twelve (12) months of the date of such termination of this Agreement, the Company enters into an agreement with respect to any Company Alternative Proposal or any Company Alternative Proposal is consummated; or

Any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument 

    ##### 

  

    

in writing signed by each of the Parties to be bound thereby, but such
extension or waiver or failure to insist on strict compliance with an
obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver
of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent failure to comply with the
same obligation, covenant, agreement or condition or any failure to comply
with any other obligation, covenant, agreement or condition by the Party
whose performance was waived.
