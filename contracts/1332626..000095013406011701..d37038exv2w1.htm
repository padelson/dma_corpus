payable in respect of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to Section&nbsp;1.06(a) upon surrender of

Effective Time transmittal materials for use in exchanging such shareholder&#146;s Certificates for the
Merger Consideration set forth in this Article&nbsp;I. If practicable, Parent shall make available such
transmittal materials to the Company prior to the Closing Date. Upon surrender of a Certificate
for cancellation to the Paying Agent together with the transmittal materials duly completed and
validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto and such other documents as may
reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the record holder of such Certificate shall be entitled
to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration (after giving effect to any required Tax
deductions and withholdings in accordance with Section&nbsp;1.09(e)), which, if practicable, shall be
paid within five (5)&nbsp;Business Days of the later of the Paying Agent&#146;s receipt of such materials or

therefor to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate so delivered is registered
