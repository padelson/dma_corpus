#### (a) Vendor shall, not later than three Business Days before the Closing
Date, provide to Purchaser a statement setting forth Vendors good faith
estimate (the " **Preliminary Net Working Capital Amount** ") of the Net
Working Capital Amount and the actual amount of the Distributions made or to
be made during the Interim Period. The amount of those Distributions shall
be converted from Canadian currency into US Dollars as of the date of
that statement. The Preliminary Net Working Capital Amount and the amount of
the Distributions made during the Interim Period provided in that statement
shall be included in calculating the amounts payable by Purchaser to Vendor
at the Closing Time pursuant to Section 3.2(b)(i) or Section 3.2(b)(ii), as
applicable.

  

#### 

  

#### (b) Vendor, with the assistance of the Corporation and the Subsidiaries,
shall prepare and deliver to Purchaser, within 30 days after the Closing
Date, a statement setting forth Vendors determination of the Net Working
Capital Amount (the " **Final Working Capital Statement** ") based on:

  

#### 

  

##### (i) the actual information available from accounting systems of Vendor
and the records of the Corporation and the Subsidiaries; and

  

##### 

  

##### (ii) a conversion of the Net Working Capital Amount from Canadian

Statement.

  

##### 

  

#### (c) Purchaser shall, within 30 days after Vendors delivery of the Final
Working Capital Statement, complete its review of the Final Working Capital
Statement. If Purchaser disputes Vendors determination of any of the Net
Working Capital Amount as set forth in the Final Working Capital Statement,
**** Purchaser will so notify Vendor, on or before the last Business Day of
that 30 day period, in writing (the " **Purchaser s Objection**"). That
notice will set forth a specific description of the basis of Purchasers
Objection and the adjustments to the Final Working Capital Statement that
Purchaser believes should be made. If Purchaser does not deliver a
Purchasers Objection within that period, the Final Working Capital Statement
shall be conclusive and binding on the Parties.

  

#### 

  

#### (d) Vendor will have 30 days (" **Vendor s Review Period**") from its
receipt of Purchasers Objection to review and respond to it, and the Parties
will thereafter attempt in good faith to reach an agreement with respect to
any matters in dispute. If Vendor and Purchaser are unable to resolve their
disagreement **** within 15 days following Vendors Review Period, they
will refer that disagreement to the Accounting Firm, who will, acting as
experts and not as arbitrators, determine, only with respect to the remaining
differences so submitted, whether and to what extent, if any, any of the
Final Working Capital Statement requires adjustment.

  



  

20   

     
   

  



  

Vendor and Purchaser will direct the Accounting Firm to use its best efforts
to render its determination within 20 Business Days. The Accounting Firms
determination will be conclusive and binding on Vendor and Purchaser. In
resolving any disputed item, the Accounting Firm must not assign a value to
that item greater than the greatest value for that item claimed by either
Vendor or Purchaser or less than the smallest value for that item claimed by
either Vendor or Purchaser. Vendor and Purchaser will each pay one half of
the fees and disbursements incurred by the Accounting Firm.

  



  

#### (e) The Net Working Capital Amount as set forth in the Final Working
Capital Statement, shall be revised to reflect any revisions agreed to by the
Parties or determined by the Accounting Firm. If the Net Working Capital
Amount (including any revisions required to be made to the Final Working
Capital Statement) is:

  

#### 

  

(i) greater than the Preliminary Net Working Capital Amount then Purchaser
shall pay Vendor an amount equal to that difference; or

  



  

(ii) less than the Preliminary Net Working Capital Amount then Vendor shall
pay Purchaser an amount equal to that difference.

  



  

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if there is a disagreement between Vendor and
Purchaser as to any items in the Final Working Capital Statement which
disagreement is required to be resolved by the Accounting Firm in accordance
with the procedures provided in Section 3.3(d) then no payment pursuant to
paragraph (i) or paragraph (ii) above, as applicable, shall be required to be
made by the applicable Party unless the difference between the Preliminary
Net Working Capital Amount and the Net Working Capital Amount incorporating
the Accounting Firms determinations is greater than US $1,500,000.

  



  

Any payment required pursuant to this Section 3.3(e) is to be made within
five Business Days following the final determination of the Net Working
Capital Amount rendered by the Accounting Firm or as agreed to by the
Parties. Any payments required pursuant to the foregoing shall be made
together with interest thereon at a rate per annum equal to the Prime Rate
calculated for the period from the Working Capital Date to but excluding the
date of payment. No further adjustments shall be made to the Purchase Price
with respect to the Net Working Capital Amount. Any such payment (excluding
the part thereof that is interest) shall be treated by Vendor and Purchaser
as an adjustment to the Purchase Price.

  



  

#### (f) Vendor and Purchaser shall cooperate and Purchaser shall cause the
Corporation and the Subsidiaries to cooperate to facilitate the preparation
and delivery of the Final Working Capital Statement in accordance with this
Section 3.3. During the period of time from and after the Closing Date
through to the time of delivery of the Final Working Capital Statement, and,
if applicable, the Accounting Firms determinations, Purchaser shall afford,
and shall cause the Corporation and the Subsidiaries to afford, to the
Accounting Firm, Vendor, counsel or financial advisors retained by Vendor in
connection with any adjustment to the Preliminary Net Working Capital Amount
contemplated by this Section 3.3, reasonable access during normal business
hours to all the properties, Contracts, personnel and Books and Records of
the Corporation and the Subsidiaries and work papers relevant to the
adjustment contemplated by this Section 3.3.

being called in this Agreement the " **Indemnified Party** ") to indemnify
and hold harmless, the Indemnified Party, its Affiliates and its and their
respective successors and permitted assigns and the directors, officers,
employees, shareholders, agents, members and partners of any of
them (collectively, the " **Vendor** **Indemnified Persons** " or the "

hereunder on the part of Vendor Indemnified Persons relating to Environmental
Matters or Environmental Liabilities or any inaccuracy or incorrectness of
any representation or warranty of Vendor relating to Environmental Matters
contained in this Agreement, or other document or certificate furnished by
Vendor pursuant to this Agreement or the existence of which Environmental
Matters or Environmental Liabilities reflects an inaccuracy or
misrepresentation in any of Vendors representations or warranties in Section
4.14 (Environmental Matters and Environmental Liabilities in respect of which
Vendor and the other Vendor Indemnified Persons are indemnified pursuant to
this Section 10.1(b) are referred to as the " **Indemnified
Environmental Matters** " and the " **Indemnified Environmental

covenants and Liabilities in respect of any such Indemnified Environmental
Matters and Indemnified Environmental Liabilities, regardless of whether such
Indemnified Environmental Matters or Indemnified Environmental Liabilities
are attributable to, occurred, arose or accrued on, before or subsequent to
the Closing Date.

  

##### 

  

Purchaser shall have no rights to recovery, indemnification or contribution
against Vendor Indemnified Persons for Indemnified Environmental Liabilities
or Indemnified Environmental Matters under this Agreement, under Applicable
Laws, in equity or otherwise, and all rights and remedies which Purchaser may
have at or under Applicable Law (including any past, present or future
Environmental Law) or in equity, including any right of contribution or
reimbursement, against Vendor Indemnified Persons with respect to any such
Indemnified Environmental Liabilities or Indemnified Environmental Matters
are expressly waived.

  



  

Purchaser does hereby release, acquit and forever discharge Vendor
Indemnified Persons from any and all Losses, including all claims for
contribution and indemnity under Applicable Laws or in equity, which may be
asserted now or in the future (or both) and that in any way relate to
or arise out of Indemnified Environmental Liabilities or Indemnified
Environmental Matters, regardless of whether those Indemnified Environmental

Purchaser covenants not to make any Claim or other demand, or institute any
action or other proceeding against Vendor Indemnified Persons for indemnity
and contribution for any of those Indemnified Environmental Liabilities or
Indemnified Environmental Matters or against a Person other than a Vendor
Indemnified Person where a Claim for contribution or indemnity may be brought
against a Vendor Indemnified Person;

  



  

##### (ii) all Claims by a Person who is not Vendor or a Vendor Related Party
to the extent that those Claims directly or indirectly relate to the
Purchased Shares, the Corporation, any Subsidiary, the Assets or the
Business, except for any Claims which are the subject of indemnification
provided by Vendor as expressly set forth in this Agreement; and

  

##### 

  

##### (iii) any financing referred to in Section 13.2(d) except to the extent
that the Loss, Liability or Claim suffered by a Vendor Indemnified Person
results or arises from

  



  

56   

     
   

  



  

##### any misstatement or omission in information furnished by any Vendor
Indemnified Person to Purchaser or Pogo.

pursuant to Article 11 shall be subject to:

  

#### 

  

##### (i) the limitations set forth in Article 6 respecting the survival of
the representations, warranties and covenants of the Parties and other
matters including the limitations in Section 6.2(b) and Section 6.2(c),

under this indemnity;

  

##### 

  

##### (ii) the restrictions in Section 6.5 or Section 6.7;

  

##### 

  

##### (iii) the requirement that the Indemnifying Party shall, in respect of
any Claim made by any third Person, to the extent reasonably possible, be
afforded an opportunity at its sole expense to resist, defend and compromise
that Claim;

  

##### 

  

##### (iv) the limitation that, for Claims made in connection with any
inaccuracy or incorrectness of any representation or warranty contained
herein or breach of any covenant contained herein, the Indemnifying Party
shall not be required to pay any such amount until the aggregate amount is
finally adjudicated or agreed as being payable by that Indemnified Party and,
if applicable, that final amount exceeds the thresholds set out in Article 6,
and then subject to the limits set forth in Article 6; and

  

##### 

  

##### (v) the limitation that, for any Claim in respect of which Purchaser is
the Indemnified Party, if specific provision or reserve was made for that
Claim in the Final Working Capital Statement and by virtue thereof the amount
of that provision or reserve was deducted in determining the Purchase Price,
then the amount of that provision or reserve shall also be deducted from that
Claim before determining the amount of that Claim which may be subject to
indemnification under this Agreement.

  

##### 

  

## **10.2** Procedures Relating to Indemnification Between Vendor and
Purchaser

  

## ** **

  

Following the discovery of any facts or conditions which could reasonably be
expected to give rise to a Claim for which indemnification is provided under
this Agreement, the Indemnified Party shall, as promptly as reasonably
possible thereafter, provide written notice to the Indemnifying Party,
setting forth the specific facts and circumstances, in reasonable detail,
relating to that Claim and the amount of that Claim (or a reasonable, good-
faith estimate thereof if the actual amount is not known or not capable of
reasonable calculation) (" **Indemnification Notice** "); provided, however,
that failure to give that Indemnification Notice on a timely basis shall not
affect the indemnification provided hereunder except to the extent the
Indemnifying Party shall have been actually and materially prejudiced as a
result of that failure. Notwithstanding the foregoing:

  



  

#### (a) a Purchaser Indemnified Person shall not be entitled to make a Claim
against Vendor under Section 10.1 unless and until:

  

#### 

  

##### (i) Purchaser shall have provided Vendor written notice of default; and

  

##### 

  

##### (ii) Vendor shall have failed to cure that default within 60 days after
Vendors receipt of Purchasers notice; and

  



  

57   

     
   

  



  

#### (b) a Vendor Indemnified Person shall not be entitled to make a Claim
against Purchaser under Section 10.1 unless and until:

  

#### 

  

##### (i) Vendor shall have provided Purchaser written notice of default; and

  

##### 

  

##### (ii) Purchaser shall have failed to cure that default within 60 days
after Purchasers receipt of Vendors notice.

  

##### 

  

## **10.3** Indemnification Procedures for Third Party Claims

  

## ** **

  

#### (a) In the case of Claims made by a third party with respect to which
indemnification is sought hereunder, the Indemnified Party shall give prompt
written notice, and in any event within 20 days after it receives notice of
that Claim, to the Indemnifying Party of any such Claim made on it stating
the nature and basis for that Claim. A failure to give that notice within
that period shall not preclude the Indemnified Party from obtaining that
indemnification but its right to indemnification shall be reduced to the
extent that any such delay materially prejudiced the defense of the Claim or
materially increased the amount of liability or cost of defense.

  

#### 

  

#### (b) The Indemnifying Party shall have the right, by notice to the
Indemnified Party given not later than 30 days after its receipt of the
notice described in Section 10.3(a), to assume the control of the defence,
compromise or settlement of that Claim, provided that such assumption shall,
by its terms, be without cost to the Indemnified Party.  If the Indemnifying
Party assumes the control of the defence, compromise or settlement of such
Claim, as against the Indemnified Party, it will be conclusively established
for the purposes of this Agreement that those Claims are within the scope of
the indemnification set out in Article 10 and the Indemnifying Party shall be
responsible for reimbursing the Indemnified Party for all prior reasonable
legal fees and expenses on a solicitor and client basis in connection
therewith. The Indemnifying Party shall thereafter keep each Indemnified
Party reasonably informed with respect to the status of that Claim.

  

#### 

  

#### (c) On the assumption of control of any Claim by the Indemnifying Party
pursuant to Section 10.3(b), the Indemnifying Party shall diligently proceed
with the defence, compromise or settlement of that Claim at its sole expense,
including, if necessary, employment of counsel satisfactory to the
Indemnified Party (acting reasonably) and, in connection therewith, the
Indemnified Party shall cooperate fully, but at the expense of the
Indemnifying Party with respect to any out-of-pocket expenses incurred, to
make available to the Indemnifying Party all pertinent information and
witnesses under the Indemnified Partys control and take such other steps as
in the opinion of counsel for the Indemnifying Party are reasonably necessary
to enable the Indemnifying Party to conduct that defence. The
Indemnifying Party shall not settle that Claim unless that settlement
includes, as an unconditional term thereof, the giving by the claimant or the
plaintiff of a full and complete release of the Indemnified Party from any
and all liability with respect to that Claim. As long as the Indemnifying
Party is contesting any such Claim in good faith and on a timely basis, the
Indemnified Party shall not pay or settle any such Claim without the consent
of the Indemnifying Party, acting reasonably. Notwithstanding the assumption
by the Indemnifying Party of the defence of that Claim as provided in Section
10.3(b), the Indemnified Party shall also have the right to participate in
the negotiation, settlement or defence of any Claim at its own expense;
provided, however, that if the defendants in any such Claim shall include
both an Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party and such Indemnified
Party shall have reasonably concluded that counsel selected by the
Indemnifying Party has a conflict of interest because of the availability of
different or additional defences to that Indemnified

  



  

58   

     
   

  



  

#### Party, that Indemnified Party shall have the right to select separate
counsel to participate in the defence of that Claim on its behalf, at the
expense of the Indemnifying Party; and provided further that the Indemnifying
Party shall not be obligated to pay the expenses of more than one separate
counsel for all Indemnified Parties.

  

#### 

  

#### (d) If the Indemnifying Party shall fail to notify the Indemnified Party
of its desire to assume the defence of any Claim within the period of time
prescribed in Section 10.3(b), or shall notify the Indemnified Party that it
will not assume the defense of any such Claim, then the Indemnified Party may
assume the defense of any such Claim, in which event it may do so in such
manner as it may deem appropriate, and the Indemnifying Party shall be bound
by any determination made in that Claim or any settlement thereof effected by
the Indemnified Party; provided that any such determination or settlement
shall not affect the right of the Indemnifying Party to dispute the
Indemnified Partys claim for indemnification. The Indemnifying Party shall
be permitted to join in the defense of that Claim and to employ counsel at
its own expense.

  

#### 

  

#### (e) The final determination of any Claim pursuant to this Section 10.3,
including all related costs and expenses, will be binding and conclusive on
the Parties as to the validity or invalidity, as the case may be, of that
Claim against the Indemnifying Party.

  

#### 

  

#### (f) Amounts payable by the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party
in respect of any Claims for which the Indemnified Party is entitled to
indemnification hereunder shall be payable by the Indemnifying Party as
incurred by the Indemnified Party.

  

#### 

  

## **10.4** Holding of Indemnities

  

## ** **

  

Vendor and Purchaser shall hold the indemnities contained in Section 10.1 in
trust on behalf of Vendor Indemnified Persons or Purchaser Indemnified
Persons, as applicable, and may enforce those indemnities on its and their
respective behalf. In furtherance of the foregoing the term " **Indemnified
Party** " as used herein shall mean or include, as applicable, any Vendor
Indemnified Person or Purchaser Indemnified Person that the Indemnified Party
may represent in the circumstances.

  



  

## **10.5** Claims Net of Insurance and Taxes

  

## ** **

  

#### (a) The amount of any and all Claims under this Article 10 and elsewhere
under this Agreement shall be determined net of any amounts recovered by
the Indemnified Party under insurance policies, indemnities or other
reimbursement arrangements with respect to those Claims.  Each Party hereby
waives, or will procure the waiver of, any subrogation rights that its
insurer may have with respect to any indemnifiable Claims.

  

#### 

  

#### (b) In determining the amount of any Claim for which either Party is
entitled to indemnification under this Article 10, the gross amount thereof
shall be reduced by any net present value of the Tax Benefit realized by that
Party in connection with that Claim to the extent that Tax Benefit results
directly from the incurrence of that Claim. If an indemnification payment
hereunder results in incremental Tax being payable by the Indemnified Party,
the amount of the applicable Claim shall be equal to:

  

#### 

  

##### (i) the gross amount of that Claim minus the net present value of the
Tax Benefit realized by that Indemnified Party as determined above;

  

##### 

  

##### _divided by:_

  

##### 

  

##### (ii) one minus the Tax Rate;

  



  

59   

     
   

  



  

provided, however, that no additional indemnification payment for any
applicable incremental Tax shall be payable until final settlement of that
Tax liability with the relevant Tax authority, and only on receipt by the
Indemnifying Party of a copy of an official communication issued by the
relevant Tax authority which evidences that final settlement of the Tax
liability and, in those circumstances, the Indemnifying Party will also pay
to the Indemnified Party interest, at Vendors Interest Rate, on the
indemnification amount payable from the date the obligation to make that
indemnification payment arose until the date on which that indemnification
payment is made. For purposes of this Section 10.5:

  



  

" **Tax Benefit** " means, as to a Party, the Tax Rate multiplied by the
amount of any income tax deduction or allowance in any year arising from any
Claim that entitles the Indemnified Party to indemnity under this Agreement.
If a change in Applicable Law replaces or otherwise supplements the federal
or provincial income tax on corporations with another method of taxation,
the Parties agree to negotiate in good faith a new definition of Tax Benefit;
and

  



  

" **Tax Rate** " means the rate of Tax exigible under the Applicable Laws to
a relevant Person for any relevant period of time.

  



  

## **10.6** Mitigation

  

## ** **

  

Each Party shall take all reasonable steps and use all commercially
reasonable efforts to mitigate any and all Claims.

  



  

## **10.7** Adjustment to Purchase Price

  

## ** **

  

Any indemnity payment under this Agreement shall be treated as an adjustment
to the Purchase Price.

  



  

## **10.8** Subrogation

  

## ** **

  

Each Party shall assign to the other Party and subrogate the other Party to
all its rights and remedies against any Person (other than, with respect to
rights and remedies of Vendor and Purchaser, those against its Related
Parties) in respect of any payment made by the other Party in respect of any
indemnification or liability assumed by the other Party pursuant to this
Agreement or as a result of this Agreement (including legal fees and other
costs of litigation).  Each Party shall provide all reasonable cooperation of
assistance required by the other Party in making and prosecuting any Claim
for recovery against that Person to the extent that payment is made by the
other Party. Neither Party shall knowingly take any action to impair any such
right or remedy of the other Party to recover any such payment.

Subsidiaries for fiscal years of the Partnership Subsidiaries ending on or
before the Working Capital Date;

  

###### 

  

##### (ii) all putative income Taxes of the Corporation and each Corporate
Subsidiary for taxation years of the Corporation or Corporate Subsidiary, as
the case may be, ending after the Working Capital Date, to the extent such
income Taxes are attributable (x) to income earned or realized by any
Partnership Subsidiary during the period in a Straddle Period of the
Partnership that notionally ended on or before the Working Capital Date, or
(y) to income earned or realized by the Corporation or Corporate Subsidiary,
as the case may be, otherwise than as a member of any Partnership Subsidiary,
during the period in a Straddle Period of the Corporation or Corporate
Subsidiary, as the case may be, that notionally ended on or before the
Working Capital Date, all as calculated on the basis and using the
assumptions set forth in Section 11.1(c); and

  

##### 

  

##### (iii) all other Taxes attributable to periods ending (or portions
thereof notionally ending) on or before the Working Capital Date;

  

##### 

  

in all such cases to the extent that such Taxes are not reflected in Net
Working Capital Amount.  After Closing and subject to the terms of this
Article 11, Vendor shall be liable for and shall pay and shall indemnify and
save and hold harmless Purchaser, the Corporation and the Subsidiaries from
and against all Taxes of the Corporation and each Subsidiary attributable to
or which arise as a result of any Distributions made during the Interim
Period. Vendor shall be entitled to any refund of (or credit for) Taxes
allocable to any period with respect to which Vendor is liable for Taxes in
accordance with the foregoing and, to the extent applicable, shall also be
entitled to any amount not reflected in the Net Working Capital Amount by
which any pre-paid or estimated Tax payments remitted before the Closing Date
with respect to any such taxation year or any such part of any Straddle
Period exceeds the Tax due and payable therefor.

  



  

#### (b) After Closing and subject to the terms of this Article 11, Purchaser
shall be liable for and shall pay or shall cause the Corporation and the
Subsidiaries to pay and shall indemnify, defend and save and hold harmless

##### (ii) all other Taxes attributable to periods beginning (or portions
thereof notionally beginning) after the Working Capital Date; and

  

##### 

  

##### (iii) any Taxes that are reflected in the Net Working Capital Amount.

  

##### 

  

#### (c) For purposes of Section 11.1(a) and Section 11.1(b), whenever it is
necessary to determine the liability for Taxes of the Corporation or any
Subsidiary for a part of any Straddle Period, the Taxes for the part of the
Straddle Period ending on or before, and the part of the Straddle Period
beginning after the Working Capital Date shall be determined by assuming
that:

##### (i) the Straddle Period consists of two taxation years (or in the case
of the Partnership Subsidiaries, two fiscal years), one which ended at the
close of the

##### (ii) items of income, gain, deduction, loss or credit of the
Corporation or any Subsidiary for the Straddle Period shall be allocated
between those two assumed taxation years based on a closing of the books; and

  

##### 

  

##### (iii) Taxes other than income Taxes will be allocated to each of the
taxation years in proportion to the number days in each such taxation year
relative to the number of days in the entire Straddle Period.

  

##### 

  

#### (d) For purposes of Section 11.1(a), Section 11.1(b) and Section
11.1(c), Vendor shall cause to be prepared notional Tax Returns for the
Corporation and each Subsidiary for, in the case of each Partnership
Subsidiary, the fiscal period of the Partnership Subsidiary that is deemed
under Section 11.1(c) to have ended at the close of the Working Capital Date
and, for the Corporation and each Corporate Subsidiary, the taxation year of
the Corporation or Corporate Subsidiary, as the case may be, that is deemed
under Section 11.1(c) to have ended at the close of the Working Capital Date,
for the purpose of determining the putative income Taxes for which Vendor is
liable under Section 11.1(a). Vendor shall be entitled, in preparing
such notional Tax Returns, to claim the maximum allowable amounts (taking
into account any limitations applicable to short periods) in respect
of discretionary deductions, including without limitation Resource Pools as
set out in Schedule 4.22. Purchaser shall have an opportunity to review and
comment on those Tax Returns, acting reasonably, and Vendor shall reasonably
consider and address any comments of Purchaser in that regard. The
Taxes reported on the notional Tax Returns shall then be included in the
Final Working Capital Statement; provided, however, that any failure of the
Parties to agree on the amount of Taxes that should be reflected on any
notional Tax Return shall be resolved pursuant to Section 3.3(d). If a
determination by any Government Authority with respect to the actual Tax
Return to which such notional Tax Return relates is inconsistent with such
notional Tax Return, the Taxes reported on the notional Tax Return shall be
recomputed consistent with such determination, and the Parties shall
reimburse each other, as appropriate, within 30 days after such
redetermination.

  

#### 

  

#### (e) The indemnities provided in this Section 11.1 are in addition to but
subject to the applicable provisions of Article 6 (other than Section 6.1,
Section 6.2(b) and Section 6.2(c)).

  

####

an opportunity to review and comment on those Tax Returns, acting
reasonably, before the filing of those Tax Returns and Vendor shall
reasonably consider and address any comments of Purchaser in that regard.
Vendor shall be entitled, in preparing such Tax Returns, to claim the maximum
allowable amounts in respect of discretionary deductions, including without
limitation Resource Pools.

  

#### 

  

#### (b) Purchaser shall cause to be prepared and filed on a timely basis all
Tax Returns for the Corporation and the Subsidiaries for any taxation year
which ends after the Closing Date and for which Tax Returns have not been

on any of those Tax Returns to the extent they relate

  



  

62   

     
   

  



  

#### to any period before the Closing Date, and to approve them, acting
reasonably, before the filing of those Tax Returns.

  

#### 

  

#### (c) Vendor shall pay and remit any Taxes due in respect of Tax Returns
referred to in Section 11.2(a). Purchaser shall or shall cause
the Corporation or any of the Subsidiaries to pay and remit any Taxes due

Purchaser shall reimburse the other Party for any Taxes for which Vendor or
Purchaser is liable pursuant to Section 11.1(a) or Section 11.1(b), as
applicable, but which are payable with Tax Returns to be filed by the other
Party pursuant to Section 11.2(a) and Section 11.2(b), as applicable, on the
written request of the Party entitled to reimbursement, setting forth in
detail the computation of the amount owed by Vendor or Purchaser, as
applicable, but in no event earlier than ten days before the due date for the
filing of any applicable Tax Returns, except to the extent such amounts have
already been paid as adjustments to the Purchase Price.  For greater
certainty, Section 10.7 shall apply to any payment made by one Party to the
other pursuant to this Section 11.2(c).

  

#### 

  

#### (d) Before Closing Vendor shall, and after Closing Purchaser shall,
cause the Corporation and the Subsidiaries to cooperate fully with each other
and make available to each other in a timely fashion such data and other
information as may reasonably be required for the preparation of any of those
Tax Returns referred to in this Section 11.2 and shall preserve that data and
other information until the expiration of any applicable limitation period
under any Applicable Laws with respect to Taxes.

  

#### 

  

#### (e) Any Tax Return to be prepared pursuant to the provisions of this
Section 11.2 shall be prepared in a manner consistent with practices followed
in prior years with respect to similar Tax Returns of the Corporation and the
Subsidiaries provided such historical practices are proper.

  

#### 

  

#### (f) Purchaser shall not and shall not allow the Corporation or any
Subsidiary to amend, refile or otherwise modify or grant an extension of any
statute of limitations with respect to any Tax Return for the Corporation or
the Subsidiaries for any taxation year ending on or before the Working
Capital Date or that includes any Straddle Period and shall not request an
audit or assessment of any such Tax Return, in each case without prior
written consent of Vendor.  Vendor shall not file an amended Tax Return for
the Corporation or the Subsidiaries for any taxable period ending on or
before the Closing Date and shall not request an audit or assessment of any
such Tax Return, in each case without written consent of Purchaser.

  

#### 

  

## **11.3** Confidentiality of Tax Information

  

## ** **

  

Unless otherwise required by Applicable Laws, securities regulatory authority
or stock exchange regulations or legal proceedings, each Party shall, and
shall cause its Representatives to, keep confidential and non-public Tax
information, records, and documents disclosed by the other Party, or to which
that Party has received or been granted access, pursuant to this Article 11
and will not use that Tax information for any purpose other than making the
determinations and taking such other actions contemplated by this Article 11.

  



  

## **11.4** Section 338 Election

  

## ** **

  

#### (a) Purchaser has the right to make an election under section 338(g) of
the Code (" **section 338 election**") with respect to the Purchase and the
deemed purchase of the shares of any eligible Subsidiary. Should Purchaser
make a section 338 election,

  



  

63   

     
   

  



  

#### Purchaser and Vendor shall cooperate fully with each other in the making
of that election.

  

#### 

  

#### (b) Provided that Purchaser makes a section 388 election, the Purchase
Price shall be allocated among the Assets in a manner required by Section 338
of the Code. Within 60 days after the Closing Date, Purchaser will provide to
Vendor copies of IRS Form 8883 and any required exhibits thereto (the "
**Asset Acquisition Statement** ") with Purchasers proposed allocation of
the Purchase Price (together with any assumable Liabilities). Within 15 days
after the receipt of that Asset Acquisition Statement, Vendor will propose to
Purchaser any changes in that Asset Acquisition Statement. If no such
changes are proposed in writing to Purchaser, Vendor shall be deemed to have
agreed to, and accepted the Asset Acquisition Statement). Purchaser and Vendor
will endeavour in good faith to resolve any differences with respect to the
Asset Acquisition Statement within 15 days after Purchasers receipt of
written notice of objection from Vendor. Should the Parties fail to reach an
agreement as required under this Section 11.4(b) the Parties further agree to
engage, as a shared expense, the Accounting Firm to resolve the issue.

  

#### 

  

#### (c) Provided that Purchaser makes a section 338 election, Vendor will,
at the request of Purchaser, cooperate with Purchaser to cause elections
under section 754 of the Code to be in effect on the Closing Date with
respect to any entity:

  

#### 

  

##### (i) in which the Corporation or its Subsidiaries holds an interest; and

  

##### 

  

##### (ii) that is treated as a partnership for United States federal income
tax purposes.

  

##### 

  

Any increase or decrease in the adjusted basis of the property of any
such partnership resulting from the section 338 election shall be allocated
among the assets of the partnership in a manner required by section 755 of
the Code and agreed on by the Parties under procedures consistent with those
described in Section 11.4(b).

  



  

#### (d) If Purchaser does not make a section 338 election, Purchaser shall
cause the Corporation not to make any distributions that would reduce the
amount Vendor must include in income as a dividend under Section 964(e) of
the Code with respect to the Purchase.

  

#### 

  

#### (e) Provided that Purchaser makes a section 338 election and, except as
provided below, Purchaser shall pay to Vendor the excess, if any (the total
excess being the " **Unused Tax Credits** "), of:

  

#### 

  

##### (i) the deemed paid credit that would have been allowed by section 960
of the Code to Vendors United States shareholders (as defined in section
951(b) of the Code) as a result of Vendors sale of the Purchased Shares to
Purchaser, if the limitations of sections 904 and 907 of the Code were
applied without regard to the section 338 election; less

  

##### 

  

##### (ii) the deemed paid credit actually allowed by section 960 of the Code
(subject to the limitations of sections 904 and 907 of the Code) to Vendors
United States shareholders as a result of Vendors sale of the Purchased
Shares to Seller, after a final determination by the appropriate Governmental
Authority.

  

##### 

  

The payment for the Unused Tax Credits shall be made within 30 days after the
final determination by the appropriate Governmental Authority and shall
include any

  



  

64   

     
   

  



  

penalties and interest assessed in that final determination as a result of a
disallowance of the Unused Tax Credits. Notwithstanding the foregoing
provisions of Section 11.4(e), Purchaser shall have no obligation to make any
payment for the Unused Tax Credits, penalties or interest unless:

  



  

###### (A) Vendors United States shareholders claim on their original Tax
Returns the deemed paid credits described in Section 11.4(e)(i);

  

###### 

  

###### (B) Vendors United States shareholders defend the position taken on
their original Tax Returns for the deemed paid credits described in Section
11.4(e)(i) to the point of a final determination by an appropriate
Governmental Authority;

  

###### 

  

###### (C) Purchaser is entitled to review and comment on Vendors United
States shareholders defense; and

  

###### 

  

###### (D) Vendors United States shareholders do not accept a determination
from an appropriate Government Authority that increases Unused Tax Credits
without the written consent of Purchaser.

  

###### 

  

## **11.5** Tax Claims

  

## ** **

  

#### (a) Each Party shall promptly notify the other Party in writing on
receipt by that Party or any of their respective Affiliates (including for
Purchaser the Corporation and the Subsidiaries) or Representatives of notice
of any pending or threatened federal, provincial, state, local or foreign Tax
audits, examinations, claims or assessments (a "Tax Claim") for which that
Party is entitled to seek, or is seeking or intends to seek, indemnification
pursuant to the applicable part of Section 11.1.

  

#### 

  

#### (b) Purchaser shall represent the interests of the Corporation and the
Subsidiaries in and with respect to any Tax Claim relating to taxation years
ending on or before the Working Capital Date and employ counsel of its own
choice for that purpose. Vendor shall be entitled to participate in or with
respect to that Tax Claim relating (in whole or in part) to
Taxes attributable to taxation years ending on or before the Working Capital
Date and, with the written consent of Purchaser, and at Vendors sole
expense, may assume the entire control of that Tax Claim.  Purchaser, with
the written consent of Vendor, shall have the right to settle, either
administratively or after the commencement of litigation, any proceeding
relating to Taxes of the Corporation and any of the Subsidiaries for any
taxation year ending on or before the Working Capital Date. In the case of any
Straddle Period, Vendor shall be entitled to participate at its expense in or
with respect to any Tax Claim relating (in whole or in part) to Taxes
attributable to the part of that Straddle Period ending on or before the
Working Capital Date, and with the written consent of Purchaser, and at
Vendors sole expense, may assume the entire control of that Tax Claim.
From and after the Closing, neither Purchaser, the Corporation, any
Subsidiary nor any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives shall
settle or compromise, or agree to settle or compromise, any Tax Claim which
may be the subject of indemnification by Vendor under Section 11.1 without
the prior written consent of Vendor.

  

#### 

  

#### (c) If the results of any Tax Claim involve an issue that:

  

#### 

  

##### (i) recurs in any taxation year (or part thereof) of the Corporation or
any Subsidiary ending on or after the Closing Date; or

  



  

65   

     
   

  



  

##### (ii) otherwise may reasonably be expected to materially and adversely
affect Purchaser, the Corporation or any Subsidiary for any taxation year (or
part thereof) ending on or after the Closing Date, then there shall be no
settlement, closing or other agreement with respect to that issue without the
consent of such affected Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed. Purchaser shall have the right to control the conduct of
any Tax Claim relating to the Corporation or any Subsidiary with respect to
any Tax matter arising in a period (or part thereof) ending after the Closing
Date.

  

##### 

  

## **11.6** Assistance and Cooperation

  

## ** **

  

After the Closing, Vendor and Purchaser shall (and shall cause their
respective Affiliates to):

  



  

#### (a) cooperate in a timely manner in preparing for any audits of, or
disputes with taxing authorities regarding, any Tax Returns of the
Corporation and the Subsidiaries;

  

#### 

  

#### (b) make available to the other Party and to any taxing authority in a
timely manner as reasonably requested all information, records, and documents
relating to Taxes and Tax Planning of the Corporation and the Subsidiaries or
their Assets or the Business;

  

#### 

  

#### (c) provide timely notice to the other in writing of any pending or
threatened Tax audits or assessment of the Corporation or the Subsidiaries
for taxation year or other periods for which the other may have a liability
under this Article 11;

  

#### 

  

#### (d) within 30 days of the receipt of a written request therefor, furnish
the other with copies of all correspondence received from any taxing
authority in connection with any Tax audit or information request with
respect to any such taxation year or other periods of the Corporation or any
of the Subsidiaries;

  

#### 

  

#### (e) timely provide to the other Party powers of attorney or similar
authorizations necessary to carry out the purposes of this Article 11; and

  

#### 

  

#### (f) use reasonable efforts to properly retain and maintain accounting
and Tax records and information, in a timely manner consistent with taxing
authority guidelines, to the extent those records and information relate to
the Corporation and the Subsidiaries or any of the Assets and the Business
until 120 days following the expiration of the applicable statute of
limitations period, and promptly notify the other Party prior to destruction
of any of those Tax records or that information and provide the other Party a
reasonable opportunity to make and retain copies of any of those Tax records
or that information.

before the Outside Date.

  

#### 

  

## **12.2** Regarding Termination by Purchaser

  

## ** **

  

Any termination of this Agreement by Purchaser pursuant to Section 12.1 shall
be without prejudice to any Claims Purchaser may have arising hereunder out
of any incorrect or inaccurate representations or warranties of Vendor in
this Agreement or any breach by Vendor of any of its covenants in this
Agreement, but subject always to the limitations set forth in Article 6.

  



  

## **12.3** Regarding Termination by Vendor

  

## ** **

  

Any termination of this Agreement by Vendor pursuant to Section 12.1 shall be

## **12.4** Deposit

  

## ** **

  

#### (a) At or before the Closing Time or at such time as this Agreement
is terminated before Closing, as applicable, Vendor and Purchaser shall
provide written notice to the Escrow Agent which notice shall direct the
Escrow Agent as to the payment of the Deposit.

  

#### 

  

#### (b) If the Closing does not occur because any representations
or warranties made by Purchaser are incorrect or inaccurate or because
Purchaser failed to perform any of its obligations or covenants under this
Agreement, the full amount of the Deposit together with all accrued interest
(less any applicable withholding Taxes) shall become the property of, shall
be paid by the Escrow Agent to and may be retained by, Vendor as liquidated
damages (and not as a penalty) to compensate Vendor for the expenses incurred
and opportunities foregone as a result of the failure of the Purchase
to close. To the extent the Deposit is paid to Vendor in the circumstances
described in this Section 12.4(b), Vendor shall retain the Deposit, plus any
interest thereon (less applicable withholding Taxes), as genuine pre-estimate
by Vendor and Purchaser of Vendors liquidated damages, not as a penalty and
as Vendors sole remedy hereunder against Purchaser for all breaches hereof
prior to the Closing or in connection with the termination of the Purchase.

  

####

by Purchaser in the performance of its obligations or covenants under
this Agreement or any representations or warranties made by Purchaser
being incorrect or inaccurate, the full amount of the Deposit together with

immediately returned to Purchaser.

## **12.6** Effect of Termination

  

## ** **

  

Each Partys right of termination under this Article 12 is in addition to any
other rights it may have under this Agreement or otherwise, and the exercise
of a right of termination will not be an election of remedies. Nothing in
this Article 12 shall limit or affect any other rights or causes of
action either Purchaser or Vendor may have with respect to the
representations, warranties, covenants and indemnities in its favour
contained in this Agreement. Nothing in this Article 12 shall be deemed to

exchange with which the disclosing Party or any Affiliate of either Party is

further that such Affiliate enters into an agreement with Vendor satisfactory
to Vendor, pursuant to which that Affiliate expressly assumes all of
Purchasers obligations under this Agreement and, if that assignment occurs
before the Closing, that Affiliate covenants to remain an Affiliate of
Purchaser until Closing. Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Section
13.4, this Agreement shall inure to the benefit of, be enforceable by and be
