to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction thereof) or
on such other date as is mutually agreeable to the Buyer and Seller
Representative; _provided, however_ , that the Closing need not be in person.
The date of the Closing is referred to herein as the " _Closing Date_."

(b) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, the parties hereto shall consummate the following transactions as
of the Closing:

(i) the Sellers shall deliver to the Buyer certificates representing the
Shares, and stock powers, executed in blank, transferring the Shares to the
Buyer;

 

(ii) the Buyer shall deliver to the Seller Representative, on behalf of the
Sellers, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account(s)
and in the amounts designated by the Seller Representative, the Estimated
Purchase Price less the Escrow Amount;

 



8 (iii) the Buyer shall deliver to Wells Fargo Bank, National Association
(the " _Escrow Agent_ "), the Escrow Amount by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to the accounts designated therefor in the Escrow Agreement,
substantially in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit C_ (the "
_Escrow Agreement_ ");

(iv) the Buyer shall pay on behalf of the Company or cause the Company to
repay, all Funded Indebtedness of the Company in accordance with the terms
thereof; and

(v) the Buyer, the Company and the Sellers shall make such other deliveries
as are required by and in accordance with ARTICLE 9 hereof.

2.04 Post-Closing Adjustment.

 

(a) _Post-Closing Determination_. Within sixty (60) days after the Closing
Date, the Buyer and its auditors shall prepare, and deliver to the Seller
Representative, (i) a statement, which shall include (A) a consolidated
balance sheet of the Company and its Subsidiaries, and (B) the Buyers
determinations of the Cash Amount, the Indebtedness Payoff Amount and the Net
Working Capital Amount, and (ii) the Buyers calculation of the Actual
Purchase Price (as defined below) (collectively, the " _Draft Computation_ ").
The Buyer and its auditors will make available to the Seller Representative
and its auditors all records and work papers used in preparing the Draft
Computation, and will prepare and deliver to the Seller Representative a
detailed analysis of the changes behind any material variance(s) between
the Buyers determinations of the Cash Amount, the Indebtedness Payoff Amount
and the Net Working Capital Amount, and the corresponding estimates of such
amounts as determined by the Company and referred to in _Section 2.01_
hereof. If the Seller Representative disagrees with any aspect of the Draft
Computation, the Seller Representative may, within forty-five (45) days after
receipt of the Draft Computation, deliver a notice (an " _Objection Notice_ ")
to the Buyer setting forth the Seller Representatives determination of the
Cash Amount, the Indebtedness Payoff Amount and/or the Net Working Capital
Amount and the Seller Representatives calculation of the Actual Purchase
Price. If the Seller Representative does not deliver an Objection Notice to
the Buyer within forty-five (45) days after receipt of the Draft Computation,
then the parties hereto will be deemed to have agreed to the Draft Computation
and such computation shall be deemed to be finally determined as set forth
therein. The Buyer and the Seller Representative shall use reasonable efforts
to resolve any disagreements as to the Draft Computation and the Objection
Notice, but if they do not obtain a final resolution within forty-five (45)
days after the Buyer has received the Objection Notice, the Buyer and the
Seller Representative shall jointly retain McGladrey LLP, or such other
accounting firm acceptable to the Buyer and the Seller Representative (the "
_Firm_ ") to resolve any remaining disagreements. The Buyer and the Seller
Representative shall direct the Firm to render a determination within thirty
(30) days after its retention and the Buyer, the Seller Representative and
their respective agents shall cooperate

 



9  with the Firm during its engagement. The Firm may consider only those items
and amounts in the Draft Computation or Objection Notice which the Buyer and
the Seller Representative are unable to resolve. In resolving any disputed
item, the Firm will act as an expert and not as an arbitrator in conducting
its analysis, and may not assign a value to any item greater than the greatest
value for such item claimed by either party or less than the smallest value
for such item claimed by either party. The Firms determination shall be based
solely on written submissions by the Buyer and the Seller Representative
(i.e., not on independent review) and on the definitions included herein. The
determination of the Firm shall be conclusive and binding upon the Buyer and
the Sellers. The costs and expenses of the Firm shall be borne (i) by the
Sellers (on a pro rata basis as allocated by the Seller Representative) if the
objections raised in the Objection Notice are resolved in favor of the Buyer,
or (ii) by the Buyer if the objections raised in the Objection Notice are
resolved in favor of the Sellers. If the objections raised in the Objection
Notice are resolved in part in favor of the Sellers and part in favor of the
Buyer, such costs and expenses shall be shared by the Buyer, on the one hand,
and the Sellers (on a pro rata basis as allocated by the Seller
Representative), on the other hand, in proportion to the aggregate dollar
amount of such objections resolved in favor of the Sellers compared to the
aggregate dollar amount of such objections resolved in favor of the Buyer.

 

The " _Actual Purchase Price_ " means an amount equal to (A) the Transaction
Value, (B) _plus_ the Cash Amount, (C) _minus_ the Indebtedness Payoff
Amount, and (D) _plus_ the excess of the Net Working Capital Amount over the
Target Net Working Capital Amount or _minus_ the excess of the Target Net
Working Capital Amount over the Net Working Capital Amount (as the case may
be), in each case as finally determined pursuant to this _Section 2.04_.

 

(b) _Post-Closing Adjustment_.

 

(i) _Payment by the Buyer Actual Purchase Price_. If the Actual Purchase
Price is greater than the Estimated Purchase Price, within five (5) Business
Days after the final determination of the Actual Purchase Price, the Buyer
shall pay to the Seller Representative, on behalf of the Sellers, by wire
transfer or delivery of other immediately available funds, an amount equal to
such difference.

(ii) _Payment by the Sellers Actual Purchase Price_. If the Actual
Purchase Price is less than the Estimated Purchase Price, then within five
(5) Business Days after the determination thereof, the Seller Representative
shall instruct the Escrow Agent to pay to the Buyer from the Adjustment Escrow
Amount, by wire transfer or delivery of other immediately available funds, an
amount equal to such difference (the " _Seller Adjustment Payment_ ").

 

(iii) _Dispute_. If, pursuant to this _Section 2.04_, there is a dispute as
to the final determination of the Actual Purchase Price, the Buyer, on the
one hand, and the Sellers, on the other hand, shall promptly pay to the other,
as appropriate, such amounts as are not in dispute pending final determination
of such dispute pursuant to this  _Section 2.04_.

 



10 2.05 Escrow.

 

(a) Effective as of the Closing, the Seller Representative and the Buyer shall
enter into the Escrow Agreement with the Escrow Agent. In accordance with the
terms of the Escrow Agreement, the Buyer shall deposit with the Escrow Agent
(i) cash in an amount equal to $2,500,000 (the " _Adjustment Escrow Amount_ ")
to be held in a single escrow account (the " _Adjustment Escrow Account_ ")
to be managed and paid out by the Escrow Agent in accordance with the terms of
the Escrow Agreement and solely to secure any Seller Adjustment Payment
pursuant to  _Section 2.04(b)(ii)_ and (ii) the Indemnification Escrow
Amount to be held in a single escrow account (the " _Indemnification Escrow
Account_ ") to be managed and paid out by the Escrow Agent after the Closing
in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement; _provided_ , _however_
, that if the Seller Adjustment Payment is greater than the funds in the
Adjustment Escrow Account, then the Escrow Agent shall pay, by wire transfer
of immediately available funds from the funds in the Indemnification Escrow
Account that amount by which the Seller Adjustment Payment exceeds the funds
in the Adjustment Escrow Account pursuant to the terms and conditions of the
Escrow Agreement.

 

(b) Immediately after the final determination of the Actual Purchase Price and
payment of a Seller Adjustment Payment (if any), any remaining funds in the
Adjustment Escrow Account shall be released by the Escrow Agent in accordance
with the Escrow Agreement to an account or accounts specified in writing by
the Seller Representative.

 

2.06 Withholding. The Buyer shall be entitled to deduct, withhold and deliver
to the appropriate Governmental Authority from the consideration otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement to the Sellers or any other Person such
amounts as the Buyer is required to deduct and withhold under the Code, or any
Tax law, with respect to the making of such payment. To the extent that any
such required amounts are so withheld and delivered, such withheld amounts
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
Person in respect of whom such deduction and withholding was made.

Seller Representative such books and records or any portion thereof which the
Buyer or the Company (or any Subsidiary) may intend to destroy, alter
or otherwise dispose of.

 



30 7.03 Notification. Prior to the Closing, upon discovery of any variances from
the representations and warranties of the Buyer contained in this Agreement,
the Buyer shall promptly notify the Company and the Seller Representative of
such variances.

 

7.04 Director and Officer Liability, Indemnification and Insurance. For a
period of six (6) years after the Closing Date, the Buyer shall not, and
shall not permit the Company (or any Subsidiary) to amend, repeal or modify
any provision in the Companys certificate of incorporation or bylaws (or
equivalent documents) relating to the exculpation or indemnification of any
current or former officer, manager, director or similar functionary (unless
required by law), it being the intent of the parties that the officers,
managers, directors and similar functionaries of the Company (and/or the
Subsidiaries) shall continue to be entitled to such exculpation and
indemnification to the fullest extent of the law. The Buyer shall cause the
Company (and each Subsidiary) to maintain its existing officers and
directors liability insurance, or other liability insurance that covers
events occurring prior to the Closing on terms and in amounts no less
favorable to its officers, directors and similar functionaries than its
existing officers and directors liability insurance for a period of six (6)
years after the Closing. Before the third (3rd) anniversary of the Closing
Date, if the Company or any Subsidiary or any of their respective successors
or assigns (i) shall consolidate with or merge into any other Person and
shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) shall transfer all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper
provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Company
(or any Subsidiary) shall assume all of the obligations set forth in this
_Section 7.04_. The provisions of this _Section 7.04_ are intended for the
benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each current and former officer,
director or similar functionary of the Company (or any Subsidiary) and his or
her heirs and representatives, and are in addition to, and not in substitution
for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such person
may have had by contract or otherwise.

7.05 Employment and Benefit Arrangements. From and after the Closing Date,
the Buyer shall cause the Company and each Subsidiary to honor all employment,
severance, termination, consulting, retirement and other compensation and
benefit plans, arrangements and agreements to which the Company or such
Subsidiary is a party, as such plans, arrangements and agreements are in
effect on the date hereof; _provided_ that the requirements of this sentence
shall not prevent the amendment or termination of any such
plans, arrangements or agreements in accordance with their terms. With
respect to any Employee Benefit Plans maintained by the Buyer or an Affiliate
of the Buyer (" _Buyer Employee Benefit Plans_ ") in which any employees of
the Company or any Subsidiary participate on or after the Closing, the Buyer
or its Affiliate, as applicable, shall: (i) use commercially reasonable
efforts to waive all pre-existing conditions, exclusions and waiting periods
with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to such
employees, except to the extent such pre-existing conditions, exclusions or
waiting periods applied under the similar plan in effect immediately prior to
the Closing; (ii) use 

 



31  commercially reasonable efforts to provide each such employee with credit
for any co-payments and deductibles paid (to the same extent such credit was
given for the year under the similar plan in effect immediately prior to the
Closing) in satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket
requirements; and (iii) recognize all continuous service of the Companys
employees with the Company or any Subsidiary, as applicable, for all purposes
(including, without limitation, for purposes of eligibility to participate,
vesting credit and entitlement to benefits, but excluding benefit accrual
under a defined benefit pension plan) under any Buyer Employee Benefit Plan in
which such employees may be eligible to participate after the Closing;
_provided_ _that_ the foregoing shall not apply to the extent it would result
in a duplication of benefits. This _Section 7.05_ shall survive the Closing.
Nothing in this _Section 7.05_ shall create any third-party beneficiary
right in any Person other than the parties to this Agreement, including any
employee (or any representative thereof), or create any right to continued
employment with the Buyer, the Company, any Subsidiary or any of their
respective Affiliates. Nothing in this _Section 7.05_ shall constitute an
amendment to any Employee Benefit Plan or Buyer Employee Benefit Plan or any
other plan or arrangement covering employees or shall prevent the amendment
or termination of any such Employee Benefit Plan or Buyer Employee Benefit
Plan, plan or arrangement.

 

7.06 Regulatory Filings. The Buyer shall, within ten (10) Business Days after
the date hereof, make or cause to be made all filings and submissions
required of the Buyer under any laws or regulations applicable to the Buyer
for the consummation of the transactions contemplated herein. The Buyer shall
be responsible for all filing fees under any such laws or
regulations applicable to the Buyer.

ARTICLE 8

 

 _ADDITIONAL COVENANTS OF THE PARTIES_

 

8.01 Reasonable Best Efforts; Further Assurances. Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, the Buyer and the Sellers shall use their
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary
or desirable to cause the conditions set forth in _ARTICLE 9_ to be satisfied
and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated, in
each case as promptly after the date hereof as practicable. Except as
otherwise expressly set forth in this Agreement, neither the Sellers nor the
Company on the one hand, nor the Buyer on the other hand, shall have any
obligation to pay any material amounts or incur any material liability or
obligation to any third party as a condition or inducement for obtaining any
consents described on _Schedule 9.01(e)_. Each of the Sellers, the Company
and the Buyer agree to execute and deliver such other documents,
certificates, agreements and other writings and to take such other actions as
may be necessary or desirable in order to consummate or implement
expeditiously the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. From time to
time, as and when requested by any party hereto and at such partys expense,
any other party shall execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and
delivered, all such documents and instruments and shall take, or cause to be
taken, all such further or other actions as such other party may reasonably
deem necessary or desirable to evidence and effectuate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 



32 8.02 Further Cooperation. Each of the Sellers and the Buyer shall cooperate
with each other (i) in determining whether any action by or in respect of, or
filing with, any Governmental Authority is required, or any actions, consents,
approvals or waivers are required to be obtained under any material contracts,
in each case in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and (ii) in taking such actions or making any
such filings, in furnishing information required in connection therewith and
in seeking timely to obtain any such actions, consents, approvals or waivers.

8.03 Public Announcements. No press release or other public announcement
related to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated herein shall be
issued or made without the joint approval of the Buyer and the Seller
Representative, and, in the event such release or announcement includes the
name of a Seller, the approval of such Seller, unless, in any case, such
release or announcement is required by law or the rules of any securities
exchange on which securities of the Buyer are traded (in the reasonable
opinion of counsel), in which case the Buyer and the Seller Representative
shall have the right to review and comment on such public announcement prior
to publication; _provided_ _,_ _however_ , that nothing shall prevent a Seller
or its Affiliates from making a press release in their customary form
following a disposition that describes the nature of the transaction in
general terms (including the proceeds received by such Seller and its
Affiliates, any gain or loss on their investment, and their internal rate of
return).

 

8.04 Tax Matters.

(a) All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration, value added
and other such Taxes and fees (including any penalties and interest) incurred
in connection with this Agreement shall be borne and paid by the Buyer when
due, and the Buyer will, at its own expense, file all necessary Tax returns
and other documentation with respect to all such Taxes and fees, and, if
required by applicable law or regulation, the Seller Representative, on behalf
of the Sellers, will execute and deliver any such Tax Returns and other
documentation. The Seller Representative, on behalf of the Sellers, shall
prepare or cause to be prepared and timely file or cause to be timely filed
all Tax Returns for the Company and its Subsidiaries that are filed on or
before the Closing Date. Such Tax Returns shall be prepared by treating items
on such Tax Returns in a manner consistent with the past practices of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, as applicable, with respect to such items,
except as required by applicable Law. At least fifteen (15) days prior to
filing any such Tax Return, the Seller Representative shall submit a copy of
such Tax Return to Buyer for Buyers review and approval, which approval shall
not be unreasonably withheld. The Buyer shall prepare or cause to be prepared
and file or cause to be filed all Tax Returns for the Company and each
Subsidiary for all periods ending prior to or including the Closing Date which
are filed after the Closing Date. At least fifteen (15) days prior to the
date on which each such Tax Return is filed, the Buyer shall submit such Tax
Return to the Seller Representative for its review and approval, which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. Seller Representative, on behalf
of each Seller, shall pay any Taxes relating to a Pre-Closing Tax Period
(including the portion of any Tax period that ends of the Closing Date)
reflected on such Tax Returns at least two (2) days prior to the date
on which such Taxes are due. With respect to Taxes of the Company and its
Subsidiaries relating to a Straddle Period, the

 



33  portion of any Tax that is allocable to the taxable period that is deemed to
end on the Closing Date will be: (i) in the case of Property Taxes, deemed to
be the amount of such Taxes for the entire Straddle Period multiplied by a
fraction, the numerator of which is the number of calendar days of such
Straddle Period in the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the denominator of which is
the number of calendar days in the entire Straddle Period, and (ii) in the
case of all other Taxes, determined as though the taxable year of the Company
terminated at the close of business on the Closing Date.

 

(b) The Sellers shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Buyer from and
against any and all losses arising out of or in connection with (i) any Taxes
of the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax
Period; (ii) Taxes of Sellers for any Tax period; and (iii) Taxes of any other
Person imposed on the Company or its Subsidiaries for any Pre-Closing Tax
Period, whether imposed as a result of Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 or
any provision of any foreign, state or local Tax law having similar effect, as
transferee, successor, by contract or otherwise.

 

(c) The Buyer and the Sellers shall each cooperate to the extent reasonably
requested by the other party, in connection with the filing of Tax Returns
and any audit, litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Such cooperation shall include the
reasonable retention and (upon the other partys request) the provision of
records and information reasonably relevant to any such audit, litigation or
other proceeding and making employees reasonably available on a mutually
convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any
material provided hereunder. The Buyer and the Sellers shall (i) retain all
books and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Company or its
Subsidiaries relating to any taxable period beginning before the Closing Date
until expiration of the statute of limitations (taking into account any
extensions thereof) of the respective taxable periods and (ii) give the other
party reasonable written notice prior to transferring, destroying or
discarding any such books and records and, if the other party so requests,
shall allow the requesting party to take possession of such books and records.

(d) Following the Closing, for each of the fiscal quarters in 2014 ending
after the Closing Date and for the Companys 2014 taxable year, the Buyer
shall calculate the Post-Closing Transaction Tax Benefit Amount, if any,
actually realized by the Company or such Subsidiary with respect to such
taxable period in connection with the filing of any Tax Return or payment of
any estimated Tax, and shall pay or cause to be paid such amount to the Seller
Representative for the benefit of the Sellers within ten (10) days after the
applicable Tax Return is filed or the applicable estimated Tax payment is
made. If the amount of the Post-Closing Transaction Tax Benefit used in
determining any estimated Tax payment is greater than the actual Post-Closing
Transaction Tax Benefit as determined for purposes of filing the Company and
its Subsidiarys 2014 Tax Returns, the Sellers shall reimburse the Buyer for
such difference.

 

(e) In computing the Post-Closing Transaction Tax Benefit Amount, the Company
and each Subsidiary shall be deemed to recognize any Post-Closing Transaction
Tax Deductions after recognizing all other available items of loss, deduction
or credit of the Company or such Subsidiary.

 



34 (f) The Sellers shall promptly refund to the Buyer the amount of any Post-
Closing Transaction Tax Benefit Amount received by the Sellers to the extent
that any Post-Closing Transaction Tax Deduction is subsequently disallowed or
reduced by any Taxing Authority.

 

(g) With respect to any income Taxes of the Company and its Subsidiaries for
any Pre-Closing Tax Period beginning January 1, 2014 and ending on the
Closing Date, all Pre-Closing Transaction Tax Deductions will be used and
applied before any Post-Closing Transaction Tax Deductions are used and
applied.

 

(h) The Buyer, the Company and its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and the
Sellers, on the other hand, shall promptly notify each other upon receipt by
such party of written notice of any inquiries, claims, assessments, audits or
similar events with respect to Taxes relating to a Pre-Closing Tax Period (any
such inquiry, claim, assessment, audit or similar event, a " _Tax Matter_ ").
Any failure to so notify the other party of any Tax Matter shall not relieve
such other party of any liability with respect to such Tax Matters except to
the extent such party was actually prejudiced as a result thereof. The
Buyer shall have sole control of the conduct of all Tax Matters, including
any settlement or compromise thereof; _provided_ _,_ _however_ _,_ that the
Buyer shall keep the Seller Representative reasonably informed of the progress
of any Tax Matter and shall not effect any such settlement or compromise with
respect to which the Sellers are liable without obtaining the Seller
Representatives prior written consent thereto, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed. 

8.05 Disclosure Generally. The Schedules have been arranged, for purposes of
convenience only, as separately titled Schedules corresponding to the
Sections of _ARTICLE 3_. Any information set forth in any Schedule or
incorporated in any Section of this Agreement shall be considered to have been
set forth in each other Schedule and shall be deemed to modify
the representations and warranties in _ARTICLE 3_ to the extent reasonably
apparent. The specification of any dollar amount in the representations and
warranties contained in this Agreement or the inclusion of any specific item
in the Schedules is not intended to imply that such amounts, or higher or
lower amounts, or the items so included or other items, are or are not
required to be disclosed or are within or outside of the ordinary course of
business, and neither party shall use the fact of the setting of such amounts
or the fact of the inclusion of any such item in the Schedules in any dispute
or controversy with any party as to whether any obligation, item or matter not
described herein or included in a Schedule is or is not required to be
disclosed (including, without limitation, whether such amounts are required to
be disclosed as material) or in the ordinary course of business for the
purposes of this Agreement. The information contained in the Schedules
is disclosed solely for the purposes of this Agreement, and no information
contained therein shall be deemed to be an admission by any party hereto to
any third party of any matter whatsoever, including of any violation of law or
breach of any agreement.

 



35 8.06 Conflicts and Privilege. It is acknowledged by each of the parties hereto
that the Sellers and the Company have retained HandK to act as their counsel in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and that HandK has not
acted as counsel for any other party in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby and that none of the other parties has the status of a
client of HandK for conflict of interest or any other purposes as a result
thereof. The Buyer hereby agrees that, in the event that a dispute arises
after the Closing between the Buyer and the Sellers, HandK may represent the
Sellers in such dispute even though the interests of the Sellers may be
directly adverse to the Buyer or the Company, even though HandK may have
represented the Company in a matter substantially related to such dispute, or
may be handling ongoing matters for the Buyer or the Company. The Buyer
further agrees that, as to all communications among HandK, the Company, and/or
the Sellers that directly relate to the negotiation and execution of this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, the
attorney-client privilege and the expectation of client confidence belongs to
the Sellers and may be controlled by the Sellers and shall not pass to or be
claimed by the Buyer or the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the
event that a dispute arises between the Buyer, the Company and a third party
other than a party to this Agreement after the Closing, the Company may assert
the attorney-client privilege to prevent disclosure of confidential
communications by HandK to such third party; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Company may not waive such privilege without the prior written consent of HandK
and the Seller Representative.

 

8.07 HSR Act. The Buyer, the Seller Representative and the Company shall,
within ten (10) Business Days after the date hereof, if required by law, file
with the United States Department of Justice and the United States Federal
Trade Commission the Notification and Report Form required to be filed by them
under the HSR Act concerning the transactions contemplated hereby, and shall
request early termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act. The Buyer,
the Sellers and the Company hereby agree that they will promptly comply with
any request by the Department of Justice or the Federal Trade Commission for
additional documents or information, and will use commercially reasonable
efforts to ensure that such waiting period shall expire, or that clearance
will be obtained, as soon as practicable after the execution and delivery of
this Agreement.

 

8.08 Buyer Financing. The Sellers acknowledge that the Buyer may undertake an
equity and/or debt financing (the " _Financing_ "), the proceeds of which may
be used to fund all or a portion of the Purchase Price; _provided that_ , the
Closing and the Buyers obligations under this Agreement shall not be
conditioned upon the successful completion of the Financing. The Company and
the Seller Representative, on behalf of the Sellers, agree that they shall use
their respective commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with the Buyers
efforts to complete the Financing, including, if requested by the Buyer: (a)
assisting the Buyers auditors in preparing audited financial statements for
the Company and its Subsidiaries for the year ended December 31, 2013; (b)
using commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Companys independent
auditors to deliver customary "comfort letters" in connection with the
Financing, which comfort letters shall comply with the requirements of PCAOB
AU Section 634 and cover such periods as are addressed by the applicable
Financial Statements and are required under Regulation S-X to

 



36  be included in a registration statement for a Financing registered with the
Securities and Exchange Commission, together with negative assurance for any
subsequent partial period for which the applicable financial information for
the Company and its Subsidiaries is available to the extent such partial
period is within 135 days of the date of the latest audited or reviewed
financial statements for the Business; and (c) providing such information to
the underwriters, initial purchasers, lenders or other parties in any such
proposed Financing as may be reasonably requested in connection with such
parties due diligence investigation of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, including permitting the Buyers lenders or their agents to
conduct an on-site evaluation of the Company and its Subsidiaries. The Buyer
shall promptly, upon request by the Company from time to time, reimburse the
Company for the reasonable, documented out-of-pocket costs incurred by the
Company in connection with such cooperation.

8.09 No Solicitation or Negotiation. Except as otherwise specifically
contemplated by this Agreement, between the date of this Agreement and the
earlier of (a) the Closing and (b) the termination of this Agreement, neither
the Sellers, the Company, the Companys Affiliates, nor their respective
officers, directors, representatives or agents will (i) solicit, initiate,
consider, encourage or accept any other proposals or offers from any Person
(A) relating to any acquisition or purchase of all or any portion of the
capital stock of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
material assets, (B) to enter into any merger, consolidation, combination,
recapitalization, reorganization or any other extraordinary
business transaction involving or otherwise relating to the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or (ii) knowingly participate in any discussions,
conversations, negotiations and other communications regarding, or furnish to
any other Person any information with respect to, or otherwise cooperate in
any way, assist or participate in, facilitate or encourage any effort or
attempt by any other Person to seek to do any of the foregoing. The Sellers
shall notify the Buyer promptly if any such proposal or offer, or any
substantive inquiry or other contact with any Person after the date hereof
with respect thereto, is made and shall, in any such notice to the Buyer,
indicate in reasonable detail the identity of the Person making
such proposal, offer, inquiry or contact and the terms and conditions of such
proposal, offer, inquiry or other contact (unless such proposal or offer was
unsolicited and its disclosure would subject the Company or the Sellers to
liability to the party which made such proposal or offer). The Sellers and
the Company will not, without the prior written consent of the Buyer, release
any Person from, or waive any provision of, any confidentiality or standstill
agreement to which any of the Sellers or the Company is a party.

8.10 Guaranty. By execution of this Agreement, the Guarantor hereby
absolutely, irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees the full and prompt
payment and performance of each of the obligations of the Buyer and its
successors and permitted assigns pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. This
guaranty is a guaranty of payment and performance and not merely for
collection. The Guarantor knowingly and fully waives any and all defenses of a
guarantor, including presentment, right to approve any amendment to this
Agreement, insufficient consideration and all others, and all
suretyship defenses. The Guarantor hereby acknowledges that the Guarantors
obligations under this _Section 8.10_ shall not be affected or impaired by
reason of any bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership or other such proceeding
relating to the Buyer. Nothing set forth in this _Section 8.10_ confers or
gives, or shall be construed to

 



37  confer or give to any person other than the Company, the Sellers and the
Seller Representative any remedies under or by reason of the obligations of
the Guarantor set forth in this  _Section 8.10_. The obligations set forth
in this _Section 8.10_ shall be binding on the Guarantors successors and
assigns.

transactions contemplated hereby.

The party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to clauses (b),
(c), (d) or (e) of this _Section 10.01_ shall give written notice of such
termination to the other parties hereto.

 

10.02 Effect of Termination. In the event this Agreement is terminated by
either the Buyer or the Seller Representative as provided in  _Section
10.01_, the provisions of this Agreement shall immediately become void and of
no further force and effect (other than _Section 7.01_ (Confidentiality),
_Section 8.03_ (Public Announcements), this  _Section 10.02_ and _ARTICLE
12_, each of which shall survive the termination of this Agreement), and there
shall be no liability on the part of the Buyer, the Company or the Sellers to

Agreement prior to the time of such termination.

 



41 ARTICLE 11

 

 _ADDITIONAL COVENANTS_

 

11.01 Survival Period. The representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements set forth in this Agreement and in any certificates delivered at
the Closing in connection with this Agreement shall survive as described below
and, after the expiration of the period described below, and thereafter shall
be of no further force or effect.

 

(a) The Special Representations shall survive for a period beginning on the
Closing Date and ending on the date that is seven (7) years after the Closing
Date (the " _Special Representation Survival Period_ ");

(b) The Extended Representations shall survive for a period beginning on the
Closing Date and ending on the expiration of the applicable statute of
limitations (the " _Extended Representation Survival Period_ ");

 

(c) The General Representations shall survive for a period beginning on the

Closing Date (the " _General Representation Survival Period_ "); and

(d) The Covenants shall survive for a period beginning on the Closing Date
and ending on the date that is fifteen (15) months after the Closing Date (the
" _Covenant Survival Period_ "); _provided_ _that_ with respect to any

performance after the Survival Period, the Survival Period shall continue
through the period of such contemplated performance.

 

11.02 Indemnification.

 

(a) Subject to the provisions of this _Section 11.02_ and _Section 11.03_
below, after the Closing, each Seller shall severally, but not jointly,
indemnify the Buyer and hold it harmless against any actual loss, liability,
damage, cost, interest, award, judgment, penalty or expense (including
reasonable legal fees and expenses, but excluding incidental, consequential
or punitive damages or any liability for lost profits or the like, except to
the extent the same are part of a Third Party Claim) (collectively, " _Losses_
" and individually, a " _Loss_ ") which the Buyer suffers as a result of any
breach of the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of the
Company or such Seller set forth herein and as restated in any certificates
delivered by or on behalf of the Company (or any Subsidiary) or the Sellers
at the Closing, excluding any breach by the Company after the Closing;
_provided_ _that_ such Loss exceeds the limitations set forth below:

 

(i) the Buyer shall not be entitled to seek indemnification with respect to
any individual Loss, unless such Loss is greater than $50,000 (the " _Minimum
Threshold_ ");

 



42 (ii) the Buyer shall not be entitled to seek indemnification with respect to
any Loss resulting from a breach of any General Representation unless such
Loss, together with all other Losses related to a breach of the General
Representations that exceed the Minimum Threshold, collectively exceeds
$2,340,000, in which case the Buyer shall be entitled to indemnification only
for the amount of such excess.

(b) Subject to the provisions of this  _Section 11.02_ and _Section 11.03_
below, after the Closing the Buyer shall indemnify the Sellers and hold them
harmless against any Loss which the Sellers suffer as a result of (i) any
breach by the Buyer of its covenants, representations and warranties set
forth herein and as restated in any certificates delivered by the Buyer at the
Closing or (ii) the operations of the Company (or any Subsidiary) following
the Closing (except to the extent such Loss results from a breach of the
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the Sellers or the
Company at or prior to Closing).

(c) No Person shall be liable for any claim for indemnification under
subsections (a) or (b) above unless written notice specifying in reasonable
detail the nature of the claim for indemnification is delivered by the Person
seeking indemnification to the Person from whom indemnification is sought
prior to the expiration of the applicable Survival Period, in which case the
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement which is the subject of such
claim shall survive, to the extent of such claim only, until such claim is
resolved, whether or not the amount of the Losses resulting from such breach
has been finally determined at the time the notice is given, if, but only if,
(i) in the case of a claim made by reason of a Third Party Claim (as defined
in _Section 11.02(d)_ below), the written notice is accompanied by a copy of
the written notice of the third party claimant or other reasonable summary of
such Third Party Claim and (ii) in the case of any claim made other than by
reason of a Third Party Claim, any Losses shall have been incurred in good
faith at or prior to the date of such notice or a liability with respect to
such claim was required to be recorded in the books of the Company under
GAAP.

(d) Promptly after the assertion by any third party of any claim (a " _Third
Party Claim_ ") against any Person entitled to indemnification under this
_Section 11.02_ (the " _Indemnitee_ " such term to also include more than one
Indemnitee) that results or may result in the incurrence by such Indemnitee of
any Loss for which such Indemnitee would be entitled to indemnification
pursuant to this Agreement, such Indemnitee shall promptly provide notice of
such Third Party Claim to the parties from whom such indemnification could be
sought (the " _Indemnitors_ ");  _provided_ , _that_ failure to promptly
deliver notice of such Third Party Claim shall not affect the Indemnitees
rights hereunder except to the extent the Indemnitor is materially prejudiced
as a result of such failure. Any Indemnitee shall have the right to employ
separate counsel in any such Third Party Claim and to participate in the
defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall not be an
expense of the Indemnitor unless (i) the Indemnitor shall have failed, within
a reasonable time after having been notified by the Indemnitee of the
existence of such Third Party Claim as provided in the preceding sentence, to
assume the defense of such Third Party Claim or (ii) the employment of such
counsel has been specifically authorized by the Indemnitor. In no event will
an Indemnitee consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any
settlement with respect to any Third Party Claim without the prior written
consent of the Indemnitor.

 



43 (e) The amount of any Loss subject to indemnification hereunder or of any
claim therefor shall be calculated net of (i) any Tax Benefit (as defined
below) inuring to the Buyer, the Company, any Subsidiary or any of their
Affiliates on account of such Loss and (ii) any insurance proceeds (net of
direct collection expenses) actually received or receivable with commercially
reasonable efforts by the Buyer or the Company on account of such Loss. If the
Buyer, the Company, any Subsidiary or any of their Affiliates receives a Tax
Benefit after an indemnification payment is made by or on behalf of the
Sellers, the Buyer shall promptly pay to the Seller Representative, on behalf
of the Sellers, the amount of such Tax Benefit at such time or times as and to
the extent that such Tax Benefit is realized. For purposes hereof, " _Tax
Benefit_ " shall mean any refund of Taxes paid or reduction in the amount of
Taxes which otherwise would have been paid, in each case computed at the
highest marginal tax rates. The Buyer and the Company (and any
Subsidiary) shall seek full recovery under all insurance policies covering
any Loss to the same extent as they would if such Loss were not subject to
indemnification hereunder, and the Buyer and the Company (and any Subsidiary)
shall not take any action to terminate or cancel any insurance policies in
effect for periods prior to the Closing. In the event that an insurance
recovery is made by the Buyer, the Company, any Subsidiary or any of their
Affiliates with respect to any Loss for which any such Person has been
indemnified hereunder by the Sellers, then a refund equal to the aggregate
amount of the recovery (net of all direct collection expenses and Taxes) shall
be made promptly to the Seller Representative, on behalf of the Sellers.
The Indemnitors shall be subrogated to all rights of the Indemnitees in
respect of any Losses indemnified by the Indemnitors.

(f) Each Person entitled to indemnification hereunder shall take all
commercially reasonable steps to mitigate all losses, costs, expenses and
damages after becoming aware of any event which could reasonably be expected
to give rise to any losses, costs, expenses and damages that are
indemnifiable or recoverable hereunder or in connection herewith.

(g) All indemnification payments made hereunder shall be treated by all
parties as adjustments to the Actual Purchase Price.

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this _Section
11.02_, there shall be no recovery for any Loss or alleged Loss by the Buyer
under this _Section 11.02_, and the Loss shall not be included in meeting the
stated thresholds hereunder, to the extent such item has been included in the
calculation of the Net Working Capital Amount or the Indebtedness Payoff
Amount as determined pursuant to _Section 2.04_ hereof.

 

(i) For the purposes of determining the amount of a Loss with respect to any
breach of a representation and warranty in ARTICLES 3, 4 and 5 giving rise to
indemnification under _Sections 11.02(a)_ or _11.02(b)(i)_ , all references to
materiality or Material Adverse Effect shall be disregarded.

 

(j) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this _Section
11.02_, with respect to any claim for Losses arising out of a breach of a
representation or warranty due to any Sellers failure to own the Shares as
provided in _Section 3.02_, only such Seller shall be liable with respect to
such Losses.

 



44 11.03 Limitation of Recourse.

 

(a) From and after the Closing Date, except in the case of fraud, the
indemnification provided by _Section 11.02(a)_ shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy for any Losses of the Buyer, the Company or any Subsidiary
with respect to any misrepresentation or inaccuracy in, or breach of, any
representations or warranties or any breach or failure in performance of any
covenants or agreements made by the Company or the Sellers in this Agreement
or in any exhibit or schedules hereto or any certificate delivered hereunder
(including expenses awarded pursuant to _Section 12.09_ hereof).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, recovery from the
Indemnification Escrow Account, to the extent of the Indemnification Escrow
Amount pursuant to the terms of _Section 11.02(a)_ and the Escrow Agreement
constitute the Buyers sole and exclusive source of funds for payment of the
indemnification provided by the Sellers in _Section 11.02(a)_ and for any
other Losses or other claims relating to or arising from this Agreement or in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby or any exhibit, Schedule
or certificate delivered hereunder (including expenses awarded pursuant to
_Section 12.09_ hereof) until the aggregate amount of all recoverable Losses
pursuant to _Section 11.02(a)_ exceeds the Escrow Balance, and the Buyer
shall have no recourse to or remedy against the Sellers for any such
indemnification or any other Loss up to the Escrow Balance. All recoverable
Losses shall be first applied to the Indemnification Escrow Account. In
addition, the aggregate liability for all Sellers for all recoverable Losses
pursuant to _Section 11.02(a)_ shall not exceed $17,550,000, including
amounts recovered from the Indemnification Escrow Account; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the limitations set forth in this _Section 11.03(a)_ shall
not apply to any Loss resulting from the breach of the Special Representations
or the Extended Representations or the Covenants set forth in _Section 8.04_.

 

(b) No Seller shall be liable for (i) aggregate Losses pursuant to this
_ARTICLE 11_ in excess of the amount of the Actual Purchase Price received
by such Seller, or (ii) an amount with respect to any single Loss pursuant to
this _ARTICLE 11_ in excess of such Sellers Pro-Rata Share of such Loss;
_provided_ _,_ _however_ with respect to any Losses attributed to a single
Seller in connection with such Sellers breach of any of its representations
and warranties in ARTICLE 4 or any covenant in ARTICLE 8, such Seller shall be
solely liable for the full amount of such Losses up to the amount of the
Actual Purchase Price received by such Seller to the extent such Losses are
indemnifiable hereunder.

(c) No claim shall be brought or maintained by the Buyer, the Company or any
Subsidiary or their respective successors or permitted assigns against any
officer, director, employee (present or former) or Affiliate of any party
hereto which is not otherwise expressly identified as a party hereto, and no
recourse shall be brought or granted against any of them, by virtue of or
based upon any alleged misrepresentation or inaccuracy in or breach of any of
the representations, warranties or covenants of any party hereto set forth or
contained in this Agreement or any exhibit or schedule hereto or any
certificate delivered hereunder.

 



45 (d) The balance in the Indemnification Escrow Account as of the date that is
fifteen (15) months after the Closing Date (the " _Indemnification Escrow
Termination Date_ ") (less the aggregate portion of the remaining Escrow
Amount claimed by the Buyer pursuant to claims made against such funds in
accordance with this Agreement and not fully resolved prior to such date)
shall be released to the Seller Representative on behalf of the Sellers. At
any time following the Indemnification Escrow Termination Date, to the extent
the available balance in the Indemnification Escrow Account exceeds the
aggregate portion of the Escrow Amount claimed by the Buyer pursuant to claims
made prior to such Indemnification Escrow Termination Date and not fully
resolved prior to the time of determination, such excess shall be promptly
released to the Seller Representative on behalf of the Sellers.

11.04 Seller Representative. Each Seller hereby appoints GarMark Advisors II
L.L.C. as the "Seller Representative" to act as the agent of the Sellers with
the full power (i) to resolve all questions, disputes, conflicts and
controversies concerning Losses as provided in this  _ARTICLE 11_, (ii) to
execute and enter into, on behalf of the Sellers, the Escrow Agreement, and to
take all actions thereunder for and on their behalf, including but not limited
the authorization of payments of amounts held under the Escrow Agreement in
connection with Losses as provided herein and therein, (iii) to negotiate
and/or settle all claims under this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, (iv) to
receive from the Buyer monies payable to the Sellers in accordance with the
provisions of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, (v) to otherwise take
such actions (or refrain from taking actions) and execute such documents on
the Sellers behalf in connection with this Agreement, and the Escrow
Agreement, as the Seller Representative, in its sole discretion, deems proper
and (vi) to perform all of the functions of the Seller Representative under
this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement. The foregoing notwithstanding, the
Seller Representative shall not have the power to negotiate and/or settle any
claims under this Agreement in which a single Seller is liable due to a breach
by such Seller unless the Seller Representative has received the prior written
consent of such Seller to negotiate and/or settle such claim. The Buyer and
the Escrow Agent are entitled to rely on the acts and agreements of the Seller
Representative as the acts and agreements of the Sellers. The Seller
Representative shall be entitled to retain counsel and to incur such
reasonable expenses (including court costs and reasonable attorneys fees and
expenses) as the Seller Representative deems to be reasonably necessary or
appropriate in connection with its performance of its obligations under this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, and all such fees and expenses incurred by
the Seller Representative shall be borne pro rata by the Sellers based upon
their respective initial economic interests in the Escrow Amount. Subject to
and in accordance with the provisions of the Escrow Agreement, the fees and
expenses incurred by the Seller Representative pursuant to this _Section
11.04_ shall be paid by the Sellers directly to the Seller Representative
and shall not be paid from the Escrow Fund.

deemed to be the language chosen by the parties hereto to express their
mutual intent, and no rule of strict construction shall be applied against any
Person. The headings of the sections and paragraphs of this Agreement have
been inserted for convenience of reference only and shall in no way
restrict or otherwise modify any of the terms or provisions hereof. In the
event a subject matter is addressed in more than one representation and
warranty in _ARTICLE 3_, the Buyer shall be entitled to rely only on the most
specific representation and warranty addressing such subject matter. Whenever
possible, each provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner
as to be effective and valid under applicable law or regulation, but if any

Company and the Sellers in connection with the required filing under the HSR
Act of the Notification and Report Form with the United States Department of

or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any
jurisdiction other than the State of New York.

 

12.07 Jurisdiction. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement,
any suit, action or proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or based
on any matter arising out of or in connection with, this Agreement or the

District Court for the Southern District of New York or any New York state
court sitting in New York County, New York, and each of the parties hereby
consents to the jurisdiction of such courts (and of the appropriate appellate
courts therefrom) in any such suit, action or proceeding and irrevocably
waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection which it may
now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such suit, action or
proceeding in any such court or that any such suit, action or proceeding which
is brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient form.
Process in any such suit, action or proceeding may be served on any party
anywhere in the world, whether within or without the jurisdiction of any such
court. Without limiting the foregoing, each party agrees that service
of process on such party as provided in _Section 12.01_ shall be deemed

adjudicator presiding over such litigation, action, arbitration or proceeding
shall award a reimbursement of the fees, costs and expenses incurred by such

12.10 Counterparts; Third Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement may be signed in

otherwise specifically set forth herein, no provision of this Agreement is
intended to confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto any rights or
remedies hereunder.

 

12.11 Entire Agreement. This Agreement and the documents referred to herein
(including the Confidentiality Agreement) contain the complete agreement
between the parties hereto and supersede any other prior understandings,
agreements or representations by or between the parties, written or oral,
