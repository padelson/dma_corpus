"Amendment") is made by and among AGL Resources Inc., a Georgia Corporation
("Buyer"), Consolidated Natural Gas Company, a Delaware
corporation ("Seller"), Virginia Natural Gas, Inc., a Virginia corporation
("VNG") and Dominion Resources, Inc., a Virginia corporation ("DRI").  
RECITALS  --------   A. Buyer, Seller, VNG and CNG are parties to a Stock
Purchase Agreement dated as of May 8, 2000 (the "Agreement").   B. The
parties have previously entered into letter agreements dated June 22, 2000
and August 15, 2000 amending the Stock Purchase Agreement. This Amendment is
intended to supercede all such amendments.   C. The parties hereto wish to
amend certain provisions of the Agreement to provide for an effective date of
the transaction as of October 1, 2000 for accounting and other related
purposes and make other amendments as herein provided.   NOW THEREFORE, the
parties hereby agree as follows:  A. AMENDMENTS  ----------   1. Article
I of the Agreement is amended by inserting the following definition:  
"Effective Date" means October 1, 2000  --------------  and deleting the
definition of "Claim" in its entirety.  -----   2. Section 2.1.2 of the
Agreement is amended to read in its entirety as follows:   2.1.2 Purchase
Price. The consideration to be paid for the VNG  --------------  Stock (the
"Purchase Price") shall be $ 550,000,000 plus the amount  by which the book
value of the Working Capital of VNG on the  Effective Date exceeds
$21,888,000, or minus the amount by which the  book value of such Working
Capital is less than $21,888,000. The  term "Working Capital" as used herein
shall mean current assets less  current liabilities determined in accordance
with U.S. GAAP;  provided, however, that for the purposes of this definition,
current  liabilities as of any date shall not include any payables to any 
Affiliates of VNG including amounts borrowed as of such date by VNG  from the
"System Money Pool" described in Note 13 to the 1999  audited VNG financial
statements, and current assets shall not  include receivables from any
Affiliates of VNG.    The computation of Working Capital as of December 31,
1999 is set  forth on Schedule 2.1.2. At the Closing, Buyer will pay Seller
an  amount (the "Estimated Purchase Price") determined by Seller\'s 
Auditors on the basis hereinabove set forth using the unaudited  balance
sheet of VNG for the end of August, 2000, subject to such  adjustments to
reflect known variances in Working Capital as may be  mutually agreeable to
the parties. The Estimated Purchase Price  shall be paid by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an  account designated by Seller.   3.
Section 2.1.3(a) is amended by deleting the reference to "Closing Date" and
inserting in its place, "Effective Date".   4. The first two sentences of
Section 2.1.4 are amended to read in their entirety as follows:   In the
event that a Section 338(h)(10) Election is made pursuant to  Section 5.4.8,
Buyer and Seller agree that the Purchase Price and  the liabilities of VNG
(plus other relevant items) as of the  Effective Date will be allocated to
the assets of VNG as of the  Effective Date for federal income tax purposes
in accordance with  the Final Allocation. Buyer shall deliver to Seller at
Closing a  preliminary allocation of the Purchase Price and liabilities
(plus  other relevant items) as of the Effective Date among the assets of 
VNG as of the Effective Date, and, as soon as possible following the  Closing
(but in any event within 90 days following the completion of  the adjustments
to the Purchase Price contemplated by Section  2.1.3), Buyer shall prepare
and deliver to Seller a final allocation  of the Purchase Price and
liabilities (plus other relevant items),  reflecting all adjustments to the
Purchase Price contemplated by  Section 2.1.3, among the assets of VNG (the
"Allocation").   5. Section 3.9 is amended to read it its entirety as
follows:   Section 3.9 Material Contracts. The Contracts listed in Schedule
3.9  ------------------ ------------  include all of the Material Contracts;
provided, however, that no  Contract shall be deemed a Material Contract
solely by reason of the  fact that it is listed on Schedule 3.9. Seller has
provided to Buyer  ------------  true, correct and complete copies of all
contracts listed on  Schedule 3.9. Except as otherwise set forth in Schedule
3.9, (i)  ------------ ------------  each Material Contract is valid,
binding and in full force and  effect, and is enforceable by VNG in
accordance with its terms,  except as enforceability may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency,  reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws now
or hereinafter  in effect relating to creditors\' rights generally, and
general  equitable principles (whether considered in a proceeding in equity 
or at law), (ii) VNG has performed the material obligations required  to be
performed by it to date under each Material Contract, and  (iii) to the
Knowledge of Seller, there has not occurred any  material default by any  
2    other party under any Material Contract nor any event that with or 
without the giving of notice or lapse or time, or both, would  constitute a
material default under any Material Contract. For the  purposes of the
immediately preceding sentence but not for any other  purposes hereunder,
"Material Contract" shall be deemed to include  each of the transition
services agreement and the software license  agreement executed by Seller and
VNG as contemplated by Sections  5.11.1 and 5.11.2 hereof.   6. Section 5.4
is amended by deleting all references to "Closing Date" or "Closing" and
inserting in their place the following: "Effective Date".   7. Section 5.7.2
is amended to read in its entirety as follows:   5.7.2 From the Closing Date
through January 28, 2006, Buyer shall  cause to be maintained in effect a
policy of officers\' and  directors\' liability insurance with respect to the
officers and  directors of VNG with an aggregate policy limit of $100 million
and,  except for the aggregate policy limit, containing terms and 
conditions that are not materially less advantageous than the policy 
maintained on behalf of VNG immediately prior to Closing (the "Buyer  DandO;
Policy"). The Buyer DandO; Policy shall cover claims arising from  facts or
events that occurred after January 28, 2000 and prior to  Closing. Prior to
January 28, 2006, Seller shall not in bad faith  terminate the directors\'
and officers\' coverage maintained by Seller  in effect for VNG as of the
Closing.   8. Section 5.8 of the Agreement is amended to read in its
entirety as follows:   Section 5.8 Employee Matters.  ----------------  
5.8.1 Certain Employees.  -----------------   (a) Related Company
Employees. Schedule 5.8.1 lists those  -------------------------
--------------  employees (including employees who are absent from work on
account of  vacation, disability, layoff, leave of absence or for any other 
reason on the Effective Date) of one or more Affiliates of VNG  (including
Seller) whom Seller deems to be principally associated  with the assets or
operations of VNG. At least 30 days prior to  Closing, Buyer shall notify
Seller of those employees listed on  Schedule 5.8.1 to whom Buyer elects to
offer employment with VNG. If  --------------  Buyer fails to so notify
Seller, Buyer shall be deemed to have  elected not to offer employment to any
employee listed on Schedule  --------  5.8.1. Neither VNG nor Buyer shall be
liable for the benefits or  -----  payments described in Section 3.13.7 with
respect to such individuals  listed in Schedule 5.8.1. Those employees to
whom Buyer notifies  --------------  Seller that it elects to offer
employment are referred to as the  "Related Company Employees." Buyer agrees
to offer employment,  --------------------------  effective as of the
Effective Date, to the Related Company Employees  at salaries that are  
3    initially equal to those salaries in effect for such Related Company 
Employees immediately prior to the Effective Date. Neither Buyer nor  VNG
shall have any liability for employee benefits or severance,  change in
control, retention or other payments due to any individual  listed on
Schedule 5.8.1 who does not become a Related Company  -------------- 
Employee.   (b) Union Employees. VNG shall recognize the Local 50 of 
---------------  the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers as the
bargaining  representative for VNG Employees currently represented,
acknowledging  the continuation of the applicable Collective Bargaining
Agreement  through its term and the continuation of the employment of all
union  employees as of the Effective Date.   5.8.2 Employee Benefits. Buyer
agrees to provide non-union VNG  -----------------  Employees from the
Effective Date until the later of December 31, 2001 or  one year from the
Effective Date, benefits that are substantially  comparable in the aggregate
to the benefits available to non-union VNG  Employees. For purposes of this
Section 5.8.2, "benefits" shall mean any  broad-based Employee Plans as of
May 8, 2000 (excluding non-qualified or  deferred compensation plans as well
as the employee stock ownership plan)  that are governed by ERISA other than
any benefits conferred by or promised  under an agreement with an individual.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer  agrees to provide non-union VNG
Employees who have retired prior to the  Effective Date, benefits that are
equivalent to those benefits that would  have been available to those
employees had they remained covered under the  System Retiree Medical
Insurance Plan of Consolidated Natural Gas and its  Participating
Subsidiaries for Employees Who Are Not Represented by a  Recognized Union
(the "CNG Retiree Medical Plan") (or under a successor  plan) for a period of
5 years from the Effective Date; provided, to the  extent the benefits under
the CNG Retiree Medical Plan or its successor  plan are reduced, Buyer\'s
plan may similarly be reduced, but Buyer is not  required to increase
benefits above the level available under the CNG  Retiree Medical Plan as in
effect on May 8, 2000. Unless the existing  coverages are continued pursuant
to the Transition Services Agreement, as  of the Effective Date, Buyer shall,
and shall cause VNG to (i) waive all  pre-existing conditions, exclusions,
actively-at-work provisions, waiting  periods and any other similar
conditions or requirements with respect to  participation and coverage of
non-union VNG Employees and their covered  dependents under any group health
plan in which VNG Employees may be  eligible to participate after the
Effective Date; (ii) provide each non-  union VNG Employee with credit for
payments made by such non-union VNG  Employee or his covered dependents prior
to the Effective Date for purposes  of satisfying any applicable deductible,
coinsurance or out-of-pocket  requirements under any health insurance plan in
which non-union   4    VNG Employees or covered dependents may be
eligible to participate after  the Effective Date; and (iii) provide credit
to non-union VNG Employees for  purposes of determining eligibility to
participate, vesting and benefit  accrual under any employee benefit plan,
program or arrangement in which  non-union VNG Employees may be eligible to
participate after the Effective  Date, for service prior to the Effective
Date with VNG, its Affiliates and  predecessors (but only to the extent
recognized by VNG and its Affiliates  for such purposes immediately preceding
the Effective Date); provided, that  --------  the foregoing shall not apply
to the extent it would result in duplication  of benefits. As of the
Effective Date, VNG shall cease to be a  participating employer in any and
all Employee Plans, except the Employee  Plans that are solely sponsored by
VNG prior to the Effective Date.   5.8.3 Section 401(k) Plan. 
-------------------   (i) As soon as practicable following the Closing,
Buyer shall  establish a defined contribution plan and trust (or amend an
existing  defined contribution plan) for non-union VNG Employees, which shall
be  qualified under Sections 401 and 501 of the Internal Revenue Code and 
which shall provide for salary reduction contributions pursuant to  Section
401(k) of the Code ("Buyer\'s 401(k) Plan").   (ii) Buyer\'s 401(k) Plan
shall provide that each non-union VNG  Employee be given credit for the VNG
Employee\'s service with VNG, its  Affiliates and its predecessor companies
for purposes of determining  the non-union VNG Employee\'s eligibility to
participate, eligibility  for benefits and vesting under Buyer\'s 401(k)
Plan. Buyer shall  ensure that all "section 411(d)(6) protected benefits" (as
defined in  Treasury Regulation 1.411(d) (4)) provided by the System Thrift
Plan  of Consolidated Natural Gas Company and Its Participating
Subsidiaries  for Employees Who Are Not Represented By A Recognized Union
(the  "Seller\'s 401(k) Plan") are preserved in Buyer\'s 401(k) Plan. VNG 
Employees will not accrue additional benefits after the Effective Date  under
defined contribution plans maintained by Seller or any of its 
Affiliates.   (iii) VNG shall cease to participate in Seller\'s 401(k) Plan
as  of the Effective Date. Assets of Seller\'s 401(k) Plan equal to the 
account balances of non-union VNG Employees under Seller\'s 401(k) Plan 
(whether or not vested) will be transferred to Buyer\'s 401(k) Plan as  soon
as practicable after the Closing. Any outstanding plan loans to  non-union
VNG Employees shall be transferred with the underlying  accounts. Assets
shall be transferred in cash unless otherwise  determined by the Buyer.  
(iv) The account balances of non-union VNG Employees in Seller\'s  401(k)
Plan will be valued as of the date on which the transfer is  made. The
account balances of VNG Employees in Seller\'s 401(k) Plan  shall share in
the earnings, appreciation and depreciation of Seller\'s  401(k) Plan for the
period between the Closing and the date on which  the transfer is made. Any
benefits that are payable to non-union VNG  Employees from Seller\'s 401(k)
Plan after the Closing and before the  assets are   5    transferred
shall be paid from Seller\'s 401(k) Plan in the ordinary  course. The amount
to be transferred to Buyer\'s 401(k) Plan shall be  reduced by the amount of
such payments. The account balances to be  credited for non-union VNG
Employees under Buyer\'s 401(k) Plan shall  not be less than the account
balances of non-union VNG Employees under  Seller\'s 401(k) Plan as of the
date on which the transfer is made.   (v) Effective on the date of the
transfer of Seller\'s 401(k) Plan  assets, (i) Buyer and Buyer\'s 401(k) Plan
shall assume all liabilities  in connection with the account balances of non-
union VNG Employees  under Seller\'s 401(k) Plan, and (ii) Seller, its
Affiliates and  Seller\'s 401(k) Plan shall have no further liability with
respect to  the account balances of non-union VNG Employees. Seller and its 
Affiliates shall have no liability with respect to Buyer\'s 401(k)  Plan.  
(vi) Buyer shall request that the Internal Revenue Service issue  a favorable
determination letter with respect to the qualification  under Sections 401
and 501 of the Internal Revenue Code of Buyer\'s  401(k) Plan and its related
trust. Buyer shall make such changes to  Buyer\'s 401(k) Plan as may be
required by the Internal Revenue Service  in order for the Internal Revenue
Service to issue a favorable  determination letter. Buyer shall provide
Seller with a copy of the  determination letter received from the Internal
Revenue Service with  respect to Buyer\'s 401(k) Plan as soon as the
determination letter is  received.   5.8.4 Employee Plans. The Employee
Plans for which VNG shall have  --------------  responsibility as of the
Effective Date are set forth on Schedule 5.8.4.  --------------   5.8.5
Retirement Plan Transfer.  ------------------------   (i) As soon as
practicable after the Closing, Buyer shall  establish a defined benefit
pension plan and trust (or amend an  existing defined benefit plan) for the
non-union VNG Employees,  which shall be qualified under Sections 401 and 501
of the  Internal Revenue Code ("Buyer\'s Retirement Plan").   (ii) Buyer\'s
Retirement Plan shall provide that each non-  union VNG Employee be given
credit for the VNG Employee\'s service  with VNG, its Affiliates and its
predecessor companies, for  purpose of determining the VNG Employee\'s
eligibility to  participate, eligibility for benefits, vesting and accrual
of  benefits. VNG Employees will not accrue additional benefits  after the
Effective Date under pension plans maintained by Seller  or any of its
Affiliates.   6    (iii) VNG shall cease to participate in the System
Pension  Plan of Consolidated Natural Gas Company and Its Participating 
Subsidiaries for Employees Who Are Not Represented By A  Recognized Union
(the "Seller\'s Retirement Plan") as of the  Effective Date. Assets of the
Seller\'s Retirement Plan equal to  the accrued benefit values (as described
below) of the non-union  VNG Employees will be transferred to Buyer\'s
Retirement Plan as  soon as practicable after the accrued benefit values have
been  determined pursuant to this Section 5.8.5. Buyer shall ensure  that
all "section 411(d)(6) protected benefits" (as defined in  Treasury
Regulation 1.411(d)-4) provided by the Seller\'s  Retirement Plan are
preserved with respect to transferred  benefits in Buyer\'s Retirement Plan.
The term "accrued benefit  values" means the present value of the accrued
benefits of VNG  Employees as of the Effective Date under the Seller\'s
Retirement  Plan, computed as if Seller\'s Retirement Plan had terminated
on  the Effective Date and based on benefits accrued before the  Effective
Date. Accrued benefit values shall be calculated as if  all affected
participants ceased accruing any additional benefits  under Seller\'s
Retirement Plan immediately prior to the Effective  Date, and for purposes of
calculating accrued benefit values, the  1983 Group Annuity Mortality Table
and the then applicable PBGC  interest rates (including the immediate and
deferred rates) shall  be used to value benefits upon plan termination, and
otherwise  actuarial assumptions stated in the last plan actuarial
valuation  shall be used.   (iv) The calculations referred to in Section
5.8.5(iii) will  be made by Seller\'s actuary as soon as practicable
following the  Closing (but not later than 120 days), subject to review by 
Buyer\'s actuary within 60 days following receipt from Seller\'s  actuary of
a copy of its valuation together with all other  information reasonably
necessary for Buyer\'s actuary to complete  its review. In the event of
significant, reasonable comment from  Buyer\'s actuary (other than a comment
relating to the assumptions  described in 5.8.5(ii)) that cannot be resolved
between the  Buyer\'s Actuary and Seller\'s Actuary within ten Business
Days,  the question or questions in dispute shall then be promptly 
submitted to any independent actuary of recognized standing to be  selected
by agreement of Seller and Buyer and whose evaluations  shall be binding and
final. The fees of any such independent  actuary shall be borne equally by
Seller and Buyer. The assets  shall be transferred in cash.   (v) Seller
will adjust the amount to be transferred from the  Seller\'s Retirement Plan
to Buyer\'s Retirement Plan, as  calculated pursuant to Section 5.8.5(iii),
by a pro rata share of  --- ----  the Seller Retirement Plan earnings,
appreciation and  depreciation for the   7    period between the Closing
and the date on which the assets are  actually transferred.   (vi) Any
benefits that are payable to non-union VNG  Employees from the Seller\'s
Retirement Plan after the Closing and  before the plan assets are transferred
shall be paid from the  Seller\'s Retirement Plan in the ordinary course to
the extent  permitted by law. The amount to be transferred to Buyer\'s 
Retirement Plan shall be reduced by the payments made.   (vii) The accrued
benefits to be credited under Buyer\'s  Retirement Plan with respect to the
non-union VNG Employees shall  not be less than the accrued benefits of the
non-union VNG  Employees under the Seller\'s Retirement Plan as of the
Effective  Date. Buyer shall ensure that Buyer\'s Retirement Plan provides 
non-union VNG Employees with the benefits accrued prior to the  Effective
Date under the Seller\'s Retirement Plan in accordance  with the terms of the
Seller\'s Retirement Plan and applicable  law. Effective on the date of
transfer of the Seller\'s  Retirement Plan assets, (i) Buyer and Buyer\'s
Retirement Plan  shall assume all liabilities in connection with the
accrued  benefits of non-union VNG Employees under the Seller\'s Retirement 
Plan, and (ii) Seller, its Affiliates and the Seller\'s Retirement  Plan
shall have no further liability with respect to the accrued  benefits of non-
union VNG Employees. Seller and its Affiliates  shall have no liability
whatsoever with respect to Buyer\'s  Retirement Plan.   (viii) The parties
agree that the transfers described in  this Section 5.8.5 shall be made in
accordance with Section  414(l) of the Internal Revenue Code. Buyer and
Seller shall make  any appropriate filings required under the Internal
Revenue Code  or ERISA in connection with the transfers described in this 
Section 5.8.5 as soon as practicable after the Closing. Seller  shall be
responsible for delivery to VNG Employees of any notice  required under Code
Section 204(h) in connection with the  transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.   (ix) Buyer will request that the Internal Revenue Service 
issue a favorable determination letter with respect to the  qualification
under Sections 401 and 501 of the Internal Revenue  Code of Buyer\'s
Retirement Plan (and the related trust). Buyer  will file with the Internal
Revenue Service application for a  determination letter for Buyer\'s
Retirement Plan. Buyer will  make such changes to the plan as may be required
by the Internal  Revenue Service in order for the Internal Revenue Service
to  issue a favorable determination letter. Buyer will provide  Seller with
a   8    copy of the determination letter received from the Internal 
Revenue Service with respect to Buyer\'s Retirement Plan within a  reasonable
time after the determination letter is received.   (x) Seller will request
that the Internal Revenue Service  issue a favorable determination letter
with respect to the  qualification under Sections 401 and 501 of the Internal
Revenue  Code of the Seller\'s Retirement Plan (and the related trust). If 
necessary, Seller will file with the Internal Revenue Service an  application
for determination letter for the Seller\'s Retirement  Plan. Seller will make
such changes to the plan as may be  required by the Internal Revenue Service
in order for the  Internal Revenue Service to issue a favorable
determination  letter. Seller will provide Buyer with a copy of the
favorable  determination letter received from the Internal Revenue Service 
with respect to the Seller\'s Retirement Plan within a reasonable  time after
the determination letter is received.   5.8.6 VNG Retirement Plan Funding.
As soon as practicable following  ---------------------------  the Closing,
Seller shall cause the VNG Retirement Plan to be fully funded  based on
calculations as of the Effective Date, so that any such plan will  have
assets equal to the "accrued benefit values" of the VNG Employees  under such
plan. For this purpose, the term "accrued benefit values" means  the present
value of the accrued benefits of VNG Employees as of the  Effective Date
under the plan, computed as if the plan had terminated on  the Effective Date
and based on benefits accrued before the Effective Date.  Accrued benefit
values shall be calculated as if all affected participants  ceased accruing
any additional benefits under the plan immediately prior to  the Effective
Date and for purposes of calculating accrued benefit values,  the 1983 Group
Annuity Mortality Table and then applicable PBGC interest  rates (including
the immediate and deferred rates) shall be used to value  annuities upon plan
termination, and otherwise actuarial assumptions stated  in the last plan
actuarial valuation shall be used. All transfers of  assets or additional
funding of plans shall be made in cash.   5.8.7 Transfer from CNG VEBA. VNG
shall cease to participate in the  ----------------------  Consolidated
Natural Gas Voluntary Employees Beneficiary Association (the  "Seller\'s
VEBA") as of the Effective Date. As soon as practicable after  Closing, the
assets and liabilities of or associated with the VNG Non-  Union/Management
subaccount of the CNG VEBA shall be transferred to Buyer\'s  VEBA. The assets
shall be transferred in cash.   5.8.8 COBRA. Buyer shall be responsible for
providing group health  -----  coverage under the Consolidated Omnibus
Budget Reconciliation Act ("COBRA")  for each non-union VNG Employee and each
qualified beneficiary with respect  to a non-union VNG Employee who is
entitled to COBRA coverage under an  Employee Plan of Seller as a result of a
"qualifying event" (as defined   9    under COBRA) that occurs on or
after the Effective Date. Pursuant to the  Buyer\'s assumption of the group
health plan maintained by VNG for union  employees, Buyer shall retain
liability for COBRA coverage for each union  VNG employee and each qualified
beneficiary with respect to a union VNG  Employee that experienced a
"qualifying event" prior to, on or after the  Effective Date.   5.8.9
Flexible Spending Accounts. The parties have agreed to 
--------------------------  continue existing flexible spending accounts
through December 31, 2000.   5.8.10 Administration. Buyer and Seller shall
each make their  --------------  appropriate employees available to the
other at such reasonable times as  may be necessary for the proper
administration by the other of any and all  matters relating to employee
benefits affecting VNG Employees.   5.8.11 Non-solicitation of Employees.
Seller covenants that it will  -----------------------------  refrain, and
will use its best efforts to cause Affiliates of Seller to  refrain, from
soliciting any of the existing employees of VNG or the  employees listed on
Schedule 5.8.1 for employment with Seller or its  --------------  Affiliates
from the date of this Agreement through the period ending  twenty-four (24)
months after the Closing Date; provided, however, that  Seller may solicit
employees terminated by VNG and Schedule 5.8.1  --------------  Associated
Seller Employees who do not become Related Company Employees..   9. Section
5.10 of the Agreement is amended to read in its entirety as follows:  
Section 5.10 Satisfaction of Debt. At or immediately prior to 
--------------------  Closing, Seller shall take, or cause VNG to take, such
actions as are  necessary to (i) extinguish all intercompany debt obligations
between  VNG, as borrower, and any of Seller or its Affiliates, as lender, 
other than those listed on Schedule 5.10 attached hereto (ii)  terminate as
to VNG the Supplemental Agreement, and (iii) extinguish  all intercompany
payables and receivables between VNG and any of  Seller or its Affiliates,
other than those listed on Schedule 5.10  attached hereto. Intercompany debt,
payables and receivables listed on  Schedule 5.10 hereto shall be paid by the
party owing such debt or  payable as promptly as possible after Closing but
in any event not  later than the date on which the payments are due under
Section 2.1.3.   10. Schedule 3.7 to the Agreement is amended to read in its
entirety as follows:   1. In Case No. PUE970617, Annual Informational
Filing Based on the  12 months ended June 30, 1998, the Staff of the State
Corporation  Commission entered a report that placed VNG\'s return on
equity  (ROE) above the minimum ROE authorized by the Commission. 
Consequently, the Staff recommended a write-down of the  unamortized balance
of VNG\'s regulatory asset consisting of  approximately $1.4 million of
deferred OPEB expenses that   10    previously were not recovered through
rates. The Commission  conducted a hearing during 1999 and on August 8, 2000
issued a  Final Order wherein the Commission adopted the findings and 
recommendations of the July 13, 2000 Report of the Chief Hearing  Examiner,
and ruled that VNG\'s regulatory asset for OPEB  implementation costs was not
fully recovered during the test  period for the twelve months ended June 30,
1998. Following this  ruling, VNG caused accounting entries to be made
consistent  therewith, reestablishing the unamortized balance of the 
regulatory asset on its books of approximately $1.4 million.   2. Franchises
for the use of the streets, alleys or public grounds  have expired in the
following localities:   Virginia Beach (pre-1963 city limits)  Hampton 
Williamsburg  Suffolk    11. Schedule 3.16 to the Agreement is amended to
read in its entirety as attached hereto.   12. Schedule 3.19 to the
Agreement is amended to add under the heading "CNG Proprietary Software
(owned by Seller and licensed to VNG - no payment obligations)," below "EDI
Software," the following:   SAMS Software  Customizations developed by CNG
for use with PeopleSoft HRMS software (as  more specifically identified in
Exhibit 5.11.2.)   13. Exhibit 5.11.2 to the Agreement is amended as
reflected in the blackline attached hereto.  B. WAIVERS AND CONSENTS 
--------------------   1. CNG and AGL have determined that a HSR Act filing
is not necessary for this transaction because the sale of VNG is being made
pursuant to the terms of a FTC divestiture order. FTC Rule 16 C.F.R. Section
802.70 provides that a filing is not required where the voting securities are
to be acquired from an entity that is subject to a divestiture order.
Therefore, the parties hereby waive the obligations and closing conditions
relating to the HSR Act in Sections 5.2.1, 6.4 and 7.4 of the Agreement.  
2. The parties hereby waive the closing conditions relating to
the registration by Buyer under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of
1935, as amended, in Sections 6.4 and 7.4 of the Agreement.   11    3.
The parties hereby ratify the June 22, 2000 letter agreement by which Seller
and Buyer agreed to extend the deadline to June 30, 2000 for submitting to
the appropriate agency/ies or third party/ies all declarations, filings
and registrations listed on Schedule 3.10 and 4.4.   4. Pursuant to Section
8.1 of the Agreement, the parties hereby agree that the Closing shall take
place on October 6, 2000 and waive any requirement for the Closing to take
place on any other date under the Agreement.   5. AGL hereby consents to and
ratifies the following actions taken by VNG between May 8, 2000 and the
Closing Date:   (i) VNG included the Related Company Employees in its
performance  based incentive program for the first nine months of 2000 and 
accrued approximately $38,000 therefor;  (ii) the execution of the transition
services agreement between VNG  and Seller as contemplated in Section 5.11.1
