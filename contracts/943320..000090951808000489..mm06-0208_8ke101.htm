Seller, its Affiliates, or any removing party to replace any item so removed,
_provided_ , _however_ , that Seller shall not be required to remove
consumable goods and other inventory items to the extent it chooses to leave
such goods and items on the Property. Seller hereby reserves  unto itself and
its Affiliates and the owners of the Excluded Assets, and their respective
Representatives, a right of entry into the Property at reasonable times after
the Closing Date and within such thirty (30) day period to effect such
removal; _provided_ , _however_ , that any such removal of Excluded Assets

Transitional Services Agreement. In the event any Excluded Assets are removed
within the thirty (30) day period after the Closing Date, Seller shall provide

discretion, to be present during such removal of the Excluded Assets. Seller
recognizes that Buyer will be replacing some or all of the Excluded Software

interfere with Seller's operations at the Property before the Closing Date;
_provided_ ,  _further_ , that the cost of any replacement software shall be
borne by Buyer; _provided_ , _further_ , that any and all information received
by Buyer through such

  



  

       



     |

---|--- 
   

       

cooperation shall be subject to the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement and

Section 1.6

     |  

_Assignability and Consents_

    
---|---|--- 
   

  

(a) Nothing in this Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be construed as an attempt or agreement to assign
any Purchased Asset, including any Contract, Seller Permit, certificate,
approval, authorization or other right, which by its terms or by Law is non-
assignable without the consent of a third party  (including any Governmental
Entity) or is cancelable by a third party in the event of an assignment (a "
_Non-Assignable Asset_ ") unless and until consent from such third party shall
have been obtained. With respect to Material Assumed Contracts, Seller shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with Buyer at its request
for up to nine (9) months following the Closing Date in endeavoring to obtain
such  consents; _provided_ , _however_ , that such efforts shall not require
Seller or any of its Affiliates to incur any expenses or Liabilities (other
than incidental legal fees), provide any financial accommodation, or remain
secondarily or contingently liable for any Assumed Liability to obtain any
such consent. Subject to the foregoing, Buyer and Seller shall use their
respective  commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, or cause to be
obtained, any consent, substitution, approval or amendment required to novate
all Liabilities under any and all Assumed Contracts or other Liabilities that
constitute Assumed Liabilities, or to obtain in writing the unconditional
release of Seller and its Affiliates, so that, in any such case, Buyer shall
be solely responsible for such Liabilities; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that
such efforts shall not require Buyer or any of its Affiliates to incur any
expenses or Liabilities (other than Assumed Liabilities and incidental legal
fees), accept changes to the material terms of any Material Assumed Contracts
or provide any financial accommodation to obtain any such consent (in each
case, unless Buyer consents thereto, such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed, provided, that  for the avoidance of doubt,
it shall not be deemed unreasonable for Buyer to withhold, condition or delay
its consent to changes to the material terms of a Material Assumed Contract or
provide financial accommodation in order to obtain consent). To the extent
permitted by applicable Law and the terms of the Non-Assignable Assets, in the
event that consents to the assignment thereof cannot be obtained, such Non-
Assignable Assets shall be held, as of and from the Closing Date, by  Seller
(or the applicable Affiliate of Seller) in trust for Buyer and the covenants
and obligations thereunder shall be performed by Buyer at its expense and in
Seller's name and all benefits and obligations existing

  



  

       



     |  

6

    
---|--- 
   

       

thereunder shall be for Buyer's account (and Seller shall promptly pay over to
Buyer all money received by it under such Non-Assignable Assets in respect of
periods after the Closing Date); _provided_ , that Seller may, after providing
prior written notice to Buyer with reasonable detail, withhold any performance
under a Non-Assignable Asset that may  otherwise be reasonably requested by
Buyer until Buyer shall have provided Seller with all funds and other
resources necessary for such performance. As of and from the Closing Date,
Seller authorizes Buyer, to the extent permitted by applicable Law and the
terms of the Non-Assignable Assets, at Buyer's expense, to perform all the
obligations and receive all the benefits of Seller under the Non-Assignable
Assets. Buyer agrees to indemnify and hold Seller and its Affiliates, 
agents, successors and assigns harmless from and against any and all
Liabilities and Damages based upon, arising out of or relating to Buyer's
performance of, or failure to perform obligations under the Non-Assignable
Assets.

  

(b) Subject to _Section 1.5_ hereof, Buyer understands and agrees that
it is solely Buyer's responsibility to obtain any and all Operating Agreements
necessary to operate and support the business located at the Property from and
after the Closing Date, including any replacement software  license
agreements for the software which would replace the Excluded Software. Subject
to the terms and conditions hereof, Buyer shall be responsible for obtaining
new licenses and permits for the operation of the Property. Except as set
forth in _Sections 1.1(d)_ , _(h)_ and _(i)_ hereof, no licenses or permits
will be transferred by  Seller in connection with the sale of the Property.
Buyer understands and agrees that the assignment of certain Contracts as
contemplated hereunder may require the delivery by Buyer of certain deposits
to the third parties that are party to such Contracts and that Buyer shall be
responsible for the timely delivery of such deposits in accordance with
requirements of such Contracts with such third parties.

_Purchase Price_

    
---|---|--- 
   

  

Upon the terms, and subject to the satisfaction or, if permissible, waiver of
the conditions of this Agreement, in consideration for Contract Transactions,

transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by Seller (A)
an amount in cash equal to $316,000,000 (the  " _Base Purchase Price_ "),

_Sections 2.4_ and _2.5_ hereof, MINUS (C) the EBITDA Adjustment, if any, as
provided for in _Sections 2.6_ and _2.7_ , MINUS  (D) the CapEx Purchase
Price Adjustment, if any, as provided for in _Section 7.4_ , (collectively,
the " _Purchase Price_ "). At Closing, in lieu of the final full Working
Capital Adjustment and EBITDA Adjustment, the amount of the Purchase Price to
be delivered or caused to be delivered by Buyer at such time shall be
calculated using (i) the Initial Working Capital Adjustment  as determined in
accordance with _Section 2.4_ hereof, with subsequent final adjustment as
provided for in _Section 2.5(c)_ hereof and (ii) the Initial EBITDA Adjustment
as determined in accordance with _Section 2.6_ hereof, with subsequent final
adjustment as provided for in _Section  2.7(c)_. For the avoidance of doubt,
in calculating the Purchase Price, if the Working Capital Adjustment or
Initial Working Capital Adjustment, as applicable, shall (i) be a positive
number then the amount thereof shall be added to the Base Purchase Price or
(ii) be a negative number then the amount thereof shall be subtracted from the
Base Purchase Price.

the interest accrued thereon, the " _Deposit_ ") with Fidelity National Title
Insurance Company, (the  " _Escrow Agent_ ") pursuant to the escrow agreement
executed and delivered by Seller, Buyer and the Escrow Agent as of the date
hereof, which is annexed hereto as _Exhibit A_ (the " _Deposit Escrow
Agreement_ ").

  

(b) In the event of any inconsistency between the terms and provisions
of the Deposit Escrow Agreement and the terms and provisions of this
Agreement, the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall control, absent an
express written agreement between the parties hereto to the contrary which
acknowledges this _Section  2.2(b)_.

Section 2.4

     |  

_Initial Working Capital Adjustment_

    
---|---|--- 
   

  

At least five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall
deliver to Buyer a statement of Working Capital of the business conducted at
the Property substantially in the form of the Detailed Balance Sheet (the "
_Pre-Closing Working Capital Statement_ "), which shall be calculated in
accordance with the working  capital calculation example set forth on
_Section 2.4_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter. The Pre-Closing Working Capital
Statement shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP and on a basis consistent
with the accounting policies, practices, procedures and principles used in
preparing the Detailed Balance Sheet. The Pre-Closing Working Capital
Statement will contain a good faith estimate, set forth in reasonable detail,
of the amount of  Working Capital of the business conducted at the Property
as of the Closing Date (the " _Pre-Closing Working Capital_ "). Seller and
Buyer each shall bear its own expenses in the preparation and review of the
Pre-Closing Working Capital Statement. The " _Initial Working Capital
Adjustment_ " (which may be a positive or negative number) shall equal (i) if
the  Pre-Closing Working Capital is greater than the Working Capital
Benchmark, the positive number that is the amount of such excess (which shall
be added to the Base Purchase Price pursuant to _Section 2.1_ ), and (ii) if
the Pre-Closing Working Capital is less than the Working Capital Benchmark,
the negative number that is the amount of such difference (which shall be
subtracted from the Base Purchase Price pursuant to  _Section 2.1_ ). On or
about the Closing Date, Seller shall conduct a cash count and a drop of

_Final Working Capital Adjustment_

    
---|---|--- 
   

  

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable following the Closing Date, but in
no event more than sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall cause
to be prepared and delivered to Seller a statement of Working Capital of the
business conducted at the Property substantially in the form of the Pre-
Closing Working Capital Statement and the  Detailed Balance Sheet (the "
_Working Capital Statement_ "). The Working Capital Statement shall be
prepared in accordance with GAAP and on a basis consistent with the accounting
policies, practices, procedures and

  



  

       



     |

---|--- 
   

  

   
   

principles used in preparing the Detailed Balance Sheet, and shall be
calculated in accordance with the working capital calculation example set
forth on _Section 2.4_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter. The Working Capital
Statement will set forth, in reasonable detail, the amount of Working Capital
of the business conducted at the Property as of the Closing Date (the "
_Closing Date Working  Capital_ "). Notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, Buyer shall provide reasonable advance notice to
Seller of any cash counts and physical inventories that will be taken for
preparation of the Working Capital Statement and, subject to applicable Gaming
Laws, if any, a Representative of Seller may be present to observe such cash
counts and physical inventories if Seller so elects. Seller and Buyer each
shall bear its own  expenses in the preparation and review of the Working
Capital Statement. Subject to applicable Law, Seller will use commercially
reasonable efforts to cooperate with Buyer in connection with the preparation
of the Working Capital Statement and the calculation of Closing Date Working
Capital, and will provide Buyer with reasonable access to any of Seller's
records not otherwise available to Buyer as a result of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, to the extent  reasonably related to the
preparation of the Working Capital Statement and the calculation of Closing
Date Working Capital.

  

(b) Notwithstanding any provision in this _Article II_ to the contrary,
in preparing the Working Capital Statement, the following provisions shall be
observed.

  

(i) As of the Closing, all real and personal property Taxes and similar
ad valorem obligations related to the Purchased Assets for Tax periods
beginning before and ending after the Closing Date shall be prorated
separately on a per diem basis as of the Closing Date using the latest
available rates and assessments, and  Seller shall be responsible for
Seller's proportionate share of its property Taxes and similar ad valorem
obligations (which shall be determined on a per diem basis from the beginning
of the relevant Tax period through the day prior to the Closing Date),
_provided_ , _however_ , that with the exception of the foregoing and the Pre-
Closing Tax Liabilities and subject to Buyer's  indemnity rights under
_Article X_ , all Taxes becoming a Lien on any of the Purchased Assets on or
after the Closing Date or which become due and payable on or after the Closing
Date shall be paid solely by Buyer.

  

(ii) Utility (which shall include water, gas, electric, sewer, fuel and
the like) meters shall be read, to the extent that the utility company will do
so, during the daylight hours on the Closing Date (or as near as practicable
prior thereto), with charges to that time paid by Seller and charges
thereafter paid by Buyer.  Prepaid utility charges shall be prorated on a per
diem basis based upon the last available invoice therefor as of the Closing,
and Buyer shall pay Seller for Buyer's prorated share thereof (which shall be
determined on a per diem basis from the Closing to the end of the relevant
period). Charges for utilities which are un-metered, or the meters for which
have not been read on the Closing Date, will be prorated between Buyer and
Seller as of the Transfer Time.

  

(c) If Seller shall disagree with the calculation of Closing Date
Working Capital or any element of the Working Capital Statement relevant
thereto, it shall, within fifteen (15) Business Days after its receipt of the
Working Capital Statement, notify Buyer of such disagreement in writing,
setting forth in reasonable detail  the particulars of such disagreement. In
connection therewith and subject to applicable Law, Buyer will provide Seller
reasonable

  



  

       



     |  

9

    
---|--- 
   

  

   
   

access to all of Buyer's and the Property's records not otherwise available to
Seller as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, to the
extent reasonably related to Seller's review of the Working Capital Statement
and the calculation of Closing Date Working Capital. In the event that Seller
does not provide such notice of disagreement within such fifteen (15) Business
Day period, Seller shall be deemed to have accepted the  Working Capital
Statement and the calculation of the Closing Date Working Capital delivered by
Buyer. In the event any such notice of disagreement is timely provided, Buyer
and Seller, in conjunction with their respective independent accounting firms,
shall use commercially reasonable efforts for a period of fifteen (15)
Business Days (or such longer period as they may mutually agree) to resolve
any disagreements with respect to the calculation of Closing Date Working
Capital. If,  at the end of such period, they are unable to resolve such
disagreements, then KPMG or an independent accounting firm of recognized
national standing with no existing relationship with either party that is
mutually agreed upon by Buyer and Seller (the " _Auditor_ ") shall resolve any
remaining disagreements. The Auditor shall determine as promptly as
practicable whether the Working Capital Statement was prepared in  accordance
with the standards set forth in this Agreement and, only with respect to the
disagreements submitted to the Auditor, whether and to what extent (if any)
Closing Date Working Capital requires adjustment. The Auditor shall promptly
deliver to Buyer and Seller its determination in writing, which determination
shall be made subject to the definitions and principles set forth in this
Agreement, and shall be (i) consistent with either the position of Seller or
Buyer or (ii)  between the positions of Seller and Buyer. The fees and
expenses of the Auditor shall be borne by Buyer and Seller in proportion to
the degree to which the Closing Date Working Capital differs from the amount
of Working Capital proposed by the payer. The determination of the Auditor
shall be final, binding and conclusive for purposes of this Agreement and not
subject to any further recourse by Buyer or Seller under any provision hereof,
including _Article  X_. The date on which Closing Date Working Capital is
finally determined in accordance with this _Section 2.5_ is hereinafter
referred to as the " _Determination Date_ ".

  

(d) Within ten (10) Business Days of the Determination Date, the amount
(which may be a positive or negative number) equal to (i) the Closing Date
Working Capital MINUS (ii) the Pre-Closing Working Capital (the " _Final
Working Capital Adjustment_ ") shall be paid in cash by wire  transfer of
immediately available funds from Buyer to Seller (if the Final Working Capital
Adjustment is a positive amount), or from Seller to Buyer (if the Final
Working Capital Adjustment is a negative amount).

(a) At least five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Seller
shall deliver to Buyer a statement of EBITDA of the business conducted at the
Property for the twelve full-month period last completed prior to the Closing
Date, substantially in the form of the Detailed EBITDA Sheet (the " _Pre-
Closing EBITDA  Statement_ "), which shall be calculated in accordance with
the EBITDA calculation example set forth on _Section 2.6_ of the Seller
Disclosure Letter. The Pre-Closing EBITDA Statement shall be prepared on a
basis consistent with the accounting policies, practices, procedures and
principles used in preparing the Detailed EBITDA Sheet, and each component
thereof  shall be calculated in accordance with GAAP. The Pre-Closing EBITDA
Statement will contain a good faith estimate, set forth in reasonable detail,
of the amount of EBITDA of the business conducted at the Property for the
twelve full-month period

  



  

       



     |

---|--- 
   

       

last completed prior to the Closing Date (the " _Pre-Closing EBITDA_ ").
Seller and Buyer each shall bear its own expenses in the preparation and
review of the Pre-Closing EBITDA Statement. The " _Initial EBITDA Adjustment_
" shall equal (i) zero, if Pre-Closing EBITDA is equal to or  greater than
the EBITDA Benchmark, or (ii) the amount to be subtracted from the Base
Purchase Price pursuant to the following calculation, if Pre-Closing EBITDA is
less than the EBITDA Benchmark: for each $1,000,000 increment (if any) that
the Pre-Closing EBITDA is less than the EBITDA Benchmark, $5,000,000 shall be
subtracted from the Base Purchase Price pursuant to _Section 2.1_. For the
avoidance of doubt, there shall be no  rounding, or partial adjustments, for
amounts (if any) by which Pre-Closing EBITDA is less than the EBITDA Benchmark
in increments of less than $1,000,000.

to be prepared and delivered to Seller a statement of EBITDA of the business
conducted at the Property for the twelve full-month period last completed
prior to the Closing Date, substantially in  the form of the Pre-Closing
EBITDA Statement and the Detailed EBITDA Sheet (the " _EBITDA Statement_ ").
The EBITDA Statement shall be prepared on a basis consistent with the
accounting policies, practices, procedures and principles used in preparing
the Detailed EBITDA Sheet, and with each component determined in accordance
with GAAP. The EBITDA Statement will set forth, in reasonable detail, the

Seller will use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with Buyer in
connection with the preparation of the EBITDA Statement and the calculation
of  Closing Date EBITDA, and will provide Buyer with reasonable access to any
of Seller's records not otherwise available to Buyer as a result of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, to the extent reasonably related
to the preparation of the EBITDA Statement and the calculation of Closing Date
EBITDA.

  



  

(b) If Seller shall disagree with the calculation of Closing Date EBITDA
or any element of the EBITDA Statement relevant thereto, it shall, within
fifteen (15) Business Days after its receipt of the EBITDA Statement, notify
Buyer of such disagreement in writing, setting forth in reasonable detail the
particulars of such disagreement. In  connection therewith and subject to
applicable Law, Buyer will provide Seller reasonable access to all of Buyer's
and the Property's records not otherwise available to Seller as a result of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, to the extent reasonably
related to Seller's review of the EBITDA Statement and the calculation of
Closing Date EBITDA. In the event that Seller does not provide such notice of
disagreement within such fifteen (15) Business Day  period, Seller shall be
deemed to have accepted the EBITDA Statement and the calculation of the
Closing Date EBITDA delivered by Buyer. In the event any such notice of
disagreement is timely provided, Buyer and Seller, in conjunction with their
respective independent accounting firms, shall use commercially reasonable
efforts for a period of fifteen (15) Business Days (or such longer period as
they may mutually agree) to resolve any disagreements with respect to the
calculation of  Closing Date EBITDA. If, at the end of such period, they are
unable to resolve such disagreements, then the Auditor shall resolve any
remaining disagreements. The Auditor shall determine as promptly as

  



  

       



     |

practicable whether the EBITDA Statement was prepared in accordance with the
standards set forth in this Agreement and, only with respect to the
disagreements submitted to the Auditor, whether and to what extent (if any)
Closing Date EBITDA requires adjustment. The Auditor shall promptly deliver to
Buyer and Seller its determination in writing, which determination shall be
made subject to the  definitions and principles set forth in this Agreement,
and shall be (i) consistent with either the position of Seller or Buyer or
(ii) between the positions of Seller and Buyer. The fees and expenses of the
Auditor shall be paid one-half by Buyer and one-half by Seller The
determination of the Auditor shall be final, binding and conclusive for
purposes of this Agreement and not subject to any further recourse by Buyer or
Seller under any provision hereof, including  _Article X_. The date on which
Closing Date EBITDA is finally determined in accordance with this _Section
2.7_ is hereinafter referred to as the " _EBITDA Determination Date_ ".

  

(c) If the difference between the Closing Date EBITDA and the Pre-
Closing EBITDA causes a change in the Initial EBITDA Adjustment as calculated
pursuant to _Section 2.6(a)_ , then within ten (10) Business Days of the
EBITDA Determination Date, the amount of such subsequent change in the
Initial  EBITDA Adjustment (the " _Final EBITDA Adjustment_ ") shall be paid
in cash by wire transfer of immediately available funds from Seller to Buyer
in accordance with the calculations as set forth in _Section 2.6(a)_.

reasonably be expected to result in a negative outcome to any finding of
suitability proceedings currently pending, or under the suitability
proceedings necessary to obtain a Gaming Approval required to consummate the

Disclosure Letter sets forth each Licensing Affiliate that Buyer believes must
obtain a Gaming Approval  in order to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (together, the " _Required Licensees_ ").

Gaming Approvals necessary to conduct the business and operations of Buyer and
its Affiliates, each of which is in full force and effect in all material
respects (the " _Buyer  Permits_ ") and, to the knowledge of Buyer, no event
has occurred which permits, or upon the giving of notice or passage of time or
both would permit, revocation, non-renewal, modification, suspension,
limitation or termination of any Buyer Permit that currently is in effect.
Each Licensed Party, and to Buyer's knowledge, each of their respective
directors, officers, key employees and Persons performing management functions
similar to officers are  in compliance, in all material respects, with the

(ii) has any Gaming Authority indicated any intention to conduct the same.
Neither Buyer, nor, to the knowledge of Buyer, any Licensed Party or director,
officer, key employee or partner of a Licensed Party has (i) received any
written claim, demand, notice, complaint, court order or administrative order

any violation or possible violation of any Gaming Laws which did or would be 
reasonably likely to result in fines or penalties of $50,000 or more, or (ii)

(vii) enter into any Contract to be assumed by Buyer under this Agreement
which (A) expires later than the Closing Date (unless such Contract is
terminable after the Closing Date, without the payment of any consideration
for early termination, at Buyer's sole discretion); (B) involves aggregate
consideration during the remaining  term thereof in excess of $25,000 per
month; or (C) is between Seller and any Affiliate of Seller; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Seller may enter into the following Contracts without any

provision of _Section  7.1(a)_ hereof.

  

(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary (including the
restrictions set forth in _Section 7.1(a)_ hereof), nothing herein shall
preclude Seller from taking any action that is required by Law or any
Governmental Entity in order to consummate the transactions contemplated 
hereby.

_Cooperation; Notice; Cure_

    
---|---|--- 
   

  

Subject to compliance with applicable Law (including antitrust Laws and Gaming
Laws), from the date hereof until the earlier of the termination of this
Agreement or the Closing, Seller and Buyer shall confer on a regular and
frequent basis with one or more Representatives of the other party to report
on the general status of ongoing operations of the Property. Seller, Buyer
and  their respective Affiliates shall promptly notify each other in writing
of, and will use commercially reasonable efforts to cure before the Closing
Date, any event, transaction or circumstance, as soon as practical after it
becomes known to such party, that causes or will cause any covenant or
agreement of Seller or of Buyer under this Agreement to be breached in any
material respect or that renders or will render untrue in any material respect
any representation or warranty of  Seller or of Buyer contained in this
Agreement. Nothing contained in _Section 7.1_ hereof shall prevent Seller from
giving such notice, using such efforts or taking any action to cure or curing
any such event, transaction or circumstance. No notice given pursuant to this
_Section 7.2_ shall have any effect on the representations or warranties, or
the covenants or agreements contained in  this Agreement other than this
_Section 7.2_ for purposes of determining satisfaction of any condition
contained herein.

Section 7.3

_No Solicitation_

    
---|---|--- 
   

  

Subject to obligations imposed by applicable Law, prior to the earlier of the
Closing and the termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Section 9.1_
, Seller and Parent shall not and shall cause their Affiliates not to,
directly or indirectly, through any of their Representatives (i) provide to
any Person any confidential  information concerning the Property in
furtherance of an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) solicit or initiate or facilitate
any Acquisition Proposal, (iii) enter into any agreement with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal or (iv) engage in negotiations with any person (or group
of persons) other than Buyer or its respective Affiliates in furtherance of an
Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ _,_   _however_ , notwithstanding the
foregoing or anything to the contrary, nothing in this Agreement is intended
to prohibit or restrict any action by Parent or its Affiliates or
Representatives with respect to any Excluded Matter (including, without
limitation, furnishing any information in furtherance of, entering into and
participating in discussions or negotiations with respect to, recommending,
otherwise seeking to facilitate or implement,  or entering into a definitive
agreement providing for, a transaction relating to any Excluded Matter). As
used herein, " _Excluded Matter_ " means (A) any issuance or sale of
securities of Parent, (B) a merger, consolidation, share exchange, business
combination or similar transaction involving Parent ( _provided_ ,  _however_
, that any Excluded Matter shall not require Parent or Seller to not fully
perform their obligations, or to breach any of their obligations, in each case
as required under this Agreement), or (C) any sale or other disposition of any
asset or property of Parent or its Affiliates other than the Property.

  

Section 7.4 _Maintenance of Assets; Budgeted Capital Expenditures;
Ownership of Purchased Assets_

  



  

(a) Subject to _Section 7.24_ , During the period from the date hereof

     |  

30

    
---|--- 
   

       

with past practice, ordinary wear and tear excepted, and to make the budgeted
capital expenditures set forth in _Section 7.4_ of the Seller Disclosure
Letter (the " _CapEx Schedule_ ") within the time periods and the amounts
indicated thereon. At the Closing, the sum of specified amounts of any 
budgeted capital expenditures set forth on the CapEx Schedule which have not
been paid for prior to the Closing Date shall be deducted from the Base
Purchase Price as a purchase price adjustment, as set forth in _Section 2.1_
hereof (such amounts, in the aggregate, the " _CapEx Purchase Price
Adjustment_ ").

  

(b) To the extent that Parent or its subsidiaries (other than Seller)
hold any right, title and interest in, to and under the Purchased Assets,
Seller will acquire all such right, title and interest prior to the Closing
and will convey such right, title and interest to Buyer at the Closing.

Section 7.5

     |  

_Employee Matters_

    
---|---|--- 
   

  



  

(a) Between the date hereof and the Closing Date, Buyer shall make
offers of employment, effective as of the Closing Date, to all Property
Employees, excluding any Property Employees on leave from employment or on
short or long term disability leave each of whom is separately identified on
_Section 7.5(a)_   of the Seller Disclosure Letter (the " _Excluded
Employees_ "), which schedule shall be updated not earlier than ten (10)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date); provided that Buyer shall make
offers of employment to the Excluded Employees if such Excluded Employees
return to work at the Property within one (1) year of the Closing Date (with
such offers to Nonrepresented Employees being on terms and  conditions of
employment comparable to the terms and conditions of employment as those
provided to similarly situated employees of Buyer and its Affiliates
immediately prior to the Closing Date, and with such offers to Represented
Employees being on terms and conditions of employment identical to the terms
and conditions of employment under the Collective Bargaining Agreements in
effect as of the Closing Date), other than the Property Employees that are set
forth on  _Section 7.5(a)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter. The Property
Employees who accept Buyer's offers of employment shall commence employment
with Buyer effective as of the Closing Date (or such later date that any
Excluded Employee commences employment in accordance with this _Section
7.5(a)_ ) and are herein collectively referred to as the " _Transferred 
Employees_." Property Employees who (i) are not Transferred Employees, whether
or not offered employment by Buyer, or (ii) are listed on _Section 7.5(a)(ii)_
of the Seller Disclosure Letter are herein referred to as " _Retained
Employees_." Subject to _Section 7.5(f)_ , nothing herein shall  restrict
Buyer from terminating the employment, for any reason, of any Transferred
Employee following the Closing Date.

  

(b) Subject to the terms of the Collective Bargaining Agreements and
subject to _Section 7.5(f)_ , for a period of at least one (1) year
immediately following the Closing Date, Buyer shall provide benefits to each
Transferred Employee who remains employed by Buyer during such period that
are  comparable to those provided to similarly situated employees of Buyer
and its Affiliates.

  

(c) With respect to any employee or employee benefit plan, program or
arrangement maintained by Buyer (including any severance plan), for all
purposes of determining eligibility to

  



  

       



     |  

31

    
---|--- 
   

       

participate and vesting but not for purposes of benefit accrual, a Transferred
Employee's service with Seller shall be treated as service with Buyer;
provided, however, that such service need not be recognized to the extent that
such recognition would result in any duplication of benefits.

  

(d) Buyer shall waive, or cause to be waived, to the extent permitted by
Buyer's benefit plan, any pre-existing condition limitation under any welfare
benefit plan maintained by Buyer or any of its Affiliates in which Transferred
Employees (and their eligible dependents) will be eligible to participate from
and after the Closing, except  to the extent such pre-existing condition
limitation would have been applicable under the comparable Seller welfare
benefit plan immediately prior to the Closing. Buyer shall recognize the
dollar amount of all expenses incurred by each Transferred Employee (and his
or her eligible dependents) during the calendar year in which the Closing
occurs for purposes of satisfying such year's deductible and co-payment
limitations under the relevant welfare benefit plans in which they  will be
eligible to participate from and after the Closing, to the extent such
deductibles and co-payments credits are permitted by Buyer's benefit plans.

  

(e) Prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall take all necessary actions
to provide that the Transferred Employees shall be fully vested in their
accrued benefits under the Seller's 401(k) Plan.

  

(f) Notwithstanding _Section 7.5(a)_ herein, Buyer shall extend offers
of employment to a sufficient number of Property Employees so as not to
effectuate a "plant closing" or "mass layoff," as those terms are defined in
the WARN Act, affecting in whole or in part  any site of employment, facility
or operating unit with respect to the Property or any Property Employee of
Seller. Buyer also shall not, at any time during the ninety (90) days
following the Closing Date, effectuate a "plant closing" or "mass layoff," as
those terms are defined in the WARN Act, for a sufficient number of employees
of Buyer, which, if aggregated with any such conduct on the part of Seller
with respect to the Property on or prior to the  Closing Date, would trigger
the WARN Act, _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this _Section 7.5(f)_
shall restrict Buyer from terminating the employment of any number of
employees from and after the Closing Date. In the event that Buyer terminates
a sufficient number of employees to effect a "plant closing" or "mass 
layoff" within the first ninety (90) days following the Closing Date, Buyer
shall indemnify Seller and hold Seller harmless for and against any WARN-
related liabilities that may arise as a result of the actions of Buyer from or
after the Closing Date. Seller shall notify Buyer of any layoffs of Property
Employees during the ninety (90) day period immediately prior to the Closing
Date. Buyer agrees that from and after the Closing Date, Buyer shall be
responsible for any  notification required under the WARN Act with respect to
the Transferred Employees.

  

(g) At or prior to the Closing, Seller will provide Buyer with a list of
Property Employees who were involuntarily terminated during the ninety (90)
day period immediately prior to the Closing Date, together with the date and
(subject to limitations on disclosure under applicable law) reason (in
reasonable detail) for each such  termination.

  

(h) Upon the Closing, Buyer shall assume all Liabilities and obligations
under, and be bound by, the Collective Bargaining Agreement in effect as of
the date hereof.

  



  

       



     |  

32

    
---|--- 
   

       

(i) Nothing in this _Section 7.5_ shall create any third party
beneficiary right in any Person other than the parties to this Agreement,
including any current or former employee or Transferred Employee, any
participant in any Seller Benefit Plan, or any dependent or beneficiary
thereof, or  any right to continued employment with Seller, the Property,
Buyer or any of their respective Affiliates. Nothing in this _Section 7.5_
shall constitute an amendment to any Seller Benefit Plan or any other plan or
arrangement covering employees or Transferred Employees. Seller and Buyer
shall each cooperate with each other and shall provide each other such
documentation, information and assistance as is reasonably necessary to
effect  the provisions of this _Section 7.5_.

_Access to Information and the Property_

    
---|---|--- 
   

  



  

(a) Upon reasonable notice, and subject to the Transitional Services
Agreement and to applicable Law (including antitrust Laws and Gaming Laws),
Seller and Parent shall afford Buyer's Representatives reasonable access,
during normal business hours during the period from the date hereof until the
earlier of the termination of this  Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.1_
hereof or the Closing, to the Property and to all personnel, premises, books
and records and Contracts related to the operation of the business at the
Property, expressly excluding, however, (A) the Excluded Assets, (B) the
Excluded Liabilities, (C) the Other Assets, (D) the Other Property, and (E)
any items relating to the litigation referred to in the form of Litigation
Settlement and Release  Documents (the " _Existing Litigation_ ") ((A)
through (E) collectively, the " _Excepted Items_ "), and, during such period,
Seller shall furnish promptly to Buyer all material information concerning the
operation of the business located at the Property and concerning the Property
Employees (other than Excepted Items) as Buyer may reasonably request
(collectively,  the " _Inspection_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that (i)
Buyer shall provide Seller with at least twenty-four (24) hours prior notice
of any Inspection; (ii) if Seller so requests, Buyer's Representatives shall
be accompanied by a Representative of Seller; (iii) Buyer shall not initiate
contact with employees or other  representatives of Seller, other than
individuals designated by Seller, without the prior written consent of Seller,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; (iv) Buyer's
Representatives shall not be entitled to perform any physical testing of any
nature with respect to any portion of the Property without Seller's prior
written consent, which consent may be withheld if in the reasonable judgment
of Seller's Representatives such testing would  unreasonably interfere with
the operation and support of the business located at the Property; (v) Buyer
shall not unreasonably interfere with the operation and support of the
business located at the Property; (vi) Buyer shall, at its sole cost and
expense, promptly repair any damage to the Property or any other property
arising from or caused by such Inspection, and shall reimburse Seller for any
loss arising from or caused by any Inspection, and restore the Property or
such  other third party property to substantially the same condition as
existed prior to such Inspection, and shall indemnify, defend and hold
harmless Seller and its Affiliates from and against any personal injury or
property damage claims, liabilities, judgments or expenses (including
reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred by any of them arising or resulting
therefrom; (vii) Seller and Parent shall not be required to provide access to
any materials if the same could jeopardize an  attorney-client or other
applicable privilege in favor of Seller or its Affiliates; and (viii) in no
event shall the results of any such Inspection or Buyer's satisfaction
therewith be a condition to Buyer's obligations hereunder, it being the intent
of Buyer to purchase the Property on an "As Is,

  



  

       



     |  

33

    
---|--- 
   

       

Where Is" basis as set forth in _Section 11.1_ hereof. Buyer will hold and
cause its Representatives to hold all such information furnished to it by or
on behalf of Seller in confidence in accordance with the confidentiality
agreement dated December 21, 2007 between Parent and Coastal Development, LLC
(the  " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "). The Confidentiality Agreement shall
survive the Closing and continue in full force and effect thereafter.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, Buyer and Seller agree that in the
event any proprietary information or knowledge relating to an Excepted Item is
obtained, revealed or otherwise made known to Buyer, Buyer shall not reveal,
disclose, employ or otherwise use any such proprietary  information and will
hold such information in confidence in accordance with the Confidentiality
Agreement. Solely for purposes of this _Section 7.6(a)_ , "Representatives" of
Buyer shall be deemed to include Buyer's potential debt or equity financing
sources and their directors, officers, employees, agents and advisors
(including financial advisors, counsel and accountants).

  

(b) No information or knowledge obtained in any investigation pursuant
to _Section 7.6(a)_ shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or
warranty contained in this Agreement or the conditions to the obligations of
the parties to consummate the transactions contemplated  herein.

  

(c) Following the Closing, at Seller's reasonable request, Buyer will
cause its employees to prepare the books and records and financial statements
required by Seller or its Affiliates (and which are not otherwise the
responsibility of Buyer under this Agreement, including with respect to
Buyer's obligations under  _Section 2.5_ hereof) in connection with any
filing with a Governmental Entity (including Tax Returns which are prepared by
Property Employees as of the Closing Date, and filings under the Exchange Act
and other applicable securities laws) in respect of the period prior to the
Closing Date, as promptly as practicable and in any event no later than ten
(10) days in advance of any applicable deadlines and/or required filing dates.
Seller will  reimburse Buyer for the cost of having such employees prepare
any of the foregoing financial statements requested by Seller pursuant to this
_Section 7.6(c)_ if Buyer would not otherwise prepare such financial
statements.

  

(d) Following the Closing and subject to applicable Law, upon Buyer's
reasonable request, Seller shall provide Buyer with copies of documents of
Seller and its Affiliates which Buyer in good faith determines it is
reasonably likely to need access to in connection with any claim or the
defense (or any counterclaim, cross-claim or similar  claim in connection
therewith) of any claim, suit, action, proceeding or investigation by or
against Buyer or any of its Affiliates, in each case, to the extent related to
the Purchased Assets or Assumed Liabilities.

(c) Without limiting _Section 7.7(a)_ hereof, Buyer and Seller shall

delaying the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

causes such party to reasonably believe that there is a reasonable likelihood
that such consent or approval from such  Governmental Entity will not be
obtained or that the receipt of any such approval will be materially delayed.
Buyer and Seller shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions reasonably necessary to (i) defend any lawsuits

practicable (and in any event within five (5) Business Days) Buyer shall
provide notice thereof to Seller (after which  time such Person shall be
considered a Required Licensee) and as promptly as reasonably practicable (and
in any event within thirty (30) days), Buyer shall cause such Person to file
with the Casino Control Commission a correct and complete application for
licensure or qualification that complies with applicable Gaming Laws. Buyer
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to promptly comply (and cause
each such Person making an application to comply) with any request of the 
Casino Control Commission related to any such applications and to obtain
approval of the Casino Control Commission for all such applications as
promptly as reasonably practicable and to avoid or eliminate each and every
impediment under any Law that may be asserted by the Casino Control Commission

through the Closing Date. Seller may continue to accept reservations for dates

business located at the Property, _provided_ , that Seller may accept

otherwise substantively changed, by any of the terms and conditions applicable
to such reservation); _provided_ ,  _further_ , that Seller may enter into
advanced booking contracts after the date hereof and pertaining to dates after
the Closing Date using an agreement that contains the language substantially
to the effect as set forth on _Exhibit H_ (which language shall not be
otherwise substantively modified or qualified, or the meaning thereof
otherwise substantively changed, by any of the terms and  conditions

warranty that any party holding a reservation or agreement for rooms,
facilities or services will utilize such reservation or honor such agreement.
Buyer, by the execution hereof, solely assumes the risk of  non-utilization
of reservations and non-performance of such agreements from and after the

agrees that in the event that any potential customer of the business located
at the Property refuses to  accept the language substantially to the effect
as set forth on _Exhibit H_ (as otherwise required pursuant to this _Section
7.12(a)_ ) for a reservation, advance booking contract, room allocation
agreements, banquet facility and service agreements or other agreement for
usage of the Property, in each case pertaining to dates after the Closing

Buyer shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, as promptly as
practicable following the date of this Agreement, (a) financing reasonably
sufficient to pay the Purchase Price and all fees and expenses necessary or
related to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(the  " _Financing_ ") and (b) Commitment Letters for the Financing. Buyer
shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable, deliver to Seller true, correct
and complete copies of each executed Commitment Letter and of all other
documents related to the Financing. Buyer shall pay, or cause its Affiliates
to pay, in full when due any and all

  



  

       



     |  

45

    
---|--- 
   

       

commitment fees or other fees in connection with the Commitment Letters and
take such other actions necessary or appropriate to cause each Commitment
Letter to constitute enforceable obligations of each party thereto. Buyer
shall not permit any amendment or modification to be made to, or any waiver of
any material provision of or remedy under, any of the Commitment Letters,
unless such amendment,  modification or waiver, as the case may be, shall
have been expressly approved in writing by Seller. Buyer shall comply (and
cause its Affiliates to comply) with its obligations under each Commitment
Letter and Buyer shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to (a) maintain
in effect each executed Commitment Letter, (b) as promptly as practicable
negotiate definitive agreements with respect to the Commitment Letters on the
terms and conditions contained in the Commitment  Letters (or on terms not
materially less favorable to the interests of Seller (including with respect

Letters), (c) satisfy all conditions applicable to it in the Commitment
Letters and such definitive agreements, and (d) enforce all of its rights
under the Commitment Letters and obtain and consummate the Financing as
promptly as practicable (and in any event prior to the Outside Date). Buyer
shall  keep Seller informed on a reasonably current basis and in reasonable
detail of the status of its efforts to obtain Commitment Letters and arrange
the Financing. Without limiting the foregoing, Buyer shall notify Seller
promptly, and in any event within two Business Days, if (A) any financing
source that is a party to any Commitment Letter (x) notifies Buyer that such
source no longer intends to provide financing to Buyer on the terms set forth
therein or (y) breaches any of its  material obligations under such
Commitment Letter or (B) for any reason Buyer no longer believes in good faith
that it will be able to obtain all of the Financing. Buyer shall not, and
shall not permit any of its Affiliates to, take any action, or enter into any
transaction, that could reasonably be expected to prevent the Financing. Buyer
acknowledges and agrees that obtaining financing is not a condition to its
obligation to consummate the Closing.

other relinquishment, or impairment, of rights with respect to the Existing
Litigation or (ii) an indication of the value or merits of the Existing
Litigation (notwithstanding, among other things, any amount of consideration
payable hereunder that is allocated thereto).  Upon the execution of this

Parties to cause, their attorneys to file immediately a Joint Motion for a
Stay in the Existing Litigation in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit J_ ,

discovery and pre-trial and trial deadlines, the entry of a stand-still

Employee without any specific intent to permit intentional disclosure of any
Excluded Intellectual Property or other confidential information following the

alleviate the possibility of inadvertent use of the Residual Knowledge arising
from routine, unaided memory retention by Transferred Employees. For the
avoidance of doubt,  this Section does not grant any licenses or other rights
to any specific Excluded Intellectual Property or other specific confidential
information of the Seller or its Affiliates.

(a) _Liability_. In the event of termination of this Agreement as
provided in _Section 9.1_ hereof, this Agreement shall immediately become void
and there shall be no Liability on the part of Buyer or Seller, or their
respective Affiliates or  Representatives; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
obligations of the parties set forth in _Sections 5.12_ and _6.3_ , clause

, the last sentence of  _Section 7.24_ , and _Sections 7.10(b)_ , _9.2_ and

Agreement, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party incurring

(i)

     |  

pursuant to _Section 9.1(h)_ hereof, or

    
---|---|--- 
   

  

(ii) pursuant to _Section 9.1(b)_ and (A) as of the date of such
termination (x) a Catastrophic Market Material Adverse Effect shall have been
in effect or (y) any of the conditions set forth in _Section 8.2(c)_ and
(subject to the following  proviso) _Section 8.2(d)_ have not been satisfied
(other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied or
waived at the Closing and those conditions that have not been satisfied due to
Buyer's failure to perform any of its obligations under this Agreement), or
(B) after the date of this Agreement Seller shall have become a debtor in a
bankruptcy case under Title 11 of the United States Code and a motion shall 
have been filed by Seller as debtor in possession or by Seller's trustee in
bankruptcy with the applicable U.S. bankruptcy court seeking to reject the
Seller's obligations under this Agreement,

  

then, in each case under clauses (i) and (ii) of this _Section 9.3(a)_ , the
Deposit, together with any interest earned thereon, shall be returned to
Buyer, _provided_ , _however_ , that, for purposes of _Section 
9.3(a)(ii)(A)(y)_ , the condition set forth in _Section 8.2(d)_ shall be
deemed to have been satisfied if (1) the Casino Control Commission has denied
Buyer's application for "Interim Casino Authorization" (as such term is
defined in the New Jersey Casino Control Act) on the grounds that Buyer, as
applicant for the casino license in connection with the Property, has failed
to establish its  "financial stability" in accordance with the New Jersey
Casino Control Act, (2) Buyer, Buyer Affiliate, their respective Affiliates,
the Initial Qualifiers, all financing sources for the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, any individual qualifiers and any additional
Persons required or requested by Gaming Authorities, shall not have filed,
prior to the date that is 170 days after the date of this Agreement, all
petitions and applications for qualification  in connection with obtaining
the Closing Gaming Approvals and the Interim Casino Authorization and such
additional materials and information as shall be necessary for the applicable
Gaming Authorities to deem all such filings, petitions and applications
complete, or (3) Buyer shall have

  



  

       



     |  

53

    
---|--- 
   

       

failed to provide the State of New Jersey with a letter of credit or a cash
deposit in respect of the Marina Lease in amounts and on terms consistent with
existing requirements.

  

(b) If (x) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to any provision of
_Section 9.1_ and (y) the Deposit is not required to be returned to Buyer
pursuant to the express provisions set forth in _Section 9.3(a)_ , then in
each such case, the parties  shall cause the Deposit, together with any
interest earned thereon, to be delivered to Seller free and clear of any
adverse right or claim. The parties hereby unconditionally and irrevocably
agree that the Deposit shall be fully earned by Seller as of the date of this
Agreement and shall be non-refundable except in the limited circumstances set
forth in _Section 9.3(a)_ , and except to the extent provided in  _Section
9.3(a)_ , Seller's entitlement to the Deposit shall not be subject to
counterclaim or set-off for, or be otherwise affected by, any claim or dispute
relating to any matter; _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer shall have a
continuing interest in the Deposit and the escrow account, which interest
shall be limited to the return of the  Deposit from the escrow account if
required pursuant to _Section 9.3(a)_ and which interest shall continue until
the earlier of the Closing or application of the Deposit from the escrow
account pursuant to _Section 9.3_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, nothing in this _Section 9.3_ shall limit Buyer's rights and 
remedies in the event of actual fraud by Seller, Parent or any of their
Affiliates.

  

(c) Prior to the Closing, (x) entitlement to the Deposit pursuant to
this _Section 9.3_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedy for Seller for
breach of the contract by Buyer that results in a failure to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereunder and (y) Seller shall not be entitled to 
specific performance to compel Buyer to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereunder. Except for entitlement to the Deposit as provided in
_Section 9.3(b)_ , Seller shall have no other rights and remedies available
under this Agreement, at Law, in equity or otherwise for any breach of
contract by Buyer that results in a failure of the transactions contemplated
hereunder to be consummated,  _provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding
the foregoing or anything to the contrary, Seller shall be entitled to all
remedies (including monetary damages, specific performance and injunctive
relief) in respect of the matters governed by _Section 6.3_ , clause (vi) of
the first sentence, and the last three sentences of,  _Section 7.6(a)_ , the
last sentence of _Section 7.24_ , _Sections 7.10(b)_ , _9.2_ and _9.3_ , or
_Article XII_ (the " _Subject Provisions_ ").  Notwithstanding the foregoing,

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no Buyer

Section 10.4

     |  

_Procedure for Claims between Parties_

    
---|---|--- 
   

  

If a claim for Damages is to be made by a Buyer Indemnified Party or Seller
Indemnified Party (each, an " _Indemnified Party_ " and collectively, the "
_Indemnified Parties_ ") entitled to indemnification hereunder, such party
shall give written notice briefly  describing the claim and the total
monetary damages sought (each, a " _Notice_ ") to the indemnifying party
hereunder (the " _Indemnifying Party_ " and collectively, the " _Indemnifying
Parties_ ") as soon as practicable after such Indemnified Party becomes aware
of any fact, condition or event which may give  rise to Damages for which
indemnification may be sought under this _Article X_. Any failure to submit
any such notice of claim to the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve any
Indemnifying Party of any Liability hereunder, except to the extent that the
Indemnifying Party was actually prejudiced by such failure.

    

       



     |  

Section 10.5

     |  

_Defense of Third Party Claims_

    
---|---|--- 
   

  

If any lawsuit or enforcement action is filed against an Indemnified Party by
any third party (each, a " _Third Party Claim_ ") for which indemnification
under this _Article X_ may be sought, Notice thereof shall be given to the
Indemnifying Party as promptly as practicable.  The failure of any
Indemnified Party to give timely Notice hereunder shall not affect rights to

  



  

       



     |  

56

    
---|--- 
   

       

indemnification hereunder, except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party
was actually prejudiced by such failure. The Indemnifying Party shall be
entitled (if it so elects) at its own cost, risk and expense, (i) to take
control of the defense and investigation of such Third Party Claim, (ii) to
employ and engage attorneys of its own choice (provided that such attorneys
are reasonably acceptable to  the Indemnified Party) to handle and defend the
same, unless the named parties to such action or proceeding include both one
or more Indemnifying Parties and an Indemnified Party, and the Indemnified
Party has been advised in writing by counsel that there may be one or more
legal defenses available to such Indemnified Party that are different from or
additional to those available to an applicable Indemnifying Party such that a
conflict of interest exists that would make separate  representation
appropriate under applicable principles and canons of legal representation, in
which event such Indemnified Party shall be entitled, at the Indemnifying
Party's reasonable cost, risk and expense, to separate counsel (provided that
such counsel is reasonably acceptable to the Indemnifying Party), and (iii) to
compromise or settle such claim, which compromise or settlement shall be made
only (x) with the written consent of the Indemnified Party (such consent not 
to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) or (y) if such compromise or
settlement contains an unconditional release of the Indemnified Party in
respect of such claim. If the Indemnifying Party elects to assume the defense
of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall cooperate in all
reasonable respects with the Indemnifying Party and its attorneys in the
investigation, trial and defense of such Third Party Claim and any appeal
arising therefrom and shall provide the  Indemnifying Party all reasonably
requested documents, including a power of attorney; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the Indemnified Party may, at its own cost, participate in the
investigation, trial and defense of such lawsuit or action and any appeal
arising therefrom. The parties shall cooperate with each other in any
notifications to insurers. If the Indemnifying Party fails to assume  the
defense of such claim within fifteen (15) calendar days after receipt of the
Notice, the Indemnified Party against which such claim has been asserted will
have the right to undertake, at the Indemnifying Party's reasonable cost, risk
and expense, the defense, compromise or settlement of such Third Party Claim
on behalf of and for the account and risk of the Indemnifying Party;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that such claim shall not be compromised or settled
without the written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld or delayed. If the Indemnified Party assumes the
defense of the claim, the Indemnified Party will keep the Indemnifying Party
reasonably informed of the progress of any such defense, compromise or
settlement.

Section 10.6

     |  

_Limitations on Indemnity_

    
---|---|--- 
   

  



  

(a) No Buyer Indemnified Party shall seek, or be entitled to,
indemnification under _Section 10.2(a)(i)_ hereof to the extent (i) the
aggregate amount of Damages incurred by a Buyer Indemnified Party with respect
to any individual matter for which indemnification is sought pursuant to 
_Section 10.2(a)(i)_ is less than $25,000 (the " _Sub-Threshold_ "), and (ii)
the aggregate of the individual claims for Damages of the Buyer Indemnified
Parties (each of which is greater than the Sub-Threshold) for which
indemnification is sought pursuant to _Section 10.2(a)(i)_ hereof is less than
$3,000,000 (the  " _Threshold_ ") or exceeds an amount equal to $40,000,000
(the " _Cap_ "); _provided_ , that if the aggregate of all individual claims
(each of which is greater than the Sub-Threshold) for Damages for breaches of
representations and warranties for which indemnification is sought pursuant
to  _Section 10.2(a)(i)_ hereof equals or exceeds the Threshold,

  



  

       



     |  

57

    
---|--- 
   

       

then Buyer, subject to the limitations in this _Article X_ , shall be entitled
to recover for such Damages only to the extent such Damages exceed the
Threshold, but in any event not to exceed the Cap (it being agreed that in no
event shall the aggregate indemnification to be paid under _Section
10.2(a)(i)_   exceed an amount equal to the Cap). Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, Seller's indemnification obligations with respect to
Taxes shall not be subject to the limits set forth in this _Section 10.6_ ,
and shall not be included in the calculation of any amounts for purposes of
the Cap or the Threshold.

  

(b) In calculating the amount of any Damages payable to a Buyer
Indemnified Party or a Seller Indemnified Party hereunder, the amount of the
Damages (i) shall not be duplicative of any other Damage for which an
indemnification claim has been made, (ii) shall be computed net of any amounts
actually recovered by such Indemnified Party under any  insurance policy or
otherwise with respect to such Damages (net of any costs and expenses incurred
in obtaining such recovery) and (iii) shall be computed net of any Tax benefit
actually realized by the Indemnified Party with respect to such Damages. If an
Indemnifying Party pays an Indemnified Party for a claim and subsequently
insurance proceeds in respect of such claim is collected by the Indemnified
Party, then the Indemnified Party promptly shall remit the insurance
proceeds  (net of any costs and expenses incurred in obtaining such insurance
proceeds) to Indemnifying Party. The Indemnified Parties shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain from any applicable insurance
company any insurance proceeds in respect of any claim for which the
Indemnified Parties seek indemnification under this _Article X_.

  

(c) To the extent that an Indemnifying Party pays on an indemnification
pursuant to _Section 10.2_ , and the Indemnified Party has a claim against a
third party (other than the Indemnifying Party), then the Indemnifying Party
shall be subrogated to the claim of the Indemnified Party to the extent  of
the amount of indemnification paid by the Indemnifying Party and to the extent
such payments are duplicative of amounts due to the Indemnified Party.

Section 10.7

     |  

_Payment of Damages_

    
---|---|--- 
   

  

An Indemnified Party shall be paid in cash by an Indemnifying Party the amount
to which such Indemnified Party may become entitled by reason of the
provisions of this _Article X_ , within fifteen (15) days after such amount is
determined either by mutual agreement of the parties or on the date on which
both such amount and an  Indemnified Party's obligation to pay such amount
have been determined by a final judgment of a court or administrative body
having jurisdiction over such proceeding.

Section 10.8

     |  

_Exclusive Remedy_

    
---|---|--- 
   

  

Except to the extent of claims alleging fraud and willful misconduct, after
the Closing, the indemnities provided in this _Article X_ shall constitute the
sole and exclusive remedy of any Indemnified Party for Damages arising out of,
resulting from or incurred in connection with any claims regarding matters
arising under or otherwise  relating to this Agreement; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that this exclusive remedy for Damages does not (a) interfere with
or impede the operation of the provisions of _Sections 2.4_ , _2.5_ , _2.6_
and _2.7_   hereof providing for resolution of certain disputes relating to
the Purchase Price between the parties and/or the Auditor, or (b) preclude a
party from bringing an action after the Closing for specific performance or
other

  



  

       



     |  

58

    
---|--- 
   

       

equitable remedy to require a party to perform its obligations under this
Agreement or any of the other agreements contemplated hereby to be entered
into by the parties, in each case in accordance with _Section 12.18_ hereof.
Without limiting the foregoing, Buyer and Seller each hereby waive (and, by
their acceptance of the benefits under this Agreement,  each Buyer
Indemnified Party and Seller Indemnified Party hereby waives), from and after
the Closing, any and all rights, claims and causes of action (other than
claims of, or causes of action arising from, fraud or willful misconduct) such
party may have against the other party arising under or based upon this
Agreement or any schedule, exhibit, Disclosure Letter, document or certificate
delivered in connection herewith, and no legal action under any Laws,
including Environmental  Laws or otherwise, sounding in tort, statute or
strict liability may be maintained by any party (other than a legal action
brought solely to enforce the provisions of this _Article X_ or the provisions
of the Assignment and Assumption Agreement contemplated by this Agreement).
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no waiver of any closing
condition in _Article VIII_ by any  party shall act as a waiver or a
limitation on such party from making a claim for indemnification pursuant to
this _Article X_.

Price, unless otherwise required by applicable Law.

Section 11.1

     |  

_As Is_

    
---|---|--- 
   

  

Buyer or its Representatives to the extent it so desires shall have examined
and inspected the Purchased Assets prior to the execution of this Agreement,
and subject to the provisions of this _Article XI_ , Buyer agrees to accept
the Purchased Assets in an "AS IS" condition as of the Closing. Buyer agrees
that, except as  provided in _Article V_ hereof, Buyer is not relying upon
any representations, statements, or warranties (oral or written, implied or
express) of any officer, employee, agent or Representative of Seller, or any
salesperson or broker (if any) involved in this transaction as to the
Purchased Assets, including, but not limited to: (a) any representation,
statements or warranties as to the physical condition of the Purchased Assets,
(b)  the fitness and/or suitability of the Purchased Assets for use as a
resort, hotel and/or casino; (c) the financial performance of the Purchased
Assets; (d) the compliance of the Purchased Assets with applicable building,
zoning, subdivision, environmental, or land use Laws, codes, ordinances, rules
or regulations; (e) the state of repair of the Purchased Assets; (f) the value
of the Purchased Assets; (g) the manner or quality of construction of the
Purchased Assets; (h) the  income derived or to be derived from the Purchased
Assets; or (i) the fact that the Purchased Assets may be located in hurricane
zones, on earthquake faults or in seismic hazardous zones. Subject to the
foregoing sentence, Buyer, for itself and its successors and assigns, waives
any right to assert any claim against Seller, at Law or in equity, relating to
any such matter, whether latent or patent, disclosed or undisclosed, known or
unknown, in contract or tort, now existing or  hereafter arising.

Section 11.2

     |  

_Title to Real Property_

    
---|---|--- 
   

  



  

(a) _Title Insurance Commitment_. Buyer agrees to accept (i) the Title
Commitment, and (ii) those certain surveys of the Land with Project No. 27403,
dated November 15, 2004 (Hotel), April 23, 2005 (Marina) and October 20, 2004
(Parking Facility), issued by Arthur W. Ponzio Co. and Associates,  Inc., as
evidence of the status of Seller's title to the Land, conditioned upon, prior
to Closing, either (i) compliance with the matters set forth on the Survey
Compliance Letter or (2) satisfaction of the inquiries presented on the Survey
Compliance Letter, to the reasonable satisfaction of Buyer (collectively, the
" _Survey_ "). Should the Buyer elect to obtain title insurance, Buyer shall
pay at Closing, the  premium for the policy of title insurance described in
the Title Commitment.

  

(b) _Defects_. Buyer agrees to accept title to the Property subject to
all matters shown by the Title Commitment, the Survey and the UCC Search as
well as Permitted Encumbrances. Buyer shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain an updated Title Commitment at least forty-five (45) days 
prior to the Closing. If the updated Title Commitment shows liens or other
financial encumbrances or defects in title not shown by the Title Commitment,
(other than Permitted Encumbrances and encumbrances and liens created or
agreed to by Buyer), and Seller has received an itemized written notice of
such defects within five (5) business days after the date of delivery of the
updated Title Commitment to Buyer (collectively, the " _Notice  Defects_ "),
Seller shall have thirty (30) days after receipt of such notice (or, if
longer, until the Closing Date) to cure any such Notice Defects, and the
Closing Date shall, if necessary, be extended accordingly pursuant to the
provisions of _Section 11.2(b_ ) and _(c)_. Notice Defects will be deemed to
not include any matters shown by the Title  Commitment. Failure to notify
Seller within the specified period of title defects revealed by the updated
Title Commitment shall be deemed a waiver of Buyer's right to disapprove of
the status of Seller's title, and Buyer shall then accept such title as is
described in the Title Commitment, as updated, without reserving any claim
against Seller for title defects; provided that, if Buyer obtains a further
updated Title Commitment immediately prior to the Closing Date and  such
updated Title Commitment shows liens or other financial encumbrances or
defects in title not shown by the prior updated Title Commitment, Buyer shall
be permitted to notify Seller in writing of such defects prior to the Closing
Date and the provisions of this Section 11.2 shall apply as if such defects
were originally identified as Notice Defects, including Seller's right to
extend the Closing Date pursuant to the provisions of _Section  11.2(b_ ) and
_(c)_. Seller shall be under no obligation to remove title defects and any
failure or refusal of Seller to do so shall not be a default of Seller

     |  

_Entire Agreement_

    
---|---|--- 
   

  

This Agreement, the Exhibits and Schedules hereto, the Disclosure Letters and
the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement and supersede
all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the
parties with respect to the subject matter hereof; _provided_ , that the
Confidentiality Agreement shall  remain in full force and effect after the
Closing. Each party hereto agrees that, except for the representations and
warranties contained in this Agreement (as qualified by the respective
Disclosure Letters), neither Seller nor Buyer makes any other representations
or warranties, and each hereby disclaims any other representations and
warranties made by itself or any of its respective Representatives or other
representatives, with respect to the execution and delivery of this

Section 12.7

     |  

_Severability_

    
---|---|--- 
   

  

This Agreement shall be deemed severable; if any term or other provision of
this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule
of Law or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement
shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or
legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in 
any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any
term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced,
the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so
as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an
acceptable manner to the end that transactions contemplated hereby are
fulfilled to the extent possible. The parties hereby acknowledge and agree
that the agreement set forth  in _Section 12.16_ hereof is reasonable in
scope and in all other respects. If it is ever held that any restriction
hereunder is too broad to permit enforcement of such restriction to its
fullest extent, each party agrees that such restriction may be enforced to the
maximum extent permitted

  



  

       



     |

by law, and each party hereby consents and agrees that such scope may be
judicially modified accordingly in any proceeding brought to enforce such
restriction.

party. Any assignment in violation of this _Section 12.8_ shall be void.

(45) days, unless Seller provides Buyer specific prior written consent; 
_provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing shall not prohibit any general
solicitation of employees that is not targeted at such individuals. For the

Agreement, they shall not (and shall cause their Affiliates not to), directly
or indirectly, solicit or hire for employment or in any other capacity any

Buyer agrees and acknowledges that in addition to owning the Purchased Assets
and operating the Property, Seller and/or Affiliates of Seller operate the
hotel and casino properties known as the "Trump Taj Mahal" and the "Trump
Plaza" in Atlantic City, New Jersey (collectively, the " _Other  Property_ ")
and own certain other assets that are not located at, and not related to the

Section 12.18

_Specific Performance_

    
---|---|--- 
   

  

The parties hereby acknowledge and agree that the failure of either party to
perform its agreements and covenants hereunder, including its failure to take
all actions as are necessary on its part to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby, will cause irreparable injury to other party, for which
damages, even if available, will not be an adequate remedy. Accordingly,
each  party hereby consents to the issuance of injunctive relief by any court
of competent jurisdiction to compel performance of each party's obligations
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, the obligations pursuant to Section
7.7 hereof) and to the granting by any court of the remedy of specific
performance of its obligations hereunder and the terms hereof (including, for
the avoidance of doubt, the obligations pursuant to Section 7.7 hereof), in
addition to any other rights or  remedies available hereunder or at Law or in
equity; _provided_ , _however_ , that, prior to the Closing, Seller shall have
no right to specific performance by requiring Buyer to close the transaction
by purchasing the Purchased Assets and that, prior to the Closing, Seller's
sole remedy shall be the amount of the Deposit, except that Seller shall be
entitled to the remedy of  specific performance with respect to _Section 7.7_
hereof; _provided_ _further_ , that Buyer may seek to compel specific
performance by Seller for the sale of the Property and consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything
to the contrary, Seller shall be entitled to all remedies (including monetary
damages,  specific performance and injunctive relief) in respect of the
matters governed by the Subject Provisions.

_Additional Provisions_

(a) Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed (i) as a waiver,
transfer or other relinquishment, or impairment, of rights or claims of Seller
or any of its Affiliates with respect to the Existing Litigation prior to the
Closing or (ii) to entitle Buyer rights or access in or to any documents or
information of Seller, its Affiliates or  Representatives related to the
Existing Litigation.

  

(b) For the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, the parties hereto agree that Seller is
