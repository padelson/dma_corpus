ARTICLE I 
  
  _THE MERGER_

  


 

  

Section 1.1 _The Merger_. At the Effective Time, upon the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in this Agreement, the Company shall be merged with
and into Merger Sub, whereupon the separate corporate existence of the Company
shall cease, and Merger Sub shall continue its existence under Delaware law as
the surviving company in the Merger (the " _Surviving Company_ ") and a wholly
owned subsidiary of Parent. The Merger shall have the effects specified in the
Delaware General Corporation law, as amended (the " _DGCL_ ") and the Delaware
Limited Liability Company Act, as amended (the " _DLLCA_ ").

  


 

  

Section 1.2 _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall take
place at the offices of Akin Gump Strauss Hauer and Feld, 1700 Pacific Avenue,
Suite 4100, Dallas, Texas 75201, at 10:00 a.m., local time, on the second
Business Day after the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted by
applicable Law) of the conditions set forth in _Article VI_ (other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the satisfaction or, to the extent permitted by applicable law,
waiver of such conditions), or at such other place, date and time as the
Company and Parent may agree in writing. The date on which the Closing
actually occurs is referred to as the " _Closing Date_."

  


 

  

Section 1.3 _Effective Time_. On the Closing Date, the Company and Merger Sub
will cause a Certificate of Merger with respect to the Merger (the "
_Certificate of Merger_ ") to be executed, acknowledged and filed with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, as provided in the DGCL and the
DLLCA, and, as soon as practicable on or after the Closing Date, shall make
any and all other filings or recordings required under the DGCL and DLLCA. The
Merger shall become effective at such time when the Certificate of Merger has
been duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at
such time as is agreed between the parties and specified in the Certificate of
Merger in accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL and the DLLCA
(the time the Merger becomes effective is hereinafter referred to as the "
_Effective Time_ ").

  


 

  

Section 1.4 _Effects of the Merger_. The effects of the Merger shall be as
provided in this Agreement and in the relevant provisions of the DGCL and the
DLLCA. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto,
at the Effective Time, all of the property, rights, privileges, powers and
franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Company,
and all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall
become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Company, all as
provided in the DGCL and DLLCA.

  


 

  

    


 

  


 

  


 

  

Section 1.5 _Organizational Documents of the Surviving Company_.

  


 

  

(a) At the Effective Time and subject to _Section 5.9_ , the certificate of
formation of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time,
shall be the certificate of formation of the Surviving Company until
thereafter amended in accordance with the provisions thereof and applicable
Law, except that the name of the Surviving Company shall be Conversant LLC.

  


 

  

(b) At the Effective Time and subject to _Section 5.9_ , the limited liability
company agreement of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, shall be the limited liability company agreement of the
Surviving Company until thereafter amended in accordance with the provisions
thereof and applicable Law, except that the name of the Surviving Company
shall be Conversant LLC.

  


 

  

Section 1.6 _Managers_. Subject to applicable Law, the Managers of Merger Sub
immediately prior to the Effective Time will be the Managers of the Surviving
Company.

  


 

  

Section 1.7 _Officers_. Except as otherwise determined by Parent prior to the
Effective Time, the officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be the initial officers of the Surviving Company and shall hold
office until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, or
their earlier death, resignation or removal.

  


 

  

ARTICLE II 
  
  _CONVERSION OF SHARES; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES_

  


 

  

Section 2.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_.

  


 

  

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of Parent, the Company, Merger Sub or the holder of any shares of
Company Common Stock or membership interests of Merger Sub:

  


 

  

(i) _Membership Interests of Merger Sub_. Each membership interest of Merger
Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
remain issued and outstanding from and after the Effective Time as membership
interests of the Surviving Company.

  


 

  

(ii) _Cancellation of Certain Stock_. Each share of Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that is owned
or held in treasury by the Company and each share of Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that is owned
by Parent, Merger Sub or any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the
Company shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled
and shall cease to exist (the " _Cancelled Shares_ "), and no consideration
shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

  


 

  

(iii) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Each share of Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
Cancelled Shares, any unvested shares issued any under a Company Restricted

  

    


 

  


 

  


 

  

Stock Award and any Dissenting Shares) shall be automatically converted into
the right to receive the following consideration (together, the " _Merger
Consideration_ "):

  


 

  

(A) Each share of Company Common Stock shall be converted into the right to
receive the combination (which combination shall hereinafter be referred to as
the " _Base Consideration_ ") of (x) 0.07037 of a share of validly issued,
fully paid and non-assessable shares of Parent Common Stock, which exchange
ratio equals $18.20 divided by the Parent Signing Trading Price, rounded to
five decimal places (the " _Fixed Exchange Ratio_ ") and (y) an amount in cash
equal to $35.00 minus the product of the Parent Closing Trading Price
multiplied by the Fixed Exchange Ratio (the " _Per Share Cash Consideration_
"); _provided_ , _however_ ; that the Per Share Cash Consideration shall not
exceed $18.62 (the " _Per Share Cash Cap_ ") and shall not be less than $14.98
(the " _Per Share Cash Minimum_ "). In the event that the Per Share Cash Cap
or the Per Share Cash Minimum is reached, then all references to the Per Share
Cash Consideration shall mean the Per Share Cash Cap or the Per Share Cash
Minimum, as the case may be. In lieu of the Base Consideration, each Company
stockholder (other than with respect to Cancelled Shares, any unvested shares
issued under a Company Restricted Stock Award and any Dissenting Shares) shall
have the right to elect, with respect to each share of Company Common Stock
owned by such stockholder, to receive (1) cash equal to the Per Share Cash
Election Consideration (a " _Cash Election_ ") or (2) a number of shares of
Parent Common Stock equal to the Per Share Stock Election Consideration (a "
_Stock Election_ "), subject to pro ration as set forth in _Section
2.1(a)(iii)(C)_ , and otherwise on the terms and conditions set forth in this
Agreement.

  


 

  

(B) Each share of Company Common Stock held by a Company stockholder that has
effectively made and not revoked a Cash Election pursuant to _Section 2.4_
with respect to such share shall be converted into the right to receive an
amount in cash, without interest, equal to $35.00, except in the case in which
the Per Share Cash Cap or the Per Share Cash Minimum has been reached, in
which case such share shall be converted into the right to receive an amount
in cash, without interest, equal to (i) the Fixed Exchange Ratio multiplied by
the Parent Closing Trading Price plus (ii) the Per Share Cash Consideration
(such amount, the " _Per Share Cash Election Consideration_ "), subject to pro
ration, as set forth in _Section 2.1(a)(iii)(C)_ and otherwise on the terms
and conditions set forth in this Agreement. Each share of Company Common Stock
held by a Company stockholder that has effectively made and not revoked a
Stock Election pursuant to _Section 2.4_ with respect to such share shall be
converted into the right to receive such number of shares of validly issued,
fully paid and non-assessable shares of Parent Common Stock which equal (a)
the Fixed Exchange Ratio plus (b) the Per Share Cash Consideration divided by
the Parent Closing Trading Price (such amount, the " _Per Share Stock Election
Consideration_ "), subject to pro ration as set forth in _Section
2.1(a)(iii)(C)_ and otherwise on the terms and conditions set forth in this
Agreement.

  


 

  

(C) The Base Consideration otherwise payable on each share of Company Common
Stock as to which either a Cash Election or a Stock Election has been made
shall be pooled and reallocated among all such shares of Company Common Stock
as to which an election has been made so that each such share gets, to the
greatest extent

  

    


 

  


 

  


 

  

possible, all cash or all Parent Common Stock, but with the consideration
payable on each such share of Company Common Stock pro rated to the extent
there is not enough cash or enough Parent Common Stock to pay pursuant to each
such election (and with the difference between such pro rated amount being
made up in the remaining Parent Common Stock or cash, as applicable). For the
avoidance of doubt, regardless of the number of shares of Company Common Stock
that are subject to either a Cash Election or a Stock Election, the aggregate
amount of cash and Parent Common Stock payable by Parent in the Merger shall
equal the aggregate amount of cash and Parent Common Stock that would have
been payable if no election had been made with respect to any shares of
Company Common Stock. Example pro ration calculations reflecting the parties\'
intent are given in _Exhibit 2.1_ of this Agreement.

  


 

  

All of the shares of Company Common Stock converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration pursuant to this _Article II_ shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist as
of the Effective Time, and uncertificated shares of Company Common Stock
represented in book-entry form (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") and each certificate
that, immediately prior to the Effective Time, represented any such shares of
Company Common Stock (each, a " _Certificate_ ") shall thereafter represent
only the right to receive the Merger Consideration and the Fractional Share
Cash Amount, plus any dividends or other distributions to which such
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares become entitled in accordance with _Section
2.2(e)_.

  


 

  

(b) _Shares of Dissenting Stockholders_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, any issued and outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock held by a person (a " _Dissenting Stockholder_ ") who has not voted in
favor of, or consented to, the adoption of this Agreement and has complied
with all the provisions of the DGCL concerning the right of holders of shares
of Company Common Stock to require appraisal of their shares (the " _Appraisal
Provisions_ ") of Company Common Stock (" _Dissenting Shares_ "), to the
extent the Appraisal Provisions are applicable, shall not be converted into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration, but shall become the right to
receive such consideration as may be determined to be due to such Dissenting
Stockholder pursuant to the procedures set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL.
If such Dissenting Stockholder withdraws its demand for appraisal or fails to
perfect or otherwise loses its right of appraisal, in any case pursuant to the
DGCL, each of such Dissenting Stockholder\'s shares of Company Common Stock
shall thereupon be treated as though such shares of Company Common Stock had
been converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to
_Section 2.1(a)(iii)_. The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any
demands for appraisal of shares of Company Common Stock received by the
Company, withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant
to Section 262 of the DGCL and shall give Parent the opportunity to
participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect thereto. The
Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent (which may be
granted or withheld in Parent\'s sole and absolute discretion), make any
payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands.

  


 

  

(c) _Certain Adjustments_. If, between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or Parent
Common Stock shall have been changed into or exchanged for a different number
of shares or a different class of shares by reason of any stock dividend,
subdivision, reorganization, reclassification, recapitalization, stock split,
reverse stock split, combination or exchange of shares, or any similar

   
 

    


 

  


 

  


 

  

event shall have occurred, then the Merger Consideration shall be equitably
adjusted, without duplication, to proportionally reflect such change;
_provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this _Section 2.1(c)_ shall be
construed to permit the Company or Parent to take any action with respect to
its securities that is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

  


 

  

(d) _No Fractional Shares_. No fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall
be issued in connection with the Merger, no certificates or scrip representing
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be delivered upon the
conversion of Company Common Stock pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)(iii)_ , and
such fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to any
dividends, voting rights or to any other rights of a holder of shares of
Parent Common Stock. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement,
each holder of shares of Company Common Stock converted pursuant to the Merger
who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of
Parent Common Stock (after aggregating all shares represented by the
Certificates and Book-Entry Shares delivered by such holder) shall receive, in
lieu thereof and upon surrender thereof, cash (without interest) in an amount
determined by multiplying (i) the closing price of Parent Common Stock
reported on the New York Stock Exchange on the trading day immediately
preceding the Closing Date by (ii) the fraction of a share (after taking into
account all shares of Company Common Stock held by such holder at the
Effective Time and rounded to five decimal places) of Parent Common Stock to
which such holder would otherwise be entitled (the " _Fractional Share Cash
Amount_ ").

  


 

  

(e) _Reversal of the Surviving Company_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary (except the remaining provisions of this _Section
2.1(e))_ , if the product of (A) the Aggregate Stock Consideration multiplied
by (B) the Testing Price (such product, the " _Aggregate Stock Consideration
Value_ ") is less than 40% of the sum of the Aggregate Stock Consideration
Value plus the amount of Non-Stock Consideration, then (i) Merger Sub shall
assign its obligations to a newly formed Delaware corporation that is a wholly
owned subsidiary of Parent (which newly formed subsidiary shall be Merger Sub
for all purposes under this Agreement) and (ii) the Company rather than Merger
Sub shall survive the Merger and be the Surviving Company (" _Reverse Merger
Condition_ "). In such case, all references to the Surviving Company shall
refer to the Company, and specifically:

  


 

  

(i) the Certificate of Incorporation of the Company shall, without further
action, be amended and restated to read the same as the Certificate of
Incorporation of Merger Sub in effect at the Effective Time, and shall be the
Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Company until thereafter amended
in accordance with applicable law;

  


 

  

(ii) the Bylaws of the Company shall, without further action, be amended and
restated to read the same as the Bylaws of Merger Sub in effect at the
Effective Time, and shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving Company until
thereafter amended in accordance with applicable law; and

  


 

  

(iii) the officers and directors of Merger Sub at the Effective Time shall
become the officers and directors of the Surviving Company, to serve as such
until the death, resignation, removal or replacement of such persons as
provided by law and the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the
Surviving Company.

  

    


 

  


 

  


 

  


 

  

Section 2.2 _Exchange of Certificates_.

  


 

  

(a) _Appointment of Exchange Agent_. Prior to the mailing of the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus, Parent shall appoint a bank or trust company reasonably
acceptable to the Company to act as exchange agent (the " _Exchange Agent_ ")
for the payment of the Merger Consideration and shall enter into an agreement
(the " _Exchange Agent Agreement_ ") relating to the Exchange Agent\'s
responsibilities under this Agreement, which Exchange Agent Agreement shall be
subject to the reasonable approval of the Company.

  


 

  

(b) _Deposit of Merger Consideration_. At or prior to the Effective Time,
Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent, in
trust for the benefit of the holders of Company Common Stock, (i) cash
sufficient to pay the Aggregate Cash Consideration (together with the
Fractional Share Cash Amount) and (ii) evidence of Parent Common Stock in
book-entry form (and/or certificates representing such Parent Common Stock, at
Parent\'s election) representing the number of shares of Parent Common Stock
sufficient to deliver the Aggregate Stock Consideration (such cash and
evidence of Parent Common Stock, together with any dividends or distributions
with respect thereto, the " _Exchange Fund_ "). Subject to the terms and
conditions in this Agreement and pursuant to irrevocable instructions, the
Exchange Agent shall promptly deliver the Merger Consideration to be issued
pursuant to this Article II out of the Exchange Fund and the Exchange Fund
shall not be used for any purpose, except as provided in this Agreement.
Parent shall pay all charges and expenses, including those of the Exchange
Agent, incurred by it in connection with the exchange of Company Common Stock
for the Merger Consideration and other amounts contemplated by this Article
II. Parent further agrees to provide to the Exchange Agent, from time to time
as needed, immediately available funds sufficient to pay any dividends and
other distributions, without interest, pursuant to _Section 2.2(e)_.

  


 

  

(c) _Exchange Procedures_. As soon as reasonably practicable (and no later
than the third Business Day) after the Effective Time and subject to _Section
2.4_ , Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record
of Company Common Stock whose shares of Company Common Stock were converted
pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)(iii)_ into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration (other than those holders of Certificates who have properly
completed and submitted, and have not revoked, Forms of Election pursuant to
_Section 2.4_ ) (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title as to any Certificates shall
pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and such
letter of transmittal shall be in such customary form and have such other
provisions as Parent, the Company and the Exchange Agent shall reasonably
agree upon prior to the Effective Time) (the " _Letter of Transmittal_ ") and
(ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration, the Fractional Share
Cash Amount and any dividends or other distributions to which such
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares become entitled in accordance with _Section
2.2(e)_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
Parent and the Company shall modify the procedures set forth in this Agreement
with respect to the letters of transmittal and the Forms of Election, to the
extent necessary to comply with DTC procedures.

  

  

 


 

  

(d) _Surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares_. Upon surrender of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent together with the
Letter of Transmittal

 

  


 

  

    


 

  


 

  

(or Form of Election), duly completed and validly executed in accordance with
the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may customarily be
required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger
Consideration into which the shares represented by such Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares have been converted pursuant to this Agreement, together with the
Fractional Share Cash Amount and any dividends or other distributions to which
such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares become entitled in accordance with
_Section 2.2(e)_. In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of Company
Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer or stock records of the
Company, any cash to be paid upon, or shares of Parent Common Stock to be
issued upon, due surrender of the Certificate or Book-Entry Share formerly
representing such shares of Company Common Stock may be paid or issued, as the
case may be, to such a transferee if such Certificate or Book-Entry Share is
presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to
evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock
transfer or other similar Taxes have been paid or are not applicable. No
interest shall be paid or shall accrue on any cash payable upon surrender of
any Certificate or Book-Entry Share. Until surrendered as contemplated by this
_Section 2.2_ , each Certificate and Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any
time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive, upon
such surrender, the Merger Consideration into which the shares represented by
such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares have been converted pursuant to this
Agreement, together with the Fractional Share Cash Amount and any dividends or
other distributions to which such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares become
entitled in accordance with _Section 2.2(e)_.

  


 

  

(e) _Treatment of Unexchanged Shares_. No dividends or other distributions, if
any, with a record date at or after the Effective Time with respect to Parent
Common Stock, shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered share of
Company Common Stock to be converted into Merger Consideration that includes
shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)(iii)_ unless and
until such holder shall surrender such share in accordance with this _Section
2.2_. After the surrender in accordance with this _Section 2.2_ of a share of
Company Common Stock to be converted into Parent Common Stock pursuant to
_Section 2.1(a)(iii)_ , the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive (in
addition to the Merger Consideration and the Fractional Share Cash Amount
payable to such holder pursuant to this _Article II_ ) (i) the amount of
dividends or other distributions, without any interest thereon, with a record
date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole
shares of Parent Common Stock, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the
amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time but prior to the date of surrender of such holder\'s shares of
Company Common Stock and a payment date occurring after the date of surrender,
payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock.

  


 

  

(f) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. The shares of
Parent Common Stock delivered and cash paid in accordance with the terms of
this _Article II_ upon conversion of any shares of Company Common Stock shall
be deemed to have been delivered and paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock. From and after the
Effective Time, subject to applicable Law in the case of Dissenting Shares,
all holders of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares shall cease to have any
rights as Company stockholders other than the right to receive the Merger
Consideration into which the shares represented by such Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares have been converted pursuant to this Agreement upon the surrender
of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share in

  

    


 

  


 

  


 

  

accordance with _Section 2.2(d)_ (together with the Fractional Share Cash
Amount and any dividends or other distributions to which such Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares become entitled in accordance with _Section 2.2(e)_ ),
without interest. From and after the Effective Time, the stock transfer books
of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no further registration of
transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Company of shares of
Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time. If, after the Effective Time, any Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
formerly representing shares of Company Common Stock are presented to the
Surviving Company, Parent or the Exchange Agent for any reason, such
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided
in this _Article II_ , subject to applicable Law in the case of Dissenting
Shares.

  


 

  

(g) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash
included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent provided that any
investment of such cash shall in all events be in short-term obligations of
the United States of America with maturities of no more than 30 days or
guaranteed by the United States of America and backed by the full faith and
credit of the United States of America or in commercial paper obligations
rated A 1 or P 1 or better by Moody\'s Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and
Poor\'s Corporation, respectively; _provided_ , _further_ , that no such
investment or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to holders of
Certificates or Book- Entry Shares pursuant to this _Article II_ , and
following any losses from any such investment, Parent shall promptly provide
additional funds to the Exchange Agent for the benefit of the holders of
shares of Company Common Stock who were holders at the Effective Time in the
amount of such losses, which additional funds will be deemed to be part of the
Exchange Fund. Any interest or other income resulting from such investments
shall be for the benefit of and paid to Parent.

  


 

  

(h) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including any interest or other amounts received with respect thereto) that
remains unclaimed by, or otherwise undistributed to, the holders of
Certificates and Book-Entry Shares for nine months after the Effective Time
shall be delivered to Parent and any holder of Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares who has not theretofore complied with this _Article II_ shall
thereafter look only to Parent or the Surviving Company (subject to abandoned
property, escheat or other similar Laws), as general creditors thereof, for
satisfaction of its claim for Merger Consideration and any dividends and
distributions which such holder has the right to receive pursuant to this
_Article II_ without any interest thereon.

  


 

  

(i) _No Liability_. None of Parent, the Company, Merger Sub or the Exchange
Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of any portion of the Exchange
Fund or the Merger Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to
any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Notwithstanding any
other provision of this Agreement, any portion of the Merger Consideration or
other amounts to be paid in accordance with this _Article II_ that remains
undistributed to the holders of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares, as of
immediately prior to the date on which the Merger Consideration or such other
amounts would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental
Entity, shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property
of the Surviving Company, free and clear of all claims or interest of any
person previously entitled thereto.

  


 

  

    


 

  


 

  


 

  

(j) _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Surviving Company, Parent and the
Exchange Agent (without duplication) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement, such amounts as are
required to be deducted or withheld with respect to the making of such payment
under applicable Tax Law. Any amounts so deducted, withheld and paid over to
the appropriate Taxing Authority shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the person in respect of which such deduction
or withholding was made.

  


 

  

(k) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent or
the Exchange Agent, the posting by such person of a bond in such amount as
either Parent or the Exchange Agent may determine (without duplication) is
reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be made against
it or the Surviving Company with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange
Agent (or, if subsequent to the termination of the Exchange Fund and subject
to _Section 2.2(h)_ , Parent) shall deliver, in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration and any dividends and
distributions, without interest, deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to
this Agreement.

  


 

  

Section 2.3 _Company Stock Options and Company Restricted Stock Awards_ _._

  


 

  

(a) A list showing, as of September 8, 2014, each of the outstanding options
to acquire shares of Company Common Stock under the Company Stock Plans or any
other outstanding agreement (the " _Company Options_ ") and outstanding
restricted stock awards in respect of shares of Company Common Stock under the
Company Stock Plans or any other outstanding agreement (the " _Company
Restricted Stock Awards_ ") is set forth on _Section 3.2(b)_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule.

  


 

  

(b) Each Company Option that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall, as of the Effective Time, be converted into an option to purchase,
on the same terms and conditions as were applicable to such Company Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, an " _Adjusted Option_ "), the
number of shares of Parent Common Stock, rounded down to the nearest whole
share, determined by multiplying the number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to the Company Option by the Per Share Stock Election Consideration,
at an exercise price per share of Parent Common Stock, rounded up to the
nearest whole cent, equal to the per-share exercise price for the shares of
Company Common Stock otherwise purchasable pursuant to the Company Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by the Per Share Stock
Election Consideration; _provided_ , _further_ , that for each Company Option
that immediately prior to the Effective Time is intended to qualify as an
"incentive stock option" as defined under Section 422 of the Code the option
exercise price and the number of shares of Parent Common Stock purchasable
under each Adjusted Option shall be determined in order to comply with Section
424(a) of the Code and Treasury Regulations Section 1.424-1, and for all other
Company Options the option exercise price and the number of shares of Parent
Common Stock purchasable under each Adjusted Option shall be determined in
order to comply with Treasury Regulations Section 1.409A-1(b)(5)(v)(D).

  


 

  

    


 

  


 

  


 

  

(c) Each Company Restricted Stock Award (subject to the provisions of any
separate agreement between the Chief Executive Officer of the Company and
Parent) that is outstanding and unvested immediately prior to the Effective
Time (after giving effect to any vesting acceleration that occurs or would
occur as a result of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement) shall, as of the Effective Time, be converted into a restricted
stock award (an " _Adjusted Restricted Stock Award_ "), on the same terms and
conditions as were applicable to the Company Restricted Stock Award
immediately prior to the Effective Time, in respect of the number of shares of
Parent Common Stock, rounded down to the nearest whole share, determined by
multiplying the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the
Company Restricted Stock Award by the Per Share Stock Election Consideration.

  


 

  

(d) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board of Directors or the
appropriate committee thereof shall adopt resolutions providing for the
treatment of the Company Options and Company Restricted Stock Awards
(collectively, the " _Company Stock Awards_ ") as contemplated by this
_Section 2.3_ , and to terminate each of the Company Stock Plans effective
immediately prior to the Effective Time. The Adjusted Options and Adjusted
Restricted Stock Awards will be issued under the Parent Stock Plans, provided
that the Adjusted Options and Adjusted Restricted Stock Awards shall be
subject to all of the same terms and conditions as were applicable to the
related Company Options or Company Restricted Stock Awards, as applicable,
immediately prior to the Effective Time (taking into account the adjustments
set forth in _Section 2.3(b)_ and _Section 2.3(c))._ The Board of Directors of
Parent or the appropriate committee thereof shall adopt resolutions providing
for the grant of the Adjusted Options or Adjusted Restricted Stock Awards as
contemplated by this _Section 2.3_ and any shares of Parent Common Stock
granted in settlement of such awards shall reduce the available share pool
under the applicable Parent Stock Plan. To the extent that Parent\'s
registration statement(s) on Form S-8 with respect to the applicable Parent
Stock Plan(s) do not have sufficient registered shares of Parent Common Stock
to cover the Adjusted Options and Adjusted Restricted Stock Awards, Parent
shall file one or more appropriate registration statements (on Form S-3 or
Form S-8 or any successor or other appropriate forms) with respect to the
Parent Common Stock underlying the Adjusted Options and Adjusted Restricted
Stock Awards.

  


 

  

(e) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Company
shall take such action as may be necessary, including adopting any necessary
resolutions or amendments with respect to the ValueClick, Inc. 2007 Employee
Stock Purchase Plan, as amended and restated (the " _Company ESPP_ ") that no
new contributions shall be accepted by, or made to, the Company ESPP, and any
cash remaining in participants\' accounts after the date such action is taken
will be distributed to participants, and the Company ESPP will be terminated
effective immediately prior to the Closing Date.

  


 

  

Section 2.4 _Company Election Procedures._

  


 

  

(a) Each Company stockholder shall be entitled to make a Cash Election or
Stock Election with respect to each share of Company Common Stock held by such
stockholder (other than Cancelled Shares, any unvested shares issued any under
a Company Restricted Stock Award and any Dissenting Shares). For the avoidance
of doubt, any Company stockholder that does not make a Cash Election or Stock
Election will receive the Base Consideration.

  


 

  

    


 

  


 

  

(b) Parent shall prepare and file as an exhibit to the Form S-4 a form of
election (the " _Form of Election_ ") in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to the Company. The Form of Election shall specify that delivery
shall be made, and risk of loss and title to any Certificates shall pass only
upon proper delivery of the Form of Election and any Certificates. Parent
shall direct the Exchange Agent to mail the Form of Election with the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus to all persons who are record holders of shares of
Company Common Stock as of the record date for the Company Stockholders\'
Meeting. The Form of Election shall be used by each record holder of shares of
Company Common Stock (or, in the case of nominee record holders, the
beneficial owner through proper instructions and documentation) having the
right to make an election under _Section 2.4(a)_ to specify the number of
shares of Company Common Stock, if any, held by such stockholder with respect
to which such stockholder desires to make a Cash Election and the number of
such shares, if any, with respect to which such stockholder desires to make a
Stock Election. Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to make
the Form of Election available to all persons who become record holders of
shares of Company Common Stock during the period between the record date for
the Company Stockholders\' Meeting and the Election Deadline who have the
right to make an election pursuant to _Section 2.4(a)_.

  


 

  

(c) Any holder\'s election shall have been properly made only if the Exchange
Agent shall have received the election at its designated office by 5:00 p.m.,
New York City time, on the date that is one Business Day immediately preceding
the Company Stockholders\' Meeting (or such other date as may be mutually
agreed by Parent and the Company) (the " _Election Deadline_ "), a Form of
Election properly completed and signed and accompanied by (i) Certificates
representing the shares of Company Common Stock to which such Form of Election
relates, duly endorsed in blank or otherwise in form acceptable for transfer
on the books of the Company (or by an appropriate guarantee of delivery of
such Certificates as set forth in such Form of Election from a firm that is an
"eligible guarantor institution" (as defined in Rule 17Ad-15 under the
Exchange Act); _provided_ , that such Certificates are in fact delivered to
the Exchange Agent by the time set forth in such guarantee of delivery) or
(ii) in the case of Company Book-Entry Shares, any additional documents
required by the procedures set forth in the Form of Election. After a Cash
Election or a Stock Election is validly made with respect to any shares of
Company Common Stock, no Company stockholder may trade, sell or otherwise
transfer such shares and no further registration of transfers of such shares
shall be made on the stock transfer books of the Company, unless and until
such Cash Election or Stock Election is properly revoked.

  


 

  

(d) Parent and the Company shall use their respective commercially reasonable
efforts to publicly announce the anticipated Election Deadline at least five
Business Days prior to the anticipated Election Deadline. If the Company
Stockholder Meeting is delayed to a subsequent date, the Election Deadline
shall be similarly delayed to a subsequent date, and Parent and the Company
shall use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to promptly
announce any such delay and, when determined, the rescheduled Election
Deadline.

  


 

  

(e) Any Cash Election or Stock Election may be revoked with respect to all of
the shares of Company Common Stock subject thereto by the holder who submitted
the applicable Form of Election by written notice received by the Exchange
Agent prior to the Election Deadline. In addition, all Cash Elections and
Stock Elections shall automatically be

  

    


 

  


 

  

revoked if this Agreement is terminated in accordance with Article VII. If a
Cash Election or Stock Election is revoked and the Closing occurs, the shares
as to which such election previously applied shall automatically receive the
Base Consideration in accordance with _Section 2.1(a)(iii)_ unless a contrary
election is properly made and submitted by the holder prior to the Election
Deadline. If a Cash Election or Stock Election is revoked, Certificates will
be returned to holders, and the accounts of holders of Book-Entry Shares will
be credited at the Depository Trust Company or equivalent, except to the
extent a subsequent election is made with respect to any or all of such
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares.

  


 

  

(f) The good faith determination of the Exchange Agent (or the joint
determination of Parent and the Company, in the event that the Exchange Agent
declines to make any such determination) shall be conclusive and binding as to
whether or not Cash Elections and Stock Elections shall have been properly
made or revoked pursuant to this _Section 2.4_ and as to when Cash Elections,
Stock Elections and revocations were received by the Exchange Agent. The
Exchange Agent shall have reasonable discretion to disregard immaterial
defects in the Forms of Election. Parent and the Company shall jointly make
all computations contemplated by _Section 2.1(a)(iii)_ , and absent manifest
error this computation shall be conclusive and binding. Parent and the Company
shall jointly make, in good faith, any rules as are consistent with this
_Section 2.4_ for the implementation of the Cash Elections and Stock Elections
provided for in this Agreement as shall be necessary or desirable to effect
these Cash Elections and Stock Elections.

  


 

  

Section 2.5 _Further Assurances_. If at any time before or after the Effective
Time, Parent or the Company reasonably believes or is advised that any further
instruments, deeds, assignments or assurances are reasonably necessary or
desirable to consummate the Merger or to carry out the purposes and intent of
this Agreement at or after the Effective Time, then Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company and the Surviving Company and their respective officers and directors
(or managers, as applicable) shall execute and deliver all such proper
instruments, deeds, assignments or assurances and do all other things
reasonably necessary or desirable to consummate the Merger and to carry out
the purposes and intent of this Agreement.

Except as disclosed in (i) the Company SEC Documents publicly filed under
Sections 13(a), 14(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act since January 1, 2014 and

January 1, 2011 (all such documents and reports filed or furnished by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, the " _Company SEC Documents_ ") and has
timely paid all fees due in connection therewith. As of their respective dates
or, if amended, as of the date of the last such amendment (and, in the case of
registration statements and proxy statements, on the dates of effectiveness
and the dates of the relevant meetings, respectively), the Company SEC
Documents complied in all material respects with the requirements of the
Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the "
_Sarbanes-Oxley Act_ ") as of the time of filing with the SEC, as the case may
be, and the applicable rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, and none
of the Company SEC Documents contained any untrue statement of a material fact
or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading. As of the date of this Agreement, no
executive officer of the Company has failed in any respect to make the
certifications required of him or her under Section 302 or 906 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act. There are no outstanding or unresolved comments in any
comment letters of the staff of the SEC received by the Company relating to
the Company SEC Documents. None of the Company SEC Documents is, to the
knowledge of the Company, the subject of ongoing SEC review.

  


 

  

(b) The consolidated financial statements (including all related notes and
schedules) of the Company included in or incorporated by reference into the
Company SEC Documents (the " _Company Financial Statements_ ") (i) fairly
present in all material respects the consolidated financial position of the
Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries, as at the respective dates thereof,
and the consolidated results of their operations and their consolidated cash
flows for the respective periods then ended (subject, in the case of unaudited
statements, to normal and recurring year-end audit adjustments and other
adjustments described therein, including the notes thereto), (ii) were
prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("
_GAAP_ ") (except, in the case of the unaudited statements, subject to normal
year-end audit adjustments and the absence of footnote disclosure) applied on
a consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be indicated
therein or in the notes thereto), and (iii) have been prepared from, and are
in accordance with, the books and records of the Company and its consolidated
subsidiaries. The books and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries have
been, and are being, maintained in all material respects in accordance with
GAAP and any other applicable legal and accounting requirements.
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has not resigned (or informed the Company that it
intends to resign) or been dismissed as independent public accountants of the
Company as a result of or in connection with any disagreements with the
Company on a matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement
disclosure or auditing scope or procedure.

  


 

  

(c) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, nor does it
have any commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet
partnership or any similar Contract (including any Contract relating to any
transaction or relationship between or among the Company or one of its
Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated Affiliate, including any
structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or person,

  

    


 

  


 

  

on the other hand) or any " _off-balance sheet arrangements_ " (as defined in
Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K of the SEC).

  


 

  

Section 3.5 _Internal Controls and Procedures_. The Company has established
and maintains disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over
financial reporting (as such terms are defined in paragraphs (e) and (f),
respectively, of Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act) designed to ensure that
all material information required to be disclosed by the Company in the
reports that it files or furnishes under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such material information is
accumulated and communicated to the Company\'s management as appropriate to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the
certifications required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act. Based on its most recent evaluation of internal controls over financial
reporting prior to the date hereof, management of the Company has disclosed to
the Company\'s auditors and the audit committee of the Company Board of
Directors (i) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the
design or operation of internal controls over financial reporting that are
reasonably likely to adversely affect in any material respect the Company\'s
ability to report financial information and (ii) any fraud, whether or not
material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant
role in the Company\'s internal control over financial reporting, and each
such deficiency, weakness and fraud so disclosed to auditors, if any, has been
disclosed to Parent prior to the date hereof. To the knowledge of the Company,
there is no reason to believe that the Company\'s outside auditors and its
chief executive officer and chief financial officer will not be able to give
the certifications and attestations required pursuant to the rules and
regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without
additional qualification, when next due.

  


 

  

Section 3.6 _No Undisclosed Liabilities_. There are no Liabilities of the

GAAP, except for (i) Liabilities that are reflected or reserved against on the
consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its Subsidiaries included in its
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2014
(including any notes thereto), (ii) Liabilities incurred in the ordinary
course of business consistent in type and magnitude with past practice since
June 30, 2014, (iii) Liabilities that have not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect
on the Company, (iv) Liabilities arising or resulting from an existing
Contract, or a Contract entered into in compliance with this Agreement, except
to the extent that such Liabilities arose or resulted from a breach or
violation or a default of such Contract and would reasonably be expected to

connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

_Laws_ " and each, a " _Law_ "), except as has not had and

  

    


 

  


 

  

would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company. Since June 30, 2013, neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any written notice or, to the
Company\'s knowledge, other communication from any Governmental Entity
regarding any actual or possible failure on the part of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries to comply with any material Law in a material respect.

  


 

  

(b) The Company and its Subsidiaries hold all franchises, grants,
authorizations, licenses, permits, easements, variances, exceptions, consents,
certificates, approvals, clearances, permissions, qualifications and
registrations and orders of all applicable Governmental Entities, and have
filed all tariffs, reports, notices and other documents with all Governmental
Entities necessary, in each case, for the Company and its Subsidiaries to own,
lease and operate their properties and assets and to carry on their businesses
as they are now being conducted (the " _Company Permits_ ") and have paid all
fees and assessments due and payable in connection therewith, in each case
except as has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.
All Company Permits are valid and in full force and effect and are not subject
to any administrative or judicial proceeding that could result in any
modification, termination or revocation thereof, except where the failure to
be valid or in full force and effect would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company. The Company and its Subsidiaries are in compliance with the terms and
requirements of all such Company Permits and to the Company\'s knowledge no
suspension or cancellation of any such Company Permit is threatened, in each
case except as has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

officers, or to the Company\'s knowledge their employees, agents, or any other

directly or indirectly, (i) violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of
1977, as amended, or violated any similar Law; or (ii) made any unlawful
bribe, unlawful kickback or other unlawful payment to any person, private or
public, regardless of form, whether in money, property or services, to obtain
favorable treatment in securing business to obtain special concessions for the

Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, or any similar Law in any
country in which the Company or its Subsidiaries does business.

Company nor, to the knowledge of the Company, any director, officer, employee,
auditor, accountant or representative of the Company or any Subsidiary of the
Company, has received or otherwise had or obtained knowledge of any material
complaint, allegation, assertion or claim, whether written or oral, regarding
accounting, internal accounting controls or auditing practices, procedures,
methodologies or methods of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company or
any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim from employees of the
Company or any Subsidiary of the Company regarding questionable accounting or
auditing matters with respect to the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company,
and (ii) to the knowledge of the Company, no

  

    


 

  


 

  

attorney representing the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company, whether or
not employed by the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company, has reported

ARTICLE IV 
  
  _REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT AND MERGER SUB_

  


 

  

Except as disclosed in (i) the Parent SEC Documents publicly filed under
Sections 13(a), 14(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act since January 1, 2014 and
prior to the date hereof (excluding any disclosures set forth in any such
Parent SEC Document in any risk factor section, any disclosure in any section
relating to forward-looking statements or any other statements that are
similarly predictive or forward-looking in nature, in each case, other than
any specific factual information contained therein), where the relevance of
the information to a particular representation is readily apparent on the face
of such disclosure or (ii) the disclosure schedule delivered by Parent to the
Company immediately prior to the execution of this Agreement (the " _Parent
Disclosure Schedule_ ") (provided that disclosure in any section of such
Parent Disclosure Schedule shall apply only to the corresponding section of
this Agreement except to the extent that it is readily apparent on the face of
such disclosure that such disclosure applies to another representation),
Parent and Merger Sub jointly and severally represent and warrant to the
Company as follows:

  


 

  

Section 4.1 _Organization; Capitalization_ _._

  


 

  

(a) Parent is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the State of Delaware and has all requisite
corporate power and

its business as presently conducted. Merger Sub is a limited liability company
duly formed, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State
of Delaware and has all requisite corporate power and authority to own, lease
and operate its properties and assets and to carry on its business as
presently conducted. Each of Parent\'s Subsidiaries is a legal entity duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of its
respective jurisdiction of organization (with respect to jurisdictions that
recognize such concept) and has all requisite corporate or similar power and
authority to own, lease and operate its properties and assets and to carry on
its business as presently conducted. Each of Parent and its Subsidiaries is
duly qualified or licensed, and has all necessary governmental approvals, to
do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction (with respect to
jurisdictions that recognize such concept) in which the property owned, leased
or operated by it or the nature of the business conducted by it makes such
approvals, qualification or licensing necessary, except where the failure to
be so duly approved, qualified or licensed and in good standing has not had
and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. Parent\'s bank Subsidiaries,
Comenity Bank and Comenity Capital Bank, are excluded from the definition of
"bank" in Section 2(c) of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (12 U.S.C.
1841(c)), as amended.

  


 

  

(b) Parent has made available to the Company prior to the date of this
Agreement true and complete copies of Parent\'s certificate of incorporation
and bylaws (collectively, the " _Parent Organizational Documents_ "), and
Merger Sub\'s certificate of formation and limited liability company agreement
(collectively, the " _Merger Sub Organizational Documents_ "), in each case,
as amended through the date hereof. The Parent Organizational Documents and
the Merger Sub Organizational Documents are in full force and effect and
neither Parent nor Merger Sub is in violation of any of their respective
provisions in any material respect. _Section 4.1(b)_ of the Parent Disclosure
Schedule sets forth a true and complete list, as of the date hereof, of all
Subsidiaries of Parent. Other than Parent\'s Subsidiaries and consolidated
variable interest entities, as of the date hereof, there is no person whose
financial position, results of operations or cash flows are consolidated in
the financial statements of Parent.

  


 

  

(c) The authorized capital stock of Parent consists of 200,000,000 shares of
common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the " _Parent Common Stock_ "), and
20,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share (the " _Parent
Preferred Stock_ "). As of June 30, 2014, (i) 55,877,640 shares of Parent
Common Stock were issued and outstanding (not including shares held in
treasury), (ii) 45,708,229 shares of Parent Common Stock were held in
treasury, (iii) no shares of Parent Preferred Stock were issued or outstanding

under the Parent Stock Plans, of which amount (A) 195,101 shares of Parent
Common Stock are subject to outstanding options, (B) no shares of Parent

850,280 shares of Parent Common Stock are subject to outstanding time- and

issued in accordance with the respective terms thereof, will be, duly
authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and free of
preemptive rights. Except as set forth in this _Section 4.1(c)_ , as of June
30, 2014, there are no outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants, calls,
convertible securities, exchangeable securities or other similar rights,
agreements or commitments to which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is a
party (A) obligating Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to (1) issue, transfer,
exchange, sell or register for sale any shares of capital stock or other
equity interests of Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent or securities
convertible into or exchangeable for such shares or equity interests, (2)
grant, extend or enter into any such subscription, option, warrant, call,
convertible securities or other similar right, agreement or arrangement
relating to the capital stock or other equity interest of Parent or any
Subsidiary of Parent, (3) redeem or otherwise acquire any such shares of
capital stock or other equity interests of Parent or its Subsidiaries, (4)
provide a material amount of funds to, or make any material investment (in the
form of a loan, capital contribution or otherwise) in, any Subsidiary that is
not a wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent or (5) make any payment to any person
the value of which is derived from or calculated based on the value of Parent
Common Stock or Parent Preferred Stock or (B) granting any preemptive or
antidilutive or similar rights with respect to any security issued by Parent

indebtedness, the holders of which have the right to vote (or which are
convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for securities having the
right to vote) with the stockholders of Parent on any matter. There are no
voting trusts or other agreements or understandings to which Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries is a party with respect to the voting or registration of the
capital stock or other equity interest of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries.

  


 

  

Section 4.2 _Corporate Authority Relative to this Agreement; No Violation_ _._

  


 

  

(a) Each of Parent and Merger Sub has all requisite corporate power and
authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger. The execution,
delivery and performance by Parent and Merger Sub of this Agreement and the
consummation by each of them of the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Merger, have been duly and validly authorized by all necessary
corporate action on the part of Parent and Merger Sub, and no other corporate
action or proceedings on the part of either Parent or Merger Sub, or vote of
Parent\'s or Merger Sub\'s stockholders, is necessary to authorize the
execution and delivery by Parent and Merger Sub of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger.
The Board of Directors of Parent and the Managers have unanimously (i)
determined that this Agreement and the Merger are fair to and in the best
interests of Parent\'s stockholders or Merger Sub, respectively, and (ii)
approved this Agreement and the Merger. This Agreement has been duly and
validly executed and delivered by Parent and Merger Sub and, assuming this
Agreement constitutes the legal, valid and binding agreement of the Company,
this Agreement constitutes the legal, valid and binding agreement of Parent
and Merger Sub and is enforceable against Parent and Merger Sub in accordance
with its terms, except as such enforcement may be subject to the
Enforceability Exceptions.

  


 

  

(b) Other than in connection with or in compliance with (iv) the filing of the
Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware,
(v) the filing of the Form S-4 and the Proxy Statement/Prospectus with the SEC
and any amendments or

  

  

    


 

  


 

  

supplements thereto and declaration of effectiveness of the S-4, (vi) the
Exchange Act, (vii) the Securities Act, (viii) applicable state securities,
takeover and "blue sky" laws, (ix) the HSR Act and any applicable
international antitrust requirements and (x) the approvals set forth in
_Section 4.2(b)_ of the Parent Disclosure Schedule (subclauses (i) through
(vi), the " _Parent Approvals_ "), no authorization, waiver, consent, order,
license, permit or approval of, or registration, declaration, notice or filing
with, any Governmental Entity is necessary, under applicable Law, for the
consummation by Parent or Merger Sub of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, other than such authorizations, waivers, consents, orders,
licenses, permits, approvals, registrations, declarations, notices and filings
the failure of which to obtain or make, as applicable, would not reasonably be
expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect
on Parent.

  


 

  

(c) The execution and delivery by Parent and Merger Sub of this Agreement does
not, and (assuming the Parent Approvals are obtained) the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and compliance with the provisions hereof
will not (xi) except as set forth in this Agreement, result in any loss, or
suspension, limitation or impairment of any right of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries to own or use any assets required for the conduct of their
business or result in any violation of, or default (with or without notice or
lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise to a right of termination,
cancellation, first offer, first refusal, modification or acceleration of any
obligation or to the loss of a benefit under any loan, guarantee of
indebtedness or credit agreement, note, bond, mortgage, indenture, lease,
agreement, Contract, instrument, permit, concession, franchise or right
binding upon Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or by which or to which any of
their respective properties, rights or assets are bound, or result in the
creation of any Liens other than Permitted Liens, in each case, upon any of
the properties or assets of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries except for such
losses, suspensions, limitations, impairments, conflicts, violations,
defaults, terminations, cancellation, accelerations, or Liens as would not
reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have a Material
Adverse Effect on Parent, (xii) conflict with or result in any violation of
any provision of the charter or bylaws or other equivalent organizational
document, of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or (xiii) conflict with or
violate any applicable Laws except as would not reasonably be expected,

Section 4.3 _Reports and Financial Statements_ _._

  


 

  

(a) Parent and each of its Subsidiaries (including each predecessor of any
such Subsidiary prior to it becoming a Subsidiary) has timely filed or
furnished all registrations, statements, schedules, forms, documents, reports
and other documents required to be filed or furnished prior to the date hereof
by it with the SEC since January 1, 2011 (all such documents and reports filed
or furnished by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, the " _Parent SEC
Documents_ ") and has timely paid all fees due in connection therewith. As of
their respective dates or, if amended, as of the date of the last such
amendment (and, in the case of registration statements and proxy statements,
on the dates of effectiveness and the dates of the relevant meetings,
respectively), the Parent SEC Documents complied in all material respects with
the requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act as of the time of filing with the SEC, as the case may be, and the
applicable rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, and none of the
Parent SEC Documents contained any untrue statement of a material fact or
omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
to make the

  

    


 

  


 

  

statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. As of the date of this Agreement, no executive officer of
Parent has failed in any respect to make the certifications required of him or
her under Section 302 or 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. There are no
outstanding or unresolved comments in any comment letters of the staff of the
SEC received by Parent relating to the Parent SEC Documents. None of the
Parent SEC Documents are, to the knowledge of Parent, the subject of ongoing
SEC review.

  


 

  

(b) The consolidated financial statements (including all related notes and
schedules) of Parent included in or incorporated by reference into the Parent
SEC Documents (the " _Parent Financial Statements_ ") (i) fairly present in
all material respects the consolidated financial position of Parent and its
consolidated Subsidiaries, as at the respective dates thereof, and the
consolidated results of their operations and their consolidated cash flows for
the respective periods then ended (subject, in the case of unaudited
statements, to normal and recurring year-end audit adjustments and other
adjustments described therein, including the notes thereto), (ii) were
prepared in conformity with GAAP (except, in the case of the unaudited
statements, subject to normal year-end audit adjustments and the absence of
footnote disclosure) applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved
(except as may be indicated therein or in the notes thereto), and (iii) have
been prepared from, and are in accordance with, the books and records of
Parent and its consolidated subsidiaries. The books and records of the Company
and its Subsidiaries have been, and are being, maintained in all material
respects in accordance with GAAP and any other applicable legal and accounting
requirements. Deloitte and Touche, LLP has not resigned (or informed Parent that
it intends to resign) or been dismissed as independent public accountants of
Parent as a result of or in connection with any disagreements with Parent on a
matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure
or auditing scope or procedure.

  


 

  

(c) Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, nor does it have
any commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet
partnership or any similar Contract (including any Contract relating to any
transaction or relationship between or among Parent or one of its
Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated Affiliate, including any
structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or person, on
the other hand) or any "off-balance sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item
303(a) of Regulation S-K of the SEC).

  


 

  

(d) Parent has established and maintains disclosure controls and procedures
and internal control over financial reporting (as such terms are defined in
paragraphs (e) and (f), respectively, of Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act)
designed to ensure that all material information required to be disclosed by
Parent in the reports that it files or furnishes under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such material information is
accumulated and communicated to Parent\'s management as appropriate to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications
required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Based on
its most recent evaluation of internal controls over financial reporting prior
to the date hereof, management of Parent has disclosed to Parent\'s auditors
and the audit committee of the Board of Directors of Parent (i) any
significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of
internal controls over financial reporting that are reasonably likely to
adversely affect in any material respect Parent\'s ability to report financial
information and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves
management or

  

    


 

  


 

  

other employees who have a significant role in Parent\'s internal control over
financial reporting, and each such deficiency, weakness and fraud so disclosed
to auditors, if any, has been disclosed to Parent prior to the date hereof. To
the knowledge of Parent, there is no reason to believe that Parent\'s outside
auditors and its chief executive officer and chief financial officer will not
be able to give the certifications and attestations required pursuant to the
rules and regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act, without additional qualification, when next due.

  


 

  

(e) Each of Comenity Bank and Comenity Capital Bank has timely filed all call
reports required to be filed by it with each of their respective bank
regulators since January 1, 2011, and since January 1, 2011 has paid all
required bank regulatory fees and assessments (including deposit insurance
assessments) when due.

  


 

  

Section 4.4 _No Undisclosed Liabilities_. There are no Liabilities of Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries of any nature whatsoever (whether accrued,
absolute, determined, contingent or otherwise and whether due or to become
due) that are required to be recorded or reflected on a balance sheet under
GAAP, except for (i) Liabilities that are reflected or reserved against on the
consolidated balance sheet of Parent and its Subsidiaries included in its
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2014
(including any notes thereto), (ii) Liabilities incurred in the ordinary
course of business consistent in type and magnitude with past practice since
June 30, 2014, (iii) Liabilities that have not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect
on Parent, (iv) Liabilities arising or resulting from an existing Contract, or
a Contract entered into in compliance with this Agreement, except to the
extent that such Liabilities arose or resulted from a breach or violation or a
default of such Contract and that would reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Parent, and (v) Liabilities incurred in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  


 

  

Section 4.5 _Compliance with Law; Permits_ _._

  


 

  

(a) Parent and its Subsidiaries are, and since January 1, 2011 have been, in
compliance with all applicable Laws, except as has not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on Parent. Since June 30, 2013, neither Parent nor any of its
Subsidiaries has received any written notice or, to Parent\'s knowledge, other
communication from any Governmental Entity regarding any actual or possible
failure on the part of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to comply with any
material Law applicable to their businesses, operations, properties or assets
in a material respect.

  


 

  

(b) Parent and its Subsidiaries hold all franchises, grants, authorizations,
licenses, permits, easements, variances, exceptions, consents, certificates,
approvals, clearances, permissions, qualifications and registrations and
orders of all applicable Governmental Entities, and have filed all tariffs,
reports, notices and other documents with all Governmental Entities necessary,
in each case, for Parent and its Subsidiaries to own, lease and operate their
properties and assets and to carry on their businesses as they are now being
conducted (the " _Parent Permits_ ") and have paid all fees and assessments
due and payable in connection therewith, in each case except as has not had
and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. All Parent Permits are valid
and in full force

  

  

    


 

  


 

  

and effect, are not subject to any administrative or judicial proceeding that
could result in any modification, termination or revocation thereof, except
where the failure to be valid or in full force and effect would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on Parent. Parent and its Subsidiaries are in compliance with
the terms and requirements of all Parent Permits, and to Parent\'s knowledge
no suspension or cancellation of any such Parent Permit is threatened, in each
case except as would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

  


 

  

(c) Neither Parent nor its Subsidiaries, nor any of their directors, managers,
officers, or to Parent\'s knowledge their employees, agents or any other
person acting for or on behalf of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, directly
or indirectly, (i) violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as
amended, or violated any similar Law; or (ii) made any unlawful bribe,
unlawful kickback or other unlawful payment to any person, private or public,
regardless of form, whether in money, property or services, to obtain
favorable treatment in securing business to obtain special concessions for
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries. Neither Parent nor its Subsidiaries, nor,
any of their directors, officers, or, to Parent\'s knowledge their employees,
agents, or any other person acting for or on behalf of Parent or its
Subsidiaries is the subject of any current, pending or threatened
investigation, inquiry or enforcement proceedings for violations of the
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, or any similar Law in any
country in which Parent or its Subsidiaries does business.

10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013 or the Quarterly Reports on Form

each Contract that would be required to be filed by Parent as a "material
contract" pursuant to Item 601(b)(10) of Regulation S-K (each, a " _Parent
Material Contract_ "). Neither Parent nor any Subsidiary of Parent is in
breach or violation of or default in any material respect under the terms of

to any Parent Material Contract is in breach or violation of or default in any
material respect under the terms of any Parent Material Contract and, to the
knowledge of Parent, no event has occurred or not occurred through Parent\'s

not had and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the

each Parent Material Contract (i) is a valid and binding obligation of Parent
or the Subsidiary of Parent that is party thereto and of each other party
thereto, and (ii) is in full force and effect, subject to the Enforceability
Exceptions. There are no disputes pending or, to Parent\'s knowledge,
threatened with respect to any Parent Material Contract and neither Parent nor
any of its Subsidiaries has received any written notice of the intention of
any other party to a Parent Material Contract to terminate for default,
convenience or otherwise any Parent Material Contract, nor to the Parent\'s

not had and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

the applicable rules of the New York Stock Exchange in order for Parent to
issue shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or
to consummate the Merger.

Parent\'s knowledge, any of its Affiliates has taken or agreed to take action
that would prevent the Merger from qualifying as a reorganization under the
provisions of Section 368(a) of the Code (provided that the Reverse Merger
Condition is not satisfied).

  


 

  

Section 4.16 _No Other Representations_. Except for the representations and
warranties contained in this _Article IV_ or in any certificates delivered by
Parent or Merger Sub in connection with the Closing, the Company acknowledges
that neither Parent, Merger Sub nor any person on behalf of Parent or Merger
Sub makes any other express or implied representation or warranty with respect

Company provided information that remains material non-public information as
of the date hereof in written form to return or destroy all such confidential
information of the Company or its controlled Affiliates in the possession of
such person or its Representatives. The Company shall not, and shall cause its
controlled Affiliates not to, release any third party from, or waive, amend or

standstill provision in any agreement to which the Company or any of its
controlled Affiliates is a party; _provided_ , _however_ , that the parties
agree that the Company may, and may cause its controlled Affiliates to, waive
any "don\'t ask, don\'t waive" provisions in any such agreements, that remain
in effect as of the date hereof, provided that notice of such waiver shall
include notice to such third party that such waiver is conditioned upon any
such third party acknowledging (i) that the Company shall not be prohibited
from providing any information to Parent (including regarding any such Company
Takeover Proposal) in accordance with, and otherwise complying with, this
_Section 5.3_ _and (ii) to the extent applicable, this Agreement and the
transactions provided for hereunder do not trigger any exceptions, including
with regard to any standstill provision, within such third party\'s
agreement_. Except to the extent otherwise permitted by the proviso in the

Affiliates to, use reasonable best efforts, which shall include seeking any
injunctive relief available to enforce the confidentiality and standstill
provisions in any agreement to which the Company or any of its controlled
Affiliates is a party.

Representatives, receives an unsolicited written Company Takeover Proposal
that the Company Board of Directors believes in good faith to be bona fide
from any person that did not result from the Company\'s or its
Representatives\' breach or violation of, or failure to perform this _Section
5.3_ and if the Company Board of Directors determines in good faith, after
consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that such
Company Takeover Proposal constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead
to a Company Superior Proposal and that the failure to take such action would
be inconsistent with the directors\' fiduciary duties under applicable Law,
then the Company and its Representatives may: (A) furnish, pursuant to and in
accordance with an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, information
(including non-public information) with respect to the Company and its
Subsidiaries to the person who has made such Company Takeover Proposal and its
Representatives; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall concurrently
with the delivery to such person provide or make available to Parent any non-
public information concerning the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that is
provided or made available to such person or its Representatives unless such
non-public information has been previously provided to Parent, (B) engage in
or otherwise participate in discussions or negotiations with the person making
such Company Takeover Proposal and its Representatives regarding such Company
Takeover Proposal and (C) grant a waiver or release to any person subject to a
"standstill" agreement with the Company to submit such a Company Takeover
Proposal, _provided_ that such grant of waiver or release shall only allow for
the making of one or more Company Takeover Proposals directly to the Company
Board of Directors without further approval by the Company Board of Directors
and shall not otherwise release such person from any other provision of such
"standstill" agreement. The Company shall promptly (and in any event within
twenty-four hours) notify Parent and Merger Sub if the Company furnishes non-
public information and/or enters into discussions or negotiations as provided
in this _Section 5.3_.

  


 

  

(d) The Company shall promptly (and in no event later than twenty-four hours
after receipt) notify Parent in writing in the event that the Company or any
of its Representatives receives a Company Takeover Proposal or a request for
information relating to the Company or its Subsidiaries that the Company Board
of Directors reasonably determines in good faith could possibly lead to or
that contemplates a Company Takeover Proposal, including the identity of the
person requesting the information or making the Company Takeover Proposal and
the material terms and conditions thereof (including an unredacted copy of
such Company Takeover Proposal or, where such Company Takeover Proposal is not
in writing, a description of the terms thereof). The Company shall provide
Parent a non-redacted copy of each Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement the
Company has executed in accordance with this _Section 5.3_. The Company shall
keep Parent reasonably informed, on a current basis, as to the status of
(including any material developments, discussions or negotiations) such
Company Takeover Proposal (including by promptly (in no event later than
twenty-four hours after receipt) providing to Parent copies of any written
correspondence, proposals, indications of interest, and/or draft agreements
relating to such Company Takeover Proposal). The Company agrees that it and
its Affiliates will not enter into any agreement with any person subsequent to
the date of this Agreement which prohibits the Company from providing any
information to Parent in accordance with, or otherwise complying with, this
_Section 5.3_.

  


 

  

    


 

  


 

  

(e) Except as expressly permitted by this _Section 5.3(e)_ , the Company Board
of Directors shall not (i) (A) change, qualify, withhold, withdraw or modify,
or authorize or publicly propose to change, qualify, withhold, withdraw or
modify, in each case in any manner adverse to Parent, the Company
Recommendation or (B) adopt, approve or recommend to Company stockholders, or
publicly propose to adopt, approve or recommend to the Company stockholders, a
Company Takeover Proposal (any action described in this clause (i) being
referred to as a " _Company Adverse Recommendation Change_ "), or (ii)
authorize, cause or permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter
into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement (including
an acquisition agreement, merger agreement, joint venture agreement or other
agreement), commitment or agreement in principle with respect to any Company
Takeover Proposal (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement entered
into in accordance with _Section 5.3(c)_ ) (a " _Company Acquisition
Agreement_ "). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, prior to the time the Company Stockholder Approval is obtained, but
not after, the Company Board of Directors may make a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change under clause (A) of such definition if and only if, both
(x) in response to an Intervening Event (and not in response to a Company
Takeover Proposal) and (y) prior to taking such action, the Company Board of
Directors has determined in good faith, after consultation with its financial
advisor and outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would
be inconsistent with the Company Board of Directors\' fiduciary duties under
applicable Law; _provided, however_ , that prior to making such Company
Adverse Recommendation Change, (1) the Company has given Parent at least five
Business Days\' prior written notice of its intention to take such action, and
specifying, in reasonable detail, the reasons therefor, (2) the Company has
negotiated, and has caused its Representatives to negotiate, in good faith
with Parent during such notice period, to the extent Parent wishes to
negotiate, to enable Parent to propose revisions to the terms of this
Agreement such that it would permit the Company Board of Directors not to make
a Company Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to this _Section 5.3(e)_ ,
(3) upon the end of such notice period, the Company Board of Directors shall
have considered in good faith any revisions to the terms of this Agreement
proposed in writing by Parent, and shall have determined, after consultation
with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that it would be
inconsistent with the Company Board of Directors\' fiduciary duties not to
make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change under clause (A) of such
definition, and (4) in the event of any change in the circumstances of such
Intervening Event or another Intervening Event occurs, the Company shall, in
each case, have delivered to Parent an additional notice consistent with that
described in clause (1) above of this proviso and a new notice period under
clause (1) of this proviso shall commence (except that the five Business Day
notice period referred to in clause (1) above of this proviso shall instead be
equal to the longer of (i) three Business Days in the case of the first such
additional notice and two Business Days in the case of any subsequent
additional notice; and (ii) the period remaining under the notice period under
clause (1) of this proviso) during which time the Company shall be required to
comply with the requirements of this _Section 5.3(e)_ anew with respect to
such additional notice, including clauses (1) through (4) above of this
proviso. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of any notice described in
this _Section 5.3(e)_ that is provided after 5:00 p.m. Central Time, the
notice period shall begin on the following Business Day.

  


 

  

(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to the time the Company Stockholder
Approval is obtained, but not after, if the Company Board of Directors has
determined in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and
outside legal counsel,

  

    


 

  


 

  

that (i) a bona fide, unsolicited Company Takeover Proposal that did not
result from the Company\'s or its Representatives\' breach or violation of, or
failure to perform this _Section 5.3_ constitutes a Company Superior Proposal
and (ii) the failure to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change, or
terminate this Agreement and enter into a definitive agreement relating to
such Company Superior Proposal, would be inconsistent with the Company Board
of Directors\' fiduciary duties under applicable Law, the Company Board of
Directors may, subject to compliance with this _Section 5.3(f)_ , make a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change or cause the Company to terminate this
Agreement in order to enter into a definitive agreement relating to such
Company Superior Proposal upon (and subject to) paying the Company Termination
Fee in accordance with _Section 7.3_ ; _provided, however_ , that prior to
making such Company Adverse Recommendation Change or so terminating this
Agreement: (A) the Company has given Parent at least five Business Days\'
prior written notice of its intention to take such action, and specifying the
reasons therefor, including the terms and conditions of, and the identity of
the person making, any such Company Superior Proposal and has
contemporaneously provided to Parent a copy of the Company Superior Proposal,
a copy of any proposed Company Acquisition Agreements and a copy of any
financing commitments relating thereto (or, in each case, if not provided in
writing to the Company, a written summary of the terms thereof), (B) the
Company has negotiated, and has caused its Representatives to negotiate, in
good faith with Parent during such notice period, to the extent Parent wishes
to negotiate, to enable Parent to propose revisions to the terms of this
Agreement such that it would cause such Company Takeover Proposal to no longer
constitute a Company Superior Proposal, (C) upon the end of such notice
period, the Company Board of Directors shall have considered in good faith any
revisions to the terms of this Agreement proposed in writing by Parent, and
shall have determined, after consultation with its financial advisor and
outside legal counsel, that such Company Takeover Proposal would nevertheless
continue to constitute a Company Superior Proposal if the revisions proposed
by Parent were to be given effect and that the failure to make a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement and enter into a
definitive agreement relating to such Company Superior Proposal, would be
inconsistent with the directors\' fiduciary duties under applicable Law, and
(D) in the event of any change to any of the financial terms (including the
form, amount and timing of payment of consideration) or any other material
terms of such Company Takeover Proposal, the Company shall, in each case, have
delivered to Parent an additional notice consistent with that described in
clause (A) above of this proviso and a new notice period under clause (A) of
this proviso shall commence (except that the five Business Day notice period
referred to in clause (A) above of this proviso shall instead be equal to the
longer of (i) three Business Days in the case of the first such additional
notice, and two Business Days for any subsequent additional notice; and (ii)
the period remaining under the notice period under clause (A) of this proviso)
during which time the Company shall be required to comply with the
requirements of this _Section 5.3(f)_ anew with respect to such additional
notice, including clauses (A) through (D) above of this proviso.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of any notice described in this
_Section 5.3(f)_ that is provided after 5:00 p.m. Central Time, the notice
period shall begin on the following Business Day. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained herein, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary
shall enter into any Company Acquisition Agreement unless this Agreement has
been terminated in accordance with its terms (including the payment of the
Termination Fee pursuant to _Section 7.3(a)_ , if applicable).

  


 

  

    


 

  


 

  

(g) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.3_ will prohibit the Company from
complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange Act with respect
to a Company Takeover Proposal; provided that (i) any disclosure of a position
contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act other than
a "stop, look and listen" or similar communication of the type contemplated by
Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act (including any factually accurate public
statement by the Company that describes the Company\'s receipt of a Company
Takeover Proposal and the operation of this Agreement with respect thereto),
or a rejection of or recommendation against any applicable Company Takeover
Proposal and a reaffirmation of the Company Recommendation will be deemed to
be a Company Adverse Change Recommendation and (ii) neither the Company or the
Company Board of Directors may effect a Company Adverse Change Recommendation
except in accordance with this _Section 5.3_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, if the provisions of _Section 5.3(e)_ or _Section 5.3(f)_ are
triggered or continuing to be triggered five Business Days before the
scheduled date of the Company\'s Stockholders Meeting by repeated proposals by
Parent to adjust the terms and conditions of this Agreement and repeated
changes to the circumstances of the Intervening Event or repeated adjustments
to the proposals of the third person(s) that triggered the provisions of
_Section 5.3(e)_ or _Section 5.3(f)_ , as the case may be, then the Company
may make a factually accurate public statement by the Company that describes
the status of the process taking place. Upon the reasonable request of Parent,
from time to time, the Company Board of Directors will publicly reaffirm the
Company Recommendation within a reasonable amount of time following such
request in light of the circumstances (but in no event shall the Company be
required to make such reaffirmation less than 3 Business Days after such
request).

  


 

  

Section 5.4 _Filings; Other Actions_ _._

  


 

  

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this
Agreement, Parent and the Company shall jointly prepare and file with the SEC
the Form S-4, which will include the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and will set
forth the Company Recommendation. Each of Parent and the Company shall use
reasonable best efforts to have the Form S-4 declared effective under the
Securities Act as promptly as reasonably practicable after such filing and to
keep the Form S-4 effective as long as necessary to consummate the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated hereby. The Company will cause the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus to be mailed to the Company stockholders as soon as
reasonably practicable after the Form S-4 is declared effective under the
Securities Act, but in no event earlier than the record date set by the
Company. Parent shall also take any action required to be taken under any
applicable state or provincial securities laws in connection with the issuance
and reservation of shares of Parent Common Stock in the Merger, and the
Company shall furnish all information concerning the Company and the holders
of Company Common Stock, or holders of a beneficial interest therein, as may
be reasonably requested in connection with any such action. No filing of, or
amendment or supplement to, the Form S-4 or the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, or
response to SEC comments with respect thereto, will be made by Parent or the
Company, as applicable, without the other\'s prior consent (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) and without providing the other
party a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon. Parent or the
Company, as applicable, will advise the other promptly after it receives oral
or written notice of the time when the Form S-4 has become effective or any
supplement or amendment thereto has been filed, the issuance of any stop
order, the suspension of the qualification of the shares of Parent Common
Stock issuable in connection with the

  

  

    


 

  


 

  

Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or any oral or written
request by the SEC for amendment of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Form
S-4 or comments thereon and responses thereto or requests by the SEC for
additional information, and will promptly provide the other with copies of any
written communication from the SEC or any state securities commission. If at
any time prior to the Effective Time any information relating to Parent or the
Company, or any of their respective Affiliates, officers or directors, is
discovered by Parent or the Company which should be set forth in an amendment
or supplement to any of the Form S-4 or the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, so
that any of such documents would not include a misstatement of a material fact
or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein,
in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the
party that discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties
hereto and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information
shall be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by law,
disseminated to the Company stockholders.

  


 

  

(b) Subject to _Section 5.3(f)_ , the Company shall take all action necessary
in accordance with applicable Laws and the Company Organizational Documents to
set a record date for, duly give notice of, convene and, as soon as reasonably
practicable after the S-4 is declared effective, hold a meeting of its
stockholders for the purpose of obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval
(the " _Company Stockholders\' Meeting_ "). Except as expressly permitted by
_Section 5.3_ , the Company Board of Directors shall not make any Company
Adverse Recommendation Change and shall include its recommendation that the
Company stockholders vote in favor of the Merger in the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus and shall solicit, and use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain, the Company Stockholder Approval at the Company Stockholders\'
Meeting; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not have any
liability to Parent based on a breach or violation of the Company\'s
obligations to use its reasonable best efforts described in the preceding
sentence unless the Company failed to take any actions requested thereunder by
Parent that are within the reasonable best efforts of the Company.

  


 

  

(c) The Company shall cooperate in good faith with and keep Parent informed on
a current basis regarding its solicitation efforts and voting results
following the dissemination of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus to its
stockholders. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, the Company may adjourn or postpone the Company Stockholders\'
Meeting (i) to the extent required by applicable Law, (ii) if as of the time
for which the Company Stockholders\' Meeting is originally scheduled (as set
forth in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus) there are insufficient shares of
Company Common Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute
a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the Company Stockholders\'
Meeting or (iii) with the prior written consent of Parent (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned). In addition, if at any time
following the dissemination of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, either the
Company or Parent reasonably determines in good faith that the Company
Stockholder Approval is unlikely to be obtained at the Company Stockholders\'
Meeting, then prior to the vote contemplated having been taken, each of the
Company and Parent shall have the right to require one adjournment or
postponement of the Company Stockholders\' Meeting; provided that no such
adjournment or postponement shall delay the Company Stockholders\' Meeting by
more than 30 days from the originally scheduled date and provided, further,
that, in the event the Company has given Parent notice that it intends to make
a Company Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to _Section 5.3(e)_ or
_5.3(f)_ or terminate this Agreement and enter into a definitive agreement
relating to a Company Superior Proposal

  

  

    


 

  


 

  

pursuant to _Section 5.3(f)_ , Parent may require an adjournment or
postponement of the Company Stockholders\' meeting without the Company\'s
consent only to the extent that (i) the applicable notice period(s) with
respect to a notice from the Company pursuant to _Section 5.3(e)_ or _5.3(f)_
have not expired or been waived, (ii) Parent has made (or intends to make)
proposed revisions to this Agreement in response to such a notice within the
time period required and (iii) and negotiations pursuant to _Section 5.3(e)_
or _5.3(f)_ are continuing. During any such period of adjournment or
postponement, the Company shall continue in all respects to comply with its
obligations under _Section 5.3_ and this _Section 5.4_.

  


 

  

(d) The Company hereby acknowledges that pursuant to the Company Voting
Agreements, each of the Company stockholders party thereto has irrevocably
granted to and appointed (subject to _Section 4.2_ of the applicable Company
Voting Agreement) Parent and up to two of Parent\'s designated representatives
as such stockholder\'s proxy to vote the Company Common Stock (and other
securities having voting rights) held by such stockholder at the Company
Stockholders\' Meeting or in any action by written consent of the Company
stockholders during the Voting Period (as defined in the applicable Company
Voting Agreement), solely on the matters and in the manner specified in the
Company Voting Agreements (the " _Company Stockholder Proxies_ "). The Company
further agrees that during the Voting Period (as defined in the applicable
Company Voting Agreement), it shall recognize the grant of any such Company
Stockholder Proxy and the exercise thereof by Parent or one of its designated
representatives in accordance with its terms at any meeting of the Company
stockholders (including the Company Stockholders\' Meeting and any adjournment
or postponement thereof) or in any action by written consent of the Company
stockholders, subject to applicable Law.

  


 

  

Section 5.5 _Employee Matters_ _._

  


 

  

(a) Effective as of the Effective Time and until the first anniversary of the
Closing Date, Parent shall provide, or shall cause the Surviving Company to
provide, to employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries who continue to be
employed by Parent or the Surviving Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries following the Effective Time (the " _Company Employees_ "), base
salaries, non-equity incentive compensation opportunities and employee
benefits that are the same or greater than the base salaries, non-equity
incentive compensation opportunities and employee benefits paid or provided to
such Company Employees by the Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the
Effective Time (acknowledging that the fact that an employee has achieved or
been awarded a certain percentage of his or her incentive compensation
opportunity prior to the date hereof does not necessarily mean that such
employee will achieve or be awarded the same percentage of his or her future
incentive compensation opportunities after the Effective Time).

  


 

  

(b) Following the Closing Date, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Company to, cause any employee benefit plans sponsored or maintained by Parent
or the Surviving Company or their Subsidiaries in which the Company Employees
are eligible to participate following the Closing Date (collectively, the "
_Post-Closing Plans_ ") to recognize the service of each Company Employee with
the Company prior to the Closing Date for purposes of eligibility vesting and
benefit accrual under such Post-Closing Plans; _provided_ , that such
recognition of service shall not (i) apply for purposes of any defined benefit
retirement plan or to

  

    


 

  


 

  

plan that provides retiree welfare benefits, (ii) operate to duplicate any
benefits of a Company Employee with respect to the same period of service or
(iii) apply for purposes of any plan, program or arrangement that is frozen,
either with respect to level of benefits or participation. With respect to any
Post-Closing Plan that provides medical, dental or vision insurance benefits,
for the plan year in which such Company Employee is first eligible to
participate, Parent shall (A) cause any pre-existing condition limitations or
eligibility waiting periods under such plan be waived with respect to such
Company Employee to the extent such limitation would have been waived or
satisfied under the Company Benefit Plan in which such Company Employee
participated immediately prior to the Effective Time and (B) credit each
Company Employee for an amount equal to any medical, dental or vision expenses
incurred by such Company Employee in the Post-Closing Plan year that includes
the Closing Date (or, if later, the year in which such Covered Employee is
first eligible to participate in such Post-Closing Plan) for purposes of any
applicable deductible and annual out-of-pocket expense requirements under any
such Post-Closing Plan. Such credited expenses shall also count toward any
annual or lifetime limits, treatment or visit limits or similar limitations
that apply under the terms of the applicable plan.

  


 

  

(c) Except as otherwise specifically provided in any separate letter between
Parent and the Company\'s Chief Executive Officer, from and after the date of
this Agreement, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Company to, honor
all accrued rights and vested benefits under the Company Benefit Plans in
accordance with their terms as in effect immediately before the Effective Time
and applicable Law as such agreements and arrangements may be modified or
terminated in accordance with their terms from time to time.

  


 

  

(d) Parent and the Company agree to cooperate to establish a Parent equity
participation program, to be maintained by Parent or the Surviving Company, by
the 30th day following the public announcement of this Agreement, under which
Company Employees may be eligible for Parent Common Stock-based awards on
after the Closing Date; _provided_ , however, that such equity participation
program shall be subject to approval by Parent Stockholders to the extent
required by applicable Law or the applicable rules of any stock exchange and
appropriate registration of the Parent Common Stock issuable under such equity
participation program.

  


 

  

(e) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall adopt resolutions to
terminate, or cause to be terminated, as of a date prior to the Closing Date,
the Conversant, Inc. 401(k) Plan (the " _Company 401(k) Plan_ ") and shall
make whatever amendments to the Company 401(k) Plan that are necessary to
effectuate the termination, to provide for distributions, and to reflect any
changes to applicable Laws. Prior to the Closing the Company shall make all
matching and profit sharing contributions under the Company 401(k) Plan as may
be required for the plan year, and shall allocate such contributions to all
participant accounts without regard to any hours of service requirement under
the Company 401(k) Plan or any requirement that participants be employed on
the last day of the plan year.

  


 

  

(f) Parent agrees to take such actions as may be required to enable
participants in the Company 401(k) Plan who continue employment with Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Company) after the Effective
Time to participate in and roll over their benefits under the Company 401(k)
Plan (including any outstanding participant loans) to a 401(k) plan sponsored
by Parent or its Subsidiaries, provided that the plan

  

    


 

  


 

  

administrator of such plan determines to its satisfaction that such rollover
is a valid rollover contribution in accordance with Revenue Ruling 2014-9.
Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any Company Employee or other
service provider any right to continue in the employ or service of Parent, the
Surviving Company or any Affiliate of Parent, or shall interfere with or
restrict in any way the rights of Parent, the Surviving Company or any of
their Affiliates, which rights are hereby expressly reserved, to discharge or
terminate the services of any Company Employee at any time for any reason
whatsoever, with or without cause. In no event shall the terms of this
Agreement be deemed to (i) establish, amend, or modify any Company Benefit
Plan or any " _employee benefit plan_ " as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA,
or any other benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement maintained or
sponsored by Parent, Surviving Company, the Company or any of their
Subsidiaries (including, after the Closing Date, Company and its Subsidiaries)
or Affiliates; or (ii) alter or limit the ability of Parent, the Surviving
Company or any of their Subsidiaries (including, after the Closing Date,
Company and its Subsidiaries) or Affiliates to amend, modify or terminate any
Company Benefit Plan or any other compensation or benefit or employment plan,
program, agreement or arrangement after the Closing Date. Notwithstanding any
provision in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing in this _Section 5.5_
shall create any third party beneficiary rights in any Company Employee or
current or former service provider of the Company or its Affiliates (or any
beneficiaries or dependents thereof).

  


 

  

Section 5.6 _Regulatory Approvals; Efforts_ _._

  


 

  

(a) Prior to the Closing, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall use their
respective reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
reasonable actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all reasonable things
necessary, proper or advisable under any applicable Laws to consummate and
make effective the Merger including (i) the preparation and filing of all
forms, registrations and notices required to be filed to consummate the
Merger, (ii) the satisfaction of the conditions to consummating the Merger,
(iii) taking all reasonable actions necessary to obtain (and cooperating with
each other in obtaining) any consent, authorization, Order or approval of, or
any exemption by, any third party, including any Governmental Entity (which
actions shall include furnishing all information and documentary material
required under the HSR Act or applicable international antitrust laws)
required to be obtained or made by Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any of
their respective Subsidiaries in connection with the Merger or the taking of
any action contemplated by this Agreement, (iv) defending and seeking to
prevent the initiation of all actions, suits and other proceedings by or
before any Governmental Entity challenging this Agreement or the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby, and causing to be lifted or rescinded
any Order or other action by any Governmental Entity adversely affecting the
ability of the parties to consummate the Merger and (v) the execution and
delivery of any reasonable additional instruments necessary to consummate the
Merger and to fully carry out the purposes of this Agreement. Additionally,
each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall use reasonable best efforts
to fulfill all conditions precedent to the Merger and shall not take any
action after the date of this Agreement that would reasonably be expected to
materially delay the obtaining of, or result in not obtaining, any permission,
approval or consent from any such Governmental Entity necessary to be obtained
prior to Closing. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, nothing in this
Agreement shall cause or require Parent, whether by consent decree, hold
separate order or otherwise, to sell, divest or dispose of any businesses,
assets,

  

    


 

  


 

  

relationships or contractual rights of Parent or of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, or to limit its freedom of action with respect to, or its
ability to retain, any businesses, assets, relationships or contractual rights
of Parent or of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (or to agree to do the
foregoing). Without the prior written consent of Parent, the Company shall not
agree or commit to, or permit any of its Subsidiaries to agree or commit to,
payment of any material fee, penalty or other consideration or make any other
material concession, waiver or amendment under any Contract in connection with
obtaining consent under any Contract in connection with obtaining any consent
and, if such prior written consent of Parent is not provided, the failure by
the Company to take any such action shall not otherwise constitute a breach of
this _Section 5.6(a)_.

  


 

  

(b) Parent and the Company shall each keep the other apprised of the status of
matters relating to the completion of the Merger and work cooperatively in
connection with obtaining all required consents, authorizations, Orders or
approvals of, or any exemptions by, any Governmental Entity undertaken
pursuant to the provisions of this _Section 5.6_. In that regard, prior to the
Closing, each party shall promptly consult with the other parties to this
Agreement with respect to and provide any necessary information and assistance
as the other parties may reasonably request with respect to (and, in the case
of correspondence, provide the other parties (or their counsel) copies of) all
notices, submissions, or filings made by such party with any Governmental
Entity or any other information supplied by such party to, or correspondence
with, a Governmental Entity in connection with this Agreement and the Merger.
Each party to this Agreement shall promptly inform the other parties to this
Agreement, and if in writing, furnish the other parties with copies of (or, in
the case of oral communications, advise the other parties orally of) any
communication from or to any Governmental Entity regarding the Merger, and
permit the other parties to review and discuss in advance, and consider in
good faith the views of the other parties in connection with, any proposed
communication with any such Governmental Entity. If any party to this
Agreement or any Representative of such parties receives a request for
additional information or documentary material from any Governmental Entity
with respect to the Merger, then such party will use reasonable best efforts
to make, or cause to be made, promptly and after consultation with the other
parties to this Agreement, an appropriate response in substantial compliance
with such request. No party shall participate in any meeting or teleconference
with any Governmental Entity where material issues or any matters relating to
timing would likely be discussed in connection with this Agreement and the
Merger unless it consults with the other party in advance and, to the extent
not prohibited by such Governmental Entity, gives the other party the
opportunity to attend and participate thereat. In addition, without the prior
written consent of Parent, the Company shall not agree or commit to, or permit
any of its Subsidiaries to agree or commit to, any commitment to sell, divest
or dispose of any businesses, assets, relationships or contractual rights of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or purporting to limit the Company\'s,
any of its Subsidiaries\' or Parent\'s freedom to action with respect to, or
ability to retain, any businesses, assets, relationships or contractual
rights. Without limiting the foregoing, unless prohibited by Law or the
applicable Governmental Entity, each party shall, on a current basis, furnish
the other parties with copies of all correspondence, filings and
communications (and memoranda setting forth the substance thereof) between it
and any such Governmental Entity with respect to this Agreement and the

Section 5.9 _Indemnification and Insurance_ _._

  


 

  

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Company shall
indemnify and hold harmless each present and former director and officer of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (in each case, when acting in such
capacity) (collectively, together with their respective heirs, executors and
administrators, the " _Company Directors and Officers_ ") against any costs or
expenses (including reasonable attorneys\' fees), judgments, fines, losses,
damages, amounts paid in settlement or other Liabilities incurred in
connection with any actual or threatened claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (an "
_Indemnified Action_ "), arising out of the fact that such person is or was a
director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (or, at the
request or for the benefit of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, of any
other person) at any time at or before the Effective Time, whether pertaining
to matters existing or occurring or actions or omissions taken (or alleged to
have existed, occurred or been taken) at or after the Effective Time,
including the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, in each case to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, and Parent and the Surviving
Company shall also advance expenses to the Company Directors and Officers in
connection with any and all such Indemnified Actions as incurred to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law; _provided_ , that each of the
Company Directors and Officers to whom expenses are advanced provides an
undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined by a final
and nonappealable judicial determination that such Company Directors and
Officers are not entitled to indemnification under this _Section 5.9(a)_ or
otherwise.

 

  


 

  

(b) Parent agrees and shall cause the Surviving Company to agree, and the
Company agrees, that all rights to indemnification, exculpation and
advancement of expenses now existing in favor of any Company Directors and
Officers or any current or former employee of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (together with their heirs, executors and administrators, and the
Company Directors and Officers, the " _Company Indemnified Parties_ ") as
provided in the Company Organizational Documents (or the Company Subsidiary
Organizational Documents) or any indemnification agreements in existence as of
the date hereof (i) with any Company Directors and Officers or (ii) set forth
on _Section 5.9(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, shall survive the
Merger and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their
terms. For a period of six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause
the Surviving Company to agree, and the Company agrees, to maintain in effect
the indemnification, exculpation and advancement of expenses provisions of the
Company Organizational Documents (and the Company Subsidiary Organizational
Documents) now in effect and any such indemnification agreements of the
Company or its Subsidiaries with the Company Indemnified Parties and not to
amend, repeal or otherwise modify such provisions in any manner that would
adversely affect the rights thereunder of such Company Indemnified Parties,
and all such rights in respect of any action, suit, proceeding or
investigation pending or asserted or claim made or threatened within such
period shall continue until the final disposition or resolution thereof.

  


 

  

(c) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, the Surviving Company
shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to, cause to be maintained
in effect the current policies of directors\' and officers\' liability
insurance maintained by the Company (provided, that the Surviving Company may
substitute therefor policies with a substantially comparable insurer of at
least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions

  

    


 

  


 

  

which are no less advantageous to the insured) with respect to claims arising
from facts or events, or actions or omissions, which occurred or are alleged
to have occurred at or before the Effective Time; _provided, however_ , that
the Surviving Company shall not be obligated to make annual premium payments
in respect of any one policy year for such insurance to the extent such
premiums exceed 250% of the annual premiums paid as of the date hereof by the
Company for such insurance (the " _Premium Cap_ "), and if such premiums for
such insurance would at any time exceed the Premium Cap, then the Surviving
Company shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to, cause to be
maintained policies of insurance which, in the Surviving Company\'s good faith
determination, provide the maximum coverage available at an annual premium
equal to the Premium Cap. In lieu of the foregoing, Parent, or the Company
after prior consultation with Parent, may obtain at or prior to the Effective
Time a six-year prepaid " _tail_ " policy under the Company\'s existing
directors\' and officers\' insurance policy providing coverage no greater than
the current policies of directors\' and officers\' liability insurance
maintained by the Company; _provided_ , that the Company shall not purchase
such prepaid " _tail_ " policy for a total cost in excess of 250% of the then
current annual premium paid by the Company for such insurance (the " _Tail
Cap_ ") without the prior written consent of Parent; provided further that if
the total cost for such prepaid " _tail_ " policy exceeds the Tail Cap, then
Parent or the Company, after prior consultation with Parent, may obtain a
prepaid " _tail_ " policy with the maximum coverage available for a total cost
not to exceed the Tail Cap.

  


 

  

(d) The rights of each Company Indemnified Party hereunder shall be in
addition to, and not in limitation of, any other rights such Company
Indemnified Party may have under the Company Organizational Documents (or
Company Subsidiary Organizational Documents), any other Contract, any Law or
otherwise. The provisions of this _Section 5.9_ shall survive the Effective
Time and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, are
intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Company
Indemnified Party and his or her representatives.

  


 

  

(e) In the event that Parent, the Surviving Company or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any person, then, and in either such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent and the
Surviving Company, as the case may be, shall assume all of the obligations set
forth in this _Section 5.9_. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall
be construed to or shall release, waive or impair any rights to directors\'
and officers\' insurance claims under any policy that is or has been in
existence with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or their
respective officers, directors and employees, and this _Section 5.9_ is not
prior to, or in substitution for, any such claims under any such policies.

rights or obligations under this Agreement, the parties understand and agree
that (a) nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Parent or the Company,
directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the other party\'s
operations prior to the Effective Time and (b) prior to the Effective Time,

fact, change, event or circumstance that has had or is reasonably likely to

Merger Sub) or _Section 6.3(a)_ , _Section 6.3(b)_ or _Section 6.3(c)_ (in the
case of the Company); _provided_ , that any failure to give notice in
accordance with the foregoing shall not be deemed to constitute the failure of
any condition set forth in _Section 6.2_ or _Section 6.3_ to be satisfied, or
otherwise constitute a breach or violation of this Agreement by the party
failing to give such notice, in each case unless the underlying breach or
violation would independently result in a failure of the conditions set forth
in _Section 6.2_ or _Section 6.3_ to be satisfied.

likelihood that the failure to obtain such consent would have a material
impact on the timing of the consummation of the Merger or on the Company, the
Surviving Company or Parent or (ii) upon receiving any written communication
from any Governmental Entity whose consent or approval is required for the
satisfaction of one of the conditions to Closing set forth in _Article VI_

any such consent or approval will not be obtained or that the receipt of any
such consent or approval will be materially delayed. The Company shall
promptly notify Parent of any written notice or other written communication

7.1(d)_ or _Section 7.1(f)_ and (C) either (1) at any time on or prior to the
twelve month anniversary

  

  

    


 

  

of such termination, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries enters into a
definitive agreement with respect to any transaction that constitutes a
Company Takeover Proposal (a " _Company Takeover Transaction_ ") or (2) at any
time on or prior to the twelve month anniversary of such termination, the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries consummates a Company Takeover Transaction
(in the case of both clauses (1) and (2), whether or not involving the same
Company Takeover Proposal as that which was the subject of the Pre-Termination
Takeover Proposal Event), the Company shall pay Parent the Termination Fee by
wire transfer (to an account designated by Parent) in immediately available
funds immediately upon (and not later than the same day as) the earlier of
entry into a definitive agreement or consummation of such Company Takeover
Transaction; _provided_ , that for the purposes of clause (C) only, all
references in the definition of Company Takeover Proposal to "15%" shall
instead be references to "50%."

  

(b) For purposes of this _Section 7.3_ , a " _Pre-Termination Takeover
Proposal Event_ " shall be deemed to occur if a Company Takeover Proposal (i)
shall have been made known to the Company Board of Directors or senior
management (and if in the case of a termination pursuant to _Section 7.1(d)_ ,
if such Company Takeover Proposal shall have become public), (ii) shall have
been made directly to the Company stockholders generally or (iii) any bona
fide acquiror (or Representative thereof acting on behalf of a bona fide
acquiror) shall have publicly announced a Company Takeover Proposal (including
an intent to make a Company Takeover Proposal), and in any such case such
Company Takeover Proposal shall not have been withdrawn prior to the event
giving rise to such termination (or in the case of a termination pursuant to
_Section 7.1(d)_ , at least five Business Days prior to the Company
Stockholders\' Meeting) (it being understood, for the avoidance of doubt, that
a person shall be a bona fide acquiror if it possesses or could reasonably be
believed to have access to the resources necessary to consummate such Company
Takeover Proposal).

  


 

  

(c) " _Termination Fee_ " shall mean a cash amount equal to $65,000,000.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if the Termination
Fee shall become due and payable in accordance with this _Section 7.3_ , from
and after such termination and payment of the Termination Fee in full pursuant
to and in accordance with this _Section 7.3_ , the Termination Fee shall be
the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent and Merger Sub and the Company shall
have no further Liability of any kind for any reason in connection with this
Agreement or the termination contemplated hereby other than as provided under
this _Section 7.3_. Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that the
Termination Fee is not intended to be a penalty, but rather is liquidated
damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent in the
circumstances in which such Termination Fee is due and payable for the efforts
and resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this
Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, which amount would
otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision. In no event shall Parent
be entitled to payment of the Termination Fee on more than one occasion. In
the event that the Company shall previously have been found to have Liability
under this Agreement for fraud or a Knowing and Material Breach, in the event
that the Termination Fee subsequently becomes due pursuant to this _Section
7.3_ , any prior payment made by the Company to Parent pursuant to any such
Liability shall be deducted from the Termination Fee.

  

  

  

    

 


 

  

(d) Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges that the
agreements contained in this _Section 7.3_ are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated hereby, and that, without these agreements, the
Company, Parent and Merger Sub would not enter into this Agreement.
Accordingly, if the Company fails to pay in a timely manner any amount due
pursuant to this _Section 7.3_ , then (i) the Company shall reimburse Parent
for reasonable costs and expenses (including disbursements and reasonable fees
of counsel) incurred in the collection of such overdue amount, including in
connection with any related claims, actions or proceedings commenced and (ii)
the Company shall pay to Parent interest on such amount from and including the
date payment of such amount was due to but excluding the date of actual
payment at the prime rate set forth in The Wall Street Journal in effect on
the date such payment was required to be made plus 2%.

The parties to this Agreement agree that irreparable damage would occur in the
event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed, or were
threatened to be not performed, in accordance with their specific terms or
were otherwise breached or violated, and that money damages would not be an
adequate remedy, even if available. It is accordingly agreed that, in addition
to any other remedy that may be available to it, including monetary damages,
each of the parties to this Agreement shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches or violations or threatened breaches or
violations of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement exclusively in the Delaware Court of Chancery and
any state appellate court

  therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, if the Delaware Court of
Chancery declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state
or federal court within the State of Delaware) (in addition to any and all
other rights and remedies at law or in equity, and all such rights and
remedies shall be cumulative, except, in each case, as may be limited by
_Section 7.3_ ). In the event any party to this Agreement seeks any remedy
referred to in this _Section 8.5_ , such party shall not be required to prove
damages or obtain, furnish, provide or post any bond or similar instrument in
connection with or as a condition to obtaining any remedy referred to in this
_Section 8.5_ and each party waives any objection to the imposition of such
relief or any right it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing,
providing or posting of any such bond or similar instrument. In addition, each
of the parties to this Agreement irrevocably agrees that any legal action or
proceeding with respect to this Agreement and the rights and obligations
arising hereunder, or for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in
respect of this Agreement and the rights and obligations arising hereunder
brought by the other party hereto or its successors or assigns, shall be
brought and determined exclusively in the Delaware Court of Chancery and any
state appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, if the
Delaware Court of Chancery declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular
matter, any state or federal court within the State of Delaware). Each of the
parties to this Agreement hereby irrevocably submits with regard to any such
action or proceeding for itself and in respect of its property, generally and
unconditionally, to the personal jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts and
agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this Agreement or any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any court other than the
aforesaid courts. Each of the parties to this Agreement hereby irrevocably
waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as a defense, counterclaim
or otherwise, in any action or proceeding with respect to this Agreement, (a)
any claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the above
named courts, (b) any claim that it or its property is exempt or immune from
jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process commenced in such
courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment,
attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment or
otherwise) and (c) to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any
claim that (i) the suit, action or proceeding in such court is brought in an
inconvenient forum, (ii) the venue of such suit, action or proceeding is
improper or (iii) this Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may not be
enforced in or by such courts. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable
Law, each of the parties to this Agreement hereby consents to the service of
