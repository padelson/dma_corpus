which shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become effective when each of the
parties has delivered a signed counterpart to the other parties, it being understood that all
parties need not sign the same counterpart. Such counterpart executions may be transmitted to the

constitutes the entire agreement and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both
written and oral, between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, other than the
Confidentiality Agreement, which shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and
shall terminate in accordance with its terms, and (b)&nbsp;is not intended to confer upon any person
other than the parties any rights or remedies hereunder, except (i)&nbsp;for the rights of the holders

validity, interpretation and effect, by the Laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to
its principles or rules of conflict of laws; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that the
Amalgamation shall also be governed by the applicable provisions of the Companies Act to the extent
required thereby.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9.7 <U>Severability</U>. Any term or provision of this Agreement which is invalid or
unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of
such invalidity or unenforceability and, unless the effect of such invalidity or unenforceability
would prevent the parties from realizing the major portion of the economic benefits of the
Amalgamation that they currently anticipate obtaining therefrom, shall not render invalid or
unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this Agreement or affect the validity or
enforceability of any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement in any other jurisdiction. If
any provision of this Agreement is so broad as to be unenforceable, the provision shall be
interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9.8 <U>Assignment</U>. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations of the parties hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties (whether by operation
of Law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other parties, which may be granted
or withheld in the sole discretion of the other parties. Any attempt to make any such assignment
without such consent shall be null and void. Subject to the preceding two (2)&nbsp;sentences, this
Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties and their
respective successors and permitted assigns.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9.9 <U>Enforcement</U>. The parties agree that money damages would be both incalculable and
an insufficient remedy and that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the
provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms on a timely
basis or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that, subject to the discretion of the
Chosen Court, the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or other equitable relief to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this

matters presented in connection with the Amalgamation by the shareholders of Genesis, but, after
any such approval, no amendment shall be made which by Law requires further approval by such
shareholders without such further approval. This Agreement may not be amended except by an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties by their duly authorized
representatives.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9.12 <U>Extension; Waiver</U>. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties may, to
the extent legally allowed, (i)&nbsp;extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or
other acts of the other party, (ii)&nbsp;waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties
contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (iii)&nbsp;waive compliance with any
of the agreements or conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a party to any such
extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of
such party. The failure of a party to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise
shall not constitute a waiver of those rights. No single or partial exercise of any right, remedy,
power or privilege hereunder shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise
of any other right, remedy, power or privilege. Any waiver shall be effective only in the specific
instance and for the specific purpose for which given and shall not constitute a waiver to any
subsequent or other exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder.
