ARTICLE I 

   

THE AMALGAMATION  

  

 1.1 _The Amalgamation; Effective Time_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement and the amalgamation agreement attached as _Exhibit A_ (the " _Amalgamation Agreement_ "), AerCap, Amalgamation Sub and Genesis will cause (i) the Amalgamation Agreement to be executed and delivered and (ii) an application for registration of an amalgamated company (the " _Amalgamation Application_ ") to be prepared, executed and delivered to the Registrar of Companies in Bermuda (the " _Registrar_ ") as provided under Section 108 of the Companies Act on or prior to the Closing Date and will cause the Amalgamation to become effective pursuant to the Companies Act on the Closing Date. The Amalgamation shall become effective upon the issuance of a certificate of amalgamation by the Registrar (the " _Certificate of Amalgamation_ ") or such other time as the Certificate of Amalgamation may provide. The parties agree that they will request the Registrar to provide in the Certificate of Amalgamation that the effective time will be the time when the Amalgamation Application is filed with the Registrar (or where the Amalgamation Application is filed with the Registrar prior to the Closing Date, the time designated as the effective time in the Amalgamation Application), or another time mutually agreed by the parties (the " _Effective Time_ "). 

  

 1.2 _Closing_. The closing of the Amalgamation (the " _Closing_ ") will take place at 10:00 a.m. (New York City time) on the date (the " _Closing Date_ ") that is the second business day after the satisfaction or waiver (if such waiver is permitted and effective under applicable Law) of the latest to be satisfied or waived of the conditions set forth in _ARTICLE VII_ (excluding conditions that, by their terms, are to be satisfied on the Closing Date), unless another time or date is agreed to in writing by the parties. The Closing shall be held at the offices of Milbank, Tweed, Hadley and McCloy LLP located at One Chase Manhattan Plaza, New York, NY, 10005, unless another place is agreed to in writing by the parties. 

  

 1.3 _Effects of the Amalgamation_. As of the Effective Time, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Amalgamation Agreement, Genesis shall be amalgamated with Amalgamation Sub and the amalgamated company (the " _Amalgamated Company_ ") shall continue after the Amalgamation. The parties acknowledge and agree that for purposes of Bermuda Law (a) the Amalgamation shall be effected so as to constitute an "amalgamation" and (b) the Amalgamated Company shall be deemed to be an "amalgamated company" in accordance with Section 104 of the Companies Act. Under Section 109 of the Companies Act, from and after the Effective Time: (i) the Amalgamation of Genesis and Amalgamation Sub and their continuance as one company shall become effective; (ii) the property of each of Genesis and Amalgamation Sub shall become the property of the Amalgamated Company; (iii) the Amalgamated Company shall continue to be liable for the obligations and liabilities of each of 

   ##### 

  

    

Genesis and Amalgamation Sub; (iv) any existing cause of action, claim or
liability to prosecution shall be unaffected; (v) a civil, criminal or
administrative action or proceeding pending by or against Genesis or
Amalgamation Sub may be continued to be prosecuted by or against the
Amalgamated Company; and (vi) a conviction against, or ruling, order or
judgment in favor of or against, Genesis or Amalgamation Sub may be enforced
by or against the Amalgamated Company. 

  

 1.4 _Amalgamated Company Memorandum of Association and Bye-laws_. Subject to  _Section 6.7_, the memorandum of association of Amalgamation Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the memorandum of association of the Amalgamated Company, until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law.

 1.5 _Directors and Officers of the Amalgamated Company_. 

  

 (a) The parties hereto shall take all actions necessary so that the board of directors of Amalgamation Sub at the Effective Time shall, from and after the Effective Time, be the directors of the Amalgamated Company until the earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed. 

   

 (b) The parties hereto shall take all actions necessary so that the officers of Amalgamation Sub at the Effective Time shall, from and after the Effective Time, be the officers of the Amalgamated Company until the earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed. 

   

 1.6 _Amalgamated Company Name_. Genesis and AerCap shall take all actions reasonably necessary so that immediately after the Effective Time the name of the Amalgamated Company shall be "AerCap International Bermuda Limited." 

  

ARTICLE II 

   

CONVERSION OF GENESIS SECURITIES; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES  

  

 2.1 _Effect on Share Capital_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Amalgamation and without any action on the part of the holder of any common shares in Genesis, each having a par value of $0.001 (each, a " _Genesis Common Share_ "), which Genesis Common Shares have been issued in the form of American Depositary Shares (each, an " _ADS_ "), with each ADS representing one Genesis Common Share and either evidenced by physical certificated American Depositary Receipts (each, an " _ADR_ " and each such certificate shall hereinafter be referred to as a " _Genesis Certificate_ ") or issued in uncertificated form through book-entry or other registration system: 

  

 (a) _Conversion of Genesis Common Shares_. Each Genesis Common Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Dissenting Shares) shall be cancelled and converted into the right to receive one (1) (the " _Exchange Ratio_ ") ordinary share in AerCap, each having a par value of 0.01 (the " _Amalgamation Consideration_ "), 

   ##### 

  

   

subject in the case of Genesis Restricted Shares, to _Section 2.3(b)_. Each
ordinary share in AerCap, having a par value of 0.01 per share, hereinafter
is referred to as an " _AerCap Common Share_." Upon such conversion, each
holder of Genesis Common Shares immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
thereafter cease to have any rights with respect to such shares except the
right to receive the Amalgamation Consideration. The
Amalgamation Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect fully
the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including
any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into AerCap Common
Shares or Genesis Common Shares), reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification or other like change with respect to
AerCap Common Shares or Genesis Common Shares having a record date on or
after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time. 

   

 (b) _Cancellation of AerCap-Owned Securities_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, all Genesis Common Shares that are owned by AerCap or by any wholly-owned subsidiary of AerCap immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Amalgamation, and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, automatically be cancelled and retired without any conversion thereof and shall cease to exist, and no payment shall be made in respect thereof. 

   

 (c) _Shares of Dissenting Shareholders_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any issued and outstanding Genesis Common Shares held by a person who did not vote in favor of the Amalgamation and who complies with all the provisions of the Companies Act concerning the right of holders of Genesis Common Shares to require appraisal of their Genesis Common Shares pursuant to Bermuda Law (any such shareholder, a " _Dissenting Shareholder_ ," and such Genesis Common Shares, " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the right to receive the Amalgamation Consideration as described in _Section 2.1(a)_, but shall be cancelled and converted into the right to receive the fair value thereof, as appraised by the Supreme Court of Bermuda under Section 106 of the Companies Act. In the event that a Dissenting Shareholder fails to perfect, effectively withdraws or otherwise waives any right to appraisal, its Genesis Common Shares shall be cancelled and converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Amalgamation Consideration for each such Dissenting Share. Genesis shall give AerCap (i) prompt notice of (A) any written demands for appraisal of Dissenting Shares or withdrawals of such demands received by Genesis and (B) to the extent that Genesis has actual knowledge, any applications to the Supreme Court of Bermuda for appraisal of the fair value of the Dissenting Shares, and (ii) the opportunity to participate with Genesis in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any demands for appraisal under the Companies Act. Neither Genesis nor AerCap shall, without the prior written consent of the other party (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle, offer to settle or otherwise negotiate, any such demands. 

   

 2.2 _Exchange Procedures_. 

  

 (a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Genesis shall designate an exchange agent (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") for the purpose of exchanging ADSs outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time for the Amalgamation Consideration. Prior to or at the Effective Time, AerCap shall take all actions reasonably necessary (including proper registration of the AerCap Common Shares to be issued in connection with the Amalgamation in accordance with Netherlands Law) to facilitate the exchange by the Exchange Agent of the ADSs for 

   ##### 

  

   

AerCap Common Shares in connection with the Amalgamation, and deposit or cause
to be deposited any dividends or distributions to which the shareholders of
Genesis may be entitled pursuant to  _Section 2.2(c)_. Such Amalgamation
Consideration to be exchanged by the Exchange Agent for ADSs and dividends or
distributions, if any, so deposited are hereinafter referred to as the "
_Exchange Fund_." No interest shall be paid or accrued for the benefit of
holders of ADSs on cash amounts, if any, payable upon the surrender of such
shares pursuant to this _Section 2.2_. 

   

 (b) _Exchange Procedures_. As promptly as practicable following the Effective Time, AerCap or the Amalgamated Company shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each ADS holder, (i) an ADS letter of transmittal (which shall be in such form and have such other provisions as the parties may reasonably specify prior to the Closing Date) and (ii) where applicable, instructions for use in effecting the surrender of ADSs in exchange for the Amalgamation Consideration. After the Effective Time, upon surrender of the ADSs previously held by an ADS holder in accordance with this _Section 2.2_, together with such ADS letter of transmittal duly executed (or, in the case of persons participating in The Depositary Trust Company (" _DTC_ "), in accordance with DTCs procedures), and such other documents as the Exchange Agent may reasonably require, a holder of ADSs shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a certificate or book-entry representing that number of whole AerCap Common Shares, and any ADS surrendered in respect thereof shall forthwith be marked as cancelled. In the event of a surrender of ADSs that is not registered in the applicable records of the Depositary, a certificate or book-entry representing the proper number of AerCap Common Shares may be issued to a transferee if the ADS is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid. 

   

 (c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares and ADSs_. No dividends or other distributions declared or made with respect to AerCap Common Shares with a record date on or after the Effective Time shall be paid to any shareholder of Genesis holding any unsurrendered ADSs with respect to the AerCap Common Shares represented thereby, until such shareholder shall surrender such ADSs in accordance with the procedures set forth in this _ARTICLE II_. Following the surrender of any such ADSs in accordance with the procedures set forth in this _ARTICLE II_ , such shareholder shall be entitled to receive, in addition to the consideration set forth in  _Section 2.1(a)_, without interest, (i) at the time of such surrender, the amount of any dividends or other distributions with a record date on or after the Effective Time theretofore paid (but withheld pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence) with respect to such whole AerCap Common Shares which a shareholder of Genesis holding Genesis Common Shares is entitled to receive hereunder, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to surrender and a payment date subsequent to surrender payable with respect to such whole AerCap Common Shares which such shareholder is entitled to receive hereunder. 

   

 (d) _No Further Rights in Genesis Common Shares_. All Amalgamation Consideration paid or issued upon the surrender of title to ADSs in accordance with the terms of this _ARTICLE II_ (including any cash paid pursuant to this _ARTICLE II_ ) shall be deemed to have been issued (and paid) in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shareholders of Genesis, in their capacity as shareholders of Genesis prior to the Effective Time. There shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Amalgamated Company of the ADSs 

   ##### 

  

   

which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, ADSs are presented to AerCap or to the Amalgamated Company or
to the Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be marked as cancelled and
exchanged in accordance with this _ARTICLE II_ , except as otherwise required
by Law. 

   

 (e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Genesis Certificates_. In the event any Genesis Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, AerCap and Genesis shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the Depositary to take such actions as are necessary or appropriate pursuant to the terms of Section 2.8 of the Deposit Agreement (whether the agreement is still in force or not) in respect of such lost, stolen or destroyed Genesis Certificates. 

   

 (f) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Unless a longer period is prescribed by applicable Law or AerCaps agreement with the Exchange Agent, any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the shareholders of Genesis for twelve (12) months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to AerCap, upon demand, and any shareholders of Genesis who have not theretofore complied with this _ARTICLE II_ shall thereafter look only to AerCap for payment of their claim for the Amalgamation Consideration and any dividends or distributions with respect to AerCap Common Shares. 

   

 (g) _No Liability_. To the extent allowed under applicable Law, any Amalgamation Consideration and any dividends or distributions with respect to AerCap Common Shares comprising the Amalgamation Consideration that remain undistributed to the shareholders of Genesis shall be delivered to and become the property of AerCap on the day immediately prior to the day that such property is required to be delivered to any public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. None of AerCap, Amalgamation Sub, the Amalgamated Company or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any shareholder of Genesis for any such property delivered to AerCap or to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. 

   

 (h) _Withholding_. The Exchange Agent, AerCap and the Amalgamated Company shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any shareholder of Genesis such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under any provision of applicable Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Exchange Agent, AerCap or the Amalgamated Company, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Genesis Common Shares in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made. The parties agree to cooperate with each other for purposes of determining whether any Taxes are required to be withheld with respect to the Amalgamation.

that if the board of directors of Genesis shall have effected a Change in
Genesis Recommendation pursuant to this _Section 6.4_, then the Genesis

shall communicate the basis for its lack of a recommendation to the Genesis
shareholders in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or an appropriate amendment or
supplement thereto to the extent it determines, after consultation with its
legal counsel, that such action is compelled by applicable Law. 

   

 6.5 _Acquisition Proposals_. 

  

 (a) Neither Genesis nor any of its subsidiaries shall, and Genesis shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause its and its subsidiaries Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, prior to the termination of this Agreement: 

    

 (i) initiate, solicit, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate (including by providing non-public information) any effort or attempt to make or implement any proposal or offer with respect to, or a transaction to effect, an amalgamation, merger, reorganization, share exchange, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving it or any of its subsidiaries which account for 20% or more of the assets or revenues of it and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or any purchase or sale of 20% or more of the consolidated assets (including, without limitation, stock of its subsidiaries) of it and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or any purchase or sale of, or tender or exchange offer for, its voting securities that, if consummated, would result in any person (or the shareholders of such person) beneficially owning securities representing 20% or more of its total voting power (or of the surviving entity in such transaction) (any such proposal, offer or transaction (other than a proposal or offer made by AerCap) being hereinafter referred to as an " _Acquisition Proposal_ "); 

   

 (ii) have, participate or otherwise engage in any discussions or negotiations with or provide any confidential information or data to any person relating to an Acquisition Proposal; 

   

 (iii) approve or recommend, or propose to approve or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal or submit to the vote of its shareholders any Acquisition Proposal; or 

   ##### 

  

   

 (iv) approve or recommend, or propose to approve or recommend, or execute or enter into, any letter of intent, agreement in principle, merger agreement, amalgamation agreement, asset purchase or share exchange agreement, option agreement or other similar agreement related to any Acquisition Proposal; 

 

 _provided_ that Genesis may, and Genesis may cause its Representatives to, if
the board of directors of Genesis, after consultation with its outside legal
counsel, concludes in good faith that such action is reasonably likely to be
required in order for the directors to comply with their fiduciary duties
under applicable Law, but subject to Genesis, its subsidiaries and
their Representatives complying with _Section 6.5(c)_, participate or
otherwise engage in discussions or negotiations with or furnish confidential
information or data to any person who has made an unsolicited bona fide
written Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a breach of this
_Section 6.5_ in any material respect and which the board of directors of
Genesis concludes would be reasonably likely to constitute or lead to a
Superior Proposal;  _provided_ , _further_ , that (A) prior to participating
or otherwise engaging in any such discussions or negotiations or furnishing
such confidential information or data, Genesis shall have entered into a
confidentiality agreement with such person on terms not less restrictive in
the aggregate to such person than the provisions of the Confidentiality
Agreement are to AerCap and its Representatives and (B) all such information
or data has previously been provided or made available to AerCap or its
Representatives or is provided or made available to AerCap or its
Representatives prior to or substantially concurrent with the time it is
provided to such person. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this
_Section 6.5(a)_ shall prohibit Genesis from contacting and engaging in
discussions with any person who has made an unsolicited bona fide written
Acquisition Proposal solely for the purpose of clarifying the terms of such
Acquisition Proposal. 

   

 (b) Subject to _Section 6.5(d)_, Genesis (i) shall, and shall cause its subsidiaries and its and their respective Representatives to, cease immediately and terminate any and all existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any third parties conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, and (ii) shall not, and shall not permit any of its subsidiaries to, release any third party from, or waive any provisions of, any confidentiality or standstill agreement to which it or any of its subsidiaries is a party, except to the extent that the board of directors of Genesis, after consultation with its outside counsel, concludes in good faith that such action is reasonably likely to be required in order for the board of directors to comply with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law in connection with any Acquisition Proposal. Genesis shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to promptly inform its and its subsidiaries respective Representatives of the obligations undertaken in this _Section 6.5_. 

   

 (c) Genesis shall promptly (and in any event within the later of (1) forty-eight (48) hours or (2) the end of the second business day following such event) notify AerCap of any (i) Acquisition Proposal received by it, any of its subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives, (ii) request for information that would reasonably be expected to be related to an Acquisition Proposal received by it, any of its subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives, and (iii) request for discussions or negotiations that would reasonably be expected to be related to an Acquisition Proposal received by it, any of its subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives, indicating, in connection with any such notice, the identity of the person making such Acquisition Proposal or request and the material terms and conditions thereof (including a copy thereof if in writing and any related available documentation and 

   ##### 

  

   

correspondence). Genesis shall (A) inform the person making such Acquisition
Proposal, request for information or request for discussions or negotiations
of its obligations under this Agreement and (B) keep AerCap reasonably
informed on a reasonably current basis of the terms of any such Acquisition
Proposal or request for information or request for discussions or
negotiations (including whether such Acquisition Proposal or request for
information or request for discussions or negotiations is withdrawn and any
material change to the terms thereof). Nothing contained in this paragraph
(c) is intended to limit any other provision of this _Section 6.5_. 

   

 (d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if, at any time prior to obtaining the Required Genesis Vote (after the expiration of the Notice Period), the board of directors of Genesis concludes that an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a breach of this _Section 6.5_ in any material respect would be reasonably likely to constitute a Superior Proposal (after giving effect to all the adjustments to this Agreement which may be offered by AerCap prior to or during the Notice Period), the board of directors of Genesis may make a Change in Genesis Recommendation pursuant to this _Section 6.5_ ; _provided_ that, the board of directors of Genesis may not make a Change in Genesis Recommendation pursuant to this _Section 6.5_ unless (i) Genesis has provided a written notice to AerCap (a " _Notice of Superior Proposal_ ") advising AerCap that it has received an Acquisition Proposal that would be reasonably likely to constitute a Superior Proposal and specifying the identity of the person making such Acquisition Proposal and the material terms thereof (including a copy thereof and any related available documentation and correspondence), and (ii) AerCap does not, within three (3) business days following its receipt of the Notice of Superior Proposal (the " _Notice Period_ "), make an offer that, as determined in good faith by the board of directors of Genesis after consultation with Genesiss outside legal counsel and financial advisors, results in the applicable Acquisition Proposal no longer being a Superior Proposal ( _provided_ that, during the Notice Period, Genesis shall, and shall cause its outside legal counsel and its financial advisors to, negotiate in good faith with AerCap (to the extent AerCap desires to negotiate) with respect to such proposal). The parties understand and agree that, to comply with this _Section 6.5(d)_, any revisions to the terms of such Superior Proposal which, individually or in the aggregate, would be material when considering such Superior Proposal in its totality, shall require Genesis to deliver to AerCap a new Notice of Superior Proposal and the commencement of a new Notice Period. 

   

 (e) Nothing contained in this _Section 6.5_ shall prohibit Genesis from (i) complying with Rule 14d-9 or 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act to the extent applicable with regard to an Acquisition Proposal ( _provided_ that, in the case of an Acquisition Proposal made by way of a tender offer or exchange offer, any failure by Genesis or its board of directors to recommend that the shareholders of Genesis reject such offer within the time period specified in Rule 14e-2(a) shall be deemed to be a Change in Genesis Recommendation), or making any legally required disclosure to its shareholders with regard to an Acquisition Proposal ( _provided_ that, any disclosure (other than a "stop, look and listen" or similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act) made pursuant to Rule 14d-9 or 14e-2(a) shall be deemed to be a Change in Genesis Recommendation unless the board of directors of Genesis expressly reaffirms its recommendation to its shareholders in favor of approval of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby) or (ii) informing any person of the existence of the provisions contained in this _Section 6.5_. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (f) " _Superior Proposal_ " means a bona fide unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal from any person (other than AerCap or its subsidiaries) that did not result from a material breach by Genesis of this _Section 6.5_, which the board of directors of Genesis concludes in good faith, after consultation with Genesiss outside legal counsel and financial advisors, taking into account the legal, financial, regulatory, timing, the person making the Acquisition Proposal and other aspects of the Acquisition Proposal (including any break-up fees, expense reimbursement provisions and conditions to consummation) (i) is in the best interests of Genesis and its shareholders taken as a whole, (ii) is more favorable to Genesis and its shareholders taken as a whole than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (after giving effect to all adjustments to this Agreement which may be offered by AerCap under _Section 6.5(d)_ in response to such Acquisition Proposal) and (iii) is fully financed or reasonably capable of being fully financed and reasonably likely to receive all required approvals of Governmental Entities and otherwise reasonably capable of being completed within six (6) months following the Genesis boards determination that such Acquisition Proposal is a "Superior Proposal"; _provided_ that, for purposes of this definition of "Superior Proposal," the term "Acquisition Proposal" shall have the meaning assigned to such term in _Section 6.5(a)(i)_, except that the reference to "20% or more of the assets or revenues" shall be deemed to be a reference to "50% or more of the assets or revenues", the reference to "20% or more of its voting power" shall be deemed to be a reference to "50% or more of its total voting power" and the reference to "20% or more of the consolidated assets" shall be deemed to be a reference to "all or substantially all of the consolidated assets." 

   

 6.6 _Fees and Expenses_. Whether or not the Amalgamation is consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such expense, except as otherwise provided herein, and except that (i) expenses incurred in connection with filing, printing and mailing the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and the Form F-4, all filing and other fees paid to the SEC in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and all filing fees associated with the Requisite Regulatory Approvals which in each case shall be shared equally by Genesis and AerCap, and (ii) fees and expenses (other than any fees and expenses of Genesiss legal counsel) associated with obtaining the Agreement Waivers and the Service Provider Agreements shall be borne by AerCap. 

  

 6.7 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_. 

  

 (a) From and after the Effective Time, the Amalgamated Company shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law (and, in the case of the former officers and directors, to the extent permitted by the bye-laws of Genesis or any of its respective subsidiaries prior to the Closing), indemnify, defend and hold harmless, and provide advancement of expenses to, each person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date hereof or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director or officer of Genesis or any of its respective subsidiaries (the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") against all losses, claims, damages, costs, expenses, liabilities or judgments or amounts that are paid in settlement of or in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation based in whole or in part on or arising in whole or in part out of the fact that such person is or was a director or officer of Genesis or any of its respective subsidiaries, and pertaining to any matter existing or occurring, or any acts or omissions occurring, at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after, the 

   ##### 

  

   

Effective Time (including matters, acts or omissions occurring in connection
with the approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby) to the same extent such persons are indemnified or have
the right to advancement of expenses as of the date of this Agreement by
Genesis or any of its respective subsidiaries pursuant to the relevant
entitys memorandum of association, bye-laws and indemnification agreements
and resolutions, if any, in existence on the date hereof. In the event that
the Amalgamated Company fails to perform its obligations pursuant to this
_Section 6.7(a)_ for any reason, AerCap will perform and fulfill such
obligations without any requirement that an Indemnified Party pursue any
available remedies against the Amalgamated Company or any other party. 

   

 (b) Genesis shall purchase as of the Effective Time, and AerCap, for a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, shall maintain, a tail policy to the existing directors and officers liability insurance maintained by Genesis with respect to claims arising from facts or events which occurred at or before the Effective Time, and which tail policy shall contain substantially the same coverage and amounts as, and contain terms and conditions no less advantageous than the coverage provided by the existing policy of Genesis as of the date of this Agreement;  _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall Genesis be permitted to expend for the entire tail policy in excess of 250% of the annual premium currently provided by Genesis for its existing policy of directors and officers liability insurance; and _provided_ ,  _further_ , that if the premium of such insurance coverage exceeds such amount, Genesis shall be permitted to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not to exceed such amount. At the request of Genesis, AerCap shall cooperate with Genesis to obtain such a tail policy effective as of the Effective Time. 

   

 (c) In the event that AerCap or the Amalgamated Company or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates or amalgamates with or merges into any other person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or amalgamation or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any person (including by dissolution), then, and in each such case, AerCap shall cause proper provision to be made so that the successors and assigns of AerCap or the Amalgamated Company assume and honor the obligations set forth in this  _Section 6.7_. 

   

 (d) The provisions of this _Section 6.7_: (i) are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each director of Genesis as of the date of this Agreement and each other Indemnified Party, his or her heirs and legal representatives and (ii) are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such person may have by contract or otherwise. Following the Effective Time, the obligations of AerCap and the Amalgamated Company under this _Section 6.7_ shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Indemnified Party to whom this _Section 6.7_ applies without the consent of each such affected Indemnified Party. 

   

 6.8 _Public Announcements_. The press release to be issued after the execution of this Agreement by all parties regarding the Amalgamation shall be a joint press release, and thereafter each of AerCap and Genesis shall, except as may be required by applicable Law or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with or rules of the NYSE, as applicable, or by request of any Governmental Entity, consult with the other party before issuing any press release or otherwise making any public statement with respect to this Agreement or the transactions 

   ##### 

  

 

contemplated hereby; _provided_ , _however_ , that this consultation
obligation shall not apply to any press release or other public statement
relating to any actual or contemplated litigation between the parties to this
Agreement. 

   

 6.9 _Additional Agreements_. In case any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Amalgamated Company with full title to all properties, assets, rights, approvals, permits, authorizations, immunities and franchises of Genesis and its subsidiaries, the parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause their respective officers and directors to take all such necessary action. 

  

 6.10 _Shareholder Litigation_. Genesis shall give AerCap the reasonable opportunity to participate in the defense of any shareholder litigation against Genesis or its directors or officers relating to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. 

  

 6.11 _Employee Matters_.

 (i) the rights and obligations arising from contracts of employment between Genesis and the Employees (except those relating to old-age, invalidity and survivors benefits referred to in Regulation 4(3) of the Transfer Regulations) will have effect after the Effective Time as if originally made between AerCap or the Amalgamated Company and each such Employee; and 

   

 (ii) Genesis and AerCap each severally has an obligation to inform and/or consult with its employee representatives, or employees as the case may be, about the transactions contemplated hereby. Such consultation will include consultation concerning the Employees rights to old-age, invalidity and survivors benefits following the Effective Time. 

  

 (b) Both Genesis and AerCap agree to comply with their respective obligations under the Transfer Regulations and provide reasonable information and assistance to the other party to allow that party to so comply, including details of the relevant Employees or other persons rights and obligations which transfer to AerCap. 

   

 (c) As soon as practicable after the date hereof but, in any event, prior to the Closing Date, Genesis shall offer to enter into severance arrangements with the employees identified in the schedule delivered on September 16, 2009 (which such schedule shall include all employees of Genesis and its subsidiaries as of September 16, 2009) by Genesiss Chief Executive Officer to AerCaps Chief Executive Officer entitled "Final Section 6.11(c) Schedule" providing for the termination of such employees employment with Genesis as of the Effective Time or at such earlier date as otherwise determined by Galveston in consideration of the receipt of a severance payment and benefits in accordance with such schedule (subject to any adjustment under _Section 6.11(d)_ ), each such payment being conditional on the relevant employee signing (x) an appropriate form of severance agreement on terms and in a form reasonably acceptable to AerCap (it being understood that each such agreement shall include a waiver of any applicable restrictions on the employment of such employee) and (y) an acknowledgement that each 

    

52

##### 

 

  

employee has exercised his or her right to refuse to transfer to AerCap or the
Amalgamated Company under the Transfer Regulations. For the avoidance of
doubt, any employee of Genesis who chooses not to accept voluntary severance
in accordance with this _Section 6.11(c)_ will be entitled to transfer
to AerCap or the Amalgamated Company in accordance with _Section 6.11(a)_. 

   

 (d) The parties acknowledge that the severance amounts specified in the list referred to in  _Section 6.11(c)_ are calculated assuming the Effective Time will be December 31, 2009. The parties agree that, should the Effective Time take place on a date other than December 31, 2009, the maximum amounts shall be adjusted as provided in the schedule referred to in _Section 6.11(c)_ to reflect the actual period before the Effective Time (such adjustments to include any adjustments necessary to each employees length of service with Genesis). 

   

 6.12 _Listing and Delisting; Reservation for Issuance_. AerCap shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause all the following shares to be approved for listing and quotation on the NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance, no later than the Closing Date: (i) all AerCap Common Shares to be issued in the Amalgamation to Genesis shareholders and (ii) all AerCap Common Shares to be reserved for issuance upon exercise or vesting of the Genesis Share Options (collectively, the " _Listed AerCap Common Shares_ "). AerCap shall take all action necessary to reserve for issuance, prior to the Closing Date, any Listed AerCap Common Shares that, by their terms and in accordance with this Agreement, will not be issued until after the Effective Time. AerCap shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Genesis Common Shares and ADSs to no longer be listed or quoted on the NYSE and to be deregistered under the Exchange Act as soon as practicable following the Effective Time. 

  

 6.13 _Tax Matters_. 

  

 (a) AerCap shall cause (i) Amalgamation Sub to file with the United States Internal Revenue Service a properly completed Form 8832 and related documents, so as to elect to be treated as a disregarded entity for U.S. federal tax purposes effective at least one day prior to the Closing Date, and (ii) the Amalgamated Company to file, after the Closing Date, with the United States Internal Revenue Service a properly completed Form 8832 and related documents, so as to cause it to be treated for U.S. federal tax purposes as a disregarded entity effective as of the Closing Date. 

   

 (b) The parties intend that the Amalgamation will qualify for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a)(1) of the Code and to obtain the opinion described in _Section 7.2(d)_. Prior to the Effective Time, each of AerCap, Amalgamation Sub and Genesis and each of their respective affiliates shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Amalgamation to so qualify and to obtain such opinion, and unless otherwise required by applicable Law or by any other provision of this Agreement, shall not take any actions, or cause any actions to be taken, which would reasonably be expected to cause the Amalgamation to fail so to qualify or the opinion to fail to be delivered. 

   

 (c) AerCap and Genesis shall each execute and deliver to Weil, Gotshal and Manges LLP, counsel to Genesis, certificates substantially in the forms attached hereto as _Exhibits B_ and  _C_ at such time or times as reasonably requested by Weil, Gotshal and Manges LLP 

    ##### 

  

    

in connection with any opinions required by the SEC or the delivery of the
opinion referred to in _Section 7.2(d)_ , as the case may be. Prior to the
Effective Time, neither AerCap nor Genesis shall take any action which would
cause to be untrue any of the representations in such certificates. 

   

 6.14 _AerCap Board of Directors_. 

  

 (a) AerCap shall propose and recommend for election to the board of directors of AerCap for at least the four (4) year term referred to in, and subject to all the terms of, Article 15.3 of AerCaps articles of association (statuten), at an extraordinary general meeting of AerCaps shareholders to be duly called and held within sixty (60) days following the Effective Time (the " _First EGM_ "), three (3) nominees proposed by Genesis (in addition to any other nominees proposed by the board of directors of AerCap or any AerCap shareholder) at least five (5) business days prior to the Closing Date, which nominees (such nominees, or any replacement nominees selected in accordance with this _Section 6.14_ from time to time, the " _Genesis Nominees_ ") shall be (i) members of the board of directors of Genesis as of such date and (ii) subject to the consent of AerCap (not to be unreasonably withheld). 

  

 (b) If any Genesis Nominee shall not be elected to the board of directors of AerCap at the First EGM, the Genesis Nominees shall designate a replacement for such person or persons (which may include re-nomination of a Genesis Nominee who was previously proposed), subject to the consent of AerCap (not to be unreasonably withheld), and AerCap shall propose and recommend for election to the board of directors of AerCap such replacement Genesis Nominee or Nominees (x) in the event that the First EGM takes place before the publication of notice of the annual general meeting of AerCaps shareholders to be held in 2010 (the " _2010 AGM_ "), at the 2010 AGM, or (y) in the event that the First EGM takes place after the publication of notice of the 2010 AGM, at an extraordinary general meeting of AerCaps shareholders to be duly called and held within ninety (90) days following the First EGM (the " _Second EGM_ "; and the term " _Applicable Meeting_ " means the First EGM, the Second EGM or the 2010 AGM, as applicable). 

  

 (c) If it shall be determined prior to the Closing Date that a Genesis Nominee shall be unable to serve as a director at the time of the First EGM or fails to obtain the consent of AerCap, Genesis shall designate another Genesis Nominee, which Genesis Nominee shall be (i) a member of the board of directors of Genesis as of such date and (ii) subject to the consent of AerCap (not to be unreasonably withheld), to serve in such individuals place. 

  

 (d) If it shall be determined following the Closing Date, but prior to the time of the Applicable Meeting, that a Genesis Nominee shall be unable to serve as a director at the time of the Applicable Meeting or fails to obtain the consent of AerCap, the remaining Genesis Nominees shall designate a replacement for such person, subject to the consent of AerCap (not to be unreasonably withheld). 

  

 (e) In any instance where AerCap is required to provide its consent under this _Section 6.14_ , AerCap may withhold such consent if (among other reasons) any proposed Genesis Nominee would reasonably be expected not to satisfy any standard (other than independence) contained in any corporate governance rule adopted by the board of directors of AerCap, AerCaps articles of association (statuten) or applicable Netherlands Law. For the avoidance of 

   ##### 

  

 

doubt, if as a result of the election of any Genesis Nominee, AerCap would
have a larger number of executive directors or non-independent directors than
prescribed under the Netherlands corporate governance code, AerCap shall make
the appropriate disclosure as allowed under such corporate governance code in
its annual report. 

   

 (f) From and after the Effective Time and until (x) the date that three (3) Genesis Nominees are elected to the board of directors of AerCap or (y) in the event that three (3) Genesis Nominees are not elected to the board of directors of AerCap at or prior to the 2010 AGM or the Second EGM, as applicable, the date of such Applicable Meeting, each Genesis Nominee who has not been elected to the AerCap board of directors shall have the right to (i) attend any meeting of the AerCap board of directors held following the Effective Time, strictly as an observer without any voting rights and (ii) receive any materials delivered to the board of directors of AerCap in connection therewith; provided that the aggregate of the number of Genesis Nominees with the rights described in clauses (i) and (ii) of this _Section 6.14(f)_ and the number of Genesis Nominees who are directors of AerCap shall not exceed three (3) at any one time. 

  

 6.15 _Deposit Agreement_. Genesis shall take any and all action reasonably requested by AerCap with respect to the Depositary and the Deposit Agreement that AerCap deems necessary or advisable in order to facilitate the exchange of ADSs for AerCap Common Shares in connection with the Amalgamation, including amending or terminating the Deposit Agreement, appointing a successor Depositary and/or removing the Depositary. 

  

 6.16 _Financing Facilities_. Effective from and after the Effective Time, the Amalgamated Company shall expressly assume Genesiss obligations under the DVB/KFW/HSH Facility. 

  

 6.17 _Monthly Reports_. Each of AerCap and Genesis shall deliver to the other party promptly after the end of each calendar month ending after the date of this Agreement, (i) true and complete copies of any monthly consolidated management accounts as may be prepared or received relating to the business or operations of AerCap and Genesis, respectively, and (ii) a report setting forth in reasonable detail, as of such month end, an update of the information required to be disclosed, with respect to Genesis, in _Section 4.11(g)_ of the Genesis Disclosure Letter and with respect to AerCap, in _Section 3.10(g)_ of the AerCap Disclosure Letter. In addition, upon Genesiss request, AerCap shall provide to Genesis reasonable updates with regard to any transaction that would be prohibited by _Sections 5.2(a)_, _(c)_ or _(e)_ but for the exceptions provided in such sections. 

  

 6.18 _Notification of Certain Matters_. AerCap shall give prompt notice to Genesis, and Genesis shall give prompt notice to AerCap, in writing (where appropriate, through updates to the AerCap Disclosure Letter or Genesis Disclosure Letter, as applicable) of, and will contemporaneously provide the other party with true and complete copies of any and all information or documents relating to, (i) any notice or other communication received by such party from any Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) any Legal Proceedings commenced, or to such partys knowledge, threatened against, relating to or involving or otherwise affecting such party or any of its subsidiaries which, in the case of either clause (i) or (ii), would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse 

   ##### 

  

 

Effect with respect to such party or prevent or materially delay consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (iii) to the knowledge
of such party, any other event, transaction or circumstance that has caused
or would reasonably be expected to cause any covenant or agreement of such
party under this Agreement to be breached or that has rendered or would
reasonably be expected to render untrue any representation or warranty of
such party contained in this Agreement as if the same were made on or as of
the date of such event, transaction or circumstance. No notice given pursuant
to this _Section 6.18_ shall have any effect on the representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement for purposes

    #####

expected to, cause a breach of this Agreement. 

   

 (b) If AerCap terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(i)_ or _Section 8.1(d)_ (unless, in the case of a termination pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)_, a Change in Genesis Recommendation has occurred due to a development applicable to AerCap, its business or securities that the Genesis directors determine is sufficiently material and adverse so as to warrant the Change in Genesis Recommendation), then Genesis shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable (and, in any event, within two (2) business days) following such termination, pay to AerCap, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by AerCap, $9,000,000 (the " _Termination Fee_ "). 

   

 (c) If either party terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(c)_ or  _Section 8.1(f)_, or if AerCap terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(e)_, and (i) at any time after the date of this Agreement and prior to (A) the Outside Date (in the case of a termination pursuant to _Section 8.1(c)_), (B) the breach giving rise to AerCaps right to termination (in the case of a termination pursuant to _Section 8.1(e)_) or (C) the date of the Genesis Shareholders Meeting (in the case of a termination pursuant to _Section 8.1(f)_), an Acquisition Proposal for Genesis shall have been publicly announced (and not withdrawn), and (ii) within twelve (12) months following the date of such termination of this Agreement, Genesis or any of its subsidiaries enters into a definitive agreement with respect to or consummates an Acquisition Transaction with any person (other than AerCap), then Genesis shall pay to AerCap upon the earlier of the date of such execution or such consummation, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by AerCap, the Termination Fee.

 8.3 _Acknowledgements_. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the agreements contained in _Section 8.2_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and that, without these agreements, AerCap would not enter into this Agreement.

 9.5 _Entire Agreement; No Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement (including the Amalgamation Agreement, the AerCap Disclosure Letter and the Genesis Disclosure Letter) (a) constitutes the entire agreement and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, other than the Confidentiality Agreement, which shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and shall terminate in accordance with its terms, and (b) is not intended to confer upon any person other than the parties any rights or remedies hereunder, except (i) for the rights of the holders of Genesis Common Shares to receive the Amalgamation Consideration pursuant to and subject to this Agreement if the Effective Time occurs, and (ii) as provided in _Section 6.7(c)_.

 9.7 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement which is invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability and, unless the effect of such invalidity or unenforceability would prevent the parties from realizing the major portion of the economic benefits of the Amalgamation that they currently anticipate obtaining therefrom, shall not render invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this Agreement or affect the validity or enforceability of any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement in any other jurisdiction. If any provision of this Agreement is so broad as to be unenforceable, the provision shall be interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable.

Any attempt to make any such assignment without such consent shall be null and void. Subject to the preceding two (2) sentences, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns. 

  

 9.9 _Enforcement_. The parties agree that money damages would be both incalculable and an insufficient remedy and that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms on a timely basis or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that, subject to the discretion of the Chosen Court, the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this 

   ##### 

  

 

Agreement in any Chosen Court, this being in addition to any other remedy to
which they are entitled at law or in equity (including under _Section
8.2_). 

   

 9.10 _Submission to Jurisdiction_. Each party irrevocably and unconditionally consents, agrees and submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of any state or federal court sitting in the Borough of Manhattan, New York, New York (collectively, the " _Chosen Courts_ "), for the purposes of any litigation, action, suit or other proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any transaction contemplated hereby. Each party agrees to commence any litigation, action, suit or proceeding relating hereto only in the Chosen Courts. Each party irrevocably and unconditionally waives any objection to the laying of venue of any litigation, action, suit or proceeding arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby in the Chosen Courts, and hereby further irrevocably and unconditionally waives and agrees not to plead or claim in any such court that any such action, suit or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Each party further irrevocably consents to and grants any such court jurisdiction over the person of such parties and, to the extent legally effective, over the subject matter of any such dispute and agrees that mailing of process or other papers in connection with any such action or proceeding in the manner provided in _Section 9.2_ or in such other manner as may be permitted by Law, shall be valid and sufficient service thereof. The parties agree that a final judgment in any such suit, action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law. 

  

 9.11 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties, by action taken or authorized by their respective boards of directors, at any time before or after approval of the matters presented in connection with the Amalgamation by the shareholders of Genesis, but, after any such approval, no amendment shall be made which by Law requires further approval by such shareholders without such further approval. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties by their duly authorized representatives. 

  

 9.12 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties may, to the extent legally allowed, (i) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other party, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (iii) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such party. The failure of a party to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of those rights. No single or partial exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or privilege. Any waiver shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which given and shall not constitute a waiver to any subsequent or other exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder.
