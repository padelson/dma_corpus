AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

  

  

This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this "Agreement") is made as of November
22, 2011, by and among: (i) Acacia Research Group LLC, a Texas limited
liability company ("Parent"), (ii) Apollo Patent Corp., a Delaware corporation
and wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub" and, together with Parent,
the "Buying Parties"), (iii) ADAPTIX, INC., a Delaware corporation (the
"Company"); and (iv) solely in its capacity as representative of the
Shareholders pursuant to Article 9 hereof, Baker Communications Fund II (QP),
L.P. ("Representative"). Capitalized terms used and not otherwise defined
herein have the meanings set forth in Article 11 below.

  

  

WHEREAS, this Agreement contemplates a transaction in which Parent will
acquire the Company pursuant to a transaction in which Merger Sub, a wholly-
owned subsidiary of Parent, will merge with and into the Company, with the
Company surviving the merger, in accordance with the Delaware General
Corporation Law (the "DGCL") in exchange for consideration to Shareholders as
contemplated herein;

  

  

WHEREAS, the board of directors of the Company has, upon the terms and subject
to the conditions set forth herein, (i) approved this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby and (ii) recommended approval of the Merger
and approval of this Agreement by the Shareholders;

  

  

WHEREAS, Shareholders holding not less than 75% of the shares of Capital Stock
will, promptly following the Company's, Parent's and Merger Sub's full
execution and delivery of this Agreement, execute written consents, adopting
this Agreement and approving the transactions contemplated hereby in
accordance with the DGCL, the Company's certificate of incorporation and
bylaws and the Stockholders Agreement, in each case as in effect as of the
date hereof (the "Shareholder Approval");

  

  

WHEREAS, the boards of directors and managers, as applicable, of Merger Sub
and Parent, in its capacity as the sole equityholder of Merger Sub, have each,
upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, approved and
consented to the Merger, the execution by Parent and Merger Sub of this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby in
accordance with the DGCL as well as all other applicable Law; and

  

  

WHEREAS, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the
Merger.

  

  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, representations and
warranties and mutual covenants contained herein and other good and valuable
consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged,
and intending to be legally bound, the parties agree as follows:

  

  

  

  

  


 

  

 

 

 

  

 

1  

  

 

 

 

   
 

ARTICLE 1

  

  

THE MERGER

  

  

1.01. The Merger.

  

  

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions hereof, at the Effective
Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company in accordance with
the DGCL (the "Merger"), whereupon the separate existence of Merger Sub shall
cease, and the Company shall be the surviving corporation (the "Surviving
Corporation").

  

  

(b) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall possess
all the rights, powers, privileges and franchises and be subject to all of the
obligations, liabilities, restrictions and disabilities of the Company and
Merger Sub, all as provided under the DGCL. The Merger shall have the effects
set forth in this Agreement and the applicable provisions of the DGCL.

  

  

1.02. Closing; Effective Time. The closing of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (the "Closing") will take place at the offices of Ropes and Gray
LLP, located at Prudential Tower, 800 Boylston Street, Boston, Massachusetts,
on or prior to the fifth Business Day following satisfaction or waiver of the
conditions to the Closing set forth in Article 2 below (other than conditions
which are to be satisfied on the Closing Date, which shall be satisfied on the
Closing Date) or on such other date as is mutually agreed to by Parent and the
Company; provided, however, that if the day following such fifth Business Day
is a Friday or any other day which is not followed immediately by a Business
Day then (if so requested by the Company or the Representative) the Closing
shall occur on the next Monday or other Business Day that is followed
immediately by a Business Day such that the release of payment of Transaction
Expenses and the Ware Firm Payout Amount from the Transaction Expenses and
Merger Consideration Escrow Account will occur at 9:00 a.m. on the morning
following the Closing Date. Subject to Section 7.01, the failure to consummate
the Closing on the date determined by this Section 1.02 shall not result in
the termination of this Agreement and shall not relieve any party to this
Agreement of any obligation hereunder. The date of the Closing is herein
referred to as the "Closing Date." At the Closing, Merger Sub and the Company
shall cause a certificate of merger (the "Certificate of Merger") to be
executed and filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in
accordance with Section 251 of the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective as
of the date and time of such filing or such other time after such filing as
Merger Sub and the Company shall agree in the Certificate of Merger (the
"Effective Time").

  

  

1.03. Certificate of Incorporation; Bylaws; Directors and Officers.

  

  

(a) The certificate of incorporation of Merger Sub in effect at the Effective
Time shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation
until amended in accordance with applicable Law.

  

  

(b) The bylaws of Merger Sub in effect at the Effective Time shall be the
bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until amended in accordance with
applicable Law.

  

  


 

  

 

 

 

  

 

2  

  

 

 

 

   
 

(c) The directors of Merger Sub and the officers of the Merger Sub immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall become, from and after the Effective Time,
the directors and officers, respectively, of the Surviving Corporation, until
their respective successors are duly elected or appointed or their earlier
resignation or removal.

  

  

1.04. Conversion of Capital Stock. As a result of the Merger, at the Effective
Time each share of Capital Stock outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time, except as otherwise provided in Section 1.08, shall be
converted into the right to receive that portion (if any) of the Aggregate
Merger Consideration to which its holder is entitled pursuant to Section C.2
of ARTICLE FOURTH of the Company's Certificate of Incorporation; provided,
however, that any share of Capital Stock owned by the Company or the Parent
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and retired and
shall cease to exist without payment of any consideration with respect
thereto. Each share of common stock of Merger Sub outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one share of
common stock of the Surviving Corporation with the same rights, powers and
privileges as the shares so converted.

  

  

1.05. Cancellation of Options. As of the Effective Time, neither Parent nor
the Surviving Corporation will assume any Option, so each Option issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired without
consideration and shall cease to exist, and each holder of any such Option
shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except as otherwise
provided for herein or by applicable law.

  

  

1.06. Surrender and Payment.

  

  

(a) Pre-Closing Mechanics:

  

  

(i) At least six (6) Business Days before the scheduled Closing Date, the
Company will deliver to Parent a spreadsheet (the "Closing Merger
Consideration Spreadsheet") which includes the following information as of the
Closing Date: (i) the name of each Shareholder; (ii) the number of shares and
type of Capital Stock of the Company owned by each Shareholder and the
aggregate number of shares of outstanding Capital Stock of each relevant class
(in each case after giving effect to any and all conversions of convertible
notes or other convertible securities to be converted effective as of
Closing); (iii) the final calculation of Aggregate Merger Consideration
(including, as of the Closing Date, Cash on Hand, the amount of The Ware Firm
Payoff Amount, Transaction Expenses and Closing Date Indebtedness); (iv) the
portion of the Aggregate Merger Consideration payable to each Shareholder
pursuant to Section 1.04 and Section 1.06(b); (v) the portion of the Post-
Closing Indemnity Escrow Amount allocable to each Shareholder and each
Manager; (vi) the portion of the Representative Expense Amount allocable to
each Shareholder; and (vii) wire transfer instructions for payments to the
accounts to which payments are to be made pursuant to Section 1.06. The Parent
and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to rely upon the Closing
Merger Consideration Spreadsheet in connection with the payment of the
Aggregate Merger Consideration and to assume that the Closing Merger
Consideration Spreadsheet is fully authorized and binding upon the
Representative and the Shareholders; and shall be entitled to indemnification
on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in Article 8 with respect
to any inaccuracy in the Closing Merger Consideration Spreadsheet.

  

  

  


 

  

 

 

 

  

 

3  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

(ii) On the first Business Day following the Company's delivery of the Closing
Merger Consideration Spreadsheet (being five Business Days prior to the
scheduled Closing Date), (1) the Buying Parties shall pay, in cash by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to the Company to an account specified
by the Company, the Transaction Expenses Escrow Amount plus the amount of any
Transaction Expenses Escrow Fees and (2) upon receipt of the funds paid to the
Company pursuant to the previous clause (1), the Company shall deposit the
Transaction Expenses Amount into an escrow account (the "Transaction Expenses
and Merger Consideration Escrow Account"), with the Escrow Agent pursuant to
the terms of an escrow agreement substantially in the form of Exhibit F among
the Company, the Escrow Agent and Representative with such changes as the
Company may reasonably request in connection with the provisions of Section
1.06 and Section 5.09 or any [***]† Matters (the "Transaction Expenses and
Merger Consideration Escrow Agreement") that provides for (A) payment of the
Aggregate Merger Consideration at Closing pursuant to Section 1.06(b) and (if
applicable) after Closing pursuant to Section 1.06(c), and (B) release of the
entire Transaction Expenses Amount in accordance with the relevant terms of
the Closing Merger Consideration Spreadsheet at 9:00 a.m. on the first
Business Day following the Closing Date, subject only to receipt by the Escrow
Agent from Representative of an instruction that the Merger has occurred and
(C) payment of any Transaction Expenses Escrow Fees to the Escrow Agent under
the Transaction Expenses and Merger Consideration Escrow Agreement.

  

  

(iii) On the third Business Day following the Company's delivery of the
Closing Merger Consideration Spreadsheet (being three Business Days prior to
the scheduled Closing Date), the Buying Parties shall pay (in addition to the
amounts paid pursuant to Section 1.06(a)(ii)), in cash by wire transfer of
immediately available funds all remaining Aggregate Merger Consideration and
Other Closing Payment Amounts (i.e., all such amounts that are not already
deposited into and held in the Transaction Expenses and Merger Consideration
Escrow Account pursuant to Section 1.02(a)(ii)) as directed by the Company and
the Representative, including as follows:

  


 

  

(iv) into the Transaction Expenses and Merger Consideration Escrow Account, an
amount equal to the Aggregate Merger Consideration (as set forth in the in the
Closing Merger Consideration Spreadsheet), to be held by the Escrow Agent
pursuant to the terms of the Transaction Expenses and Merger Consideration
Escrow Agreement, which will provide for release of the entire Aggregate
Merger Consideration in accordance with the relevant terms of the Closing
Merger Consideration Spreadsheet as contemplated by this Section 1.06 (on the
Closing Date as provided in Section 1.06(b) and (if applicable) under Section
1.06(c) after the Closing Date to the extent holders of Capital Stock entitled
to payment of any portion of the Aggregate Merger Consideration do not
complete delivery of Letters of Transmittal in form satisfactory to
Representative prior to Closing), subject only to the Escrow Agent's receipt
of a notification from Representative that the Merger has occurred (which the
Representative will not issue until it has received telephonic or other notice
from the Office of the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or from
reputable filing service, or similarly trustworthy confirmation, that the
Certificate of Merger has been accepted for filing) and the Representative's
instruction, on behalf of Shareholders, to make such payment;

1.08. Treatment of Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, holders of Capital Stock who have properly demanded
appraisal of such shares pursuant to, and who comply in all respects with, the
provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL ("Dissenting Shares") shall not have
such shares converted as provided herein, but instead such holders shall be
entitled to such rights (and only such rights) as are granted under Section
262 of the DGCL. At the Effective Time, all Dissenting Shares shall no longer
be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and extinguished and shall
cease to exist, and except as otherwise provided by Law, each holder of
Dissenting Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto other
than the rights granted pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if any holder shall fail to validly perfect or shall otherwise
waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL
or if a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is
not entitled to the relief provided by Section 262 of the DGCL, then the
rights of such holder under Section 262 of the DGCL shall cease and such
Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to have been converted, as applicable, at
the Effective Time as set forth in Section 1.04. The Company shall give Parent
prompt written notice of any demands for appraisal with respect to Dissenting
Shares, and Parent shall have the opportunity to participate in all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands, provided, that the
Representative shall have the right to lead the negotiations and proceedings
with respect to such demands and any settlements with respect thereto shall
not be entered into without the prior written consent of the Company or the
Surviving Corporation (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or
delayed). Any payments to be made in respect of Dissenting Shares will be made
by Parent and/or the Surviving Corporation; provided, that to the extent any
payments made in respect of Dissenting Shares require Parent to pay any
amounts in excess of the Aggregate Merger Consideration, after taking into
account the payments made pursuant to Section 1.06 (a) and (b), then Parent
shall be entitled to be reimbursed for such excess payments from the Post-
Closing Indemnity Escrow Account as provided in Section 8.02(a)(iv).

  

  

1.09. No Further Ownership Rights in Capital Stock. The consideration paid in
accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Capital Stock (including any
rights to receive accrued but unpaid dividends or any liquidation preference
on such Capital Stock, if any), and, from and after the Effective Time, the
holders of certificates representing ownership of Capital Stock and holders of
Options shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares (including
any rights to receive any accrued but unpaid dividends or any liquidation
preference on such shares, if any), except as otherwise expressly provided for
in this Agreement and, if applicable, the Escrow Agreements. At the Effective
Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and thereafter
there shall be no further registration of transfers on the records of the
Surviving Corporation of shares of Capital Stock. If, after the Effective
Time, certificates are presented to Parent or the Surviving Corporation for
any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged, subject to delivery of
Letters of Transmittal, as provided hereunder.

  

  

1.10. Lost Certificates. If any certificate for Capital Stock shall have been
lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such certificate for Capital Stock to be lost, stolen or
destroyed, the Surviving Corporation will pay, in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed certificate, the applicable consideration, as the case may
be, to be paid in respect of the Capital Stock represented by such certificate
as contemplated by this Article 1.

5.02. Access to Books and Records. During the period from the date of this

pursuant to Section 7.01 hereof, the Company will provide Parent and its
authorized representatives ("Parent's Representatives") with reasonable access
during normal business hours and upon reasonable notice to the offices,
properties, books and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries (other than
books and records relating to the negotiation of this Agreement and the
process leading to the execution of this Agreement) to the extent relating to
the transition of the Company's business to Parent; provided that such access
does not unreasonably interfere with the normal operations of the Company;
provided further that all requests for such access will be directed to Michael
Pisterzi or Timothy Montgomery at the Company or such other Person as the
Company may designate in writing from time to time. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Agreement, the Company will not be required to
disclose any information to Parent if such disclosure would be reasonably
likely to (a) jeopardize any attorney-client or other legal privilege or (b)
contravene any applicable Laws, fiduciary duty or binding agreement entered
into prior to the date hereof. None of the Company, Representative nor any of
their respective Affiliates or Shareholders make any representation or
warranty as to the accuracy of any information (if any) provided pursuant to
this Section 5.02, and neither Parent nor Merger Sub may rely on the accuracy
of any such information, in each case other than as expressly set forth in the
Company's representations and warranties contained in Article 3. The
information provided pursuant to this Section 5.02 will be used solely for the
purpose of effecting the transactions contemplated hereby, and will be
governed by all the terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement,
dated November 1, 2011, between Parent and the Company (the "Confidentiality

within 10 Business Days after the date hereof. The Buying Parties and the
Company will coordinate and cooperate with each other in exchanging such
information and providing such assistance as Parent or the Company, as the
case may be, may reasonably request in connection with the foregoing (and the
parties will include in any and all such filings and submissions any
description of any [***]† Matter that is determined by the Buying Parties and
the Company to be required by Law, such determination to be made to the
reasonable satisfaction of the Company). Subject to applicable Laws relating
to the exchange of information, the parties will have the right to review in
advance, and to the extent practicable will consult with each other on, all
the information that appears in any such filings. The parties will request
confidential treatment of all filings under the HSR Act and each party will
request early termination of the HSR Act waiting period.

  

  

(b) Parent, Merger Sub and the Company will comply with any additional
requests for information, including requests for production of documents and
production of witnesses for interviews or depositions by any Governmental
Body. Each of the Buying Parties and the Company agree to use best efforts to
take any and all steps necessary to avoid the entry of, or to effect the
dissolution of, any decree, order, judgment, injunction, temporary restraining
order or other order in any proceeding, that would otherwise have the effect
of preventing or materially delaying the consummation of the Merger and,
subject to the provisions of Section 5.03(d), to avoid or eliminate each and
every impediment under any law that may be asserted by any Governmental Body
or any other Person so as to enable the parties to expeditiously close the
transactions contemplated hereby.

(c) Parent and the Company will keep each other apprised of the status of all
filings and submissions referred to in this Section 5.03, including promptly
furnishing the other with copies of notices or other communications received
by Parent or the Company in connection therewith. Neither Parent nor Merger
Sub will permit any of its officers, employees or other representatives or
agents to participate in any meeting with any Governmental Body in respect of
such filings and submissions unless it consults with the Company in advance
and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Authority, gives the Company
the opportunity to attend and participate thereat.

expenses in connection with satisfying the covenants to close set forth
herein), (ii) to hold separate (including by trust or otherwise) or divest any
businesses, product lines or assets that are or have a reasonable likelihood
of becoming, individually or in the aggregate, material to Parent or the
Surviving Corporation or to the value of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement to Parent and its Affiliates, (iii) to agree to any material
structural or non-structural limitation on Parent's, the Company's or their
respective Affiliates' businesses, assets or operations, or (iv) to waive any
of the conditions set forth in Article 2 of this Agreement. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing (and notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Section 5.03 or otherwise): (A) the Company shall not take any of the
actions contemplated by clauses (ii) or (iii) above without Parent's prior
written consent which may be withheld in Parent's sole discretion; and (B) if
and to the extent that any request for Parent or any of its Affiliates or the
Company to hold separate arrangements or divestitures of the type described in
clause (ii) above relates to or results from the introduction of [***]† into
the transactions contemplated hereby through the [***]† Matters, the Buying
Parties will not make the request contemplated by Section 5.09(a) and will
take such steps as may be required to exclude [***]† from the transactions
contemplated hereby. Each of Parent and the Company will promptly deliver to
the other a copy of each such filing made, each such notice given and each
such consent obtained.

  

  

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 5.03 or otherwise
but subject to Section 5.03(d), Parent and the Company will communicate and
use reasonable efforts to coordinate regarding whether and how to respond to
any demands for sale, divestiture or disposition of assets or business of
Parent or the Company or their respective Affiliates or other relief asserted
by the relevant Governmental Body in connection with antitrust or competition
matters and how to defend through litigation any proceeding commenced by any
Governmental Body in connection with the transaction contemplated hereby.

  

  

(f) Parent will pay all fees required to be paid in connection with the
filings required under the HSR Act in order to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby. All out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Parent or the
Company in connection with their respective obligations pursuant to this

requirements under the DGCL. If approval is obtained by written consent, the
Company shall give, in a timely manner (and shall Parent true and correct
copies of) all notices, if any, required to be given under the DGCL. The
information distributed to the Shareholders shall not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein in light
of the circumstances under which they were made not misleading.

  

  

5.05. Conditions. The Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause the conditions set forth in Section 2.01 and Section 2.02 hereof to be
satisfied and to consummate the transactions contemplated herein as soon as

those set forth in Section 2.02(c) to be satisfied at the Closing). Each of
Parent and Merger Sub will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
conditions set forth in Section 2.01 and Section 2.03 hereof to be satisfied
and to consummate the transactions contemplated herein as soon as reasonably
possible after the satisfaction of such conditions (other than those set forth
in Section 2.03(c) to be satisfied at the Closing).

  

  

5.06. Exclusive Dealing. During the period from the date of this Agreement
until the Closing or the earlier termination of this Agreement pursuant to

transaction or series of transactions with any Person, other than Parent and
its Affiliates involving any recapitalization, restructuring, financing,
merger, consolidation, sale, non-ordinary course of business license or
encumbrance or other business combination transaction or extraordinary
corporate transaction of the Company that would or could reasonably be
expected to impede, interfere with, prevent or delay the Merger (any such
efforts by any such Person, including a firm proposal to make such an
acquisition, to be referred to as an "Alternative Acquisition"), (b) provide
information with respect to the Company to any Person, other than Parent and
its Affiliates, relating to a possible Alternative Acquisition by any Person,
other than Parent and its Affiliates, (c) enter into an agreement with any
Person, other than Parent and its Affiliates, providing for a possible
Alternative Acquisition, or (d) make or authorize any statement,
recommendation or solicitation in support of any possible Alternative
Acquisition by any Person, other than by Parent and its Affiliates. Neither
the Company's board of directors nor any committee thereof shall withdraw,
modify or amend, or propose to withdraw, modify or amend, in a manner adverse
to Parent, the Company Board Recommendation or resolve to do so; provided,
however, that nothing in this Section 5.06 is intended or shall be construed
to limit the ability of the Company or any of its Affiliates to take any
action with respect to interim financing for the Company for the period from
the date hereof to the Closing provided that such actions do not result in a
change of control, a license or encumbrance that would survive the Closing or
prevent or materially delay the Merger on the terms contemplated hereby.

amended Tax Return, enter into any closing agreement related to Taxes, settle
any Tax claim or assessment relating to Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
surrender any right to claim a refund of Taxes, consent to any extension or
waiver of the limitation period applicable to any Tax claim or assessment
relating to Company or any of its Subsidiaries, if such election, adoption,
change, amendment, agreement, settlement, surrender or consent would have the
effect of materially increasing the Tax liability of Company or any of its
Subsidiaries for any period ending after the Closing Date or decreasing any
Tax attribute of Company or any of its Subsidiaries existing on the Closing
Date.

  

  

5.08. Termination of Certain Company Benefit Plans. (a) Effective as of and

representatives with reasonable access (for the purpose of examining and
copying), during normal business hours, to the personnel, books and records of
the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries with respect to periods or
occurrences prior to the Closing Date in connection with any matter, whether
or not relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby. Parent will not, and will not permit the Surviving
Corporation to, for a period of six years following the Closing Date, destroy,
alter or otherwise dispose of any books and records of the Surviving
Corporation, or any portions thereof, relating to periods prior to the Closing
Date.

  

  

6.02. Director and Officer Liability and Indemnification.

  

  

(a) Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to indemnification,
advancement or exculpation existing on the date hereof in favor of any
officers and directors of the Company (each, an "Indemnified Person"), as
provided in the Company's certificate of incorporation, bylaws or equivalent
governing documents or otherwise as in effect as of the date hereof, shall
survive the Merger, it being the intent of the parties that each Indemnified
Person of the Company will continue to be entitled to such exculpation,
indemnification and advancement of expenses to the full extent of the law. For
a period of six years after the Closing, Parent shall cause the governing
documents of the Surviving Corporation or any successor to the Surviving
Corporation, to contain provisions that are no less favorable with respect to
indemnification, advancement of costs and exculpation of Indemnified Persons
as are set forth in the applicable governing documents of the Company on the
date of this Agreement, except to the extent that an alteration or
modification of such documents is required by applicable Law that cannot be
waived.

  

  

(b) At the Closing, Parent will, or will cause the Surviving Corporation to,
obtain, maintain and fully pay for irrevocable "tail" insurance policies
naming the Indemnified Persons as direct beneficiaries with a claims period of
at least six years from the Closing Date from an insurance carrier with the
same or better credit rating as the Company's current insurance carrier with
respect to directors' liability insurance in an amount and scope at least as
favorable as the Company's existing policies with respect to matters existing
or occurring at or prior to the Closing Date, such policies to take effect
from and after the Effective Time. Parent will not, and will cause the
Surviving Corporation to not, cancel or change such insurance policies in any
respect.

  

  

(c) In the event that all or substantially all of the assets of the Surviving
Corporation are sold, whether in one transaction or a series of transactions,
then Parent and the Surviving Corporation will, in each such case, ensure that
the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation assume the obligations
set forth in this Section 6.02. The provisions of this Section 6.02(c) will
apply to all of the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation.

deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, all such documents and
instruments and will use commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to
be taken, all such further or other actions as may be reasonably necessary or
desirable to evidence and effectuate the transactions contemplated by this

terminate pursuant to this Section 7.01(d) after five Business Days following
the execution of this Agreement;

  

  

(e) by either Parent or the Company, if any court order or injunction entered

(other than this Section 7.02 and Article 12 hereof which will survive the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with their terms); provided, that
(i) the last sentence of Section 5.02 above, and the Confidentiality Agreement
referred to therein, will survive the termination of this Agreement for a
period of five years following the date of such termination; and (ii) there
will be no liability on the part of any of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or
the Shareholders to one another (or to or from their respective Affiliates,
officers, directors, employees or agents) under or in connection with this
Agreement; provided, however, that nothing herein is intended or shall be
construed to limit the liability of any party to this Agreement for any breach
of the agreements and covenants contained in this Agreement (including the
failure of a party to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement following the satisfaction of all the conditions to such party\'s
obligations under Article 2) prior to the time of such termination.

claim with respect thereto will expire on the date that is 18 months after the
Closing Date) unless a specific covenant contained in Article 5 requires
performance after the Closing Date, in which case such covenant will survive
for the period set forth therein and (b) the covenants and agreements set
forth in Articles 6, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12 will survive in accordance with the
terms thereof.

  

  

8.02. Indemnification of Parent.

  

  

(a) From and after the Closing (but subject to the terms and conditions of
this Article 8), the Parent Indemnitees (as defined below) will be indemnified
from the Post-Closing Indemnity Escrow Funds (to the extent of available
funds) in respect of any actual and reasonable out-of-pocket loss (hereinafter
individually a "Loss" and collectively "Losses") suffered or incurred by
Parent or any of its Affiliates (the "Parent Indemnitees") to the extent such
Loss directly results from (i) a breach of any representation or warranty of
the Company contained in Article 3 of this Agreement, (ii) any breach of any
covenant of the Company contained in this Agreement requiring performance by
the Company prior to the Effective Time, (iii) any inaccuracy in the Closing
Merger Consideration Spreadsheet, (iv) any payments made by Parent in respect
of Dissenting Shares, to the extent Parent is required to pay any amounts in
excess of the Aggregate Merger Consideration, or (v) any Employment Taxes that
Parent or the Surviving Corporation is obligated to pay (other than out of the
Aggregate Merger Consideration or for which they are otherwise reimbursed)
with respect to compensatory amounts as described in Section 1.06(d) or (vi)
any Tax indemnification obligation pursuant to Section 10.02(a) (but without
duplicating any indemnification obligation pursuant to Section 10.02(a)).

  

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

33  

  

 

 

 

 

  

  

  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, no
Parent Indemnitee will be entitled to any indemnification under Sections
8.02(a)(i) or 8.02(a)(ii) unless the aggregate amount of all Losses arising
from or relating to any such breach of any representation, warranty or
covenant of the Company contained in this Agreement would exceed on a
cumulative basis an amount equal to $500,000 (the "Basket Threshold"), and
then Losses will be subject to indemnification hereunder, on the terms and
subject to the conditions hereof, without respect to (and without deduction
of) the Basket Threshold.

  

  

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement or
otherwise, from and after the Closing (but subject to the terms and conditions
of this Article 8), any indemnification of the Parent Indemnitees hereunder
will be effected by a payment made from the Post-Closing Indemnity Escrow
Funds from time to time remaining in the Post-Closing Indemnity Escrow
Account, in accordance with the terms of the Post-Closing Indemnity Escrow
Agreement, and any post-Closing claim by any Parent Indemnitees arising under
or with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby will
be asserted solely and exclusively against the Post-Closing Indemnity Escrow
Funds. From and after the Closing, the remedies set forth in Article 8 shall
be the sole and exclusive remedy with respect to any and all claims (in law or
equity and whether based on contract, tort or any other theory of law)
relating, directly or indirectly, to the subject matter of this Agreement.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing and subject to Section
8.02(f), each of Parent and Merger Sub hereby waives, to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Law, any and all rights, claims and causes of
action it or any of their respective officers, directors, employees (present
or former) or Affiliates may have against any of the Company's officers,
directors, employees (present or former) or Affiliates with respect to the
subject matter of this Agreement, whether arising under or based upon any law
or in equity and whether based on contract, tort or any other theory of law.

  

  

(d) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that Representative is a party to
this Agreement solely to perform certain administrative functions in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.
Accordingly, the parties hereto acknowledge and agree that Representative
shall have no liability to, and shall not be liable for any Losses of, any
party hereto or to any Parent Indemnitee in connection with any obligations of
the Representative under this Agreement or the Escrow Agreements or otherwise
in respect of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, except
to the extent such Losses shall be proven to be the direct result of
deliberate fraud by the Representative in connection with the performance of
its obligations hereunder or under the Escrow Agreements.

  

  

(e) No claim shall be brought or maintained by any party or any of their
respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates or their respective successors or
permitted assigns against any officer, director, employee (present or former)
or Affiliate of the Company, Representative or any Shareholder, member,
officer, director, employee (present or former) or any Affiliate of any of the
above, as applicable (each of whom is deemed a third-party beneficiary of this
Section 8.02(e)), which is not otherwise expressly identified as a party
hereto, and no recourse shall be brought or granted against any of them, by
virtue of or based upon any alleged misrepresentation or inaccuracy in or
breach of any of the representations, warranties or covenants of any party
hereto set forth or contained in this Agreement or any exhibit or schedule
hereto or any certificate delivered hereunder.

  

  

(f) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, nothing herein is
intended or shall be construed to limit in a manner that would violate
applicable Law, or that would constitute an impermissible limitation under
applicable Law of, the liability of any party for any fraud committed in
connection with this Agreement.

  

  

  

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

34  

  

 

 

 

 

  

  

  

(g) All payments under this Section 8.02 will be treated by the parties as an
adjustment to the proceeds received by Shareholders pursuant to Article 1.

  

  

8.03. Indemnification of Shareholders. Parent will indemnify the Company and
each Shareholder, their members, its and their Affiliates, and its and their
officers, directors, employees and agents, as applicable (the "Shareholder
Indemnitees") against and hold them harmless from any Losses suffered or
incurred by any such Shareholder Indemnitee to the extent such Loss directly
results from (a) a breach of any representation or warranty of Parent or
Merger Sub set forth in Article 4 this Agreement, (b) any breach of any
covenant of Parent or Merger Sub contained in this Agreement requiring
performance by Parent or Merger Sub prior to the Closing or by Parent or the
Surviving Corporation at or after the Closing, (c) actions taken by Parent,
the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries on or after
the Closing Date or relating to the post-Closing operations of the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries, (d) any [***]† Matter and (e) any
indemnification obligations to the Escrow Agent under the Transaction Expenses
and Merger Consideration Escrow Agreement or and other fees, expenses or costs
arising from such agreement (it being understood and agreed that Losses for
these purposes will include any and all diminution of value of the Company or
the Company Patents suffered or incurred that relates to or results from any
[***]† Matters or from the breach of any representation and warranty contained
in Section 4.04(b) or Section 4.08). All payments under this Section 8.03
after the Closing will be treated by the parties for tax purposes as an
adjustment to the proceeds received by the Shareholders pursuant to Article 1.

  

  

8.04. Expiration of Claims. Other than claims pursuant to Section 8.03(c), the
ability of any Person to receive indemnification under Sections 8.02 or 8.03
will terminate on the applicable survival termination date (as set forth in
Section 8.01), unless such Person or a Parent Indemnitee, as applicable, has
made a proper claim for indemnification pursuant to Sections 8.02 or 8.03,
subject to the terms and conditions of this Article 8, prior to such
termination date, as applicable, for a Loss prior to such applicable
termination date. If a Parent Indemnitee has made a proper claim for
indemnification pursuant to Sections 8.02 or 8.03 prior to such termination
date, then such claim, if then unresolved, will not be extinguished by the
passage of the deadlines set forth in Section 8.01. Parent and each Parent
Indemnitee will have no right to assert any claim pursuant to this Article 8
with respect to any Loss, cause of action or other claim to the extent it is a
Loss, cause of action or claim with respect to which Parent or any of its
Affiliates has taken action (or caused action to be taken) for the purposes of
accelerating the time period in which such matter is asserted or payable.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary (other than Section
8.02(f)), all claims by any Parent Indemnitee will immediately terminate and
expire at such time as all Post-Closing Indemnity Escrow Funds have been
distributed.

8.05. Inter-Party Claims. In order for a party to be entitled to seek any
indemnification provided for under this Agreement (such party, the "Claiming
Party"), such Claiming Party must notify the other party or parties from whom
such indemnification is sought (the "Defending Party") in writing promptly
after occurrence of the event giving rise to such Claiming Party's claim for
indemnification, specifying in reasonable detail the basis of such claim;
provided that failure to give such notification will not affect the
indemnification provided hereunder except to the extent the Defending Party
will have been prejudiced as a result of such failure or the indemnification
obligations are materially increased as a result of such failure. The Claiming
Party will thereupon give the Defending Party reasonable access during normal
business hours to the books, records and assets of the Claiming Party which
evidence or support such claim or the act, omission or occurrence giving rise
to such claim and the right, upon prior notice during normal business hours,
to interview any employee of the Claiming Party related thereto at a mutually
convenient time. If the Defending Party disputes its liability with respect to
any such claim, the Defending Party and the Claiming Party will proceed to
negotiate a resolution of such dispute and, if not resolved through
negotiations, such dispute will, subject to the terms of this Agreement, be
resolved by litigation in an appropriate court of competent jurisdiction. The
Claiming Party will have the burden of proof in establishing the amount of
Losses suffered by it.

  

  

8.06. Third Party Claims.

  

  

(a) In order for a Claiming Party to seek any indemnification provided for
under this Agreement in respect of a claim or demand made by any Person
against the Claiming Party (a "Third Party Claim"), such Claiming Party must
notify the Defending Party in writing, and in reasonable detail, of the Third
Party Claim as promptly as reasonably possible after receipt by such Claiming
Party of notice of the Third Party Claim; provided that failure to give such
notification on a timely basis will not affect the indemnification provided
hereunder except to the extent the Defending Party will have been prejudiced
as a result of such failure. Thereafter, the Claiming Party will deliver to
the Defending Party, within 5 Business Days after the Claiming Party's receipt
thereof, copies of all notices and documents (including court papers) received
by the Claiming Party relating to the Third Party Claim.

  

  

(b) If a Third Party Claim is made against a Claiming Party, the Defending
Party will be entitled to participate in the defense thereof and, if it so
chooses, to assume the defense thereof with counsel selected by the Defending
Party and reasonably satisfactory to the Claiming Party. Should a Defending
Party so elect to assume the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Defending
Party will not be liable to the Claiming Party for legal expenses subsequently
incurred by the Claiming Party in connection with the defense thereof. If the
Defending Party assumes such defense, the Claiming Party will have the right
to participate in the defense thereof and to employ counsel, at its own
expense, separate from the counsel employed by the Defending Party, it being
understood, however, that the Defending Party will control such defense. If
the Defending Party chooses to defend any Third Party Claim, then all the
parties will cooperate reasonably in the defense or prosecution of such Third
Party Claim, including by retaining and (upon the Defending Party's request)
providing to the Defending Party all records and information which are
relevant to such Third Party Claim, and making employees available on a
mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of
any material provided hereunder. Whether or not Representative will have
assumed the defense of a Third Party Claim, neither Parent nor any of its
Affiliates will admit any liability with respect to, or settle, compromise or
discharge, any Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of
Representative, nor shall Representative settle, compromise or discharge any
Third Party Claim without obtaining Parent's prior written consent (which
consent shall not be withheld unreasonably) in cases where Parent would be
obligated to admit any liability with respect to such Third Party Claim or be
subject to any damages other than monetary damages for which it will be
entitled to indemnification hereunder.

  

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

36  

  

 

 

 

 

  

  

  

8.07. Mitigation.

  

  

(a) Each Person entitled to indemnification hereunder will take commercially
reasonable steps to mitigate all Losses after becoming aware of any event
which could reasonably be expected to give rise to any Losses that are
indemnifiable or recoverable hereunder or in connection herewith. In the event
that an indemnifying party makes any payment to any indemnified party for
indemnification for which such indemnified party could have collected on a
claim against a third party (including under any contract and any insurance
claims), such indemnifying party will be entitled to pursue claims and conduct
litigation on behalf of such indemnified party and any of its successors, to
pursue and collect on any indemnification or other remedy available to such
indemnified party thereunder with respect to such claim and generally to be
subrogated to the rights of such indemnified party. Except pursuant to a
settlement agreed to by the indemnifying party, the indemnified party will not
waive or release any contractual right to recover from a third party any loss
subject to indemnification hereby without the prior written consent of such
indemnifying party. The indemnified party will, and will cause its Affiliates
(including the Surviving Corporation if the Surviving Corporation is an
Affiliate) to, cooperate with the indemnifying party, at such indemnifying
party's expense, with respect to any such effort to pursue and collect with
respect thereto.

  

  

8.08. Determination of Loss Amount.

  

  

(a) The amount of any and all Losses under this Article 8 will be determined
net of (i) the net present value of any Tax benefits actually realized by any
party seeking indemnification hereunder arising from the deductibility (or
amortization or depreciation or other tax benefit, etc.) of any such Losses
and (ii) any amounts recovered, actually recoverable or for which there is an
actual right of recovery by any Claiming Party or any of such Claiming Party's
Affiliates under or pursuant to any insurance policy, title insurance policy,
indemnity, reimbursement arrangement or contract pursuant to which or under
which such Claiming Party or such Claiming Party's Affiliates is a party or
has rights (collectively, "Alternative Arrangements").

  

  

(b) In no event will Parent Indemnitees be entitled to recover or make a claim
for any amounts in respect of consequential, incidental or indirect damages,
lost profits, diminutions in value or punitive damages and, in particular, no
"multiple of profits" or "multiple of cash flow" or other valuation
methodology will be used in calculating the amount of any Losses; provided,
however, that, notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent Indemnitees shall be
entitled to make a claim for amounts in respect of diminutions in value as an
element of "Losses" subject to indemnification hereunder in the case of a
claim for breach of the representations and warranties contained in Section
3.14 (for which the term "Loss" shall also be deemed to include any diminution
of value of the Company Patents that results from any matter that constitutes
a breach of the representations and warranties contained in Section 3.14). In
addition, except in cases where Parent Indemnitees are seeking indemnification
as a result of a breach by the Company of the representations and warranties
contained in Section 3.14, in no event will Parent Indemnitees be entitled to
recover for any Losses that are not paid to a third party. No indemnifying
party will be liable hereunder in respect of any claim if such claim would not
have arisen but for a change in legislation or accounting policies or a change
in interpretation of applicable Law as determined by a court or pursuant to an
administration rule-making decision. Attorney, consultant, and other
professional fees and disbursements incurred by an indemnifying party in
connection with this Article 8 will be reasonable and based only on time
actually spent, which will be charged at no more than such professional's
standard hourly rate. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to
the contrary, if on the Closing Date the Parent Indemnitee has actual
knowledge that one or more of the representations, warranties or covenants
made by the Company is materially inaccurate as of the date made, the Parent
Indemnitee will have no right or remedy after the Closing with respect to such
material inaccuracy and will be deemed to have waived its rights to
indemnification in respect thereof. The Representative will have the burden of
proof in establishing that the Parent Indemnitee had actual knowledge that one
or more of the representations, warranties or covenants made by the Company
was materially inaccurate as of the date made.

  

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

37  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  

(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in no event will the
Parent Indemnitees be indemnified for any Losses pursuant to this Article 8
related to or arising from the amount, value or condition of any Tax asset or
attribute (e.g., net operating loss carry-forward, tax credit carry-forward or
tax basis) of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the ability of Parent
or the Surviving Corporation to utilize any such Tax asset or attribute for
any taxable period commencing after the Effective Time.

  

  

(d) No Parent Indemnitee will be entitled to any indemnification under this
Article 8 to the extent such matter (i) was taken into account in determining
the final calculation of Aggregate Merger Consideration pursuant to Section
1.06, (ii) was specifically reserved for in the Financial Statements, or (iii)
is set forth and specifically identified as a liability on the disclosure
schedules to this Agreement.

  

  

8.09. Acknowledgment by Buying Parties.

  

  

(a) Without limiting the representations and warranties made by the Company in
this Agreement, and without limiting the Buying Parties' rights to
indemnification hereunder, each Buying Party acknowledges that it has
conducted, to its satisfaction, an independent investigation and verification
of the financial condition, results of operations, assets, liabilities,
properties and projected operations of the Company and, in making its
determination to proceed with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
each of Parent and Merger Sub has relied on the results of its own independent
investigation and verification, in addition to the representations and
warranties of the Company expressly and specifically set forth in Article 3 of
this Agreement. SUCH REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES BY THE COMPANY CONSTITUTE
THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES TO PARENT AND MERGER SUB
IN CONNECTION WITH THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, AND EACH BUYING PARTY
UNDERSTANDS, ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ALL OTHER REPRESENTATIONS AND
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND OR NATURE, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE SPECIFICALLY
DISCLAIMED BY THE COMPANY, REPRESENTATIVE AND EACH SHAREHOLDER AND ARE NOT
BEING RELIED UPON BY ANY BUYING PARTY OR ANY OF THEIR RESPECTIVE
REPRESENTATIVES OR AFFILIATES.

  

  

 

(b) Each Buying Party understands, acknowledges and agrees that the
indemnification provided to Parent Indemnitees pursuant to, and subject to the
terms and conditions of, Section 8.02 will be the sole and exclusive remedy of
the Parent Indemnitees against any Shareholder or any other Person with
respect to (i) the subject matter of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby or (ii) any other matter relating to the Company, the
operation of its businesses, its assets or liabilities or any other
transaction or state of facts involving the Company and that the Parent
Indemnitees will have no other remedy or recourse with respect to any of the
foregoing other than pursuant to, and subject to the terms and conditions of,
Section 8.02. The Buying Parties acknowledge and agree that, subject to the
provisions of Section 8.02(f), the Parent Indemnitees may not avoid such
limitation on liability by (x) seeking damages for breach of contract, tort or
pursuant to any other theory of liability, all of which are hereby waived to
the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, or (y) asserting or
threatening any claim against any Person that is not a party (or a successor
to a party) for breaches of the representations, warranties and covenants
contained in this Agreement.

ARTICLE 9 
 

  

  

REPRESENTATIVE

  

  

9.01. Representative.

  

  

(a) Effective upon and by virtue of the Shareholder Approval, and without any
further act of any of the Shareholders, Representative shall be hereby
appointed as the representative of the Shareholders and as the attorney-in-
fact and agent for and on behalf of each Shareholder for purposes of this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreements. Representative will take such actions
under this Agreement and the Escrow Agreements and otherwise on behalf of such
Shareholders as Representative may deem necessary or appropriate in its
discretion in connection with or to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby, including (i) executing and delivering this Agreement, the
Escrow Agreements and any other ancillary documents and negotiating and
executing amendments, modifications, waivers or changes thereto (provided that
any waiver or amendment that shall adversely and disproportionately affect the
rights or obligations of any Shareholder as compared to other Shareholders
shall require the prior written consent of such Shareholder), (ii) taking all
actions and making all filings on behalf of such Shareholders with any
Governmental Body or other Person necessary to effect the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (iii) agreeing to, negotiating,
entering into settlements and compromises of, complying with Orders with
respect to, and otherwise administering and handling any claims under this
Agreement or the Escrow Agreements on behalf of the Shareholders, (iv) using
the Representative Expense Amount to satisfy costs, expenses and/or
liabilities of Representative in connection with matters related to this
Agreement and/or Escrow Agreements as Representative, and (v) taking all other
actions that are either necessary or appropriate in the judgment of
Representative for the accomplishment of the foregoing or contemplated by the
terms of this Agreement or the Escrow Agreements. Representative hereby
accepts such appointment. Representative shall use commercially reasonable
efforts based on contact information available to Representative to keep the
Shareholders reasonably informed with respect to actions of Representative
pursuant to the authority granted Representative under this Agreement which
actions have a material impact on the amounts payable to the Shareholders.
Each Shareholder shall promptly provide written notice to Representative of
any change of address of such Shareholder.

  

  

(b) A decision, act, consent or instruction of Representative hereunder shall
constitute a decision, act, consent or instruction of all Shareholders and
shall be final, binding and conclusive upon each of such Shareholders, and
Parent may rely upon any such decision, act, consent or instruction of
Representative as being the decision, act, consent or instruction of each and
every such Shareholder. Parent and the Escrow Agent shall be relieved from any
liability to any Person for any acts done by them in accordance with such
decision, act, consent or instruction of Representative.

  

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

39  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

(c) Representative will incur no liability with respect to any action taken or
suffered by any party in reliance upon any notice, direction, instruction,
consent, statement or other document believed by such Representative to be
genuine and to have been signed by the proper Person (and shall have no
responsibility to determine the authenticity thereof), nor for any other
action or inaction, except the deliberate fraud of Representative. In all
questions arising under this Agreement or the Escrow Agreements,
Representative may rely on the advice of outside counsel, and Representative
will not be liable to any Shareholder for anything done, omitted or suffered
in good faith by Representative based on such advice.

  

  

(d) If and to the extent that the Representative Expense Amount is not
sufficient to pay, or reimburse Representative for, the expenses incurred in
connection with the performance of duties hereunder by the Representatives,
the Shareholders shall severally (each based on its proportionate share of any
consideration paid or payable pursuant to this Agreement) but not jointly
indemnify Representative and hold Representative harmless against any such
excess costs or expense. The Shareholders shall severally (each based on its
proportionate share of any consideration paid or payable pursuant to this
Agreement) but not jointly indemnify Representative and hold Representative
harmless against any and all loss, liability or expense incurred, other than
as a result of deliberate fraud on the part of Representative, that arises
from or relates to the acceptance or administration of Representative\'s
duties hereunder, including the reasonable fees and expenses of any legal
counsel or other advisors reasonably retained by Representative. After release
of all Post-Closing Indemnity Escrow Funds and completion of the
Representatives duties hereunder, if and to the extent any portion of the
Representative Expense Amount is unspent, Representative will take reasonable
steps to distribute any such remaining portion as contemplated by Sections
1.06(a) and 1.06(b).

  

  

(e) At any time Shareholders representing at least seventy percent (70%) in
interest of the Shareholders may, by written consent, appoint a new
representative as Representative. Notice together with a copy of the written
consent appointing such new representative and bearing the signatures of
Shareholders of at least seventy percent (70%) in interest of the Shareholders
must be delivered to Parent and, if applicable, the Escrow Agent not less than
ten (10) days prior to such appointment. Such appointment will be effective
upon the later of the date indicated in the consent or the date such consent
is received by Parent and, if applicable, the Escrow Agent. For the purposes
of this Section 10.01, "seventy percent (70%) in interest of the Shareholders"
shall mean Shareholders representing in the aggregate at least 70% of the
percentage Shareholders\' interests in the any consideration paid or payable
pursuant to this Agreement.

  

  

  

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

40  

  

 

 

 

 

  

  

  

 

(f) In the event that Representative becomes unable or unwilling to continue
in his or its capacity as Representative, or if Representative resigns as a
Representative, Shareholders representing at least seventy percent (70%) in
interest of the Shareholders may, by written consent, appoint a new
representative as Representative. Notice and a copy of the written consent
appointing such new representative and bearing the signatures of the
Shareholders of at least seventy percent (70%) in interest of the Shareholders
must be delivered to Parent and, if applicable, the Escrow Agent. Such
appointment will be effective upon the later of the date indicated in the
consent or the date such consent is received by Parent and, if applicable, the
Escrow Agent.

  

  

(g) The grant of authority provided for herein (i) is coupled with an interest
and shall be irrevocable and survive the death, incompetency, bankruptcy or
liquidation of any Shareholder, and (ii) shall survive the consummation of the
Merger.

  

 

  

ARTICLE 10 
 

  

  

TAX MATTERS

  

  

10.01. Tax Matters. Neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall (nor
shall they cause any Affiliate to) make any election under Section 338 of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, (or any similar provision under
state, local or non-U.S. law) with respect to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. For the portion of the day of the Closing after the time of
Closing, other than the transactions expressly contemplated hereby, the Parent
will cause the Surviving Corporation to carry on its business only in the
ordinary course in the same manner as heretofore conducted. The parties will
cooperate with each other to provide each other with such assistance as may be
reasonably requested by them in connection with the preparation of any Tax
Returns, any Tax audit or other examination in connection with an
administrative or judicial proceeding involving a taxing authority relating to
Taxes, and the enforcement of the provisions of this Section 10.01. Such
cooperation will include providing records and information that are reasonably
relevant to any such matters and making employees available on a mutually
convenient basis to provide additional information. Any real property transfer
or gains tax, stamp tax, stock transfer tax, or other similar Tax imposed on
any party as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
any penalties or interest with respect to such amounts (collectively,
"Transfer Taxes") shall be remitted by the party legally responsible for
remitting such Taxes or charges. Parent shall file all necessary Tax Returns
and other documentation with respect to Transfer Taxes (except to the extent
such Tax Returns are required by law to be filed by a Shareholder).

  

  

  

  

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

41  

  

 

 

 

 

  

  

  

10.02. Tax Indemnification.

  

  

(a) From the Post-Closing Indemnity Escrow Funds, the Parent shall be
indemnified and held harmless from and against, any loss, claim, liability,
expense, or other damage attributable to (i) all Taxes (or the non-payment
thereof) of Company and its Subsidiaries for all Taxable periods ending on or
before the Closing Date and the portion through the end of the Closing Date
for any Taxable Period that includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date
("Pre-Closing Tax Period"), other than Taxes arising out of or relating to any
[***]† Matter or arising as a result of the payment of Transaction Expenses or
of The Ware Firm Payout Amount as contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) all
Taxes of any member of an affiliated, consolidated, combined or unitary group
of which Company or any of its Subsidiaries (or any predecessor of any of the
foregoing) is or was a member on or prior to the Closing Date, including
pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 or any analogous or similar
state, local, or foreign law or regulation, and (iii) any and all Taxes of any
Person (other than Company and its Subsidiaries) imposed on Company or any of
its Subsidiaries as a transferee or successor, by contract or pursuant to any
law, rule, or regulation, which Taxes relate to an event or transaction
occurring before the Closing other than an event or transaction that is or
that result from any [***]† Matter or the payment of Transaction Expenses or
of The Ware Firm Payout Amount as contemplated by this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any amounts owed to the Parent pursuant to this
Section 10.02 shall be reduced by (A) any Tax refunds actually received by the
Parent that relate to the Taxes of the Company for the Pre-Closing Tax Period,
(B) any Tax benefit actually realized by the Parent or the Company relating to
the Pre-Closing Tax Period (or that could have been realized but for any
reduction of any Tax benefit as a result of any [***]† Matter or as a result
of the satisfaction of Transaction Expenses and The Ware Firm Payout Amount as
contemplated by this Agreement) or due to compensation or other deductions
arising out of the payment of Transaction Expenses (including but not limited

12.05. Assignment. This Agreement and all of the provisions hereof will be
binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective
successors and permitted assigns, except that neither this Agreement nor any
of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder may be assigned or delegated
by any party without the prior written consent of the other parties; provided,
however, that Parent may assign this Agreement to any Affiliate of Parent
without the prior written consent of the Company but any such transfer or
assignment will not relieve any Buying Party of its obligations hereunder.

  

  

12.06. Severability. Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement will
be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable
Law, but if any provision of this Agreement is held to be prohibited by or
invalid under applicable Law, such provision will be ineffective only to the
extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without invalidating the remainder
of such provision or the remaining provisions of this Agreement, and the
parties will amend or otherwise modify this Agreement to replace any
prohibited or invalid provision with an effective and valid provision that
gives effect to the intent of the parties to the maximum extent permitted by
applicable Law.

  

  

12.07. No Strict Construction. The language used in this Agreement will be
deemed to be the language chosen by the parties to express their mutual
intent, and no rule of strict construction will be applied against any Person.
The disclosure schedules attached to this Agreement have been arranged for
purposes of convenience in separately titled sections corresponding to
sections of this Agreement; provided, however, that each section of the
disclosure schedules will be deemed to incorporate by reference all
information disclosed in any other section of the disclosure schedules where
it is reasonably apparent that such disclosure is relevant. Capitalized terms
used in the disclosure schedules and not otherwise defined therein have the
meanings given to them in this Agreement. The specification of any dollar
amount or the inclusion of any item in the representations and warranties
contained in this Agreement or the disclosure schedules or Exhibits is not
intended to imply that the amounts, or higher or lower amounts, or the items
so included, or other items, are or are not required to be disclosed or are
within or outside of the ordinary course of business, and no party will use
the fact of the setting of the amounts or the fact of the inclusion of any
item in this Agreement or the disclosure schedules or Exhibits in any dispute
or controversy between the parties as to whether any obligation, item or
matter not described or included in this Agreement or in any disclosure
schedule or Exhibit is or is not required to be disclosed or is within or
outside of the ordinary course of business for purposes of this Agreement. The
information contained in this Agreement and in the disclosure schedules and
Exhibits is disclosed solely for purposes of this Agreement, and no
information contained herein or therein will be deemed to be an admission by
any party to any third party of any matter whatsoever (including, without
limitation, any violation of law or breach of contract).

  

  

12.08. Amendment and Waiver. Any provision of this Agreement or the disclosure
schedules or Exhibits may be amended or waived only in a writing signed by
Parent, the Company and Representative; provided, that after the Shareholder
Approval has been obtained, there shall be not amendment that pursuant to the
DGCL requires further approval by such Shareholders without the further
approval of such Shareholders. No waiver of any provision hereunder or any
breach or default thereof will extend to or affect in any way any other
provision or prior or subsequent breach or default.

  

  

12.09. Complete Agreement. This Agreement and the documents referred to herein
(including the Confidentiality Agreement) contain the complete agreement
between the parties and supersede any prior understandings, agreements or
representations by or between the parties, written or oral, which may have
related to the subject matter hereof in any way.

  

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

56  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  

12.10. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts (including by means of telecopied signature pages, electronic
transmission in portable document format (.pdf)) or electronic mail (any such
delivery, an "Electronic Delivery")), any one of which need not contain the
signatures of more than one party, but all such counterparts taken together
will constitute one and the same instrument. Any documents delivered through
the use of Electronic Delivery will be treated in all manner and respects as
an original agreement or instrument and will be considered to have the same
binding legal effect as if it were the original signed version thereof
delivered in person. No party hereto or to any such agreement or instrument
will raise the use of Electronic Delivery to deliver a signature or the fact
that any signature or agreement or instrument was transmitted or communicated
through the use of Electronic Delivery as a defense to the formation of a
Contract, and each such party forever waives any such defense, except to the
extent such defense related to lack of authenticity.

  

  

12.11. Obligations of Parent and Merger Sub. The obligations of Parent and
Merger Sub hereunder are jointly and severally guaranteed by each other.

  

  

12.12. Governing Law. All matters relating to the interpretation,
construction, validity and enforcement of this Agreement will be governed by
and construed in accordance with the domestic laws of the State of New York
without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule
(whether of the State of New York or any other jurisdiction) that would cause
the application of laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of New York.

  

  

12.13. Consent to Jurisdiction and Service of Process. The parties to this
Agreement submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state courts located in
the City of New York, NY or the United States District Court located in
Manhattan, New York in respect of the interpretation and enforcement of the
provisions of this Agreement and any related agreement, certificate or other
document delivered in connection herewith and by this Agreement waive, and
agree not to assert, any defense in any action for the interpretation or
enforcement of this Agreement and any related agreement, certificate or other
document delivered in connection herewith, that they are not subject thereto
or that such action may not be brought or is not maintainable in such courts
or that this Agreement may not be enforced in or by such courts or that their
property is exempt or immune from execution, that the action is brought in an
inconvenient forum, or that the venue of the action is improper. Service of
process with respect thereto may be made upon any party by mailing a copy
thereof by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, to such party at its
address as provided in Section 12.04.

  

  

12.14. Waiver of Jury Trial. Each party hereby acknowledges and agrees that
any controversy which may arise under this Agreement is likely to involve
complicated and difficult issues, and therefore each such party hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally waives any right such party may have to a
trial by jury in respect of any litigation directly or indirectly arising out
of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Each party certifies and acknowledges that (i) no representative,
agent or attorney of any other party has represented, expressly or otherwise,
that such other party would not, in the event of litigation, seek to enforce
the foregoing waiver, (ii) each such party understands and has considered the
implications of this waiver, (iii) each such party makes this waiver
voluntarily, and (iv) each such party has been induced to enter into this
agreement by, among other things, the mutual waivers and certifications in
this Section 12.14.

  

  

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

57  

  

 

 

 

 

  

  

  

12.15. Third Party Beneficiaries. No Person other than the parties will have
any rights, remedies, obligations or benefits under any provision of this
Agreement, except for (i) the present or former directors and officers of the
Company with respect to Section 6.02, (ii) the present or former officers,
directors, employees, member, owners and Affiliates of the Company,
Representative and any Shareholder and other Persons named in Article 8 with
respect to the matters covered thereby, (iii) Baker Communications Fund II
(QP), L.P. and its Affiliates with respect to Section 11.01, (iv) any
Shareholder with respect to Article 1 , Article 6, Article 8 and Article 9 and
(v) the Shareholders and Prior Company Counsel with respect to Section 12.16.

  

  

12.16. Representation of the Shareholders and their Affiliates. Each of the
Parent, and the Company agrees that it and, after the Closing, the Surviving
Corporation shall take all steps necessary to ensure that any privilege
attaching as a result of Wilson Sonsini Goodrich and Rosati, PC, Ropes and Gray
LLP or other counsel from time to time retained by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries prior to the Closing (collectively, "Prior Company Counsel"),
whether or not in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, shall survive the Closing and shall remain in effect, provided that
from and after the Closing such privilege shall be controlled by Baker
Communications Fund II (QP), L.P. and not the Surviving Corporation. In
addition, Parent waives, and agrees to cause the Surviving Corporation and
each of its Subsidiaries to waive, any conflicts that may arise in connection
with (i) Prior Company Counsel representing Representative or any Shareholder
after the Closing and (ii) the communication by Prior Company Counsel to
Representative or any Shareholder in any such representation, of any fact
known to Prior Company Counsel, including without limitation in connection
with any negotiation, arbitration, mediation, litigation or other proceeding
in any way related to a dispute with Parent or the Surviving Corporation
following the Closing, and the disclosure of any such fact in connection with
any process undertaken for the resolution of such dispute. Parent acknowledges
that it and the Company have had the opportunity to discuss and obtain
adequate information concerning the significance and material risks of, and
reasonable available alternatives to, the waivers, permissions and other
provisions of this Section 12.16, including without limitation the opportunity
to consult with counsel other than Prior Company Counsel. This Section 12.16
is for the benefit of Representative and the Shareholders and Prior Company
Counsel. The Shareholders and Prior Company Counsel are intended third-party
beneficiaries of this Section 12.16. This Section 12.16 shall be irrevocable,
and no term of this Section 12.16 may be amended, waived or modified, without
the prior written consent of Representative and the Prior Company Counsel
affected thereby.

12.17. Deliveries to Buying Parties; Disclaimer. Each Buying Party agrees and
acknowledges that all documents or other items included in the electronic
dataroom or otherwise delivered to any Buying Party or their respective
representatives (including, without limitation, Parent's accountants and any
of Parent's legal counsel) will be deemed to be delivered to each Buying Party
for all purposes hereunder. Each Buying Party acknowledges and agrees that
none of the Company, Representative, any Shareholder or any of their
respective Affiliates or representatives has made any representation or
warranty, express or implied, as to the Company or as to the accuracy or
completeness of any information regarding the Company furnished or made
available to any Buying Party or their respective representatives, except as
expressly set forth in this Agreement and, except as set forth in this
Agreement, none of the Company, Representative, any Shareholder or any of

liability to any Buying Party or any other Person resulting from the

any such information or any information, documents or material made available
to Buying Parties. Each Buying Party further agrees that none of the Company,
Representative, any Shareholder or any of their respective past, present or
future direct or indirect Affiliates, directors, officers, members, employees
or representatives will have or be subject to any liability or indemnification
obligation (whether in contract or in tort) to any Buying Party or any other
Person resulting from the distribution to any Buying Party or any Buying
Party's use of, any such information, including any informational material
prepared by the Company or its advisors or representatives and any
information, document or material made available to any Buying Party or their
respective Affiliates or representatives in certain "data rooms" and online
"data sites," management presentations or any other form in expectation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

  

12.18. Conflict Between Transaction Documents. The parties agree and
acknowledge that to the extent any terms and provisions of this Agreement are
in any way inconsistent with or in conflict with any term, condition or
provision of any other agreement, document or instrument contemplated hereby,
this Agreement will govern and control.

  

  

12.19. Specific Performance. The parties agree that irreparable damage would
occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed by Parent, Merger Sub or the Company, as applicable, in accordance
with their specific terms or were otherwise breached by Parent, Merger Sub or
the Company, as applicable. It is accordingly agreed that Parent, Merger Sub,
Representative, the Company and the express third party beneficiaries
described in Section 12.15), as applicable, will be entitled to seek an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement by any party
hereto and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof against
