 **AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER**

 



 

 **THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER** (this " ** _Agreement_** ") is made and
entered into as of May 27, 2014 by and among **THE SPECTRANETICS CORPORATION**
, a Delaware corporation (" ** _Parent_** "), **SAA MERGER SUB, INC.**, a
Delaware corporation (" ** _Merger Sub_** "), **ANGIOSCORE INC.** , a Delaware
corporation (the " ** _Company_** "), and Shareholder Representative Services
LLC, a Colorado limited liability company solely in its capacity as the
Securityholders Representative. Certain other capitalized terms used in this
Agreement are defined in **Exhibit A**. Parent, Merger Sub, the Company and
the Securityholders Representative are occasionally referred to herein as the
"parties" and each a "party."

 



 

 **RECITALS**

 



 

 **A.** Parent, Merger Sub, and the Company intend to effect a merger of
Merger Sub with and into the Company in accordance with this Agreement and the
Delaware General Corporation Law (the " ** _Merger_** "). Upon consummation of
the Merger, Merger Sub will cease to exist, and the Company will become a
wholly owned subsidiary of Parent;

 



 

 **B.** The respective boards of directors of the Company, Parent and Merger
Sub deem it advisable and in the best interests of their respective
stockholders that the parties consummate the transactions contemplated hereby,
upon the terms and subject to the conditions provided for herein;

 



 

 **C**. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and also to prescribe
various conditions to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby; and

 



 

 **D**. Parent shall place a portion of the consideration otherwise payable by
Parent in connection with the Merger in escrow as security for the
indemnification and other obligations of the Company Securityholders. The
parties hereby agree as follows:

 



 

 **1.** ** ****DESCRIPTION OF TRANSACTION**.

 



 

1.1 **The Merger; Effective Time; Closing; Surviving Corporation;
Restructuring**.

 



 

 **(a)** ** ****Merger of Merger Sub into the Company**. Upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Effective Time
(as defined below), Merger Sub shall merge with and into the Company, and the
separate existence of Merger Sub shall cease. The Company will continue as the
surviving corporation in the Merger (the " ** _Surviving Corporation_** ").
The Merger has the effects set forth in this Agreement and in the applicable
provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law.

 



 

 **(b)** ** ****Effective Time**. Simultaneously with, or as promptly as
practicable after, the Closing, Parent shall file with the Secretary of State
of the State of Delaware a certificate of merger in substantially the form
attached hereto as **Exhibit B** (the

 



      
 

 



 

" ** _Certificate of Merger_** ") in such form as required by, and executed in
accordance with the relevant provisions of, the Delaware General Corporation
Law. The Merger becomes effective when Parent files the Certificate of Merger
with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, or at such other time as
Parent and the Company shall agree and specify in the Certificate of Merger
(the " ** _Effective Time_** ").

 



 

 **(c)** ** ****Closing**. Subject to the satisfaction or waiver of all of the
conditions to the Closing contained in _Section 6_, the closing of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the " ** _Closing_** ") shall
take place at the offices of Faegre Baker Daniels LLP, as soon as practicable
(but not later than three Business Days) after the satisfaction or waiver of
the conditions to the Closing contained in _Section 6_ (other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the fulfillment or waiver of those conditions), unless another date
or place is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto; _provided, however,_
that Parent shall have the right to defer the Closing to June 30, 2014 but
shall be deemed to have waived any remaining conditions precedent under
_Section 6.2_ if it makes such election (other than those conditions that by
their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
fulfillment or waiver of those conditions). The date on which the Closing
actually occurs is hereinafter referred to as the " ** _Closing Date_** _._ "
All proceedings to be taken, all documents to be executed and delivered by the
Parties, and all payments to be made and consideration to be delivered, at the
Closing is deemed to have been taken and executed simultaneously, and, except
as permitted hereunder, no proceedings are deemed taken nor any documents
executed or delivered until all have been taken, executed and delivered in
accordance with this Agreement.

 



 

 **(d)** ** ****Surviving Corporation**.

 



 

 **(i)** ** **At the Effective Time, the parties shall cause the Amended and
Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as such may be amended from time to
time (the " ** _Company Charter_** ") to be amended so as to read in its
entirety as the certificate of incorporation of Merger Sub and, as so amended,
such Company Charter is the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein and by
applicable Legal Requirement.

 



 

 **(ii)** ** **At the Effective Time, and without any further action on the
part of the Company and Merger Sub, the Amended and Restated Bylaws of the
Company is amended so as to read in their entirety as the bylaws of Merger Sub
and, as so amended, are the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until
thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Legal
Requirement.

 



 

 **(iii)** ** **Subject to applicable Legal Requirement, effective as of, and
immediately following, the Effective Time, the board of directors of the
Surviving Corporation consists of the members of the board of directors of
Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time, each to hold office until
the earlier of his or her resignation, removal or death or until his or her
successor is duly elected and qualified, as the case may be, in accordance
with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation
and applicable Legal Requirement.

 



      
 

 



 

 **(iv)** ** **Effective as of, and immediately following, the Effective Time,
the officers of the Surviving Corporation are the officers of Merger Sub
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 



 

 **(v)** ** **Effective as of, and immediately following, the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation shall possess all properties, rights, privileges,
powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub, and all of the claims,
obligations, liabilities, debts and duties of the Company and Merger Sub are
the claims, obligations, liabilities, debts and duties of the Surviving
Corporation.

 



 

 **(e)** ** ****Restructuring. **If Parent Merger Shares are to be issued as
part of the Aggregate Merger Consideration in accordance with _Section
1.3(a)(ii)_ hereof, the parties shall cooperate and use commercially
reasonable efforts to restructure the Merger so that it qualifies as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. To the

 **(i)** ** **$115,000,000, such amount to be payable in cash,

 



 

 **(ii)** ** **_plus_ $115,000,000, such amount to be payable in cash (such

Merger Consideration_** "); _provided, that_ , if (i) Parent has made
commercially reasonable efforts to consummate a closing of the convertible
debt offering contemplated by the Prospectus on terms acceptable to Parent
(the " ** _Debt Offering_** "), and (ii) despite such efforts the Debt

this _Section 1.3(a)(ii)_ may, subject to the provisions of _Section 1.1(e)_
and _Section 5.9_, be paid by the issuance of the Parent Merger Shares to the
Company Securityholders. " ** _Parent Merger Shares_** " means the number of

the following information, as of the Closing Date: (i) the names of all
Company Securityholders (and such other information as the Paying Agent may

and the wire transfer information of each such Person; (iv) the aggregate
amount of Company Debt along with a breakdown by lender, amount of Company

Share Amount and the amounts that the Company Securityholders are entitled to
receive pursuant to _Sections 1.3_ , _1.4_ , _1.6, 1.7_ , _1.11_ and _1.12_ is
calculated by allocating the Aggregate Merger Consideration in accordance with
(i) the liquidation provisions set forth in the Company Charter, (ii) with
respect to each Cashed-Out Option, the calculation of the Vested Option
Payment Amount in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement
and the respective Option Termination Agreement, (iii) with respect to each
Cashed-Out Warrant, the calculation of the Company Warrant Payment Amount in
accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the respective

(iv) with respect to each Change of Control Plan Rights, the calculation of
the Aggregate Plan Payment Amount in accordance with the terms and conditions

 **(c)** ** ****Escrow Fund and Representative Fund**.

 



 

 **(i)** ** **Parent shall withhold from the Aggregate Merger Consideration
and deposit in separate accounts with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association
(the " ** _Escrow Agent_** ") (A) $18,000,000 of the Aggregate Merger
Consideration (the " ** _Indemnity Escrow Amount_** ") from the Aggregate
Merger Consideration (the " ** _Indemnity Escrow Account_** "), _plus_ (B)
$5,000,000 of the Aggregate Merger Consideration (the " ** _Special Escrow
Amount_** ", together with the Indemnity Escrow Amount, the " ** _Escrow

Amount may be used solely for the purpose of securing the indemnification
obligations of the Company Securityholders set forth in _Section 8.1(b)_ and
_(c)_ of this Agreement and _Section 1.5_ hereof and satisfying the
obligations of the Company Securityholders pursuant to _Section 1.4(c)_ and
_(d)_ hereof, if any; and the Special Escrow Amount may be used solely for
the purpose of satisfying the obligations of the Company Securityholders
pursuant to _Schedule 1.3(c)_. Subject to a reserve for pending claims, the
terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, the Escrow
Agreement shall provide for the release of payments from the Escrow Fund on
the following dates (each such date of release, the " ** _Release Date_** "):
(i) with respect to the Indemnity Escrow Amount, the 12- month anniversary of
the Closing Date; and (ii) with respect to the Special Escrow Amount, the
24-month anniversary of the Closing Date. Each release and payment of the
Escrow Fund shall occur within five Business Days after the applicable Release
Date. Any release and payment of the Escrow Fund to Company Securityholders is
made in accordance with each Company Securityholders Pro Rata Portion as set
forth on the Consideration Spreadsheet. All fees, costs, and expenses of the
Escrow Agent with respect to the Escrow Fund shall be borne 50% by Parent and
50% by the Company Securityholders (in accordance with each Company
Securityholders respective Pro Rata Portion), with the portion payable by the
Company Securityholders being treated as a Specified Transaction Expense
hereunder.

 



 

 **(ii)** ** **Parent shall withhold $200,000 of the Aggregate Merger
Consideration (the " ** _Representative Fund Amount_** ") from the Aggregate
Merger Consideration and deposit the Representative Fund Amount in an account
of the Securityholders Representative for purposes of funding the reasonable,
out-of-pocket costs and expenses of the Securityholders Representative
incurred in the administration of the services contemplated in _Section 1.13_
hereof (the " ** _Representative Account_** ").

 



 

 **(d)** ** ****Earnout Amount**. The Aggregate Merger Consideration will be
increased by up to the amounts specified in this _Section 1.3(d)_
(collectively, the **_"Earnout Amount_** ").

 



 

 **(i)** ** **The Earnout Amount includes the following:

 



 

 **a)** ** **Parent shall make annual payments for Net Sales of the Companys
Products occurring in calendar years 2015, 2016 and 2017, equal to a the
product

 



      
 

 



 

of 2.0 times each years annual increase in Net Sales in excess of 10% over
the highest preceding year Net Sales (each a " ** _Revenue Milestone
Payment_** " and collectively, the " ** _Revenue Milestone Payments_** "). No
such Revenue Milestone Payments are payable if the year-over-year change in
Net Sales is negative. Furthermore, under no circumstances may the aggregate
Revenue Milestone Payments exceed $50,000,000. By way of example only, if Net
Sales are $62 million in 2014, $74 million in 2015, $70 million in 2016, and
$112 million in 2017, the Revenue Milestone Payment for 2015 would be $11.6
million, there would be no Revenue Milestone Payment due for 2016, and the
Revenue Milestone Payment for 2017 would be $38.4 million. For purposes of
this _Section 1.3(d)_, " ** _Net Sales_** " means an amount equal to (i)
aggregate gross sales generated by the sale of Company Products, less (ii)
deductions for returns and allowances for damaged or missing goods, as
determined in accordance with GAAP, and " ** _Company Products_** " means the
products of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries identified on _Schedule
1.3(d)_ attached hereto; it being understood that any such products whether
commercialized by the Company or the Surviving Corporation, Parent or any
Affiliate thereof constitutes a "Company Product" for purposes hereof.

 



 

 **b)** ** **Parent will make a one-time payment of $5,000,000 as additional
Aggregate Merger Consideration upon Parent or its Affiliates obtaining
European CE Mark approval of the Drug Coated AngioSculpt Product for use in

Mark Coronary Milestone Payment_** ").

 



 

 **c)** ** **Parent will make a one-time payment of $5,000,000 as additional
Aggregate Merger Consideration upon Parent or its Affiliates obtaining

Mark Peripheral Milestone Payment_** ", and together with the AngioSculpt CE
Mark Coronary Milestone Payment, " ** _AngioSculpt CE Mark Milestone
Payments_** ").

 



 

 **d)** ** **Parent will make a one-time payment of $15,000,000 as additional
Aggregate Merger Consideration upon Parent or its Affiliates obtaining U.S.

together with the AngioSculpt CE Mark Milestone Payments, the " **
_AngioSculpt Milestone Payments_ "**, and together with the Revenue Milestone
Payments, collectively, the " ** _Earnout Payments_** ").

 



 

 **(ii)** ** **For the period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on
December 31, 2017 (the " ** _Earnout Period_** "), Parent shall separately
track the sales of the Company Products in order to calculate the Earnout
Payments.

 



 

 **(iii)** ** **For each quarterly period after the Closing Date and ending on
December 31, 2017, Parent shall provide to the Securityholders Representative
a report setting forth in reasonable detail the progress made during the
quarter towards achieving the Earnout Payments (the " ** _Earnout Payment
Progress Report_** "). The Earnout Payment Progress Report shall show, with
respect to the Revenue Milestone Payments, Net Sales by Company Product for
each month during the quarterly period, as well as year to date and Closing
Date to date. The Earnout Payment Progress Report shall show, with respect to
the AngioSculpt

 



      
 

 



 

Milestone Payments, sufficient information to enable the Securityholders
Representative to assess the progress during the quarterly period year to date
and Closing Date to date with respect thereto. Upon delivery of written notice
and during normal business hours, the Securityholders Representative and its
Representatives may, at Securityholders Representatives expense (on behalf
of the Company Securityholders), audit the books and records covering the
Company Products and associated Net Sales, except that the foregoing audit
right may be exercised no more than once in any 12 month period. Parent shall
and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and any of their Affiliates to
cooperate with the Securityholders Representative in conducting any such
audit.

 



 

 **(iv)** ** **Parent shall spend at least $6,700,000 on clinical, regulatory
and engineering programs towards the achievement of the CE Mark approval for
the Drug Coated AngioSculpt Product by December 31, 2016; _however,_ Parent is
not required to spend such amounts if it makes a CE Mark Unlikeliness
Determination or receives CE Mark approval for the Drug Coated AngioSculpt
Product in the coronary and peripheral arteries. Parent shall spend at least
$2,800,000 on clinical, regulatory and engineering programs towards the
achievement of the IDE approval for the Drug Coated AngioSculpt Product by
December 31, 2016; however, Parent is not required to spend such amounts if it
makes an IDE Unlikeliness Determination or receives IDE approval for the Drug
Coated AngioSculpt Product in the coronary or peripheral arteries.

 



 

 **(v)** ** **If Parents spends less than the amount set forth in _Section
1.3(d)(iv)_ on clinical, regulatory and engineering programs toward CE Mark
approval for the Drug Coated AngioSculpt Product between the Closing and
December 31, 2016 (and Parent has not made a CE Mark Unlikeliness
Determination or received CE Mark approval for the Drug Coated AngioSculpt
Product in the coronary and peripheral arteries), Parent will make an
additional cash payment equal to the unpaid AngioSculpt CE Mark Milestone
Payments. If Parent spends less than the amount set forth in _Section
1.3(d)(iv)_ on clinical, regulatory and engineering programs toward IDE
approval for the Drug Coated AngioSculpt Product between the Closing and
December 31, 2016 (and Parent has not made an IDE Unlikeliness Determination
or received IDE approval for the Drug Coated AngioSculpt Product in the
coronary or peripheral arteries), Parent will make an additional cash payment
equal to the AngioSculpt IDE Milestone Payment. All such additional payments
contemplated in this _Section 1.3(d)(v)_ constitute additional "Earnout
Amount" and are intended to be treated as additional Aggregate Merger
Consideration for all purposes under this Agreement.

 



 

 **(vi)** ** **Parent shall not offer trade, quantity or cash discounts,
rebates, refunds, chargebacks or other allowances with respect to any Company
Product during the Earnout Period that are inconsistent in any material
respect with those discounts, rebates, refunds, chargebacks or other
allowances generally offered by Parent with respect to its products, viewed as
a whole, during the Earnout Period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing
contained in this _Section 1.3(d)(vi)_ prevents Parent from reasonably
responding to competitive or market changes following the Closing that are
reasonably likely to materially adversely affect Parent without such response.

 



 

 **(vii)** ** **Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to materially
implement the integration plan previously provided to the Company.
Notwithstanding

 



      
 

 



 

the foregoing, nothing contained in this _Section 1.3(d)(vii)_ prevents
Parent from responding to changes or circumstances following the Closing that
may adversely affect Parent without such response.

 



 

 **(viii)** ** **In the event Parent divests any material portion of the
Companys business or of a Parent Change of Control on or before December 31,
2017, Parent shall provide written notice thereof to the Securityholders
Representative (the " ** _Acceleration Notice_** "). Within 20 days from
delivery of the Acceleration Notice, the Securityholders Representative shall
have the right to elect that Parent (or its successor) make the Accelerated
Payment (as defined below) to the Company Securityholders within 10 days of
the closing of such divestiture or Parent Change of Control (the " **
_Election_** "). If the Securityholders Representative does not make the
Election within such 20-day period, the Securityholders Representative shall
have been deemed to waive the Company Securityholders right to the
Accelerated Payment and the Earnout Payments shall remain enforceable
according to their terms. Upon the making of the Election, the Company
Securityholders are only entitled to the Accelerated Payment and are not
entitled to any other Revenue Milestone Payments or AngioSculpt CE Mark
Milestone Payments. The AngioSculpt IDE Milestone Payment remains enforceable
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. " ** _Accelerated Payment_** "
means an amount equal to (A) the Maximum Revenue Milestone Payments (as
defined below) as of the effective time of the Parent Change of Control plus
any Revenue Earnout Payments previously earned but unpaid, _plus_ (B) if the
Parent Change of Control occurs prior to January 1, 2017 and if both
AngioSculpt CE Mark Milestone Payments have not been paid, an amount equal to
the unpaid AngioSculpt CE Mark Milestone Payments. " ** _Maximum Revenue
Milestone Payments_** " means an amount equal to $50,000,000 if such a
divestiture or Parent Change of Control occurs on or before December 31, 2015;
$41,000,000 if such a divestiture or Parent Change of Control occurs during
2016; and $25,000,000 if such a divestiture or Parent Change of Control occurs
during 2017.

 



 

 **(ix)** ** **Subject to Parents above undertaking in this _Section
1.3(d)_, Parent may operate the Company as it chooses, in its sole discretion,
and is not under any obligation to provide any specific level of investment or
financial assistance to the Company or its products or to undertake any
specific actions (or to refrain from taking any specific actions) with respect
to the operation of the Company.

 



 

 **(x)** ** **Parent shall pay the Earnout Payments in cash. Each time a
determination of the Earnout Payment owed is made by Parent, the
Securityholders Representative shall update the Consideration Spreadsheet and
deliver a copy thereof to Parent. Parent shall make any payment of the Earnout
Amount to the Company Securityholders in accordance with each Company
Securityholders Pro Rata Portion as set forth on the Consideration
Spreadsheet. Except as set forth elsewhere in this _Section 1.3(d)_, Parent
shall make all Earnout Payments to be made pursuant to this _Section 1.3(d)_
on or before the 10th Business Day of the month following the determination of
the amounts owed, if any, and shall be paid by Parent (or an Affiliate of
Parent) to the Paying Agent for the benefit of the Company Securityholders
(other than the Cashed-Out Optionholders and Change of Control Plan
Participants) or to the Surviving Corporation for the benefit of the Cashed-
Out Optionholders and Change of Control Plan Participants. The parties will
treat any payment pursuant to this _Section 1.3(d)_ as an adjustment to the
Aggregate Merger Consideration. Parent may reduce any

 



      
 

 



 

payment of the Earnout Amount by the amount of any employer Taxes attributable
to such payments to Cashed-Out Optionholders and Change of Control Plan
Participants (in addition to the other withholding obligations and rights
under _Section 1.9_).

 



 

 **(xi)** ** **As soon as practicable following achievement of an Earnout
Payment, but in no event later than 10 Business Days thereafter, Parent shall
prepare and deliver to the Securityholders Representative a notice of such
achievement and the calculation thereof (each, an " ** _Earnout Notice_** ").
The Securityholders Representative may review all records, work papers, and
calculations that are reasonably necessary for the purpose of reviewing the
Earnout Notice. The Securityholders Representative has 30 days after delivery
of the Earnout Notice in which to notify Parent in writing (such notice, a "
** _Earnout Dispute Notice_** ") of any discrepancy in, or disagreement with,
the items reflected on the Earnout Notice (and specifying the amount in
dispute and setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for such discrepancy
or disagreement), and upon agreement by Parent regarding the adjustment
requested by the Securityholders Representative, make an appropriate
adjustment thereto. If the Securityholders Representative does not deliver a
Earnout Dispute Notice to Parent during such 30 day period, the Earnout Notice
is deemed accepted in the form presented to the Securityholders
Representative. If the Securityholders Representative timely delivers a
Earnout Dispute Notice and Parent and the Securityholders Representative do
not agree, within 15 days after timely delivery of the Earnout Dispute Notice,
to resolve any discrepancy or disagreement therein, either party may submit
the discrepancy or disagreement for review and final determination by the
Independent Accounting Firm. The review by the Independent Accounting Firm is
limited to the discrepancies and disagreements set forth in the Earnout
Dispute Notice, and the Independent Accounting Firm shall resolve such
discrepancies and disagreements and determine the Earnout Payment (A) in
writing, (B) to the extent applicable in accordance with GAAP, (C) with
respect to any specific discrepancy or disagreement, no greater than the
higher amount calculated by Parent or the Securityholders Representative, as
the case may be, and no lower than the lower amount calculated by Parent or
the Securityholders Representative as the case may be (and, in any event, no
greater than the amounts specified in _Section 1.3(d)_), (D) as promptly as
practical after the submission of such discrepancies and disagreements to the
Independent Accounting Firm (but in no event later than 30 days after the date
of submission), and (E) final and binding upon, and non-appealable by, the
parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns for all purposes
hereof, and not subject to collateral attack for any reason absent manifest
error or fraud. The Company Securityholders shall pay a portion of the fees
and expenses of the Independent Accounting Firm equal to 100% multiplied by a
fraction, the numerator of which is the amount of disputed amounts submitted
to the Independent Accounting Firm that are resolved in favor of Parent (that
being the difference between the Independent Accounting Firms determination
and Securityholders Representatives determination) and the denominator of
which is the total amount of disputed amounts submitted to the Independent
Accounting Firm (that being the sum total by which Parents determination and
Securityholders Representatives determination differ from the determination
of the Independent Accounting Firm). Parent shall pay that portion of the fees
and expenses of the Independent Accounting Firm that the Company
Securityholders are not required to pay hereunder. In addition, the
Securityholders Representative shall have the right, based on review of the
Earnout Payment Progress Report or its audit rights specified in clause (iii)
above, to make a demand for payment of an Earnout Payment and, in such case,
any agreement with respect to

 



      
 

 



 

such Earnout Payment shall be resolved in accordance with the procedures set
forth above in this clause (xi).

 



 

1.4 **Closing Date Net Working Capital Adjustment**.

 



 

 **(a)** ** **The Company shall deliver to Parent the Companys good-faith
estimate of the Closing Date Net Working Capital (the " ** _Estimated Closing
Date Net Working Capital_** ") and a good faith estimate of the corresponding
Adjustment Amount no later than three Business Days prior to the Closing Date
(the " ** _Estimated Closing Date Net Working Capital Statement_** "). The
Company shall base such estimate on the Companys books and records, the best
reasonable estimate of the management of the Company, and other reasonably
reliable information then available.

 



 

 **(b)** ** **The parties shall base the Adjustment Amount paid on the Closing
Date (the " ** _Estimated Adjustment Amount_** ") on the Estimated Closing
Date Net Working Capital. The parties will not know the exact Adjustment
Amount as of the Closing Date and shall adjust the Adjustment Amount
determined on the Closing Date on the basis set forth herein. Accordingly, as
soon as practicable following the Closing Date, but in no event later than 60
days after the Closing Date, Parent shall prepare and deliver to the
Securityholders Representative (i) an unaudited balance sheet of the Company
as of 11:59 PM Pacific time on the date immediately prior to the Closing Date
(the " ** _Closing Date Balance Sheet_** ") prepared in accordance with GAAP
(as adjusted by the terms of this Agreement) and applied on a consistent basis
with the audited Company Financial Statements for the most recent fiscal year
end, (ii) a determination of the Closing Date Net Working Capital, and (iii) a
statement setting forth the determination of the resulting Adjustment Amount
(the " ** _Closing Date Net Working Capital Statement_** ").

 



 

 **(c)** ** **The Securityholders Representative and Parent may review all
records, work papers, and calculations that are reasonably necessary for the
purpose of reviewing the Estimated Closing Date Net Working Capital Statement,
the Closing Date Balance Sheet, and the Closing Date Net Working Capital
Statement. The Securityholders Representative has 30 days after delivery of
the Closing Date Net Working Capital Statement in which to notify Parent in
writing (such notice, a " ** _Closing Date Net Working Capital Dispute
Notice_** ") of any discrepancy in, or disagreement with, the items reflected
on the Closing Date Net Working Capital Statement (and specifying the amount
in dispute and setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for such
discrepancy or disagreement), and upon agreement by the Parent regarding the
adjustment requested by the Securityholders Representative, make an
appropriate adjustment thereto. If the Securityholders Representative does
not deliver a Closing Date Net Working Capital Dispute Notice to the Parent
during such 30 day period, the Closing Date Net Working Capital Statement is
deemed accepted in the form presented to the Securityholders Representative.
If the Securityholders Representative timely delivers a Closing Date Net
Working Capital Dispute Notice and Parent and the Securityholders
Representative do not agree, within 15 days after timely delivery of the
Closing Date Net Working Capital Dispute Notice, to resolve any discrepancy or
disagreement therein, either party may submit the discrepancy or disagreement
for review and final determination by the Independent Accounting Firm. The
review by the Independent Accounting Firm is limited to the discrepancies and
disagreements set forth in the Closing Date Net Working Capital Dispute
Notice, and the Independent Accounting Firm shall resolve such discrepancies
and disagreements and determine the Closing Date Net Working Capital and the
resulting Adjustment Amount (i) in

 



      
 

 



 

writing, (ii) in accordance with GAAP (as adjusted by the terms of this
Agreement) and applied on a consistent basis with the audited Company
Financial Statements for the most recent fiscal year end, (iii) with respect
to any specific discrepancy or disagreement, no greater than the higher amount
calculated by Parent or the Securityholders Representative, as the case may
be, and no lower than the lower amount calculated by Parent or the
Securityholders Representative as the case may be, (iv) as promptly as
practical after the submission of such discrepancies and disagreements to the
Independent Accounting Firm (but in no event later than 30 days after the date
of submission), and (v) final and binding upon, and non-appealable by, the
parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns for all purposes
hereof, and not subject to collateral attack for any reason absent manifest
error or fraud. The Company Securityholders shall pay (solely from the
Indemnity Escrow Amount held in the Escrow Fund) a portion of the fees and
expenses of the Independent Accounting Firm equal to 100% multiplied by a
fraction, the numerator of which is the amount of disputed amounts submitted
to the Independent Accounting Firm that are resolved in favor of Parent (that
being the difference between the Independent Accounting Firms determination
and Securityholders Representatives determination) and the denominator of
which is the total amount of disputed amounts submitted to the Independent
Accounting Firm (that being the sum total by which Parents determination and
Securityholders Representatives determination differ from the determination
of the Independent Accounting Firm). Parent shall pay that portion of the fees
and expenses of the Independent Accounting Firm that the Company
Securityholders are not required to pay hereunder. Following the resolution of
all objections of the Securityholders Representative regarding the manner in
which any item or items are treated on the Closing Date Net Working Capital
Statement, by mutual agreement or Independent Accounting Firm, Parent shall
prepare the final Closing Date Net Working Capital Statement reflecting such
resolution and shall deliver copies thereof to the Securityholders
Representative and such final Closing Date Net Working Capital Statement is
the " ** _Final Closing Date Net Working Capital Statement_** " and for
avoidance of doubt, the final Adjustment Amount set forth in the Final Closing
Date Net Working Capital Statement is the " ** _Final Adjustment Amount._** "

 



 

 **(d)** ** **If the Final Adjustment Amount as finally determined pursuant to
_Section 1.4(c)_ exceeds the Estimated Adjustment Amount paid on the Closing
Date, Parent shall pay to the Paying Agent (for the benefit of the Company
Securityholders (other than the Cashed-Out Optionholders and the Change of
Control Plan Participants)) and to the Surviving Corporation (for the benefit
of the Company Securityholders who are Cashed-Out Optionholders and the Change
of Control Plan Participants) the entire amount of such difference by wire
transfer of immediately available funds (in accordance with each Company
Securityholders respective Pro Rata Portion) in accordance with _Section
1.3(b)_. If the Estimated Adjustment Amount paid on the Closing Date exceeds
the Final Adjustment Amount as finally determined pursuant to _Section
1.4(c)_, the Securityholders Representative (on behalf of each Company
Securityholder) and Parent shall instruct the Escrow Agent to pay the entire
amount of such difference to Parent out of the Indemnity Escrow Amount (in
accordance with each Company Securityholders respective Pro Rata Portion) in
accordance with _Section 1.3(b)_, with any balance of the Indemnity Escrow
Amount held in the Escrow Fund being promptly related to the Paying Agent for
further distribution to the Company Securityholders in accordance with each
Company Securityholders respective Pro Rata Portion; _provided, however_ ,
that if the amount payable to Parent under this _Section 1.4(d)_ exceeds the
Indemnity Escrow Amount, the Company Securityholders, severally and not
jointly, in each case based on their Pro Rata Portions shall pay to Parent the
amount of such excess.

 



      
 

 



 

1.5 **Transfer Taxes**. Parent shall timely pay 50% and the Company
Securityholders (in accordance with each Company Securityholders respective
Pro Rata Portion) shall timely pay 50% of all transfer, documentary,
registration and other such Taxes (including, without limitation, charges for
or in connection with the recording of any instrument or document as provided
in this Agreement) payable in connection with the execution and delivery of
this Agreement, the consummation of the Closing and the other transactions
contemplated hereby (" ** _Transfer Taxes_** "). Any Transfer Taxes payable by
the Company Securityholders pursuant to this _Section 1.5_ are payable from
the funds then held in the Indemnity Escrow Account.

 



 

1.6 **Treatment of Company Securities**.

 



 

 **(a)** ** ****Conversion**. Subject to _Sections 1.3_ , _1.7_ and _1.8_ at
the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further action on
the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any Company Stockholder, each
share of Company Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time is
cancelled and converted into the right to receive from Parent, promptly
following the surrender of the certificate representing such share of Company
Shares (each a " ** _Company Stock Certificate_** "), in accordance with
_Section 1.7(b)_, the following consideration:

 



 

 **(i)** ** **with respect to each Company Share held in treasury of the
Company and each Company Share owned by Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, or
any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, Merger Sub or the
Company immediately prior to the Effective Time, no payment of any other
consideration;

 



 

 **(ii)** ** **with respect to each share of Series F Preferred Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that is held by a Company
Stockholder (other than shares to be canceled and retired in accordance with
_Section 1.6(a)(i)_ and the Dissenting Shares), an amount in (A) cash
(without interest), or (B) subject to _Section 1.3(a)(ii)_, cash (without
interest) and Parent Merger Shares, in each case equal to the Series F Per
Share Amount;

 



 

 **(iii)** ** **with respect to each share of Series E Preferred Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that is held by a Company
Stockholder (other than shares to be canceled and retired in accordance with
_Section 1.6(a)(i)_ and the Dissenting Shares), an amount in (A) cash
(without interest), or (B) subject to _Section 1.3(a)(ii)_, cash (without
interest) and Parent Merger Shares, in each case equal to the Series E Per
Share Amount;

 



 

 **(iv)** ** **with respect to each share of Series D Preferred Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that is held by a Company
Stockholder (other than shares to be canceled and retired in accordance with
_Section 1.6(a)(i)_ and the Dissenting Shares), an amount in (A) cash
(without interest), or (B) subject to _Section 1.3(a)(ii)_, cash (without
interest) and Parent Merger Shares, in each case equal to the Series D Per
Share Amount;

 



       
 

 



 

 **(v)** ** **with respect to each share of Series C Preferred Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that is held by a Company
Stockholder (other than shares to be canceled and retired in accordance with
_Section 1.6(a)(i)_ and the Dissenting Shares), an amount in (A) cash
(without interest), or (B) subject to _Section 1.3(a)(ii)_, cash (without
interest) and Parent Merger Shares, in each case equal to the Series C Per
Share Amount;

 



 

 **(vi)** ** **with respect to each share of Series B Preferred Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that is held by a Company
Stockholder (other than shares to be canceled and retired in accordance with
_Section 1.6(a)(i)_ and the Dissenting Shares), an amount in (A) cash
(without interest), or (B) subject to _Section 1.3(a)(ii)_, cash (without
interest) and Parent Merger Shares, in each case equal to the Series B Per
Share Amount;

 



 

 **(vii)** ** **with respect to each share of Series A-1 Preferred Stock

Stockholder (other than shares to be canceled and retired in accordance with
_Section 1.6(a)(i)_ and the Dissenting Shares), an amount in (A) cash
(without interest), or (B) subject to _Section 1.3(a)(ii)_, cash (without

Amount; and

 



 

 **(ix)** ** **with respect to each Dissenting Share, the right to receive
payment from the Surviving Corporation with respect thereto in accordance with
applicable state law.

 



 

The amount of cash, if any, that each Company Stockholder is entitled to
receive for the Company Shares held by such Company Stockholder is rounded to
the nearest cent (with $0.005 being rounded upward) and computed after
aggregating the cash amounts payable for all shares of each class and series
of Company Shares held by such Company Stockholder and any cash amount payable
in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to _Section 1.3(a)(ii)_ hereof.

 



 

 **(b)** ** **Each share of the common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of
Merger Sub outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time is converted
into one share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation and as of the
Effective Time, constitutes all of the issued and outstanding shares of
capital stock of the Surviving Corporation. Each stock certificate of Merger
Sub evidencing ownership of any such shares remain outstanding and evidence
ownership of shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

 



      
 

 



 

1.7 **Surrender of Company Stock Certificates**.

 



 

 **(a)** ** **At the Effective Time, holders of Company Stock Certificates
representing the Company Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time cease to have any rights as stockholders of the Company, and
the stock transfer books of the Company close with respect to all shares of
such capital stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. The
Company shall not effect any further transfer of any such Company Shares on
such stock transfer books after the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, a holder presents a valid Company Stock Certificate to the Surviving
Corporation or Parent, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to cancel
the Company Stock Certificate and the holder may exchange the Company Stock
Certificate as provided in this _Section 1.7_.

 



 

 **(b)** ** **At or as soon as practicable after the date hereof, the Company
and Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to send to the holders of record of
the Company Shares (i) a letter of transmittal in the form attached hereto as
**Exhibit C** (each, a " ** _Letter of Transmittal_** ") and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Company Stock
Certificates in exchange for payment in accordance with the terms and
conditions of this Agreement. After the Effective Time and upon surrender to
the Paying Agent of a Company Stock Certificate (or an affidavit of loss in
lieu thereof), together with a duly executed Letter of Transmittal, the holder
of such Company Stock Certificate is entitled to receive in exchange therefor
payment of an amount payable pursuant to _Section 1.6_, and the Company Stock
Certificate so surrendered is canceled. Until surrendered as contemplated by
this _Section 1.7_, each Company Stock Certificate is deemed, from and after
the Effective Time, to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender
a portion of the Aggregate Merger Consideration as determined in accordance
with, and subject to, the terms and conditions of this Agreement. If any
Company Stock Certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, the owner of
such lost, stolen or destroyed Company Stock Certificate may provide (in lieu
of such Company Stock Certificate) an appropriate affidavit as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against Parent or the Surviving Corporation
with respect to such Company Stock Certificate.

 



 

 **(c)** ** **No dividends or other distributions declared or made with
respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time may
be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Company Stock Certificate (or
uncertificated shares of Company Common Stock) with respect to the shares of
Parent Common Stock issuable upon surrender thereof, and no cash payment with
respect to any cash portion of Applicable Per Share Amount or in lieu of
fractional shares may be paid to any such holder, until the surrender of such
Company Stock Certificate (or uncertificated shares of Common Stock) in
accordance with this _Section 1.7_.

 



 

 **(d)** ** **Parent shall not issue any certificates or scrip representing
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock upon the conversion of Company Shares
pursuant to this _Section 1_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, Parent shall pay each holder of shares of Company Shares converted
pursuant to the Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a
fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after taking into account all
shares of Company Shares exchanged by such holder), in lieu thereof, cash
(without interest) in an amount equal to such fractional amount multiplied by
the Closing Parent Stock Price.

 



 

 **(e)** ** **Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, none
of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation, the
Securityholders

 



      
 

 



 

Representative, the Paying Agent, or the Escrow Agent is liable to any Company
Securityholder for any portion of the Aggregate Merger Consideration delivered
to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat,
or similar Legal Requirement. Any Aggregate Merger Consideration remaining
undistributed to Company Securityholders immediately prior to such time as
such Aggregate Merger Consideration payable to the Company Stockholders
pursuant to this _Section 1_ would otherwise escheat to or become the
property of any Governmental Authority, to the extent permitted by applicable
Legal Requirement, becomes the property of the Surviving Corporation free and
clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.
Furthermore, each of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation and the Securityholders Representative are entitled to rely upon
the payment instructions set forth in this Agreement, including, without
limitation, the Consideration Spreadsheet.

 



 

1.8 **Dissenting Shares**.

 



 

 **(a)** ** **Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, any shares of capital stock of the Company (the " ** _Dissenting
Shares_** ") that, as of the Effective Time, are held by a Company Stockholder
exercising such Company Stockholders right to dissent in accordance with
Section 262 of the Delaware General Corporation Law are not converted into or
represent the right to receive payment in accordance with _Sections 1.6_ and
_1.7_ , and such Company Stockholders are entitled only to such rights as may
be granted to such Company Stockholders in Section 262 of the Delaware General
Corporation Law; _provided, however_ , that if such Company Stockholders
right to dissent is not perfected, or if such Company Stockholders demand for
payment is withdrawn pursuant to Section 262 of the Delaware General
Corporation Law, as of the later of the Effective Time or the time of the
failure to perfect such status or the withdrawal of such demand, such shares
are automatically converted into and represent only the right to receive (upon
the surrender of the certificate or certificates representing such shares)
payment in accordance with _Sections 1.6_ and _1.7_.

 



 

 **(b)** ** **The Company shall (i) give Parent prompt notice of any written
demand received by the Company prior to the Effective Time to require the
Company to purchase Company Shares pursuant to Section 262 of the Delaware
General Corporation Law and of any other demand, notice or instrument
delivered to the Company prior to the Effective Time pursuant to the Delaware
General Corporation Law, and (ii) give Parent the opportunity to participate
in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such
demand. The Company shall not make any payment or settlement offer prior to
the Effective Time with respect to any such demand unless Parent consents in
writing to such payment or settlement offer.

 



 

1.9 **Withholding Rights**. Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation,
the Paying Agent and the Escrow Agent, as applicable, are entitled to deduct
and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any Company Securityholder such amounts as Parent, the Company,
the Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent or the Escrow Agent, as the case
may be, is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such
payment under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law. To
the extent that amounts are so withheld and timely paid over to the
appropriate Governmental Authority by Parent, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation, the Paying Agent or the Escrow

 



      
 

 



 

Agent, such withheld amounts are treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to such Company Securityholder.

 



 

1.10 **Termination of Exchange Fund**. The Paying Agent shall, upon demand by
Parent, deliver any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to
the holders of Company Shares for two years after the Effective Time and
Parent shall pay any holder of Company Shares who has not previously complied
with the provisions of this _Section 1_, after complying with the provisions
of this _Section 1_, payment of its claim to the Applicable Per Share Amount
for each Company Share due to such holder of Company Shares.

 



 

1.11 **Treatment of Company Options**.

 



 

 **(a)** ** **Company Options are not continued, assumed, or substituted for
by the Surviving Corporation or the Parent as part of the Merger. Instead,
except only as set forth below in this _Section 1.11(a)_ each Unvested Option
and each Vested Option that is not exercised as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time is cancelled at the Effective Time. Prior to the Closing, the
Company shall provide a notice to the holders of Company Options apprising
them that all Unvested Options and any Vested Options that are unexercised as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time, are cancelled at the Effective
Time and that any payment (as described in _Section 1.11(b)_ below) with
respect to any such unexercised Vested Options is contingent upon the holder
thereof executing and delivering to the Company, an Option Termination
Agreement in the form attached hereto as **Exhibit E** (an " ** _Option
Termination Agreement_** "). If a holder of Vested Options executes and
delivers the Option Termination Agreement in accordance with this _Section
1.11(a)_ his or her Vested Options are " ** _Cashed-Out Options_** " for
purposes of this Agreement. All Unvested Options and any Vested Options not
exercised prior to the Effective Time and for which a holder does not so
execute and deliver the Option Termination Agreement are " ** _Forfeited
Options_** " for purposes of this Agreement and the Company Stock Option Plan.

 



 

 **(b)** ** **Prior to the Closing, the Companys board of directors shall
adopt appropriate resolutions and take all other actions reasonably necessary
and appropriate to cause (i) each Cashed-Out Option that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time to be cancelled and converted into the
right to receive (subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and
the Option Termination Agreement) a portion of the Aggregate Merger
Consideration with respect thereto equal to the Vested Option Payment Amount,
less any applicable withholding Taxes (with all withholding Taxes to be paid
in cash), and (ii) each Forfeited Option that is outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested to be canceled for no
consideration as of the Effective Time. As of the Effective Time, all Company
Options automatically cease to exist, and each holder of a Company Option
ceases to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive
the Vested Option Payment Amount, if any. In accordance with this Agreement
and the Option Termination Agreements, as promptly as administratively
possible (and, with respect to payments made as of the Closing, in any event
no later than the second regular payroll date after the Effective Time) the
Surviving Corporation, through the Surviving Corporations payroll system, or
the Paying Agent, as the case may be, shall pay to the former holders of
Cashed-Out Options such amounts as such holders are entitled to receive
pursuant to this Agreement and the Option Termination Agreement, reduced by
applicable withholding Taxes. Any portion of the proceeds payable with

 



      
 

 



 

respect to any Company Option that is held in the Escrow Fund is reported as
compensation income and only subject to withholding for income and employment
Taxes at such time as the amounts are released and disbursed from the Escrow
Fund and paid to the former holder of such Company Option.

 



 

1.12 **Treatment of Company Warrants.**

 



 

 **(a)** ** **Prior to the Closing, the Company shall provide a notice to the
holders of Company Warrants apprising them that, subject to the holder thereof
executing and delivering to the Company prior to the end of the Business Day
on the date that is at least three Business Days prior to the Closing Date a
Warrant Termination Agreement in the form attached hereto as **Exhibit F** (a
" ** _Warrant Termination Agreement_** "), such holder is entitled to the
payments set forth in this Agreement with respect to such Company Warrant, all
in accordance with and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement
and the Warrant Termination Agreement. If a holder timely executes and
delivers the Warrant Termination Agreement in accordance with this _Section
1.12(a)_ his or her Company Warrants are " ** _Cashed-Out Warrants_** " for
purposes of this Agreement. Any holder that fails to timely execute and
deliver a Warrant Termination Agreement forfeits such Company Warrant and such
Company Warrant terminates effective as of the Closing.

 



 

 **(b)** ** **Prior to the Closing, the Companys board of directors shall
adopt appropriate resolutions and take all other actions it determines are
reasonably necessary and appropriate to cause each Cashed-Out Warrant that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time to be cancelled and
converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive (subject to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Warrant Termination Agreement)
a portion of the Aggregate Merger Consideration with respect thereto equal to
the Company Warrant Payment Amount less any applicable withholding Taxes (with
any such withholding Taxes to be paid in cash). As of the Effective Time, all
Cashed-Out Warrants automatically cease to exist, and each holder of a Cashed-
Out Warrant ceases to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right
to receive the Company Warrant Payment Amount, if any, in accordance with this
Agreement and the Warrant Termination Agreements.

 



 

1.13 **Securityholders  Representative**.

 



 

 **(a)** ** **The Company, by the execution and delivery of this Agreement,
and each Company Securityholder, by the execution and delivery of any Letter
of Transmittal, any Option Termination Agreement or any Warrant Termination
Agreement hereby irrevocably constitutes and appoints Shareholder
Representative Services LLC as the sole, exclusive, true and lawful agent and
attorney-in-fact of each Company Securityholder (the " ** _Securityholders 
Representative_**"), with full power of substitution to act in such Company
Securityholders name, place and stead with respect to all transactions
contemplated by and all terms and provisions of this Agreement or the Escrow
Agreement, and to act on such Company Securityholders behalf in any dispute,
litigation or arbitration involving this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement,
and to do or refrain from doing all such further acts and things, and execute
all such documents as the Securityholders Representative deems necessary or
appropriate in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
or the Escrow Agreement, including, without limitation, the power:

 



      
 

 



 

 **(i)** ** **to waive any condition to the obligations of such Company
Securityholder to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

 



 

 **(ii)** ** **to execute and deliver all ancillary agreements, certificates
and documents on behalf of such Company Securityholder which the
Securityholders Representative deems necessary or appropriate in connection
with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
the Escrow Agreement; and

 



 

 **(iii)** ** **to do or refrain from doing any further act or deed on behalf
of such Company Securityholder as is assigned, delegated or charged to the
Securityholders Representative or which the Securityholders Representative
otherwise deems necessary or appropriate in its sole discretion relating to
the subject matter of this Agreement, as fully and completely as such Company
Securityholder could do if personally present.

 



 

All such actions set forth or described in this _Section 1.13(a)_ are deemed
to be facts ascertainable outside this Agreement and are binding on the
Company Securityholders.

 



 

 **(b)** ** **The appointment of the Securityholders Representative is deemed
coupled with an interest and is irrevocable, and Parent, its Affiliates, and
any other Person may conclusively and absolutely rely, without inquiry, upon
any action of the Securityholders Representative on behalf of the Company
Securityholders in all matters referred to herein. All notices delivered by
Parent or the Company (following the Closing) to the Securityholders
Representative (whether pursuant hereto or otherwise) for the benefit of the
Company Securityholders shall constitute notice to the Company
Securityholders. The Securityholders Representative shall act for the Company
Securityholders on all of the matters set forth in this Agreement in the
manner the Securityholders Representative believes to be in the best interest
of the Company Securityholders as a whole and consistent with its obligations
under this Agreement, but the Securityholders Representative is not liable or
responsible to the Company Securityholders for any loss or damages it or they
may suffer by reason of the performance by the Securityholders Representative
of its duties under this Agreement, other than loss or damage arising from
fraud by or gross negligence of the Securityholders Representative.

 



 

 **(c)** ** **If the Securityholders Representative resigns or is otherwise
similarly unable to carry out its duties hereunder, then the Company
Securityholders with an aggregate Pro Rata Portion of 51% (the " ** _Requisite
Company Securityholders_** ") shall within five Business Days appoint a new
Securityholders Representative. The Requisite Company Securityholders may at
any time, for any reason or no reason, remove the Securityholders
Representative. If at any time there is not a Securityholders Representative
and the Company Securityholders fail to designate in writing a successor
Securityholders Representative within five Business Days after receipt of a
written request delivered by Parent to the Requisite Company Securityholders
requesting that a successor Securityholders Representative be designated in
writing, then Parent may petition a court of competent jurisdiction to appoint
a new Securityholders Representative hereunder.

 



 

 **(d)** ** **All actions, decisions and instructions of the Securityholders
Representative taken, made or given pursuant to the authority granted to the
Securityholders Representative pursuant to this _Section 1.13_ is conclusive
and binding upon each Company

 



      
 

 



 

Securityholder, and no Company Securityholder may object, dissent, protest, or
otherwise contest the same. The Company, by the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, each Company Stockholder, by the execution and delivery of any
Letter of Transmittal, each Cashed-Out Optionholder, by the execution and
delivery of any Option Termination Agreement, each Company Warrantholder, by
the execution and delivery of any Warrant Termination Agreement, as
applicable, is deemed to have approved, confirmed and ratified any action
taken by the Securityholders Representative in the exercise of the power-of-
attorney granted to the Securityholders Representative pursuant to this
_Section 1.13_, which power-of-attorney, being coupled with an interest, is
irrevocable and shall survive the death, incapacity or incompetence of each
such Company Securityholder.

 



 

 **(e)** ** **The Securityholders Representative is not liable to the Company
Securityholders for any act done or omitted hereunder in its capacity as the
Securityholders Representative unless caused by fraud by or gross negligence
of the Securityholders Representative. The Securityholders Representative
shall not have any fiduciary, agency or other duties to the Company
Securityholders and its only obligations are as expressly set forth in this
Agreement. The Securityholders Representative is serving in that capacity
solely for purposes of administrative convenience, and is not personally
liable for any of the obligations of the Company Securityholders hereunder,
and Parent, the Company and the Surviving Corporation agree that they will not
look to the underlying assets of the Securityholders Representative for the
satisfaction of any obligations of the Company or the Company Securityholders
(or any of them). The Company Securityholders shall jointly, in accordance
with their respective Pro Rata Portion, indemnify and defend the
Securityholders Representative and hold the Securityholders Representative
on demand harmless against any and all losses, liabilities, damages, claims,
penalties, fines, forfeitures, actions, fees, costs and expenses (including
the fees and expenses of counsel and experts and their staffs and all expense
of document location, duplication and shipment) (collectively, " **
_Representative Losses_** ") incurred by the Securityholders Representative
and arising out of or in connection with the acceptance, performance or
administration of the Securityholders Representative duties hereunder or
under the Escrow Agreement, in each case as such Representative Loss is
suffered or incurred; provided, that in the event that any such Representative
Loss is finally adjudicated to have been directly caused by the gross
negligence or fraud of the Securityholders Representative, the
Securityholders Representative will reimburse the Company Securityholders the
amount of such indemnified Representative Loss to the extent attributable to
such gross negligence or fraud. If not paid directly to the Securityholders
Representative by the Company Securityholders, any such Representative Losses
may be recovered by the Securityholders Representative from (i) the funds in
the Representative Fund, (ii) the amounts in the Escrow Fund at such time as
remaining amounts would otherwise be distributable to the Company
Securityholders, and (iii) from any Earnout Amounts at such time as any such
amounts would otherwise be distributable to the Company Securityholders;
provided, that while this section allows the Securityholders Representative
to be paid from the Representative Fund, the Escrow Fund and the Earnout
Amounts, this does not relieve the Company Securityholders from their
obligation to promptly pay such Representative Losses as they are suffered or
incurred, nor does it prevent the Securityholders Representative from seeking
any remedies available to it at law or otherwise. In no event will the
Securityholders Representative be required to advance its own funds on behalf
of the Company Securityholders or otherwise. The Company Securityholders
acknowledge and agree that the foregoing indemnities shall survive the
resignation or removal of the

 



      
 

 



 

Securityholders Representative or the termination of this agreement. The
Securityholders Representative may retain its own counsel and other
professional advisers at the expense of the Company Securityholders in
connection with the acceptance, performance or administration of the
Securityholders Representatives duties hereunder or under the Escrow
Agreement or the exercise of any of the Securityholders Representatives
rights hereunder.

 



 

 **(f)** ** **Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
Securityholders Representative is authorized and empowered to establish such
reserves as the Securityholders Representative may from time to time
determine, in its sole discretion, to be necessary and desirable in connection
with the reasonable, out-of-pocket expenses and other costs to be borne by the
Securityholders Representative or the Company Securityholders hereunder,
including the Representative Fund, and to pay such reserves from the
Representative Fund or direct the Parent to make payment of such amounts from
the Escrow Amount to be applied to such reserves in lieu of the payment to the
Company Securityholders.

 



 

 **(g)** ** **The Representative Fund Amount shall be maintained by the
Representative Account for use by the Securityholders Representative in
accordance with this Agreement. The Company Securityholders will not receive
any interest or earnings on the Representative Fund Amount and irrevocably
transfer and assign to the Securityholders Representative any ownership right
that they may otherwise have had in any such interest or earnings. The
Securityholders Representative will not be liable for any loss of principal
of the Representative Fund Amount other than as a result of its gross
negligence, fraud or willful misconduct. The Securityholders Representative
will hold these funds separate from its corporate funds, will not use these
funds for its operating expenses or any other corporate purposes and will not
voluntarily make these funds available to its creditors in the event of
bankruptcy. Any portion of the Representative Fund Amount remaining after (i)
payment of all of the Securityholders Representatives reasonable, out-of-
pocket expenses following the resolution of all indemnification claims under
_Article VIII_ and resolution of all earn-out matters under _Section 1.3(d)_
hereof and (ii) the determination by the Securityholders Representative that
such funds are no longer necessary in connection with indemnification claims
or earn-out matters that may be brought thereunder (such portion of the
Representative Fund Amount, the " ** _Remaining Representative Fund_** ")
shall be delivered to the Paying Agent for distribution to the Company
Securityholders in the amounts such Company Securityholders would receive if
the Remaining Representative Fund were instead a portion of the Escrow Amount
to be distributed to such Company Securityholders in accordance with the
Escrow Agreement. The Securityholders Representative shall hold and disburse
the Representative Fund Amount for the Company Securityholders, and the
Representative Account shall not be used for any other purpose and shall not
be available to the Parent or any other Indemnified Person to satisfy any
claims hereunder.

 



 

 **(h)** ** **The provisions of this _Section 1.13_ are independent and
severable, constitute an irrevocable power of attorney, coupled with an
interest and surviving death or dissolutions, granted by the Company
Securityholders to the Securityholders Representative, and are binding upon
the executors, heirs, legal representatives, successors and assigns of each
such Company Securityholder. As of the Effective Time, the obligations of the
Company (as the Surviving Corporation) with respect to the Securityholders
Representative shall terminate, including, without limitation, the power-of-
attorney granted pursuant to this _Section 1.13_.

parties hereto and the Company Securityholders acknowledge and agree that this
_Section 1.13_ is governed by, construed and enforced in accordance with the
laws of the State of Delaware.

afford, subject, with respect to any classified materials, to Parents and its
Representatives compliance with any security clearance requirements and
procedures (to the extent determined necessary by the Company in order to
comply with applicable Legal Requirements), Parent and its personnel,
accountants, counsel and other representatives (including financing sources
bound in writing to maintain the confidence of such information) reasonable
access during normal business hours to (a) all of Companys books, contracts,
commitments and records, (b) all other existing information concerning the
business, properties and personnel of Company as Parent may reasonably
request, and (c) such other access as may be reasonably necessary or

_provided, however,_ that (i) in exercising access rights under this _Section

written notice prior to accessing any of the foregoing. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary, neither Parent nor its Affiliate or any of their
Representatives shall contact any of

 



      
 

 



 

the Companys customers, vendors or employees regarding the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement unless specifically authorized in advance by
the Company.

 



 

5.2 **Public Disclosure; Confidentiality**. Except as may be required by Legal
Requirement:

 



 

 **(a)** ** **the Company shall not, and cause its Affiliates and
Representatives to not, issue any press release or otherwise make any public
statement or make any other public (or non-confidential) disclosure (whether
or not in response to an inquiry) regarding the terms of this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby; and

 



 

 **(b)** ** **the parties incorporate by reference the terms of the Mutual
Nondisclosure Agreement, dated December 3, 2013 between the Company and Parent
(the " ** _Confidentiality Agreement_** "), which continues in full force and
effect until the Closing, at which time such Confidentiality Agreement
terminates. From and after the Closing, by approving this Agreement, the
Company Securityholders and the Securityholders Representative shall, and
shall cause their Affiliates to, hold, and shall use their reasonable best
efforts to cause their respective Representatives to hold, in confidence any
and all information, whether written or oral, concerning Parent and its
Affiliates (including the Company), except to the extent that such Person can
show that such information (a) is generally available to and known by the
public through no fault of a Company Securityholder, the Securityholders
Representative, any of their Affiliates or their respective Representatives;
or (b) is lawfully acquired by a Company Securityholder, the Securityholders
Representative, any of its Affiliates or their respective Representatives from
and after the Closing from sources which are not prohibited from disclosing
such information by a legal, contractual or fiduciary obligation. For the
avoidance of doubt, any information delivered pursuant to _Section 1.3(d)_ is
considered confidential information of Parent and its Affiliates and subject
to the terms of this _Section 5.2(b)_. If this Agreement is, for any reason,
terminated prior to the Closing, the Confidentiality Agreement shall
nonetheless continue in full force and effect in accordance with its terms.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement or the Confidentiality Agreement to
the contrary, following Closing, the Securityholders Representative shall be
permitted to: (i) after the Closing of the Merger, publicly announce that it
has been engaged to serve as the Securityholders Representative in connection
with the Merger as long as such announcement does not disclose any of the
other terms of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated herein; and
(ii) disclose information as required by applicable Legal Requirements or to
employees, advisors or consultants of the Securityholders Representative and
to the Company Securityholders, in each case who have a need to know such
information, provided that such persons either (A) agree to observe the terms
of this _Section 5.2(b)_ or (B) are bound by obligations of confidentiality
to the Securityholders Representative of at least as high a standard as those
imposed on the Securityholders Representative under this _Section 5.2(b)_.
In the event the Securityholders Representative is required to make any such
disclosure pursuant to any applicable Legal Requirements, the Securityholders
Representative shall provide Parent with prompt written notice thereof and
shall cooperate with Parents efforts to contest or limit the scope of such
disclosure.

 



 

 **(c)** ** **The rights and remedies for actual or threatened breach of this
_Section 5.2_ include having such provision specifically enforced by any
court having equitable

 



      
 

 



 

jurisdiction. Such actual or threatened breach will cause irreparable injury
to non-breaching party and money damages do not provide an adequate remedy.

 



 

5.3 **Efforts; Government Approvals and Further Assurances**.

 



 

 **(a)** ** **Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to satisfy the conditions to Closing and to consummate the
Closing and the other transactions contemplated hereby. Each of Parent, Merger
Sub, and the Company shall execute and deliver such further instruments of
conveyance and transfer and take such additional action as any other party may
reasonably request to effect, consummate, confirm, or evidence the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall: (i)
make any filings and give any notices required to be made or given by such
party in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the
consummation of the Closing and the other transactions contemplated hereby;
(ii) use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any material consent
required to be obtained (pursuant to any applicable Legal Requirement,
Material Contract or otherwise) by such party in connection with this
Agreement, the consummation of the Closing and the other transactions
contemplated hereby; and (iii) use commercially reasonable efforts to lift any
restraint, injunction or other legal bar to the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, the consummation of the Closing and the other transactions
contemplated hereby. The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
assist Parent with the preparation of the Prospectus, and the Parent shall use
commercially reasonable best efforts to promptly prepare the Prospectus. Each
of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall promptly deliver to the other a
copy of each such filing made, each such notice given and each such consent
obtained during the Pre-Closing Period, it being understood that delivery of
such filings, notices and consents exclusively to the outside counsel of such
other party are deemed to be in compliance with the requirements of this
_Section 5.3(a)_.

 



 

 **(b)** ** **The Company and Parent shall use their commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain the authorizations, consents, orders and approvals necessary
for the performance of their obligations pursuant to this Agreement. Each of
Parent and the Company shall use their commercially reasonable to (i) file, as
promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement, all notices, reports
and other documents required to be filed by such party with any Governmental
Authority with respect to this Agreement, the consummation of the Closing and
the other transactions contemplated hereby, and (ii) to submit promptly any
additional information requested by any such Governmental Authority and to
cause to be taken, on a timely basis, all other actions necessary or
appropriate for the purpose of consummating the Closing and the other
transactions contemplated hereby. If required by the HSR Act and if the
appropriate filing of a premerger notification and report form pursuant to the
HSR Act has not been filed prior to the date hereof, each of Parent and the
Company agrees to make an appropriate filing of a premerger notification and
report form with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
within five Business Days after the date hereof, to make all other filings,
notifications or other consents as may be required to be made or obtained by
such party related to other Antitrust Laws in those jurisdictions identified
in _Section 5.3(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule_, which contains the
list of the only jurisdictions where clearance is a condition to Closing, and
to supply promptly any additional information and documentary material that
may be subsequently requested by the relevant Governmental Authority. The

 



      
 

 



 

parties directly or indirectly through any of their Affiliates, shall not
enter into any agreement, transaction, or any agreement to effect any
transaction (including any merger or acquisition) that might reasonably be
expected to make it more difficult, or to increase the time required to: (i)
obtain the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act,
or any other applicable Antitrust Laws, (ii) avoid the entry of, the
commencement of litigation seeking the entry of, or to effect the dissolution
of, any injunction, temporary restraining order or other order that would
materially delay or prevent the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby or (iii) obtain all authorizations, consents, orders and approvals of
Governmental Authorities necessary for the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Parent shall pay the filing and related fees
in connection with any such Antitrust Laws filings that are made by any of the
parties. Each of the Company (to the extent it has actual knowledge of such
facts) and Parent shall (A) give the other party prompt notice of the
commencement of any legal proceeding by or before any Governmental Authority
with respect to this Agreement, the consummation of the Closing and the other
transactions contemplated hereby; and (B) keep the other party informed as to
the status of any such legal proceeding. The Company and Parent shall consult
and cooperate with one another, and shall consider in good faith the views of
one another, in connection with any analysis, appearance, presentation,
memorandum, brief, argument, opinion, or proposal made or submitted by either
of them in connection with any legal proceeding under or relating to national
security matters. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this _Section
5.3_ shall require, or be construed to require, Parent or any of its
Affiliates to agree to (x) sell, hold, divest, discontinue or limit, before or
after the Closing Date, any assets, businesses or interests of Parent, the
Company or any of their respective Affiliates; (y) any conditions relating to,
or changes or restrictions in, the operations of any such assets, businesses
or interests which, in either case, could reasonably be expected to result in
a Parent Material Adverse Effect or Company Material Adverse Effect or
materially and adversely impact the economic or business benefits to Parent of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; or (z) any material
modification or waiver of the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

 



 

 **(c)** ** **Parent shall promptly notify the Company if its compliance
audits of the Company disclose any findings, observations, events, conditions,
systems, policies, processes, or procedures that, if such findings,
observations, events, conditions, systems, policies, processes, or procedures
existed after Closing would require the Company to notify the Office of
Inspector General under the Companys Corporate Integrity Agreement. Parent
and the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to remedy any such
findings, observations, events, conditions, systems, policies, processes, or
procedures prior to Closing. The Company and Parent shall consult and
cooperate with one another, and shall consider in good faith the views of one
another, in connection with remedying those findings, observations, events,
conditions, systems, policies, processes, or procedures. Parents receipt or
transmittal of information pursuant to this _Section 5.3_ does not operate as
a waiver or otherwise affect any representation, warranty, or agreement given
or made by Company in this Agreement and is not deemed to amend or supplement
the Company Disclosure Schedule.

 



 

5.4 **Tax Matters**.

 



 

 **(a)** ** ****Cooperation on Tax Matters**. Parent, the Company, the
Surviving Corporation and the Securityholders Representative shall cooperate
fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by another party, in
connection with the filing of any Tax Return

 



      
 

 



 

or amended Tax Return with respect to any taxable period beginning before the
Closing Date, and in connection with any audit, litigation or other proceeding
with respect to Taxes for such taxable periods. Such cooperation includes the
retention and (upon the other partys request) the provision of records and
information which are reasonably relevant to any such Tax Return, audit,
litigation or other proceeding and making employees available on a mutually
convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any
material provided hereunder. Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation
and the Securityholders Representative agree (i) to retain all books and
records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Company and its
Subsidiaries relating to any taxable period beginning before the Closing Date
until the expiration of the statute of limitations (and, to the extent
notified by Parent or the Company, any extensions thereof) of the respective
taxable periods, and to abide by all record retention agreements entered into
with any taxing authority, and (ii) to give the other parties reasonable
written notice prior to transferring, destroying or discarding any such books
and records and, if any other party so requests, Parent or the Company, as the
case may be, shall allow the other parties to take possession of such books
and records. Parent and the Securityholders Representative further agree,
upon request, to use their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any
certificate or other document from any Governmental Authority or any other
Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax of the
Company, the Surviving Corporation its Subsidiaries or Parent that could be
imposed (including, but not limited to, with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement).

 



 

 **(b)** ** ****Tax Returns**.

 



 

 **(i)** ** ****Pre-Closing Tax Returns**. The Company shall prepare and file
all Tax Returns relating to the Company or its Subsidiaries that are required
to be filed on or before the Closing Date (taking into account applicable
extensions) in accordance with past practices and customs unless otherwise
required by applicable law. The Company shall provide Parent with copies of
such Tax Returns.

 



 

 **(ii)** ** ****Post-Closing Tax Returns**. Parent shall prepare and file (or
cause the Surviving Corporation to prepare and file) all Tax Returns relating
to the Company and its Subsidiaries that are required to be filed after the
Closing Date. Parent shall prepare any Tax Returns, to the extent relating to
any Pre-Closing Tax Period, in accordance with the Companys past practices
and customs unless otherwise required by applicable law. If the Taxes
reflected on such Tax Returns would form the basis for a claim of
indemnification pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)_, Parent shall provide such Tax
Returns to the Securityholders Representative for review and comment at least
30 days prior to the due date for filing such Tax Returns, shall consider in
good faith (but is not required to make as long as such good faith standard is
satisfied) reasonable changes to such Tax Returns requested by the
Securityholders Representative. The Securityholders Representative will
cooperate with Parent to release from the Escrow Fund any amount owed in
respect of such Tax Returns pursuant _Section 8.1(b)_ 3 days before the due
date of such Tax Returns.

 



 

 **(c)** ** ****Tax Audits and Contests**. Parent shall give written notice to
the Securityholders Representative of the receipt of any written notice
received by the Company, Parent or any of Parents Affiliates which involves
the assertion of any claim, or the commencement of any action, in respect of
which an indemnity may be sought by the Parent

 



      
 

 



 

pursuant to _Article VIII_ (a " ** _Tax Claim_** "); _provided, that_ failure
to comply with this provision does not affect Parent right to indemnification
hereunder unless the Securityholders are materially prejudiced by such
failure. Parent shall control the contest or resolution of any Tax Claim;
_provided, however_ , that Parent shall obtain the prior written consent of
the Securityholders Representative (which consent may not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed) before entering into any settlement of a claim or ceasing
to defend such claim; and, _provided further_ , that the Securityholders
Representative may participate in the defense of such claim and employ counsel
of its choice for such purpose. The Company Securityholders shall solely bear
the fees and expenses of such separate counsel.

 



 

 **(d)** ** ****Straddle Periods**. For purposes of this Agreement, the
portion of Tax with respect to the income, property or operations of the
Company that is attributable to any Straddle Period will be apportioned
between the portion of the Straddle Period that extends before the Closing
Date through the Closing Date (the " ** _Pre-Closing Straddle Period_** ") and
the portion of the Straddle Period that extends from the day after the Closing
Date to the end of the Straddle Period in accordance with this _Section
5.4(d)_. The portion of such Tax attributable to the Pre-Closing Straddle
Period (i) in the case of any Taxes other than income Taxes, sales or use
taxes, value-added taxes, employment taxes, or withholding taxes, shall be
deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire taxable period multiplied
by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the Pre-Closing
Straddle Period and denominator of which is the number of days in the Straddle
Period, and (ii) in the case of any income Taxes, sales or use taxes, value-
added taxes, employment taxes, or withholding taxes, shall be deemed equal to
the amount that would be payable if the Straddle Period ended on and included
the Closing Date. To the extent that any Tax for a Straddle Period is based on
the greater of a Tax on net income, on the one hand, and a Tax measured by net
worth or some other basis not otherwise measured by income, on the other hand,
the portion of such Tax related to the Pre-Closing Straddle Period shall be
determined based on the foregoing and based on the manner in which the actual
Tax liability for the entire Straddle Period is determined.

 



 

5.5 **Employee Matters. **As promptly as reasonably practicable, but in no
event resulting in a gap in coverage, after the Closing Date, Parent shall
enroll Company Employees who were employees of the Company immediately prior
to the Closing and who remain employees of the Company or become employees of
Parent or any Affiliate of Parent following the Closing (the " ** _Continuing
Employees_** ") in employee benefit plans sponsored by Parent or any Affiliate
of Parent for which such employees are eligible (the " ** _Parent Plans_** "),
including its medical plan, dental plan, life insurance plan and disability
plan, on substantially similar terms applicable to employees of Parent or such
Affiliate of Parent who are similarly situated based on levels of
responsibility, to the extent permitted by the terms of the applicable Parent
Plans; _provided, however,_ that Parent is not obligated to enroll any
Continuing Employee in Parent Plans if Parent or such Affiliate of Parent
maintains in effect a comparable existing Company benefit arrangement for the
benefit of such employee following the Closing. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, for Continuing Employees so enrolled in Parent
Plans, Parent shall recognize the prior service with the Company of each of
the Continuing Employees for purposes of eligibility and vesting and
entitlement to severance and vacation benefits. Subject to any Legal
Requirements and solely to the extent permitted by the terms of such plans
and, if applicable, insurer, Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to cause the group health plan maintained by the Parent or an affiliate
thereof, and applicable insurance carriers, third party

 



      
 

 



 

administrators and any other third parties, to the extent such group health
plan is made available to Continuing Employees, to (i) waive any evidence of
insurability requirements, waiting periods, and any limitations as to
preexisting medical conditions under the group health plan applicable to such
employees and their spouses and eligible dependents (but only to the extent
that such preexisting condition limitations did not apply or were satisfied
under the group health plan maintained by the Company prior to the Closing)
and (ii) provide such Continuing Employees with credit, for the calendar year
in which the Closing occurs, for the amount of any out-of pocket expenses and
copayments or deductible expenses that were incurred by them during the
calendar year in which the Closing occurs under a group health plan maintained
by Parent or such Affiliate of Parent. Notwithstanding anything in this
_Section 5.5_ to the contrary, this _Section 5.5_ shall not operate to (a)
duplicate any benefit provided to any Continuing Employee or to fund any such
benefit, (b) require Parent or such Affiliate of Parent to continue to
maintain any employee benefit plan in effect following the Closing for their
employees, including the Continuing Employees, (c) be construed to mean the
employment of the Continuing Employees is not terminable by Parent or such
Affiliate of Parent at will at any time, with or without cause, for any reason
or no reason, (d) amend any ERISA plan or create any third party rights of
causes of action for any person, or (e) confer any third party beneficiary
rights upon any Continuing Employee or any other Person.

 



 

5.6 **Stockholder Action**.

 



 

 **(a)** ** **Promptly following the execution and delivery of this Agreement,
the Company shall, in accordance with and pursuant to Section 228 of the
Delaware General Corporation Law, take all action necessary to seek, as soon
as practicable, the Required Stockholder Approval by written consent, in the
form attached hereto as **Exhibit G** (the " ** _Stockholder Written
Consents_** "). As soon as practicable following the Companys receipt of the
Stockholder Written Consents necessary to secure the Required Stockholder
Approval in lieu of calling a meeting of Company Stockholders, the Company
shall deliver to Parent copies of such Stockholder Written Consents, certified
as true and complete by the secretary of the Company.

 



 

 **(b)** ** **To the extent required by the Delaware General Corporation Law,
the Company shall promptly (and in any event within 15 Business Days after the
Company has obtained the Stockholder Consent) deliver to any holder of Company
Shares a notice of the approval of the Merger and adoption of this Agreement
by written consent of the holders of Company Shares pursuant to the applicable
provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which notice constitutes
the notice to holders of Company Shares required by applicable Legal
Requirement that dissenters or appraisal rights may be available to holders
of Company Shares in accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law.

 



 

 **(c)** ** **If the Stockholder Consents are not delivered to the Company in
accordance with _Section 5.6(a)_ the Company, acting through the Companys

Agreement, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of the
Company Stockholders for the purpose of considering the approval and adoption
of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the
Merger.

 



      
 

 



 

 **(d)** ** **The Company shall submit for a vote by the Company Stockholders
by the requisite threshold (and in a manner reasonably satisfactory to Parent)
any payments or benefits that may constitute a "parachute payment" pursuant to
Section 280G of the Code, such that all such payments and benefits are not
deemed to be "parachute payments" under Section 280G of the Code or be exempt
from such treatment under Section 280G, and deliver to Parent evidence
reasonably satisfactory to Parent that a Company Stockholder vote was held in
conformance with Section 280G and the regulations thereunder, or that such
requisite Stockholder approval has not been obtained with respect to any
payment or benefit that may be deemed to constitute a "parachute payment"
within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code and as a consequence, that such
"parachute payment" shall not be made by the Company, Parent or their
respective Affiliates.

 



 

5.7 **No Solicitation of Other Proposals**.

 



 

 **(a)** ** **The Company shall not, and shall not authorize or permit any of
its Affiliates (including the Company) or any of its or their Representatives
to, directly or indirectly, (i) encourage, solicit, initiate, facilitate or
continue inquiries regarding an Acquisition Proposal; (ii) enter into
discussions or negotiations with, or provide any information to, any Person
concerning a possible Acquisition Proposal; or (iii) enter into any agreements
or other instruments (whether or not binding) regarding an Acquisition
Proposal. The Company shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated, and
shall cause its Affiliates (including the Company) and all of its and their
Representatives to immediately cease and cause to be terminated, all existing
discussions or negotiations with any Persons conducted heretofore with respect
to, or that could lead to, an Acquisition Proposal. For purposes hereof, " **

Person (other than Parent or any of its Affiliates) concerning (i) a merger,
consolidation, liquidation, recapitalization, share exchange or other business
combination transaction involving the Company; (ii) the issuance or
acquisition of shares of capital stock or other equity securities of the
Company; or (iii) the sale, lease, exchange or other disposition of any
significant portion of the Companys properties or assets.

 



 

 **(b)** ** **In addition to the other obligations under this _Section 5.7_,
the Company shall promptly (and in any event within one Business Day after
receipt thereof by Company or its Representatives) advise Parent orally and in
writing of any Acquisition Proposal, any request for information with respect
to any Acquisition Proposal, or any inquiry with respect to or which could
reasonably be expected to result in an Acquisition Proposal and the material
terms and conditions of such request, Acquisition Proposal or inquiry.

 



 

 **(c)** ** **The rights and remedies for noncompliance with this _Section
5.7_ include having such provision specifically enforced by any court having
equity jurisdiction. Such breach or threatened breach will cause irreparable
injury to Parent and that money damages would not provide an adequate remedy
to Parent.

 



 

5.8 **Notice of Certain Events**.

 



 

 **(a)** ** **From the date hereof until the expiration of the Pre-Closing
Period, Company shall promptly notify Parent in writing of:

the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

 **(b)** ** **Parents receipt of information pursuant to this _Section 5.10_

amend or supplement the Company Disclosure Schedule.

respects, in each case as of the date of this Agreement and as of the Closing
Date with the same effect as though made as of the Closing Date, except that
the accuracy of representations and warranties that by their terms speak as of
a specified date will be determined as of such date.

 



 

 **(b)** ** ****Performance of Covenants**. Parent and Merger Sub has complied
with and performed in all material respects all of its respective covenants
under this Agreement required to be complied with or performed by Parent and
Merger Sub, as applicable, at or prior to the Closing.

 



 

 **(c)** ** ****Parent Closing Certificate**. The Company has received a
certificate executed on behalf of Parent by an officer of Parent (the " **
_Parent Closing Certificate_** ") representing and warranting that the
conditions set forth in _Sections 6.3(a)_ and _6.3(b)_ have been satisfied.

 



 

 **(d)** ** ****Receipt of Closing Deliverables**. Company has received each
of the agreements, instruments and other documents set forth in _Section
1.2(a)_, and Parent has satisfied its Closing payment obligations set forth
herein.

 



 

 **7.** ** ****TERMINATION**.

 



 

7.1 **Termination**. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the
Closing (with respect to _Sections 7.1(b)_ through _7.1(d)_ , by notice from
the terminating party to the other party setting forth a brief description of
the basis for termination):

 



 

 **(a)** ** **by the mutual written consent of the Parent and the Company;

 



 

 **(b)** ** **by the Parent or the Company if the Closing has not been
consummated by the three month anniversary of the date hereof; _provided,
however_ , that the

 



      
 

 



 

right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section 7.1(b)_ is not
available to any party whose failure to comply with or perform in any material
respect any covenant under this Agreement has been the cause of or resulted in
the failure of the Closing to occur on or before such date;

 



 

 **(c)** ** **without limiting the right of Parent or the Company to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(b)_, by the Company if (i) there is a
material breach of any of the representations or warranties of Parent or
Merger Sub in this Agreement such that the condition set forth in _Section
6.3(a)_ would not be satisfied, or there has been a material breach by Parent
or Merger Sub of any of its respective covenants in this Agreement such that
the condition set forth in _Section 6.3(b)_ would not be satisfied, (ii) the
Company has delivered to Parent a written notice of such breach, and (iii) at
least thirty (30) Business Days has elapsed since the delivery of such notice
without such breach having been cured ( _provided, however_ , that no such
cure period is available or applicable to any such breach which by its nature
cannot be cured); or

 



 

 **(d)** ** **without limiting the right of Parent or the Company to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(b)_, by Parent if (i) there is a
material breach of any of the representations or warranties of the Company in
this Agreement such that the condition set forth in _Section 6.2(a)_ would
not be satisfied, or there has been a material breach by the Company of any of
their covenants in this Agreement such that the condition set forth in
_Section 6.2(b)_ would not be satisfied, (ii) Parent has delivered to the
Company a written notice of such breach, and (iii) at least thirty (30)
Business Days has elapsed since the delivery of such notice without such
breach having been cured ( _provided, however_ , that no such cure period is
available or applicable to any such breach which by its nature cannot be
cured).

 



 

7.2 **Effect of Termination**. Upon termination of this Agreement as provided
in _Section 7.1_, this Agreement is of no further force or effect, and there
is no liability on the part of Parent or the Company or their respective
officers, directors, or stockholders, except to the extent that such liability
results from any prior breach by a party of any of its covenants, agreements,
representations, or warranties set forth in this Agreement; _provided,
however,_ that the provisions of _Section 1.13(e)_, _Section 9_ and the
Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and survive
any termination of this Agreement.

 



 

 **8.** ** ****ESCROW AND INDEMNIFICATION**.

 



 

8.1 **Indemnification**.

 



 

 **(a)** ** ****Expiration of Representations, Warranties, and Covenants**.
All representations and warranties made by the Company in this Agreement, all
representations and warranties made by the Company Stockholders in any Letter
of Transmittal, all representations and warranties made by the Cashed-Out
Optionholders in any Option Termination Agreement, and all representations and
warranties made by the Company Warrantholders in any Warrant Termination
Agreement, survive the Closing for a period beginning on the Closing Date and
ending on the 12-month anniversary of the Closing Date, at which time such
representations and warranties expire and terminate and be of no further force
and effect; _provided, however,_ that the representations in any Option
Termination Agreement, Warrant Termination Agreement and Letter of Transmittal
survive the Closing indefinitely (the date of expiration of any representation
or warranty in this Agreement, being a " ** _Representation_**

 



      
 

 



 

 ** _Termination Date_** "). The covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement that by their terms are to be performed solely between the date
hereof and the Closing do not survive the Closing. The covenants or agreements
contained in this Agreement that by their terms are to be performed at or
after the Closing continue in full force and effect after the Closing until
performed or waived in accordance with their terms (the date of expiration of
any covenant in this Agreement being a " ** _Covenant Termination Date_** ").
No person may bring action for a breach of any representation or warranty
contained in this Agreement after the expiration of the Representation
Termination Date of such representation or warranty, and no person may bring
an action for a breach of any covenant contained in this Agreement after the
expiration of the Covenant Termination Date of such covenant, in each case
except for claims of which a party has received written notification (each, a
" ** _Indemnification Claim Notice_** ") prior to such expiration setting
forth in reasonable detail the nature of such claim (including a reasonable
specification of the basis for such claim and the amount of the Damages
incurred by Parent as a result of such breach, if known or ascertainable), in
which case such claim asserted in such notice shall survive such
Representation Termination Date or Covenant Termination Date, as applicable,
until such time as such claim is fully and finally resolved as provided by
this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement. It is the express intent of the
parties that, if the Representation Termination Date or Covenant Termination
Date, as applicable, for an item as contemplated by this _Section 8.1(a)_ is
shorter than the statute of limitations that would otherwise have been
applicable to such item, then, by contract, the applicable statute of
limitations with respect to such item is reduced to the shortened survival
period contemplated by this Agreement. The parties further acknowledge that
the time periods set forth in this _Section 8.1(a)_ for the assertion of
claims under this Agreement are the result of arms-length negotiation among
the parties and that they intend for the time periods to be enforced as agreed
by the parties. Following the delivery of any Indemnification Claim Notice,
the Parent shall give, and shall cause its Affiliates and Representatives to
give, the Securityholders Representative and its Representatives reasonable
access (including electronic access, to the extent available) as the
Securityholders Representative may reasonably require to the books and
records of the Company and the Parent and reasonable access to such personnel
or representatives of the Company and the Parent, including to the individuals
responsible for the matters subject to the Indemnification Claim Notice, as
the Securityholders Representative may reasonably require for the purposes of
resolving any disputes or responding to any matters or inquiries raised in the
Indemnification Claim Notice.

 



 

 **(b)** ** ****Indemnification for Company Representations, Covenants and
Taxes**. Subject to the limitations set forth in _Section 8.1(a)_, this
_Section 8.1(b)_ and _Section 8.1(e)_, from and after the Closing Date, the
Company Securityholders who receive a portion of the Aggregate Merger
Consideration (the " ** _Indemnifying Securityholders_** "), severally and not
jointly, shall indemnify Parent and its Affiliates and their respective
stockholders, directors, officers, employees, agents, successors in interest,
and assigns (each of the foregoing being referred to individually as an " **
_Indemnified Person_** " and collectively as " ** _Indemnified Persons_** "),
for Damages actually incurred by such Indemnified Person as a result of (i)
any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty of the Company
set forth in Section 2 of the Agreement or in any certificate or instrument
delivered by or on behalf of Company pursuant to this Agreement, (ii) the
breach or nonfulfillment of any covenant, agreement or obligation of the
Company set forth in this Agreement, (iii) any Unpaid Company Debt and any
Unpaid Specified Transaction Expenses, and any liabilities described in (b)(1)
and (b)(6) of the definition of

 



      
 

 



 

Closing Date Net Working Capital, (iv) any inaccuracy in, or dispute arising
from, the calculations made in the Consideration Spreadsheet or any payments
made in accordance therewith or this Agreement, (v) any amounts paid to the
holders of Dissenting Shares, including any interest required to be paid
thereon, in excess of what such holders would have received hereunder had such
holders not been holders of Dissenting Shares, (vi) any Stockholder-Related
Claims or Losses, (vii) the matters described in Schedule 1.3(c), or (viii)
all Taxes payable by the Company (A) for any Pre-Closing Tax Period, (B) for
any Pre-Closing Tax Period as a result of the Company (or any predecessor of
the Company) being a member of an affiliated, consolidated, combined or
unitary group before Closing including Taxes pursuant to Treasury Regulation
1.1502-6 or any similar applicable law, and (C) for any Pre-Closing Tax Period
as a result of the Company being a transferee or successor of any Person
(other than the Company) by applicable law, contract or otherwise, or (viii)
any payments or other consideration required to be paid or delivered to
members of the Companys medical advisory board. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Indemnifying Securityholders shall not have an obligation to
indemnify any Indemnified Person for any Taxes (1) resulting from an election
by Parent under Section 338 of the Code (or comparable provision of any state,
local or other Tax law), (2) resulting from any transaction undertaken on the
Closing Date at the behest of Parent (other than transactions specifically
contemplated by this Agreement) or (3) taken into account in the Final Closing
Date Net Working Capital Statement or the Closing Date Net Working Capital
Statement.

 



 

 **(c)** ** ****Indemnification for Company Securityholder Representations and
Covenants**. In addition to the indemnification obligations of the Company
Securityholders set forth in _Section 8.1(b)_, but subject to the limitations
set forth in _Section 8.1(a)_, this _Section 8.1(c)_ and _Section 8.1(e)_
and the other limitations set forth in this Agreement, any Letter of
Transmittal, any Option Termination Agreement, or any Warrant Termination
Agreement, from and after the Closing Date, each Company Securityholder shall
indemnify, severally and not jointly, each Indemnified Person for any Damages
incurred by such Indemnified Person as a result of (i) any inaccuracy in or
breach of any representation or warranty of such Company Securityholder set
forth in the Letter of Transmittal, any Option Termination Agreement, and/or
any Warrant Termination Agreement to which such Company Securityholder is a
party, or (ii) the breach or nonfulfillment of any covenant, agreement or
obligation of such Company Securityholder set forth in the Letter of
Transmittal, any Option Termination Agreement, and/or any Warrant Termination
Agreement to which such Company Securityholder is a party.

 



 

 **(d)** ** ****Indemnification for Parent and Merger Sub Representations and
Covenants**. From and after the Closing Date, Parent shall indemnify each
Company Securityholder and their respective stockholders, directors, officers,
employees, agents, successors in interest, and assigns for Damages actually
incurred by any such Person as a result of (i) any inaccuracy in or breach of
any representation or warranty of the Parent or Merger Sub set forth in
_Section 3_ of the Agreement or in any certificate or instrument delivered by
or on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub pursuant to this Agreement, or (ii) the
breach or nonfulfillment of any covenant, agreement or obligation of Parent
and Merger Sub set forth in this Agreement.

 



 

 **(e)** ** ****Limitations of Liability**.

 



 

 **(i)** ** ****Sole and Exclusive Remedy**. Except as provided in _Section
8.1(e)(vii)_, the rights of Parent under this _Article VIII_ shall be the
sole and exclusive

 



      
 

 



 

remedy of Parent. Parent may not bring any claim with respect to this
Agreement or the agreements or transactions contemplated hereby or thereby,
whether in tort, contract or otherwise, except in accordance with the
provisions of this _Article VIII_. Accordingly, Parent expressly waives and
releases any remedy, liability and any rights it may have pursuant to law or
equity other than the remedies expressly provided under this _Article VIII_.
Furthermore, Parent covenants not to sue, assert any arbitration claim or
otherwise threaten any claim that includes any remedy waived by the preceding.
The Parties agree that, to the extent required by applicable law to be
effective, the agreement, waivers and releases contained in this section are
conspicuous. The provisions of this _Article VIII_ constitute an integral
part of the consideration given to the Company Securityholders pursuant to
this Agreement and were specifically bargained for and reflected in the total
amount of the consideration paid by Parent.

 



 

 **(ii)** ** ****Threshold**. Subject to _Section 8.1(e)(vi)_ and without
limiting the effect of any other limitation contained in this Agreement, the
indemnification obligations of the Company Securityholders provided for in
_Section 8.1(b)(i)_ do not apply, and the Indemnified Persons are not
entitled to exercise any indemnification rights under this Agreement, except
to the extent that the aggregate amount of the Damages against which such
Indemnified Persons would otherwise be entitled to be indemnified under
_Section 8.1(b)(i)_ exceeds $1,150,000 (the " ** _Threshold_** "); _provided,
however,_ that such Threshold does not apply to any Special Representation,
fraud or intentional misrepresentation. If the aggregate amount of such
Damages exceeds the Threshold, then the Indemnifying Securityholders shall,
subject to the other limitations contained herein, indemnify the Indemnified
Persons for all such Damages from the first dollar. For purposes of this
_Article VIII_, references to the term "fraud" do not include negligent
misrepresentation.

 



 

 **(iii)** ** ****Cap**. The Indemnifying Securityholders indemnity
obligations for Damages under _Section 8.1(b)_ and _Section 8.1(c)_ shall in
no event exceed, in the aggregate, $18,000,000 (the " ** _Cap_** ");
_provided, however,_ that the Cap does not apply to fraud or intentional
misrepresentation committed by or on behalf of the Company or by an
Indemnifying Securityholder; _provided further_ that the Indemnifying
Securityholders indemnity obligations for Damages pursuant to _Schedule
1.3(c)_ shall be governed by the terms of _Schedule 1.3(c)_. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary, no Indemnifying Securityholder shall have indemnity
obligations for the Damages pursuant to _Section 8.1(c)_ caused by or
attributed to another Indemnifying Securityholder. In no event may Parents
indemnity obligations for Damages under _Section 8.1(d)_ exceed, in the
aggregate, the Cap.

 



 

 **(iv)** ** ****Exclusivity of Escrow Fund**. Except as set forth in _Section
1.13(e)_, the Escrow Fund (as reduced from time to time in accordance with the
Escrow Agreement) is the sole and exclusive source of payment for all of the
Company Securityholders indemnification obligations under this Agreement. To
the extent Parent Merger Shares are issued pursuant to _Section 1.3(a)(ii)_
and a portion of the Escrow Fund is constituted by Parent Merger Shares
pursuant to _Section 1.2(a)(v)_, all indemnity claims required to be
satisfied out of the Escrow Fund in accordance with this _Article VIII_ shall
be satisfied from both cash and Parent Merger Shares, in equal proportions.

 



 

 **(v)** ** ****Nature of Damages**. No party shall be liable for diminution
of value or any multiple of earnings (or any other metric) damages, punitive
or

 



       
 

 



 

exemplary damages, special damages, unrealized expectations or other similar
items, except in each case to the extent such damages are actually owed by an
indemnifying party to a third party.

 



 

 **(vi)** ** ****No Reliance**. AS MODIFIED BY THE APPLICABLE DISCLOSURE
SCHEDULES, THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF (A) THE COMPANY IN ARTICLE
II, (B) PARENT AND MERGER SUB IN ARTICLE III, AND (C) ANY COMPANY
SECURITYHOLDER IN A LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL, WARRANT TERMINATION AGREEMENT OR
OPTION TERMINATION AGREEMENT, AS APPLICABLE, CONSTITUTE THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE PARTIES HERETO. EXCEPT FOR SUCH
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, NONE OF THE COMPANY, PARENT OR THE MERGER SUB
MAKES ANY OTHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY OF ANY NATURE.
EACH PARTY CONFIRMS THAT IT IS NOT RELYING ON ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY
OTHER THAN THOSE EXPLICITLY SET FORTH IN ARTICLE II, ARTICLE III, A LETTER OF
TRANSMITTAL, WARRANT TERMINATION AGREEMENT OR AN OPTION TERMINATION AGREEMENT,
AND EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THIS NO RELIANCE CONFIRMATION IS A MATERIAL
INDUCEMENT TO THE OTHER PARTIES WILLINGNESS TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT AND
CONSUMMATE THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. WITHOUT LIMITING THE
FOREGOING, THE PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT, EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET
FORTH IN ARTICLE II, THE COMPANY IS NOT MAKING OR HAS MADE ANY REPRESENTATION
OR WARRANTY WITH RESPECT TO MATERIALS FURNISHED TO PARENT OR THEIR
REPRESENTATIVES DURING THE DILIGENCE PROCESS OR OTHERWISE (INCLUDING FINANCIAL
FORECASTS) OR MATTERS THAT WERE DISCUSSED ON OR PRIOR TO THE DATE HEREOF.

 



 

 **(vii)** ** ****Applicability of Limitations**. Nothing in this Agreement
limits any remedy any party hereto may have against any Person for fraud
committed by such Person under applicable laws or for intentional
misrepresentations by such Person.

 



 

 **(f)** ** ****Control of Defense; Conditions**. Except as otherwise provided
in _Section 5.4(c)_, which applies to all Tax Contests, and _Schedule 1.3(c)_
, if Parent or another Indemnified Person becomes aware of a third party claim
(any such claim, a " ** _Third Party Claim_** ") that Parent believes may
result in a claim for indemnification pursuant to this _Article VIII _by or
on behalf of an Indemnified Person, Parent shall promptly notify the
Securityholders Representative of such Third Party Claim. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, no delay in providing such notice prior to the applicable
Representation Termination Date affects an Indemnified Persons rights
hereunder, unless (and then only to the extent that) the Company
Securityholders are prejudiced thereby. Such notice must contain a reasonably
detailed description of the basis of the claim and the nature and amount, if
then reasonably ascertainable, of such Damages that may be indemnifiable. The
obligations of the Company Securityholders under this _Article VIII_ with
respect to Damages arising from any Third Party Claim are governed by the
following additional terms and conditions:

 



 

 **(i)** ** **The Securityholders Representative, at its option and at the
expense of the Company Securityholders, is entitled to assume control of the
defense of any

 



      
 

 



 

Third Party Claim at any time within 30 days of receiving notice of the Third
Party Claim from Parent and may appoint as lead counsel of such defense any
legal counsel selected by the Securityholders Representative and reasonably
acceptable to Parent. If the Securityholders Representative assumes control
of the defense of any Third Party Claim, the Securityholders Representative
shall inform Parent of all material events and developments, including
promptly providing copies of any correspondence and court filings, with
respect to such Third Party Claim.

 



 

 **(ii)** ** **Notwithstanding _Section 8.1(f)(i)_ above, the Indemnified
Person may participate in the defense of such claim and employ counsel of its
choice for such purpose; _provided_ , that such employment is at the
Indemnified Persons own expense unless (A) the Securityholders
Representative has failed to assume (or elects not to assume) the defense and
employ counsel in accordance with _Section 8.1(f)(i)_, (B) the named parties
to any such Third Party Claim (including any impleaded parties) include both
the Company Securityholders and the Indemnified Person and, in the opinion of
counsel to the Securityholders Representative and the Indemnified Person,
there is an actual conflict of interest between the Securityholders
Representative and the Indemnified Person, or (C) the Indemnified Person
determines in good faith that there is a reasonable probability that such
Third Party Claim will result in material non-monetary relief; _provided,
however,_ that if it is ultimately determined by agreement of the
Securityholders Representative and the Indemnified Person or by a court of
competent jurisdiction that the Indemnified Person is not entitled to be
indemnified hereunder with respect to the Third Party Claim such fees and
expenses are not Damages

 



 

 **(iii)** ** **Neither the Securityholders Representative nor the
Indemnified Person may consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any
settlement or compromise with respect to any Third Party Claim without the
prior written consent of the other, such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned, or delayed.

 



 

8.2 **Treatment of Indemnification Payments.** Any amount paid to an
Indemnified Person pursuant to this _Article VIII_ shall be treated as a
reduction in the consideration payable hereunder for Tax purposes.

 



 

8.3 **Income on the Escrow Fund. **All interest and other income earned on the
Escrow Fund (net of any losses) will be retained by the Escrow Agent and added
to and become part of the Escrow Fund. Parent shall take into account all
income, gain, loss, and deductions derived from the investment of the Escrow
Fund for income tax purposes as income of Parent. The parties shall treat for
income tax purposes a portion of any payment to the Company Securityholders
from the Escrow Fund pursuant to this Agreement as a payment of imputed
interest to the Company Securityholders, and Parent is entitled to a
corresponding deduction, in each case, to the extent provided in accordance
with the rules set forth in the Code and applicable United States Treasury
Regulations.

 



 

8.4 **Set-Off. **Parent shall not have the right to set-off any amount to
which Parent claims or is entitled to under this _Article VIII_ against any
amount otherwise payable by Parent to Company Securityholders under this
Agreement (including the Earnout) or any agreement, document or instrument
delivered in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

9.2 **Counterparts**. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, all of which are considered one and the same agreement, and
become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the
parties and delivered to the other parties, it being understood that all
parties need not sign the same counterpart.

 



 

9.3 **Entire Agreement; Nonassignability; Parties in Interest**. This
Agreement and the documents and instruments delivered pursuant hereto,
including the exhibits hereto, the Company Disclosure Schedule and the other
schedules hereto: (a) together constitute the entire agreement among the
parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior
agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with

provided in the final sentence of this _Section 9.3_; and (c) shall not be
assigned by Parent, on the one hand, or by Company, on the other hand (by
operation of law or otherwise), without the written consent of each of the
parties hereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the prior written
consent of the any other Person, Parent, may at any time, in its sole
discretion, assign, in whole or in part, (x) its rights and obligations
pursuant to this Agreement to one or more of its Affiliates; (y) its rights
under this Agreement for collateral security purposes to any lender providing
financing to Parent, the Surviving Company or any of their Affiliates and any
such lender may exercise all of the rights and remedies of the Parent
hereunder; and (z) its rights under this Agreement, in whole or in part, to
any subsequent purchaser of the Parent or any of its divisions or any material
portion of its assets (whether such sale is structured as a sale of stock,
sale of assets, merger, recapitalization or otherwise); provided that any such
assignment does not relieve the Parent of its obligations hereunder.

 



 

9.4 **Severability**. If any provision of this Agreement, or the application
thereof becomes, or is declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to be
illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement, and the
application of such provision to other persons or circumstances other than
those as to which it is determined to be illegal, void or unenforceable, will
not be impaired or otherwise affected and will continue in full force and
effect and be enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law.

 



 

9.5 **Expenses**. Other than as set forth in this Agreement and in the
Accounting Expense-Sharing Agreement, each party shall bear all fees and
expenses incurred by

 



      
 

 



 

them in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby, including, all fees of counsel and accountants.

 



 

9.6 **Governing Law; Venue**. This Agreement is governed by and is intended to
be construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of Delaware
applicable to parties residing in the State of Delaware, without regard to
applicable principles of conflicts of law. Each of the parties irrevocably
consents to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the state and federal
courts located in Delaware, in connection with any matter based upon or
arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and
agrees that process may be served upon it in any manner authorized by the laws
of the State of Delaware for such persons and waives and covenants not to
assert or plead any objection which it might otherwise have to such
jurisdiction and such process. Each of Parent, the Company (both before and
after giving effect to the Closing), each Company Securityholder and the
Securityholders Representative irrevocably and unconditionally waives the
right to trial by jury in connection with any matter based upon or arising out
of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby **.**

 



 

9.7 **Time is of the Essence**. Time is of the essence of this Agreement.

 



 

9.8 **Remedies Cumulative; Injunctive Relief. **Except as otherwise provided
herein, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party hereto
shall be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy
conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a
party hereto of any one remedy shall not preclude the exercise of any other
remedy and nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed a waiver by any party of
any right to specific performance or injunctive relief. It is accordingly
agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they
are entitled at law or in equity, and the parties hereby waive the requirement
of any posting of a bond in connection with the remedies described herein.

 



 

9.9 **Waiver. **Except as set forth in _Sections 6.1_ , _6.2_ and _6.3_
hereof, any waiver of any of the terms or conditions of this Agreement must be
in writing and must be duly executed by or on behalf of the party to be
charged with such waiver. Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, the
failure of a party to exercise any of its rights hereunder or to insist upon
strict adherence to any term or condition hereof on any one occasion does not
constitute a waiver or deprive that party of the right thereafter to insist
upon strict adherence to the terms and conditions of this Agreement at a later
date. Further, no waiver of any of the terms and conditions of this Agreement
is deemed to or constitutes a waiver of any other term of condition hereof
(whether or not similar).

 



 

9.10 **Certain Waivers.** It is acknowledged by each of the parties hereto
that the Company has retained Orrick, Herrington and Sutcliffe LLP (" **
_Orrick_** ") to act as its counsel in connection with the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereunder. The parties acknowledge and agree
that Orrick shall be permitted, without need for any additional conflict
waiver or other consent from Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the Surviving
Corporation, to represent the Securityholders Representative on behalf of the
Company Securityholders in any post-Closing matter and will not seek to
disqualify Orrick. The parties further acknowledge and agree that in
connection with any actual or potential dispute following the Closing between
any

 



      
 

 



 

Indemnified Person, on the one hand, and any Company Securityholder or the
Securityholders Representative (on behalf of such Company Securityholders),
on the other hand relating to the Merger, the Company Securityholder and
Securityholder Representative (on behalf of such Company Securityholder) shall
