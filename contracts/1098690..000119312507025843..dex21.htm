2.8 _Allocation_. Prior to Closing, the Parties shall endeavor in good faith
to agree upon a preliminary allocation of the Purchase Price and the Assumed

compliance with Section 1060 of the Code. The Parties shall endeavor in good
faith to update the preliminary allocation within fifteen (15) days following
the final determination of Closing Working Capital in accordance with ARTICLE
III, to reflect such final determination. In the event that the Parties cannot
reach an agreement on the allocation within fifteen (15) days following the
final determination of Closing Working Capital in accordance with Article III,
then, any Party may refer the matters in dispute to a mutually acceptable
independent appraiser (the " _Independent Appraiser_ ") to assist in
determining the allocation described in this Section 2.8. If the allocation is
submitted to the Independent Appraiser for resolution, Sellers and Buyer shall
enter into a customary engagement letter with the Independent Appraiser.
The Independent Appraiser shall be instructed to deliver to Buyer and Sellers
a written determination of the allocation within thirty (30) days after the
date of referral thereof to the Independent Appraiser. Each Party shall
furnish to the Independent Appraiser such workpapers and other documents and
information relating to such allocation as the Independent Appraiser may
request and are available to that Party or its Affiliates (or its independent
public accountants) and will be afforded the opportunity to present to the
Independent Appraiser any material relating to the determination of the
matters in dispute and to  



 

-26- EXECUTION COPY



 

 discuss such determination with the Independent Appraiser. The Independent
Appraiser may determine the issues in dispute following such
procedures, consistent with the provisions of this Agreement, as it
reasonably deems appropriate in the circumstances and with reference to the
amounts in issue. Except as expressly provided herein, the Parties do not
intend to impose any particular procedures upon the Independent Appraiser, it
being the desire of the Parties that any such disagreement shall be resolved
as expeditiously and inexpensively as reasonably practicable. The Independent
Appraiser shall act as an expert for the limited purpose of determining the
allocation and may not award damages, interest, or penalties to any Party with
respect to any matter. Each Party shall bear its own legal fees and costs of
presenting its case. Sellers shall bear one half and Buyer shall bear
one half of the costs and expenses of the Independent Appraiser. The Parties
agree to report and act in accordance with such final allocation in the filing
of all income tax returns (including filing Form 8594 with their Federal
income tax return for the taxable year that includes the date of the Closing)
and in the course of any tax audit, tax review or tax litigation relating
thereto, except as otherwise required by a determination, as defined in
Section 1313 of the Code.

ARTICLE III

WORKING CAPITAL ADJUSTMENT

3.1 _Estimated Working Capital Adjustment_. No later than five business days
prior to the Closing Date, Concentra shall deliver to Coventry and Buyer a
statement showing the calculation of a good faith estimate of the Working
Capital as of immediately prior to the Closing (the " _Estimated Working
Capital_ "). The amount, if any, by which the Estimated Working Capital
exceeds the Target Working Capital is referred to herein as the " _Positive
Estimated Working Capital Adjustment_ " and the amount, if any, by which the
Target Working Capital exceeds the Estimated Working Capital is referred to
herein as the " _Negative Estimated Working Capital Adjustment_."

3.2 _Post-Closing Working Capital Adjustment_.

(a) Concentra shall cause to be prepared and, as soon as practical, but in no
event later than 90 days after the Closing Date, shall cause to be delivered
to Buyer, the unaudited combined balance sheet of CISI (solely with respect to
the CISI Business) and the Acquired Entities prepared as of immediately prior
to the Closing (excluding the Excluded Assets and Excluded Liabilities) (the
" _Closing Date Balance Sheet_ ") and a statement showing the calculation of
the Working Capital as of immediately prior to the Closing (the " _Initial
Calculation_ "). Buyer shall provide Concentra and its accountants with the
reasonable assistance of personnel and timely and reasonable access, during
normal business hours, to its personnel, properties, books and records, in
each case at Concentras expense (provided that Concentra shall not be
required to reimburse Buyer for the allocable salary costs of Buyers
personnel or other general corporate overhead expenses incurred by Buyer in
connection therewith), but only to the extent related to the preparation by
Concentra of the Closing Date Balance Sheet and of such Initial Calculation.
The Closing Date Balance Sheet and the Initial Calculation shall be
accompanied by such schedules and data with respect to the determination of
the Working Capital contained therein as may be appropriate to support such
Initial Calculation.



 

-27- EXECUTION COPY



 

(b) Within 150 days after the Closing Date, Buyer may deliver to Concentra a
written notice (the " _Calculation Notice_ ") either advising Concentra that
Buyer agrees with and accepts the Initial Calculation or setting forth those
particular line items (the " _Disputed Items_ ") in the Initial
Calculation that Buyer disputes and, to the extent possible, a statement,
with reasonable detail as to the Disputed Items, of what Buyer believes is the
correct calculation of each Disputed Item and of the Working Capital as of
immediately prior to the Closing. Buyer and the advisors engaged by Buyer
shall be entitled to review Concentras working papers, trial balances and
similar materials relating to its preparation of the Closing Date Balance
Sheet, if any, for purposes of reviewing the Initial Calculation. Concentra
shall also provide Buyer and its accountants with the reasonable assistance of
personnel and timely and reasonable access, during normal business hours, to
its personnel, properties, books and records, in each case at Concentras
expense, but only to the extent related to the review by Buyer of such Initial
Calculation. If Concentra shall concur with the Calculation Notice, or if
Concentra shall not object to the Calculation Notice, in a writing delivered
to Buyer within 15 days after receipt of the Calculation Notice, the
calculation of the Working Capital set forth in the Calculation Notice shall
become final, binding and conclusive on the Parties and shall not be subject
to further review, challenge or adjustment. If Buyer does not submit a
Calculation Notice within the 150-day period provided herein, then the Initial
Calculation shall become final, binding and conclusive on the Parties and
shall not be subject to further review, challenge or adjustment. To the
extent that Buyer timely provides a Calculation Notice within the 150-day
period, all items reflected therein that are not Disputed Items shall become
final, binding and conclusive on the Parties and shall not be subject
to further review, challenge or adjustment.

(c) In the event that Concentra timely objects to any Disputed Items included
in a timely received Calculation Notice, Buyer and Concentra shall use
reasonable best efforts for a period of 30 days (or such longer period as they
may mutually agree) after the date of Concentras objection to the Calculation
Notice to resolve any Disputed Items. During such 30-day period (or such
longer period as they may mutually agree), Buyer and Concentra shall have
access to the working papers, trial balances, schedules and calculations of
the other used in the preparation of the Initial Calculation and the
Calculation Notice and the determination of the Working Capital contained
therein and the Disputed Items. In the event that Buyer and Concentra are
unable to resolve all Disputed Items within such 30-day period (or such
longer period as they may mutually agree), then the remaining unresolved
Disputed Items shall be referred to a nationally recognized accounting firm
selected by mutual agreement of Buyer and Concentra; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that if Buyer and Concentra are unable to agree on a nationally recognized
accounting firm within 5 days after the expiration of such 30-day period (or
such longer period as they may mutually agree), then within 10 days
thereafter, each of Buyer and Concentra shall select an office of an
accounting firm of recognized national standing and such two firms shall,
within 15 days after the expiration of such 30-day period (or such longer
period as they may mutually agree), then select a accounting firm
of recognized national standing to resolve any remaining Disputed Items (such
selected firm, the " _Settlement Firm_ "). Buyer and Concentra will promptly,
and in no event later than the time that Disputed Items are submitted to
the Settlement Firm, enter into reasonable and customary arrangements for the
services to be rendered by the Settlement Firm under this Section 3.2. The
Parties agree that the selection process for the Settlement Firm shall occur
only once and that such Settlement Firm, once selected, shall resolve
remaining unresolved Disputed Items. The determination of the remaining  



 

-28- EXECUTION COPY



 

 unresolved Disputed Items by the Settlement Firm shall be final, binding and
conclusive and shall constitute an arbitral award that is unappealable and
not subject to further review, challenge or adjustment and upon which a
judgment may be entered by a court having jurisdiction thereof. Buyer and
Concentra shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the Settlement Firm to
reach a determination as promptly as practicable (and in any event within 30
days from the date that the Disputed Items are submitted to it). Within 10
days after the Settlement Firm has been retained, Buyer and Concentra shall
furnish, at their own expense, to the Settlement Firm and each other a
written statement of their position with respect to each Disputed Item. Within
5 business days after the expiration of such 10-day period, Buyer and
Concentra may deliver to the Settlement Firm and to each other its response
to the others position on each Disputed Item. With each submission, Buyer and
Concentra may also furnish to the Settlement Firm such information, workpapers
and other documents as they deem relevant to the resolution of the
Disputed Items, with appropriate copies or notification being given to the
other. In addition, Buyer and Concentra shall each furnish the Settlement Firm
such workpapers and other documents and information relating to the Disputed
Items, and shall provide interviews and answer questions, as such Settlement
Firm may reasonably request. The Settlement Firm may, at its discretion,
conduct a conference concerning the disagreement with Buyer and Concentra, at
which conference Buyer and Concentra shall each have the right to present
additional documents, materials and other information and to have present its
advisors, counsel and accountants. Each Party shall pay its own costs and
expenses incurred in connection with this Section 3.2;  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Buyer, on the one hand, and Concentra, on the other hand,
shall each pay one-half of the fees and expenses of the Settlement Firm.

(d) The " _Working Capital Adjustment Amount_ ", which may be a positive or
negative amount, shall mean the amount equal to the Working Capital, as
finally determined in accordance with this Section 3.2, minus the Estimated
Working Capital. For clarification purposes, the Parties acknowledge and agree
that the Parties respective rights to recover the Working Capital Adjustment
Amount in full shall not be subject to any of the limitations set forth in
ARTICLE XII.

(e) If the Working Capital Adjustment Amount is a positive amount, then Buyer
shall promptly deliver, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account or accounts designated in writing by Concentra, an amount equal to the
Working Capital Adjustment Amount, together with interest thereon from the
Closing Date to the date of payment at the prime rate of interest designated
by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (" _Bank_ "), as of the Closing Date (the "
_Closing Date Interest Rate_ ") (such amount is referred to herein as the "
_Positive Working Capital Adjustment Payment_ "). If the Working Capital
Adjustment Amount is a negative amount, then Concentra shall promptly deliver
or cause an Affiliate to promptly deliver, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account designated in writing by Buyer, an amount equal
to the Working Capital Adjustment Amount, together with interest thereon from
the Closing Date to the date of payment at the Closing Date Interest Rate
(such amount is referred to herein as the " _Negative Working Capital
Adjustment Payment_ ").

(f) All amounts paid pursuant to this Section 3.2 shall be deemed an
adjustment to the Purchase Price. For purposes of this Section 3.2, all
computations of interest shall be made on the basis of a year of 365 days, in
each case for the actual number of days  



 

-29- EXECUTION COPY



 

 (including the first day but excluding the last day) occurring in the period
for which such interest is payable. Any payments made by any Person pursuant
to this Section 3.2 shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available
funds within five business days after the date on which the Working Capital
determination becomes final and binding on the Parties under this Section 3.2.

 

(g) The Working Capital, as finally determined pursuant to this Section 3.2,
shall be the final Working Capital for purposes of this Agreement. 

3.3 _Methodology for Working Capital Calculations_. All Working Capital
determinations made pursuant to this ARTICLE III (estimated and actual),
including each and every amount and calculation determined in accordance
therewith, shall be determined and calculated in accordance with this
Agreement and, to the extent not inconsistent with this Agreement, GAAP. For
the avoidance of doubt, the Parties covenant and agree that if this Agreement
is inconsistent with GAAP, the terms of this Agreement shall control.

Except as set forth in the Concentra Disclosure Letter (which Concentra
Disclosure Letter shall be arranged to correspond to the numbered
subsections contained in this ARTICLE IV and qualify each subsection in this
ARTICLE IV to the extent that it is reasonably apparent on the face of such
disclosure that such disclosure is applicable to such subsection and

of each such Person, enforceable against it in accordance with its terms,
except as enforcement may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium and other laws affecting creditors rights
generally and except insofar as the availability of equitable remedies may be
limited by applicable law. Except as set forth in Section 4.2 of the
Concentra Disclosure Letter, none of the execution and delivery by any of the

Contract, (d) results in the creation of a Lien on any of the Shares or the
Acquired Assets or (e) violates or conflicts with any Rulings or Regulations

Concentra Disclosure Letter. Use of the Leased Real Property for the various
purposes for which it is presently being used is permitted under all
applicable zoning legal requirements. No condemnation proceeding is pending
or, to Concentras Knowledge, threatened, which would preclude or materially
impair the use of any such leased real property for the uses for which it is
intended.

(c) CISI has good title to, or holds pursuant to valid and enforceable leases
to, all the tangible properties and assets (excluding real property) included
in the Acquired Assets, with only such exceptions as constitute Permitted

representation or warranty. (By way of example, as to the foregoing sentence,
environmental matters are addressed in the representations and warranties in

any claim, dispute, action, cause of action, investigation or proceeding of
any kind by or against any Person, and shall (and shall cause Buyer and each
of its Subsidiaries to) cooperate fully with Concentra and its representatives
(including counsel and independent auditors) in connection with the foregoing,
at the sole cost and expense of Concentra, including, without limitation, by

normal business hours, and upon reasonable notice, make available and provide
Coventry and its representatives (including counsel and independent auditors)
with access to the facilities and properties of Concentra and each of its
Subsidiaries and to all information, files, documents and records (written

protected by legal privilege relating to CISI or the Business for any and all
periods prior to or including the Closing Date that they may require with

any reasonable business purpose.

6.4 _Notification of Certain Matters_.

(a) Concentra shall give prompt written notice to Coventry of: (i) the
occurrence, or failure to occur, of any event, condition, fact or circumstance
of which it has Knowledge that would be reasonably likely to cause any
representation or warranty of Concentra  



 

-49- EXECUTION COPY



 

 and the Sellers contained in this Agreement or in any other Transaction
Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect at any time from
the date of this Agreement to the Closing determined as if such
representation or warranty were made at such time, (ii) the failure of
Concentra or the Sellers to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any
covenant to be complied with by it hereunder, (iii) any written notice or
other written communication from any Person alleging that the Consent of such
person is or may be required in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and (iv) any written notice or other written communication

representations or warranties of the Parties or the conditions to
their respective obligations hereunder. Solely to the extent such disclosure
under clause (i) above relates to an event, condition, fact or circumstance
that first occurs after the date of this Agreement and which results in a
breach of a representation or warranty, Concentra shall be entitled to make
such disclosures in the form of updates and/or modifications to the Concentra
Disclosure Letter. In the event Concentra acknowledges in writing that such
update gives rise to a termination right by Coventry under ARTICLE XI and
Coventry nevertheless waives or fails to timely exercise its right to
terminate as set forth below, such update shall amend and supplement the
appropriate Sections of the Concentra Disclosure Letter previously delivered
solely for the purposes of ARTICLE XII only; _provided_ , _however_ , that in
no event shall such updates amend the Concentra Disclosure Letter for the
purpose of determining whether any of the conditions set forth in Section
10.2 have been satisfied, except to the extent set forth in the following
sentence. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary,
unless Coventry and Buyer provides Concentra and the Sellers with a written
termination notice pursuant to ARTICLE XI within five business days following
the later to occur of (i) the receipt of reasonably detailed supporting
information relating to the matters described in such update or (ii) the
expiration of any applicable Cure Period in respect of a breach described in
an updated Concentra Disclosure Letter delivered pursuant to the preceding
sentence, Coventry, solely with respect to the breach(es) described in the
update to the Concentra Disclosure Letter, shall be deemed to have waived its
right to terminate this Agreement or prevent the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement pursuant to ARTICLE XI or Section
10.2, as applicable.

(b) Coventry and Buyer shall give to Concentra prompt written notice of: (i)
the occurrence, or failure to occur, of any event, conditions, fact
or circumstance of which either of them has Knowledge that would be
reasonably likely to cause any representation or warranty of Coventry or Buyer
contained in this Agreement or in any other Transaction Agreement to be untrue
or inaccurate in any material respect at any time from the date of this
Agreement to the Closing determined as if such representation or warranty were
made at such time, (ii) the existence of any fact or circumstance or the
occurrence, or failure to occur, of any event of which either of them has
Knowledge that would be reasonably likely to cause any representation or
warranty of Concentra or the Sellers contained in this Agreement or in any
other Transaction Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate in any material
respect at any time from the date of this Agreement to the Closing determined
as if such representation or warranty were made at such time, (iii) the
failure of Coventry or Buyer to comply with or satisfy in any material respect
any covenant to be complied with by it hereunder, (iv) any written notice or
other written communication from any Person alleging that the Consent of such
Person is or may be required in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and (v) any written notice or  



 

-50- EXECUTION COPY



 

 other written communication from any Governmental Authority in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. No such notification
shall affect the representations or warranties of the Parties or the
conditions to their respective obligations hereunder.

6.5 _HSR_. From the date hereof through the date of termination of the
required waiting period under the HSR Act, Coventry and Buyer shall not, and
shall cause their Affiliates not to, take any action that could reasonably be
expected to hinder or delay the obtaining of clearance or the expiration of
the required waiting period under the HSR Act or any other applicable
Antitrust Law. Coventry and Buyer shall pay the filing fees relating to any
filings made pursuant to the HSR Act in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

6.6 _Governmental Consents_. Promptly following the execution of this
Agreement, but in no event later than ten business days following the date of
this Agreement, the parties shall file, or cause to be filed by their
respective "ultimate parent entities," with the FTC and the DOJ the
notifications and other information (if any) required to be filed under the
HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated in the Transaction
Agreements. Promptly following the execution of this Agreement, Concentra and
Coventry shall promptly proceed to prepare and file with the appropriate
Governmental Authorities such additional requests, reports or notifications as
may be required or, in the opinion of Coventry and Concentra, advisable, in
connection with this Agreement and shall diligently and expeditiously
prosecute, and shall cooperate fully with each other in the prosecution of,
such matters. Except as may be prohibited by any Governmental Authority or by
any Regulation, each of Coventry and Concentra shall furnish to the other such
necessary information and reasonable assistance as the other may reasonably
request in connection with its preparation of any filing or submission which
is necessary or, in the opinion of Coventry and Concentra, advisable, under
the HSR Act. Coventry and Concentra shall keep each other apprised of the
status of any communications with, and any inquiries or requests for
additional information from, the FTC or the DOJ. In the event a suit is
threatened or instituted challenging the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement as violative of any Antitrust Laws, subject to the last
sentence of this Section 6.6, Coventry shall use reasonable best efforts to
avoid the filing of; or resist or resolve such suit. Coventry shall be
entitled to direct any proceedings or negotiations with any Governmental
Authority relating to any of the foregoing, provided that it shall afford
Concentra a reasonable opportunity to participate therein. In addition,
subject to the last sentence of this Section 6.6, Coventry shall use its
reasonable best efforts to take action as may be required by any federal or
state court of the United States in any suit brought by any Governmental
Authority or any other person challenging the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement as violative of any Antitrust Laws, in order to avoid the entry
of any permanent injunction or other permanent order which has the effect of
preventing the consummation of the transactions contemplated herein prior
to the Termination Date, and in the event that any permanent or preliminary
injunction or other order is entered or becomes reasonably foreseeable to be
entered in any proceeding that would make consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby in accordance with the terms of this Agreement unlawful
or that would prevent or delay consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby, Coventry shall use its reasonable best efforts to promptly take any
and all steps necessary, subject to the last sentence of this Section 6.6, to
vacate, modify or suspend such injunction or order so as to  



 

-51- EXECUTION COPY



 

 permit such consummation prior to the Termination Date. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Coventry shall not have
any obligation under this Agreement: (i) to dispose, transfer or hold
separate, or cause any of its Subsidiaries to dispose, transfer or hold
separate any assets or operations, or to commit or to cause any of the
Concentra Parties to dispose of any assets; (ii) to discontinue or cause any
of its Subsidiaries to discontinue offering any product or service, or to
commit to cause any of the Concentra Parties to discontinue offering any
product or service; (iii) to make or cause any of its Subsidiaries to make
any commitment (to any Governmental Authority or otherwise) regarding its
future operations or the future operations of any of the Concentra Parties.

6.7 _Consents_. After the date hereof and prior to the Closing, Concentra
shall use its reasonable best efforts, at the request and under the direction
and control of Coventry, but excluding making any expenditures or payments to
any third party except to the extent set forth in the Material Contract or any
changes to the terms of the Material Contract except to the extent that
such changes do not take effect until the Closing, (i) to obtain the Consent,
in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Coventry, from any party to a
Material Contract that is required to be obtained by CISI or the Acquired
Entities in connection with the execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements, or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, and (ii) to obtain all Consents,
approvals and waivers required to be obtained from the lenders under the
Credit Agreement in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, such
that the condition set forth in Section 10.3(d) shall have been satisfied
within sixty (60) days from the date hereof. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, Concentra shall not be required to refinance the indebtedness
outstanding under its Credit Agreement.

6.8 _Reasonable Efforts; Further Assurances_.

(a) Subject to Section 6.6 and Section 6.7, which shall govern the subject
matter thereof, prior to the Closing, upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, the Parties shall use reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary, proper or advisable (subject to any applicable
laws) to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as
practicable. In addition, no Party shall take any action after the date of
this Agreement to materially delay the obtaining of, or result in not
obtaining, any Consent from any Governmental Authority necessary to be
obtained prior to Closing.

(b) At and after the Closing, each of the Parties hereto agrees to use its
reasonable efforts to execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and
delivered, all documents and to take, or cause to be taken, all actions that
may be reasonably necessary or appropriate, in the reasonable opinion of
counsel for Concentra and Coventry, to effectuate the provisions of this
Agreement. In furtherance of the foregoing, each Party covenants and agrees
that to the extent that, after the Closing, any assets, properties or rights
are in its possession or control that, pursuant to the terms of this Agreement
or any other Transaction Agreement, should be in the possession or control of
any other Party, it shall promptly take all actions that may be reasonably
necessary or appropriate to promptly and effectively transfer all such assets,
properties or rights to such Person in accordance with the Transaction
Agreements. For example (and not by way of  



 

-52- EXECUTION COPY



 

 limitation), if Concentra or any member of the Concentra Group receives any
payment in respect of an Accounts Receivable of the Business after the
Closing, Concentra shall promptly remit such payment to Buyer and if Buyer or
any member of the CISI Group receives any payment in respect of a receivable
of the Retained Business, Buyer shall promptly remit such payment to
Concentra.

(c) Buyer covenants and agrees that Buyer shall promptly reimburse Concentra
by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designed
in writing by Concentra to Buyer for all such amounts paid by any member of
the Concentra Group in respect of an Assumed Liability of the Business from
and after the Closing promptly after receipt of a request therefor, together
with commercially reasonable supporting documentation of the payment thereof.
For example (and not by way of limitation), in the event that Concentra or any
member of the Concentra Group makes any payment in respect of an Accounts
Payable of the Business, Buyer shall reimburse Concentra or its designee
therefor promptly after receipt of a request therefor, together with
commercially reasonable supporting documentation of the payment thereof. In
furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, in the event that
customers of the Business bill any member of the Concentra Group or make
deductions against any member of the Concentra Groups receivables, including
for promotion programs or with respect to returns (such as for unused
services), in each case, that should have been made against or are applicable
to the Business, Concentra shall promptly forward such bill or deduction, with
commercially reasonable supporting documentation, to Buyer, and Buyer shall
promptly pay to Concentra the amount of all valid claims supported by such
documentation.

(d) Concentra covenants and agrees that Concentra shall promptly
reimburse Buyer by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
designed in writing by Buyer to Concentra for all such amounts paid by Buyer
or any member of the CISI Group in respect of an Excluded Liability from and
after the Closing promptly after receipt of a request therefor, together with
commercially reasonable supporting documentation to Concentra of the payment
thereof. For example (and not by way of limitation), in the event that Buyer
or any member of the CISI Group makes any retention payment pursuant to
Section 1 of the Retention Bonus Agreements, Concentra shall reimburse Buyer
or its designee therefor promptly after receipt of a request therefor,
together with commercially reasonable supporting documentation of the payment
thereof. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, in the event
that customers of the Retained Business bill any member of the CISI Group or
make deductions against any member of the CISI Groups receivables,
including for promotion programs or with respect to returns (such as for
unused services), in each case, that should have been made against or are
applicable to the Retained Business, Buyer shall promptly forward such bill or
deduction, with commercially reasonable supporting documentation, to
Concentra, which shall promptly pay to Buyer the amount of all valid claims
supported by such documentation.

(e) No Party hereto shall undertake any action to encourage deductions or
returns relating to the other Partys business.

6.9 _Investigation and Agreement; No Other Representations or Warranties_.
Each of Coventry and Buyer agrees that, except for the representations and
warranties made by Concentra and the Sellers that are expressly set forth in
Article IV of this Agreement, neither  



 

-53- EXECUTION COPY



 

 Concentra, the Sellers nor any of their respective Affiliates has made and
shall not be deemed to have made to Coventry, Buyer or to any of their
respective representatives any representation or warranty of any kind
whatsoever with respect to any data, records, documentation or other
information that is not the subject of an express representation and warranty
made by Concentra and the Sellers pursuant to Article IV of this Agreement,
and neither Coventry nor Buyer is relying on any express or implied warranties
not expressly set forth in Article IV of this Agreement.

6.10 _Intellectual Property Assignment_. Effective immediately prior to the
Closing, CISI and each of the Acquired Entities hereby assign to Concentra, or
its designee, any and all of their right, title, and interest in and to any
and all inventions, original works of authorship, designs, developments,
discoveries, ideas or trade secrets related to any Intellectual Property that
is an Excluded Asset, including all notes, documents or work papers
related thereto, whether or not patentable or registrable under copyright or
similar laws, which CISI and/or the Acquired Entities may have solely or
jointly with Concentra conceived or developed or reduced to practice, or
caused to be conceived or developed or reduced to practice, during the period
of time prior to Closing (collectively referred to as " _Joint Development_
"). If Buyer acquires, or the Acquired Entities retain, any rights in the
Joint Development despite the forgoing assignment, Buyer and each of the
Acquired Entities hereby grant to Concentra or its designee a nonexclusive,
royalty-free, fully paid-up, irrevocable, perpetual, worldwide license to
make, have made, modify, use, sell, offer for sale, import, export,
reproduce, modify and otherwise commercialize such Joint Development as part
of or in connection with its products, processes or services, and to practice
any method related thereto. In addition, to the extent Buyer acquires, or
any of the Acquired Entities retains, any rights known as "moral rights,"
"artists rights," "droit moral," or the like, Buyer and each of the Acquired
Entities hereby ratifies and consents to any action that may be taken with
respect to such rights by Concentra or its designee, and Buyer and each of the
Acquired Entities hereby waives and agrees not to assert any such rights with
respect to any action by Concentra or its designee.

the Acquired Entities shall be transferred to Concentra or an Affiliate
thereof.

6.12 _Release of Guarantees and Letters of Credit_. The Parties shall
cooperate and use their reasonable best efforts (a) to obtain the release,

agreement, performance bond, surety bond, bid bond or other similar agreement
primarily relating to the Assumed Assets or the Assumed Liabilities, including
those guarantees, endorsements, make whole agreements, performance bonds,
surety bonds, bid bonds and similar agreements listed in Section 6.12 of the
Concentra Disclosure Letter (the " _Guarantees_ ") and (b) to cause to be
issued, effective as of the Closing Date, letters of credit, bankers
acceptances and similar facilities on the account of Acquisition or the CISI
Group as replacements for the letters of credit, bankers acceptances and
similar facilities issued by or on behalf of any one or more members of the
Concentra Group prior to the Closing Date primarily in connection with the
operation of the Business in the amount and for the beneficiaries identified
on Section 6.12 of the Concentra Disclosure Letter (the " _Letters of Credit_
"). In the event any of the Guarantees or Letters of Credit are not released
prior to or at the Closing, Coventry will provide the Concentra  



 

-54- EXECUTION COPY



 

 Group with an unconditional guarantee that indemnifies and holds each member
of the Concentra Group that is a party to each such Guarantee or Letter
of Credit harmless for any and all payments required to be made under, or
costs incurred in connection with, such Guarantee or Letter of Credit by such
members of the Concentra Group following the Closing until it is released for
events that occur following the Closing.

6.13 _Non-Negotiation_. In consideration of the substantial expenditure of
time, effort and expense undertaken by Coventry in connection with its due
diligence review and the preparation and negotiation of this Agreement, from
and after the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the termination of
this Agreement in accordance with Article XI or the Closing, each of the
Concentra Parties agrees that it will not, and it will cause their respective
Affiliates, stockholders, directors, officers, employees, representatives and
other agents not to, directly or indirectly, (a) solicit, initiate, or
encourage any Acquisition Proposal, (b) engage in negotiations or discussions
concerning, or provide any non-public information to any Person in connection
with, any Acquisition Proposal or (c) agree to, approve, recommend or
otherwise endorse or support any Acquisition Proposal. Each of the Concentra
Parties will (and will cause each of their respective Affiliates to)
immediately cease any and all existing activities, discussions or negotiations
with any parties conducted heretofore with respect to any of the foregoing.
Each of the Concentra Parties will promptly advise Coventry of the terms of
any communications it may receive relating to any Acquisition Proposal.

6.14 _Termination of Intercompany Agreements_. Except as provided in Section
6.14 of the Concentra Disclosure Letter or in any of the Transaction
Agreements, effective as of the Closing and without any further action on the
part of the Parties hereto, (a) all Intercompany Agreements shall terminate
and be of no further force or effect and all parties shall be released
from all obligations thereunder, (b) all Intercompany Payables shall
terminate, all related notes shall be cancelled and all outstanding
indebtedness thereunder shall be released and forgiven, and (c) all
Intercompany Receivables shall terminate and be of no further force or effect
and all outstanding obligations thereunder shall be released and forgiven.
Each Party shall, at the reasonable request of the other Party, take, or cause
to be taken, such other actions as may be necessary to effect the foregoing.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the provisions of this
Section 6.14 shall not apply to this Agreement and the other Transaction
Agreements.

6.15 _Separation of Contractual Arrangements_.

(a) On or prior to the Closing Date, to the extent that Buyer and Concentra
mutually agree that the following is the best course of action with respect to
each Common Contract, Buyer and Concentra shall use their reasonable best
efforts to amend in a manner reasonably acceptable to, and approved in
writing by Buyer and Concentra, all Contracts between or among (i) members of
the Concentra Group and the CISI Group, on the one hand, and (ii) any other
Person, on the other hand, that relate to both the Business and the Retained
Business (the " _Common Contracts_ "), including the Common Contracts set
forth on Section 6.15 of the Concentra Disclosure Letter, so that, after the
Closing Date, such Common Contracts shall be equitably apportioned between
the Business and the Retained Business in the manner described on Section 6.15
of the Concentra Disclosure Letter, including, if commercially practicable, on
substantially the same economic terms as such arrangements exist as of the
Closing Date.



 

-55- EXECUTION COPY



 

(b) If, in the case of a Common Contract relating primarily to or used
primarily in connection with the Retained Business, such amendments cannot be
obtained, or if Concentra and Buyer mutually agree that an attempted amendment
thereof would be ineffective or would adversely affect in a material respect
the rights of Buyer or Concentra thereunder, Buyer and Concentra shall use
their reasonable best efforts to negotiate a mutually acceptable arrangement
under which (i) Buyer shall obtain the benefits and assume the obligations
under such Common Contract to the extent relating to the Business, including
by entering into sub-contracting, sub-licensing or sub-leasing arrangements
for the benefit of Buyer, or (ii) Concentra shall enforce for the benefit of
Buyer, with Buyer assuming Concentras obligations, any and all rights of
Concentra against a third party thereto to the extent relating to the
Business.

(c) If, in the case of a Common Contract relating primarily to or used
primarily in connection with the Business, such amendments cannot be obtained,
or if Concentra and Buyer mutually agree that an attempted amendment thereof
would be ineffective or would adversely affect in a material respect the

arrangements for the benefit of Concentra, or (ii) Buyer shall enforce for the

the Retained Business.

contrary in this Agreement, Concentra or its Affiliates shall be responsible
for any cash, equity or in-kind payments that are required pursuant to the
terms of any settlement agreements entered into in connection with the Settled
Actions, as described on Section 6.16 of the Concentra Disclosure Letter, and
Buyer shall assume, and the Assumed Liabilities shall include, all other
executory Liabilities under the terms of such settlement agreements from and
after the Closing.

6.17 _Straddle Period Claims_. In the event that any Pending Insured Claim or
Known Insurable Claim relates to actions or omissions that first occurred on
or prior to the Closing and end after the Closing (" _Straddle Period Claims_
"), the Liability for the Straddle Period Claim shall be equitably
apportioned between Sellers and Buyer based on the portion of the acts or
omissions that occurred on or prior to the Closing and the portion of the acts
or omissions that occurred subsequent to the Closing. 

ARTICLE VII

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

7.1 _WARN_. Concentra shall not, and shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries
to, at any time within the 90-day period prior to the Closing, effectuate a
"plant closing" or "mass layoff" as those terms are defined in WARN or any

-56- EXECUTION COPY



 

 part any site of employment, facility, operating unit or employee of the
Business, without notifying Coventry and Buyer in advance and without
complying with the notice requirements and all other provisions of WARN and
any state or local law.

7.2 _Employee Matters and Employee Benefits_. 

(a) _Offers of Employment or Engagement_. On or before the Closing Date, Buyer
or an Affiliate of Buyer shall, or shall cause the Acquired Entities to,
offer to hire as of the Closing, or in the case of employees of an Acquired
Entity, maintain after the Closing the employment of, all of the Eligible
Employees. In addition, on or before the Closing Date, Buyer or an
Affiliate of Buyer shall, or shall cause the Acquired Entities to, offer to
hire as of the Closing, or in the case of employees of an Acquired Entity,
maintain after the Closing the employment of, the individuals listed on
Section 7.2(a) of the Concentra Disclosure Letter (" _Contracted Employees_
") on terms and conditions set forth on Section 7.2(a) of the Concentra
Disclosure Letter and to comply with the covenants and agreements of Buyer set
forth on Section 7.2(a) of the Concentra Disclosure Letter.

(b) _Employee Benefits_. Coventry shall take such action as may be necessary
so that, on and after the Closing Date, and for the remainder of calendar
year 2007, Eligible Employees of Concentra and its Affiliates and Contracted
Employees who after the Closing are employed by Coventry or an Affiliate of
Coventry (" _Hired Employees_ ") are either, as Coventry may determine from
time to time, (i) provided employee benefits, plans and programs which, in the
aggregate, are not materially less favorable than those made available by
Concentra and its Affiliates to such Hired Employees immediately prior to the
Closing Date or (ii) provided employee benefits, plans and programs on
substantially the same basis as officers and employees of Coventry and its
Affiliates having similar responsibilities and positions. For purposes of
eligibility to participate and vesting in all benefits provided by Coventry to
such Hired Employees (but not for purposes of benefit accrual), the Hired
Employees will be credited with their years of service with Concentra and its
Affiliates and any predecessors thereof to the extent service with Coventry
and its Affiliates and any predecessors thereof is taken into account under
the plans of Coventry and its Affiliates. To the extent permitted by a third
party insurer (to the extent applicable), Coventry shall use reasonable best
efforts to ensure that (i) the eligibility of any such Hired Employee to
participate in any welfare benefit plan or program of Coventry shall not be
subject to any exclusions for any pre-existing conditions if such individual
has met the participation requirements of similar benefit plans and programs
of Concentra and its Affiliates, (ii) all Hired Employees eligible to
participate in any plan or arrangement contemplated above shall be
immediately eligible to participate in the similar plan or arrangement
maintained by Coventry and its Affiliates (or the same plan or arrangement if
still maintained), and (iii) amounts paid before the Closing Date by Hired
Employees under any health plans of Concentra or its Affiliates shall, after
the Closing Date, be taken into account in applying deductible and out-of-
pocket limits applicable under the health plans of Coventry provided as
of the Closing Date to the same extent as if such amounts had been paid under
such health plans of Coventry. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to
create a right in any Eligible Employee to employment with Coventry, Buyer,
the Acquired Entities, or any of their respective Subsidiaries and, subject
to the effect of applicable law and any agreement between an employee and
Coventry, Buyer, the Acquired Entities, or any of their respective Affiliates,
the employment of each Eligible Employee who continues employment with
Coventry, Buyer, the Acquired Entities, or any of their respective Affiliates
after the Closing shall be "at will" employment.

all responsibility for the provision of health continuation coverage under

amended, to (i) all employees not hired by Buyer on the Closing Date and their
beneficiaries, and (ii) all other current and former employees of Concentra
and its respective Affiliates (not including any Hired Employees employed by
Buyer on the Closing Date), and their beneficiaries. Buyer shall not have any
responsibility, liability or obligation, whether to employees not hired by
Buyer on the Closing Date and their beneficiaries, or to other current and
former employees of Concentra and its respective Affiliates (not including any
Hired Employees employed by Buyer on the Closing Date), with respect to any
notification or provision of health continuation coverage in accordance with
the requirements of COBRA.

account of any other Person, solicit, hire or attempt to hire or retain any
employee of Buyer or any of the Acquired Entities; provided, however, that
the foregoing provision will not prevent any member of the Concentra Group
from hiring or retaining or attempting to hire or retain any such Person who
(i) contacts any member of the Concentra Group on his or her own
initiative without any direct solicitation by or encouragement from any
member of the Concentra Group or (ii) responds to an advertisement or other
general solicitation for employment that is not specifically targeted to any
such Person.

(b) _Coventry_. During the period of time beginning on the Closing Date and
continuing until the date that is eighteen (18) months after the Closing
Date, neither Coventry nor any Affiliate of Coventry shall, on its own account
or for the account of any other Person, solicit, hire or attempt to hire or
retain any employee of any member of the Concentra Group in its businesses
or operations; provided, however, that the foregoing provision will not
prevent Coventry or any Affiliate of Coventry from hiring or retaining or
attempting to hire or retain any such person who (i) contacts Coventry or any
Affiliate of Coventry on his or her own initiative without any direct
solicitation by or encouragement from Coventry or any Affiliate of Coventry or

relating to a Competing Business of a nature of, or incidental to, the
services it provides to its patients on the date of this Agreement, provided,
however, that such division shall not be permitted to, in any material
respect, perform any services beyond the current nature of the services it
provides to its patients as of the date of this Agreement. Such permitted

(i) services related to a Network Dispensing System (NDS), which is (A) a

7.5 _Defense of Litigation_. Each of the Parties shall use its reasonable best
efforts to defend against all Actions in which such party is named as a
defendant that challenge or otherwise seek to enjoin, restrain or prohibit the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. No Party shall settle any such
Action or fail to perfect on a timely basis any right to appeal any judgment
rendered or Ruling entered against such Party therein without having
previously consulted with the other Parties. Each of the Parties shall use
reasonable best efforts to cause each of its Affiliates, directors and
officers to use reasonable best efforts to defend any such Action in which
such Affiliate, director or officer is named as a defendant and which seeks
any such relief, and to comply with this Section 7.5 to the same extent as if
such Person was a Party.

7.6 _Control of Other Party s Business_. Nothing contained in this Agreement
shall give the Concentra Entities, directly or indirectly, the right to
control or direct Coventrys or Buyers operations prior to the Closing.
Nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Coventry or Buyer, directly or
indirectly, the right to control or direct the Concentra Entities or the
Acquired Entities operations prior to the Closing. Prior to the Closing, each
Party shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, complete control and supervision over their respective operations.

7.7 _Failure to Obtain Consent_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement or any other Transaction Agreement, to the extent
that the transfer to Buyer of any Assumed Contract or Permit that is an
Acquired Asset requires any Governmental Authority or third-party
authorizations, approvals, consents or waivers, and the Closing occurs
without such authorization, approval, consent or waiver having been obtained,
then neither this Agreement nor any other Transaction Agreement shall
constitute a transfer of such Assumed Contract or Permit, or an attempt
thereof. In the event that the Closing occurs without the transfer of such
Assumed Contract or Permit, then, following the Closing, the Parties shall use
their reasonable best efforts, and cooperate with each other, to obtain
promptly such authorizations, approvals, consents or waivers; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, except as otherwise expressly provided herein or as
otherwise expressly set forth in any Assumed Contract, the Concentra Entities,
on the one hand, and Coventry and Buyer, on the other, shall not be required
to pay any consideration for any such authorization, approval, consent or
waiver. Pending such authorization, approval, consent or waiver, the Parties
shall cooperate with each other in any mutually agreeable, reasonable
and lawful arrangements (to the extent any such arrangements are feasible)
designed to provide to Buyer the benefits of such Assumed Contract or Permit,
that Buyer would have obtained had such Assumed Contract or Permit been
transferred to Buyer at the Closing. To the extent that Buyer is provided the
benefits pursuant to this Section 7.7 of any such Assumed Contract or Permit,
Buyer shall perform, for the benefit of Concentra and its Subsidiaries, the
obligations of Concentra and its Subsidiaries thereunder and shall be
responsible for any related Liabilities that, but for the lack of an
authorization, approval, consent or waiver in connection with the assignment
of such Assumed Contract or Permit to Buyer, would have become Assumed
Liabilities of Buyer by virtue of Section 2.4. Once authorization, approval,
consent or waiver for the transfer of any such Assumed Contract or Permit not
transferred at the Closing is obtained, Concentra shall transfer (or cause
an Affiliate to transfer) any such Assumed Contract or Permit to Buyer and
Buyer shall assume obligations under such Assumed Contracts in accordance with
Section 2.4. To the extent that any such Assumed Contract or Permit cannot be
transferred following the Closing pursuant to this Section 7.7, then  



 

-60- EXECUTION COPY



 

 the Parties shall cooperate reasonably in an effort to find and enter into
mutually agreeable arrangements (including subleasing, sublicensing
or subcontracting), if feasible, to provide the Parties the economic and
operational equivalent, to the extent permitted, of obtaining such
authorization, approval, consent or waiver and the performance by Buyer of the
obligations thereunder. Concentra and its Subsidiaries shall hold in trust
for, and pay to Buyer promptly upon receipt thereof, all income, proceeds and
other monies received by Concentra and its Subsidiaries in respect of Buyers
performance of any such Assumed Contract in connection with the arrangements
under this Section 7.7. This Section 7.7 shall in all cases be limited to the
extent necessary so as not to result in a violation of applicable law.

7.8 _Post-Closing Insurance Coverage_. On or prior to the Closing, Concentra
shall, or shall cause one or more of its Subsidiaries to, (i) purchase three-
year "tail" coverage under each Insurance Policy that is a "claims made" basis
policy of insurance on substantially the same terms and conditions as the
Insurance Policies currently in effect and (ii) name Coventry as an
additional named insured on such Insurance Policies.

7.9 _Additional Agreement_. Buyer covenants and agrees to comply with its
covenants and agreements set forth on Section 1.1(g) of the Concentra
Disclosure Letter.

ARTICLE VIII 

TAX MATTERS

8.1  _Tax Matters_. The following provisions of this Section 8.1 shall apply
notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement.

(a) _Allocation of Taxes of Acquired Entities_. Concentra shall indemnify the
Buyer Indemnitees and hold them harmless from and against (i) any Taxes of the
Acquired Entities for any Pre-Closing Tax Period and the portion of any Taxes
of the Acquired Entities for any Straddle Period that is allocable (determined
in accordance with Section 8.1(c)) to the portion of the Straddle Period
ending on the Closing Date, in each case, to the extent the aggregate amount
of such Taxes exceeds the amount of Taxes with respect to the Acquired
Entities included as a current liability in Working Capital, as finally
determined in accordance with ARTICLE III; and (ii) any Taxes of any
Consolidated Group or any member of a Consolidated Group, including pursuant
to Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-6 or any analogous or similar state,
local, or foreign law or regulation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Concentra
shall not be required to indemnify the Buyer Indemnitees, and Coventry and
Buyer shall jointly and severally indemnify and hold harmless the Seller
Indemnitees, from any Taxes resulting from any action taken by Coventry, Buyer
or the Acquired Entities after the Closing on the Closing Date outside of the
ordinary course of business.

(b) _Tax Returns of Acquired Entities_. Concentra shall prepare and file (or
cause to be prepared and filed) all Tax Returns of any Consolidated Group for
all periods and all other Tax Returns with respect to the Acquired Entities
for all Pre-Closing Periods. Buyer shall prepare or cause to be prepared all
Tax Returns with respect to the Acquired Entities for all Straddle Periods.
With respect to each such Tax Return for a Straddle Period, (i) Buyer shall
provide, at least thirty (30) days prior to filing such Tax Return, a copy of
such Tax Return,  



 

-61- EXECUTION COPY



 

 together with all workpapers and schedules utilized in its preparation, to
Concentra for its review and comment, and Buyer shall incorporate all
of Sellers reasonable comments, and (ii) such Tax Return shall be prepared
as required by applicable law and in a manner consistent with Section 8.1(c)
and with past practices, except as otherwise required by applicable law. After
the Closing, neither Buyer nor any of the Acquired Entities shall, without
the prior written consent of Concentra, file any amended Tax Return with
respect to any Acquired Entity for any Taxable period beginning on or prior to
the Closing Date; provided that Buyer shall be permitted to file and amended
Tax Return with respect to an Acquired Entity not included in a Consolidated
Group solely for the purpose of obtaining a Tax refund or benefit described in
Section 8.1(e)(ii) but only if (A) prior to filing such amended Tax Return,
Buyer permits Concentra to review and comment on such Tax Return, and (B) the
filing of such Tax Return would not materially and adversely affect Concentra
and/or its Affiliates.

(c) _Allocation of Straddle Period Taxes of Acquired Entities_. For purposes
of allocating Taxes and preparing Tax Returns of the Acquired Entities for a
Straddle Period, the portion of any Taxes of the Acquired Entities for a
Straddle Period that is allocable to the portion of the Straddle Period ending
on the Closing Date shall be:

(i) in the case of Taxes that are either based upon or related to income or
receipts, or imposed in connection with any sale or other transfer
or assignment of property (real or personal, tangible or intangible), deemed
equal to the amount which would be payable if the taxable year or period ended
on the Closing Date;

(ii) in the case of Taxes not described in subparagraph (i) above that are
imposed on a periodic basis and measured by the level of any item, deemed to
be the amount of such Taxes for the entire relevant period (or, in the case of
such Taxes determined on an arrears basis, the amount of such Taxes for the
immediate preceding period) multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is
the number of calendar days in the period ending on the Closing Date and the
denominator of which is the number of calendar days in the entire relevant
period; and

(iii) for purposes of determining such Taxes, exemptions, relief, allowances
or deductions that are calculated on an annual basis, such as the deduction
for depreciation, shall be apportioned in the manner specified in
subparagraph (ii) above. All determinations necessary to give effect to the
foregoing allocations shall be made in a manner consistent with prior practice
of the applicable Acquired Entity.

(d) _Tax Refunds of the Acquired Companies_. Except as otherwise provided in
Section 8.1(e), the amount or economic benefit of any refunds, credits or
offsets of Taxes of any Acquired Entity or any Consolidated Group to the
extent attributable to any Acquired Entity for any Pre-Closing Tax Period
shall be for the account of Concentra. The amount or economic benefit of any
refunds, credits or offsets of Taxes of the Acquired Entities for any Taxable
period beginning on or after the Closing Date shall be for the account of
Buyer. The amount or economic benefit of any refund, credit or offset of Taxes
of the Acquired Entities for any Straddle Period shall be equitably
apportioned between Concentra and Buyer in accordance with the principles set
forth in Section 8.1(c). Each party shall forward, and shall cause its
Affiliates  



 

-62- EXECUTION COPY



 

 to forward, to the party entitled to receive the amount or economic benefit
of a refund, credit or offset to Tax pursuant to this Section 8.1(d)
the amount of such refund or economic benefit within 30 days after such
refund is received or such credit or offset is allowed or applied against
another Tax liability, as the case may be.

(e) _Carrybacks_. Buyer shall make and shall cause the Acquired Companies to
make elections under section 172(b)(3) and other relevant provisions of the
Code, and under any comparable provision of any state, local or foreign tax
law in any state, locality or foreign jurisdiction in which any Acquired
Entity is included in a Consolidated Tax Return, to relinquish the entire
carryback period with respect to any net operating loss, capital loss, or tax
credit of such Acquired Entity arising in any Taxable period beginning after
the Closing Date that could be carried back to a Taxable period of such
Acquired Entity ending on or before the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_
, that with respect to any such item for which an election cannot be made
under applicable law, notwithstanding Section 8.1(d), (i) Concentra shall be
entitled to retain (and Buyer or the Acquired Entity shall be required to pay
to Concentra) the Tax refund received or Tax benefit that results from any
such carryback to a Tax Return of a Consolidated Group and (ii) Coventry shall
be entitled to retain the Tax refund received or Tax benefit that results
from any such carryback to a Tax Return of an Acquired Entity that is not
included in a Consolidated Group.

8.2  _Transfer Taxes and Property Taxes on Acquired Assets_.

(a) _Transfer Taxes_. All sales, use, transfer, real property transfer, value
added, recording, registration, notary, stamp, stamp duty or similar Taxes and
fees, and all recording costs, arising out of the transfer of the Acquired
Assets and the Shares pursuant to this Agreement and all costs and expenses
incurred in connection with the transferring and recording of title to the
Acquired Assets (collectively, the " _Transfer Taxes_ "), shall be the
responsibility of Buyer, and Sellers shall promptly reimburse Buyer for one
half of such Transfer Taxes; _provided_ that Sellers shall not reimburse
Buyer for any Transfer Taxes incurred by reason of Buyers failure or
inability to provide an exemption or resale certificate to the extent that
such would otherwise be available through reasonable best efforts of Buyer.
The Tax Returns relating to such Transfer Taxes shall be timely prepared by
the Party legally obligated to make such filing, and such party will use its
reasonable best efforts to provide such Tax Returns to the other parties at
least ten days prior to the due date for such Tax Returns.

(b) _Property Taxes_.

(i) All ad valorem taxes, real property taxes, personal property taxes and
similar obligations attributable to the Acquired Assets with respect to
the Tax period in which the Closing Date occurs (" _Property Taxes_ ") shall
be apportioned as of the Closing Date among Concentra and Buyer determined by
prorating such Property Taxes on a daily basis over the entire Taxable
period. 

(ii) Buyer shall pay or cause to be paid, when due, to the appropriate Taxing
Authorities all Property Taxes relating to the Taxable period during which
the Closing Date occurs. Buyer shall send to Concentra a statement that
apportions the Property Taxes as of the Closing Date between Concentra and
Buyer based upon Property Taxes actually invoiced and  



 

-63- EXECUTION COPY



 

 paid to the Taxing Authorities by Buyer for the Tax year which includes the
Closing Date. This statement shall be accompanied by proof of Buyers
actual payment of such Property Taxes for such tax year. Within ten (10)
business days of receipt of such statement and proof of payment, Concentra
shall reimburse Buyer for Concentras pro-rated portion of such Property Taxes
to the extent the aggregate amount of such Property Taxes pro-rated to
Concentra exceeds the amount of Property Taxes included as a current liability
in the Working Capital, as finally determined in accordance with ARTICLE III.

8.3 _Tax Claims; Cooperation on Tax Matters_.

(a) _Control of Tax Claims_. Buyer shall promptly notify Concentra upon
receipt of any notice of any Tax audit, assessment, claim or investigation (a
" _Tax Claim_ ") for which Concentra may be liable. The failure promptly to
give such notice shall not affect any Buyer Indemnitees ability to seek
indemnification hereunder unless such failure has materially and adversely
affected the right of any of the Concentra Entities to participate in and
contest the Tax Claim. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement,
with respect to any Tax Claim relating to Taxes for which Concentra or any of
its Affiliates may be liable, Concentra shall control all proceedings;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that Concentra will allow Buyer to participate at
its own expense in the defense of any such Tax Claim (other than a Tax Claim
relating to a Tax or Tax Return of a Consolidated Group not affecting any
Acquired Entity); _provided further_ that Concentra shall not settle any Tax
Claim without the prior written consent of Buyer (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld) if the compromise or settlement would materially
increase the Tax liability of Buyer, an Acquired Entity, or Coventry for any
Tax period ending after the Closing Date; and _provided_ , _further_ , that
with respect to any Tax Claim relating to a Straddle Period and involving both
Taxes for which Concentra is liable and Taxes for which Concentra is not
liable, Concentra and Buyer shall jointly control the defense of such Tax
Claim and neither Concentra nor Buyer shall enter into any compromise or agree
to settle any claim pursuant to such proceeding without prior written consent
of the other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

(b) _Cooperation_. The parties shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent
reasonably requested by the other parties in connection with the filing of Tax
Returns filed after the Closing Date and any audit, litigation, or other
proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation shall include
the retention and (upon another partys request) the provision of records and
information which are relevant to any such audit, litigation, or other
proceeding and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to
provide additional information and explanation of any material provided under
this Agreement. The parties agree to retain all books and records with respect
to Tax matters pertinent to the Acquired Entities and Acquired Assets relating
to any Taxable period beginning before the Closing Date until the expiration
of the statute of limitations of the respective Taxable periods, and to abide
by all record retention agreements entered into with any Taxing Authority.

(c) _Mitigation_. The parties further agree, upon request, to use their
reasonable best efforts to obtain any certificate or other document from
any Governmental Authority or any other Person as may be necessary to
mitigate, reduce, or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed (including, but
not limited to, with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby).



 

-64- EXECUTION COPY



 

8.4 _Tax Treatment of Payments_. The Parties shall treat any payments made
pursuant to this ARTICLE VIII as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for

be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for federal Tax purposes.

any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement set forth in this
Agreement, which breach (i) would give rise to the failure of a condition to

resulting from:

(i) any breach or inaccuracy of any representation and warranty made by
Concentra or the Sellers in this Agreement or any other Transaction Agreement

_Indemnified Party_ ") from and against any Losses the Seller Indemnitees
may suffer, sustain or become subject to (" _Seller Indemnifiable Losses_ ";
Buyer Indemnifiable Losses and Seller Indemnifiable Losses, as the context
requires, are each sometimes referred to herein as " _Indemnifiable Losses_
"), arising out of, in connection with or resulting from:

(i) any breach or inaccuracy of any representation and warranty made by
Coventry or Buyer in this Agreement or any other Transaction Agreement or any
other document or certificate delivered by or on behalf of Coventry or Buyer
hereunder or thereunder prior to or at Closing, determined in each
case, without giving effect to any "material," "material respect" or

12.2(a)(i) and Section 12.2(a)(iii), until Buyer Indemnitees shall first have
suffered aggregate Buyer Indemnifiable Losses in excess of $3,875,000 (the "

ARTICLE XII, Concentra shall be obligated to indemnify Buyer Indemnitees for
all such Buyer Indemnifiable Losses in excess of the Basket); _provided_ ,

and such Buyer Indemnifiable Losses shall not be counted toward the Basket; 
_provided_ , _further_ , that, for purposes of determining whether an Buyer
Indemnifiable Loss exceeds twenty thousand dollars ($20,000), all Buyer
Indemnifiable Losses arising out of or related to the same event or
circumstance or a series of related events or circumstances shall be treated
as one Buyer Indemnifiable Loss. Notwithstanding the foregoing to the
contrary, claims asserted under Section 12.2(a)(i) for Buyer Indemnifiable
Losses arising from a breach of a Class I Fundamental Representation or

aggregate liability of Concentra and the Sellers for Buyer
Indemnifiable Losses arising under (A) Section 12.2(a)(i), excluding claims

Indemnitees with respect to any Seller Indemnifiable Losses arising

subject to the limitations set forth in this Article XII, Coventry and Buyer
shall be obligated to indemnify Seller Indemnitees for all such Seller
Indemnifiable Losses in excess of the Basket).

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, (i) the
aggregate liability of Coventry and Buyer for Seller Indemnifiable Losses

(h) Except as set forth in Section 12.3(f), THE RIGHTS OF INDEMNITY PROVIDED
IN THIS ARTICLE XII SHALL BE THE INDEMNIFIED PARTYS SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE
REMEDY AFTER THE CLOSING RELATING IN ANY WAY TO A BREACH OF THIS AGREEMENT.
From and after the Closing, each Indemnified Party waives all other rights and
claims that such Person may otherwise have, whether in law or in equity,
relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the other
Transaction Agreements, including claims for contribution, breach of contract,
breach of representation or warranty or breach of duty. Notwithstanding the
anything to the contrary herein, claims arising under Section 7.3, Section 7.4
and Article VIII shall be governed by the terms of such Section or Article and
shall not be limited in any manner by this Article XII. 

(i) The Parties shall treat any payments made pursuant to this ARTICLE XII as
an adjustment to the Purchase Price for federal Tax purposes, unless a final
determination causes such payment not to be treated as an adjustment to the
Purchase Price for federal Tax purposes.

(j) In connection with any Losses that an Indemnified Party may seek
indemnification under this Article XII, such Indemnified Party shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to seek and pursue any available insurance
coverage or other claims against third parties that such Indemnified Party
may have in respect of such Losses and as provided in the definition of
Losses, the amount of insurance proceeds or other recoveries actually received
by such Indemnified Party shall not be included in Losses that such
Indemnified Party may recover under this Article XII and if such Indemnified
Party receives any such amounts subsequent to an indemnification payment by
the Indemnifying Person in respect of such Losses, then such Indemnified
Party shall promptly reimburse the Indemnifying Person for any payment made or
expense incurred by such Indemnifying Person in connection with providing such
indemnification payment up to the above amounts so received by such
Indemnified Party.

(k) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the contrary,
Concentra shall not be liable to, or indemnify, Buyer Indemnitees for any
Buyer Indemnifiable Losses resulting from any breach of any representation or
warranty of Concentra or the Sellers that is disclosed to Buyer in an updated
Concentra Disclosure Letter delivered pursuant to Section 6.4(a) and with
respect to which Concentra acknowledges in writing that such breach gives rise
to a termination right by Coventry and Buyer.

(l) Concentra shall not have any obligation to indemnify Buyer Indemnitees
with respect to any Claims for Buyer Indemnifiable Losses arising under
Section 12.2(a)(iii) that are asserted after the date that is 18 months
following the Closing Date. 

(m) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the contrary, in
the event that any other Transaction Agreement or document delivered in
connection with this Agreement or any such other Transaction Agreement
includes an indemnification obligation of any member of the Concentra Group,
then the terms of such indemnity shall control and the provisions of
this Section 12.2 shall not be applicable to such other Transaction Agreement
or document.

12.4 _Matters Involving Third Parties_.

(a) If any third party shall notify any Indemnified Party with respect to any
matter (a " _Third Party Claim_ ") which may give rise to a claim for
indemnification against the Indemnifying Party under this ARTICLE XII, then
the Indemnified Party shall promptly notify the Indemnifying Party thereof in
writing; _provided_ , _however_ , that no delay on the part of
the Indemnified Party in notifying the Indemnifying Party shall relieve the
Indemnifying Party from any obligation hereunder unless (and then solely to
the extent) the Indemnifying Party is prejudiced thereby.

(b) The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to defend the Indemnified
Party against the Third Party Claim with counsel of the Indemnifying Partys
choice, reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, so long as (i) the
Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party, within fifteen (15) days
after the Indemnified Party has given notice of the Third Party Claim to the
Indemnifying Party, that the Indemnifying Party is assuming the defense of
such Third Party Claim and (ii) the Indemnifying Party conducts the defense of
the Third Party Claim in an active and diligent manner. In the event that
the Indemnifying Party fails to assume the defense of any Third Party Claim
within fifteen (15) days after notice thereof is given by the Indemnified
Party, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to undertake the defense of
such Third Party Claim at the expense and for the account of the Indemnifying
Party.

(c) So long as the conditions set forth in Section 12.4(b) are and remain
satisfied, then (i) the Indemnifying Party may conduct the defense of the
Third-Party Claim in accordance with Section 12.4(b), (ii) the Indemnified
Party may retain separate co-counsel at its sole cost and expense (provided,
however, that the Indemnifying Party shall pay the attorneys fees of the
Indemnified Party if (A) the employment of separate counsel shall have been
authorized in writing by the Indemnifying Party in connection with the
defense of such Third Party Claim, (B) the Indemnified Party shall have
reasonably concluded that there may be defenses available to such Indemnified
Party that are different from or additional to those available to the
Indemnifying Party or (C) the Indemnified Partys counsel shall have advised
the Indemnified Party in writing, with a copy delivered to the Indemnifying
Party, that there is a conflict of interest that could make it inappropriate
under applicable standards of professional conduct to have common counsel)
and (iii) the Indemnifying Party shall not, without the prior written consent
of the Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed), consent to any admission or the entry of any judgment with respect
to the matter, or enter into any settlement which (A) imposes an injunction or
other equitable relief upon the Indemnified Party or (B) does not include an
unconditional provision whereby the plaintiff or claimant in the matter
releases the Indemnified Party from all liability with respect to such matter.

(d) Notwithstanding the above, the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled
to control (but shall be entitled to participate at its own expense in the
defense of), and the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to have sole control
over, the defense or settlement, compromise, admission, or acknowledgment of
any Third Party Claim (i) as to which the Indemnifying Party fails to assume
the defense within fifteen (15) days after the Indemnified Party gives notice
thereof to the Indemnifying Party or (ii) to the extent the Third Party Claim
 



 

-75- EXECUTION COPY



 

 seeks an order, injunction, or other equitable relief against the
Indemnified Party which, if successful, would materially adversely affect the
business, operations, assets, or financial condition of the Indemnified
Party; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnified Party shall make no
settlement, compromise, admission, or acknowledgment that would give rise to
liability on the part of the Indemnifying Party without the prior written
consent of the Indemnifying Party.

disclosure required by applicable laws (including federal securities laws) or
the terms of the indentures governing Concentra Notes if it determines in
good faith that it, or any Subsidiary thereof, is required to do so. A Party,
with respect to each such disclosure, shall provide the other Parties with
prior notice and a reasonable opportunity to review the disclosure.

permitted successors and assigns.

law or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement

extent possible.

13.8 _Waiver_.

(a) The rights and remedies of the Parties to this Agreement are cumulative
and not alternative. Neither the failure nor any delay by any Party in
exercising any right, power, or privilege under this Agreement or
the documents referred to in this Agreement will operate as a waiver of such
right, power, or privilege, and no single or partial exercise of any such
right, power, or privilege will preclude any other or further exercise of such
right, power, or privilege or the exercise of any other right, power, or
privilege.

(b) To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law:

(i) no claim or right arising out of this Agreement or the documents referred
to in this Agreement can be discharged by one Party, in whole or in part, by
a waiver or renunciation of the claim or right unless in writing signed by the
other Parties;



 

-78- EXECUTION COPY



 

(ii) no waiver that may be given by a Party will be applicable except in the
specific instance for which it is given; and

(iii) no notice to or demand on one Party will be deemed to be a waiver of any
obligation of such Party or of the right of the Party giving such notice or
demand to take further action without notice or demand as provided in this
Agreement or the documents referred to in this Agreement.

13.9 _Third Parties_. This Agreement shall not confer any rights or remedies
upon any Person other than the Parties and their respective successors and
permitted assigns, the Hired Employees as provided in ARTICLE VII and the
Indemnified Persons as provided in ARTICLE XII.

13.10  _Joint Liability_. Each representation, warranty, covenant and
agreement made by Coventry or Buyer in this Agreement shall be deemed a joint
representation, warranty, covenant and agreement made by Coventry and Buyer
jointly and all liability and obligations relating thereto shall be deemed a
joint liability and obligation of Coventry and Buyer. Each representation,
warranty, covenant and agreement made by Concentra or Sellers in this
Agreement shall be deemed a joint representation, warranty, covenant and
agreement made by Concentra and Sellers jointly and all liability and
obligations relating thereto shall be deemed a joint liability and obligation
of Concentra and Sellers.

13.11 _Rules of Construction_.

(a) Each of the Parties hereto acknowledges that it has been represented by
independent counsel of its choice throughout all negotiations that have
preceded the execution of this Agreement and that it has executed the same
with consent and upon the advice of said independent counsel. Each Party and
its counsel cooperated in the drafting and preparation of this Agreement and
the documents referred to herein, and any and all drafts relating thereto
exchanged between the Parties shall be deemed the work product of the Parties
and may not be construed against any Party by reason of its preparation.
Accordingly, any rule of law or any legal decision that would require
interpretation of any ambiguities in this Agreement against any Party
that drafted it is of no application and is hereby expressly waived.

(b) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the
contrary, except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, the
Parties hereto covenant and agree that no amount shall be (or is intended to
be) included, in whole or in part (either as an increase or a reduction), more
than once in the calculation of any calculated amount pursuant to this
Agreement if the effect of such additional inclusion (either as an increase or
a reduction) would be to cause such amount to be over- or under-counted for
purposes of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(c) The inclusion of any information in the Concentra Disclosure Letter shall
not be deemed an admission or acknowledgment, in and of itself and solely by
virtue of the inclusion of such information in the Concentra Disclosure
Letter, that such information is required to be listed in the Concentra
Disclosure Letter or that such items are material. The headings, if any,
of the individual sections of the Concentra Disclosure Letter are inserted
for  



 

-79- EXECUTION COPY



 

 convenience only and shall not be deemed to constitute a part thereof or a
part of this Agreement. The Concentra Disclosure Letter is arranged in
sections corresponding to those contained in Article IV merely for
convenience, and the disclosure of an item in one section of the Concentra
Disclosure Letter as an exception to a particular representation or warranty
shall be deemed adequately disclosed as an exception with respect to all
other representations or warranties to the extent that the relevance of such
item to such representations or warranties is reasonably apparent on the face
of such item, notwithstanding the presence or absence of an appropriate
section of the Concentra Disclosure Letter with respect to such other
representations or warranties or an appropriate cross reference thereto.

(d) The specification of any dollar amount in the representations and
warranties or otherwise in this Agreement or in the Concentra Disclosure
Letter is not intended and shall not be deemed to be an admission
or acknowledgment of the materiality of such amounts or items, nor shall the
same be used in any dispute or controversy between the Parties to determine
whether any obligation, item or matter (whether or not described herein or
included in any schedule) is or is not material for purposes of this
Agreement.

13.12 _Governing Law_.

(a) This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with, and governed in all
respects by, the internal laws of the State of Delaware (without
