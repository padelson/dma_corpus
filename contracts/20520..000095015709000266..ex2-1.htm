covenants and agreements of any party hereunder to become substantially more
burdensome, (c) substantially increasing the regulatory or other consents or
approvals required to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, or (d)
otherwise resulting in any substantial impediment to the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby. In the event the parties reasonably, and in
good faith, agree upon such an alternative structure, they shall be
obligated, as soon as practicable thereafter, to modify the covenants and
agreements set forth in this Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements
accordingly to reflect the change in transaction structure referenced in the
immediately preceding sentence. In furtherance of the foregoing, each of the
parties shall take all action reasonably necessary to modify the Ruling
Request to reflect the transactions as so modified and effectuate the change
in transaction structure contemplated by this Section 2.7, and each such
party shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to cause the transactions
contemplated hereby, as so modified, to be consummated as soon as
practicable thereafter. To the extent that the filing or effectiveness of
the materials necessary for the solicitation of proxies for use at the
Company Stockholders Meeting is delayed in order to afford the parties the
time necessary to obtain a response with respect to the IRS Ruling such delay
will be deemed to not constitute, nor constitute any basis for a claim of, a
breach of the Company's covenants under Article VII hereof or otherwise. The
parties acknowledge that, subject to the limitations set forth in Section
2.4(d) of the Distribution Agreement, Verizon may elect pursuant to Section
2.4(d) of the Distribution Agreement to change the structure of certain
transactions contemplated in the recitals hereto and to make amendments to
this Agreement in order to reflect such changes.

CONVERSION OF SHARES; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

 

 

3.1 Effect on Capital Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of Spinco, the Company or any holder of
any Spinco Common Stock or Company Common Stock:

 

 

(a) All of the shares of Spinco Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares canceled in
accordance with Section 3.1(b)) shall be automatically converted into an
aggregate number of duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable shares of Company Common Stock equal to the quotient of (x) the
Spinco Closing Equity Value divided by (y) the Company Average Price (the
"Aggregate Merger Consideration"); provided, however, that to the extent the
Aggregate Merger Consideration would be less than the Minimum Aggregate
Consideration, then (i) the Minimum Aggregate Consideration shall be used in
place of the Aggregate Merger Consideration and (ii) Verizon shall, at its
option, either make a payment in cash to the Surviving Corporation on the
Closing Date equal to the Spinco Value Shortfall or reduce the
aggregate amount of the Spinco Securities and/or the Special Payment by the
Spinco Value Shortfall. In connection with the foregoing, no later than
three Business Days prior to the Effective Time, Verizon and Spinco shall
deliver to the Company a statement (the "Closing Statement"), certified by
an officer of Verizon and accompanied by reasonable supporting detail,
setting forth the amount of, and identifying, all Distribution Date Spinco
Indebtedness. Each share of Spinco Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be automatically converted into
a number of shares of Company Common Stock equal to (1) the Aggregate Merger
Consideration (or, if applicable, the Minimum Aggregate
Consideration) divided by (2) the aggregate number of shares of Spinco
Common Stock issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time (the "Per Share Merger Consideration").

 

 

(b) Each share of Spinco Common Stock held by Spinco as treasury stock
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and shall cease to
exist and no stock or other consideration shall be issued or delivered in
exchange therefor.

 

 

(c) Each share of Spinco Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time, when converted in accordance with this Section
3.1, shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and
shall cease to exist.

(d) Each share of Company Common Stock that is issued and outstanding
immediately prior to and at the Effective Time shall remain outstanding
following the Effective Time.

 

 

3.2 Distribution of Per Share Merger Consideration.

 

 

(a) Agent. Prior to or at the Effective Time, the Company shall deposit with
the Agent (as defined in the Distribution Agreement), for the benefit of
persons entitled to receive shares of Spinco Common Stock in the Distribution
and for distribution in accordance with this Article III, through the Agent,
certificates or book-entry authorizations representing the shares of Company
Common Stock (such shares of Company Common Stock being hereinafter referred
to as the "Distribution Fund") issuable pursuant to Section 3.1 upon
conversion of outstanding shares of Spinco Common Stock. The Agent shall,
pursuant to irrevocable instructions, deliver the Company Common Stock
contemplated to be issued pursuant to Section 3.1 from the shares of Company
Common Stock held in the Distribution Fund. If the Company deposits such
shares into the Distribution Fund prior to the Effective Time and the Merger
is not consummated, the Agent shall promptly return such shares to the
Company. The Distribution Fund shall not be used for any other purpose.

 

 

(b) Distribution Procedures. At the Effective Time, all shares of Spinco
Common Stock shall be converted into shares of Company Common Stock pursuant
to, and in accordance with the terms of, this Agreement, immediately
following which the Agent shall distribute on the same basis as the shares of
Spinco Common Stock would have been distributed in the Distribution and to
the persons entitled to receive Spinco Common Stock in the Distribution, in
respect of the outstanding shares of Verizon Common Stock held by holders of
record of Verizon Common Stock on the Record Date, all of the shares of
Company Common Stock into which the shares of Spinco Common Stock that
otherwise would have been distributed in the Distribution have been converted
pursuant to the Merger. Each person entitled to receive Spinco Common Stock
in the Distribution shall be entitled to receive in respect of the shares of
Spinco Common Stock otherwise distributable to such person a certificate or
book-entry authorization representing the number of whole shares of Company
Common Stock that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to this
Article III (and cash in lieu of fractional shares of Company Common Stock,
as contemplated by Section 3.3) (and any dividends or distributions pursuant
to Section 3.2(c)). The Agent shall not be entitled to vote or exercise any
rights of ownership with respect to the Company Common Stock held by it from
time to time hereunder. The Company agrees that, from and after the Effective
Time, those holders of record of Verizon Common Stock who have become holders
of record of Company Common Stock by virtue of the Distribution and the
Merger shall be holders of record of Company Common Stock for all purposes
for so long as they hold such Company Common Stock.

(c) Distributions with Respect to Undistributed Shares. No dividends or other
distributions declared or made after the Effective Time with respect to
Company Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be
paid with respect to any shares of Company Common Stock that have not been
distributed by the Agent promptly after the Effective Time, whether due to a
legal impediment to such distribution or otherwise. Subject to the effect of
applicable Laws, following the distribution of any such previously
undistributed shares of Company Common Stock, there shall be paid to the
record holder of such shares of Company Common Stock, without interest (i) at
the time of such distribution, the amount of cash payable in lieu of
fractional shares of Company Common Stock to which such holder is entitled
pursuant to Section 3.3 and the amount of dividends or other distributions
with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to
such whole shares of Company Common Stock and (ii) at the appropriate
payment date therefor, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a
record date after the Effective Time but prior to the distribution of such
shares and a payment date subsequent to the distribution of such shares
payable with respect to such whole shares of Company Common Stock.

 

 

(d) No Further Ownership Rights in Spinco Common Stock. All shares of Company
Common Stock issued in respect of shares of Spinco Common Stock (including
any cash paid pursuant to Section 3.3) shall be deemed to have been issued in
full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Spinco
Common Stock.

 

 

(e) Termination of Distribution Fund. Any portion of the Distribution Fund
made available to the Agent that remains undistributed to the former
stockholders of Spinco on the one-year anniversary of the Effective Time
shall be delivered to the Company, upon demand, and any former stockholders
of Spinco who have not received shares of Company Common Stock in accordance
with this Article III shall thereafter look only to the Company for payment
of their claim for shares of Company Common Stock and any dividends,
distributions or cash in lieu of fractional shares with respect to such
Company Common Stock (subject to any applicable abandoned property, escheat
or similar Law). If and to the extent the Company does not receive the
Distribution Fund from the Agent, the former stockholders of Spinco shall
look only to the Agent to complete the transfer or payment.

 

 

(f) No Liability. None of Spinco, the Surviving Corporation or the Agent
shall be liable to any holder of shares of Spinco Common Stock or any holder
of shares of Verizon Common Stock for any shares of Company Common Stock (or
dividends or distributions with respect thereto or with respect to shares
of Spinco Common Stock) or cash delivered to a public official pursuant to
any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

(g) Closing of Transfer Books. From and after the Effective Time, the stock
transfer books of Spinco shall be closed and no transfer shall be made of any
shares of capital stock of Spinco that were outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time.

 

 

(h) Withholding Rights. Spinco, the Company and the Surviving
Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Spinco Common
Stock such amounts as they determine in good faith are required to be
deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the
Code, or under any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the
extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate Taxing
Authority, such withheld amounts will be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the recipient.

 

 

3.3 Fractional Shares.

 

 

(a) No fractional shares of Company Common Stock shall be issued in the
Merger and no dividend or distribution with respect to Company Common Stock
shall be payable on or with respect to any fractional share interests and
such fractional share interests will not entitle the owner thereof to any
rights of a stockholder of the Company.

 

 

(b) As promptly as practicable following the Effective Time, the Agent shall
determine the excess of (x) the number of shares of Company Common Stock
delivered to the Agent by the Company pursuant to Section 3.2(a) over (y) the
aggregate number of whole shares of Company Common Stock to be distributed in
respect of shares of Spinco Common Stock pursuant to Section 3.2(b) (such
excess, the "Excess Shares"). As soon after the Effective Time as
practicable, the Agent, as agent for the applicable holders, shall sell the
Excess Shares at the then prevailing prices on the New York Stock Exchange
(the "NYSE"), in the manner provided in paragraph (c) of this Section 3.3.

 

 

(c) The sale of the Excess Shares by the Agent shall be executed on the NYSE
through one or more member firms of the NYSE and shall be executed in round
lots to the extent practicable. The Agent shall use all reasonable efforts
to complete the sale of the Excess Shares as promptly following the Effective
Time as is practicable consistent with obtaining the best execution of such
sales in light of prevailing market conditions. Until the net proceeds of
any such sale or sales have been distributed in respect of such shares of
Spinco Common Stock, the Agent will hold such proceeds in trust for the
applicable holders. The Surviving Corporation shall pay all
commissions, transfer taxes and other out-of-pocket transaction costs of the
Agent incurred in connection with such sale or sales of Excess Shares. In
addition, the Surviving Corporation shall pay the Agent's compensation and
expenses in connection with such sale or sales. The Agent shall determine
the portion of such net proceeds to which each applicable holder shall be
entitled, if any, by multiplying the amount of the aggregate net proceeds by
a fraction the numerator of which is the amount of the fractional share
interest to which such holder of Spinco Common Stock is entitled (after
taking into account all shares of Spinco Common Stock then held by such
holder) and the denominator of which is the aggregate amount of fractional
share interests to which all holders of Spinco Common Stock are entitled.

any, to be paid in respect of Spinco Common Stock with respect to any
fractional share interests, the Agent shall pay such amounts to the
applicable holders.

Adverse Effect on Spinco or the Spinco Business.

duly executed and delivered by Verizon and, assuming the due authorization,
execution and delivery by the Company, constitutes a legal, valid and binding
agreement of Verizon, enforceable against Verizon in accordance with its

bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar Laws affecting
creditors' rights generally, or by principles governing the availability of
equitable remedies). As of the Distribution Date, each other
Transaction Agreement to which Verizon or one of its Subsidiaries is a party
will have been duly executed and delivered by Verizon or such Subsidiary and,
assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by the other parties
thereto, will constitute a legal, valid and binding agreement of Verizon or
such Subsidiary, as applicable, enforceable against Verizon or such
Subsidiary, as applicable, in accordance with its terms (except insofar as
such enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or similar Laws affecting creditors' rights
generally, or by principles governing the availability of equitable
remedies).

 

 

(b) Neither the execution and delivery by Verizon of this Agreement and other
Transaction Agreements to which it is or as of the Effective Time will be a
party nor the consummation by Verizon of the transactions contemplated hereby
or thereby, or performance by Verizon of any of the provisions hereof or

(or an event that, with notice or lapse of time or both, would become a
default) or give rise to any right of termination by any third
party, cancellation, amendment or acceleration of any obligation or the loss
of any benefit under, any Contract to which Verizon or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party or by which Verizon or any of its Subsidiaries is
bound or affected; (iii) result in the creation of a Lien on any of the

Spinco Subsidiary or on any of the Spinco Assets pursuant to any Contract to
which Verizon or any of its Subsidiaries (including Spinco and its
Subsidiaries) is a party or by which Verizon or its Subsidiaries is bound or
affected; or (iv) assuming the consents and approvals contemplated by Section
4.2(c) are obtained, violate or conflict with any Order or Law applicable to
Verizon or any of its Subsidiaries (including Spinco and its Subsidiaries),
or any of the properties, business or assets of any of the foregoing, other
than, in the case of each of clauses (ii) through (iv), any such violation,

approvals and filings that Verizon reasonably believes, as of the date of
this Agreement, are necessary to obtain or make prior to consummation of the

Verizon Subsidiary is responsible for filing with any Governmental Authority

Agreement, no Spinco Benefit Plan or Spinco Benefit Agreement, no plan or
arrangement sponsored or maintained by Verizon in which any Spinco Business
Employee is, or on the Distribution Date will be, a participant and no
contractual arrangement between any Subsidiary of Verizon conducting the
Spinco Business and any third party exists, or on the Distribution Date will
exist, that could result in (i) the payment to any current, former or future
director, officer, stockholder or employee of Spinco, any Spinco Subsidiary
or any of the Subsidiaries of Verizon conducting the Spinco Business or of
any entity the assets or capital stock of which have been acquired by a

"parachute payment" (within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code) or (b)

stockholder under the DGCL, Spinco's certificate of incorporation or Spinco's
bylaws. The approval of Verizon's stockholders is not required to effect the
transactions contemplated by the Distribution Agreement, this Agreement or
the other Transaction Agreements. Upon obtaining the Spinco

(b) Subject to the immediately following sentence, the assets of Spinco and
the Spinco Subsidiaries as at the Closing Date (assuming the consummation of
the Contribution), together with the licenses and services to be made
available pursuant to the Transaction Agreements, will be sufficient to
permit the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to operate the Spinco
Business independent from Verizon and its Subsidiaries (including having the
ability to interact with retail and carrier customers, to provide for
acceptances, orders and trouble reports and to dispatch personnel to care for
those orders and trouble reports, to bill for services and to collect
accounts receivable) immediately following the Effective Time (x) in
all material respects, in compliance with Law and (y) in a

behalf of Spinco with third party vendors (whether or not the same as
those under the Retained Contracts) or with Verizon or Subsidiaries of
Verizon unless (x) they are listed on Section 5.17(b)(ii) of the Spinco
Disclosure Letter, (y) the Company and Verizon agree pursuant to Section 7.24
to omit such services as part of the Realignment or (z) they involve Verizon
Third Party Intellectual Property;

 

 

(iii) as contemplated by the Employee Matters Agreement, certain of the
administrative and regional headquarters management employees currently
operating or advising the Spinco Business may not be transferred to Spinco
and the Spinco Subsidiaries and the immediately preceding sentence assumes
that the Surviving Corporation will provide such equivalent personnel as may

involve any material alterations to the manner in which customers engage with
the Spinco Business for sales and service, the manner in which the Spinco
Business delivers such sales and service, billing and remittance processing,
credit and collections, field service and dispatch, network design, network
configuration, employee training, payphone administration, the manner of
wholesale customer interfacing and related provisioning, fleet operations and
real estate management and (Y) shall not materially diminish the overall
standards of quality, timeliness and efficiency for customer services from
those prevailing immediately prior to such Realignment, taking into account
reasonable fluctuations that occur from month to month;

 

 

(vi) the Company and Verizon may agree prior to the completion of the
Realignment to omit certain operational functions from the Spinco Business to
the extent the Company wishes to integrate such functions with the Company's
existing operations as of the Closing and the foregoing sentence assumes the
completion of any such integration;

 

 

(vii) the only assets that will be held by Spinco and the Spinco Subsidiaries
as of the Closing with respect to the activities described in clauses (ii)(B)
and (ii)(C) of the definition of "Spinco Business" will be customer
relationships (and, in the case of Clause (ii)(C), those assets listed in
item (G) of the definition of Spinco Assets) and the Surviving Corporation
will need to procure all other assets needed to undertake such activities;

 

 

(viii) the Spinco Business conducted in West Virginia will need to be

5.18 Spinco Real Property.

 

 

(a) Section 5.18(a) of the Spinco Disclosure Letter sets forth the address of
all real property that is, or will be following the Contribution, Spinco
Owned Real Property the loss of which would be material and adverse to the
Spinco Business. After giving effect to the Contribution and the other
transactions contemplated by the Distribution Agreement and subject to the
receipt of all applicable consents or approvals, Spinco, or the Spinco
Subsidiaries, will have, in all material respects, good and valid and
marketable title to all of the Spinco Owned Real Property identified on
Section 5.18(a) of the Spinco Disclosure Letter, free and clear of all
encumbrances other than Permitted Encumbrances. Neither Verizon nor any of
its Subsidiaries has leased or otherwise granted any third party any right to
use or occupy any of the Spinco Owned Real Property identified on Section
5.18(a) of the Spinco Disclosure Letter, and there are no outstanding
options, rights of refusal, rights of first offer, rights of reverter or
other third party rights in Spinco Owned Real Property identified on Section
5.18(a) of the Spinco Disclosure Letter.

 

 

(b) Section 5.18(b) of the Spinco Disclosure Letter sets forth a list of the
real property leases which are, or will be following the Contribution
(assuming the Contribution occurred on the date hereof), leases of Spinco or
a Spinco Subsidiary ("Spinco Leases"). Section 5.18(b) of the Spinco
Disclosure Letter sets forth the subleases in respect of Spinco Leases as of
the date hereof (the "Spinco Subleases"). Spinco has previously made
available to the Company complete and correct copies of each of the Spinco
Leases and Spinco Subleases. With respect to Spinco Leases and Spinco
Subleases, (i) each is enforceable in accordance with its terms, except
insofar as such enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar Laws affecting creditors'
rights generally, or by principles governing the availability of equitable
remedies, (ii) there is no material default or material breach of a covenant
by Verizon or any of its Subsidiaries, (iii) no event has occurred which
with or without the giving of notice or lapse of time, or both, would
constitute such a material default or material breach and (iv) there has been
no collateral assignment or other security interest and they are not subject
to any encumbrance other than Permitted Encumbrances.

5.19 Communications Regulatory Matters.

 

 

(a) Spinco and the Spinco Subsidiaries hold, or on the Distribution Date will
hold, all permits, licenses, franchises, waivers, orders, approvals,
concessions, registrations and other authorizations issued or provided by the
FCC, state public service or public utility commissions or other similar
state regulatory bodies (the "State Regulators") or any other Governmental
Authority relating to communications regulatory matters (including
multichannel video) under all Laws currently in effect that are necessary for
Spinco and/or the Spinco Subsidiaries to own their respective assets or
operate the applicable portion of the Spinco Business as currently conducted
("Spinco Licenses"), except such Spinco Licenses the failure of which to so
hold has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually
or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Spinco or the Spinco
Business.

 

 

(b) Verizon and each of the Contributing Companies in the conduct of the
Spinco Business has complied since January 1, 2006 with, and currently is not
in violation of, any requirement of Law relating to communications regulatory
matters (including multichannel video) to which Spinco or the Spinco Business
is subject, except to the extent that any such non-compliance or violation
has not resulted and would not reasonably be expected to result in any
material burden, fine or consequence on the Spinco Business. Without limiting
the foregoing, there is not pending, nor to Spinco's Knowledge, threatened
against Verizon or any of its Subsidiaries any application, action, petition,
objection or other pleading, or any proceeding by or before the FCC or any
State Regulators which questions or contests the validity of, or any rights
of the holder under, or seeks the non-renewal, revocation or suspension of
any Spinco License. Since January 1, 2006, neither Verizon nor any of the
Contributing Companies has received written notice of an investigation or
review by any Governmental Authority (including, for this purpose only, the
Universal Service Administrative Company and any other administrators
designated by the FCC or a State Regulator) relating to communications
regulatory matters (including multichannel video) with respect to a material
violation by Verizon or any of the Contributing Companies (with respect to
the use or operation of the Spinco Assets) of any requirement of Law relating
to the Spinco Business, excluding any notice in respect of a matter that has
been withdrawn or resolved without the imposition of material penalties,
burdens or fines. Spinco (a) is capable of providing local number portability
in material compliance with 47 U.S.C. § 251(b)(2) and the implementing rules
of the FCC; (b) complies in all material respects with the requirements of
the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act, 47 U.S.C. § 1001 et
seq., and the implementing rules of the FCC ("CALEA"); and (c) is capable
of providing 911 service in material compliance with 47 U.S.C. § 251(e)(3)
and the implementing rules of the FCC and applicable state Laws of the
State Regulators.

Governmental Authority with respect to an intention to enforce multichannel
video customer service standards pursuant to the Communications Act or (ii)
agreed with any Governmental Authority to establish multichannel video
customer service standards that exceed the standards in the Communications
Act.

 

 

5.20 Company Common Stock. Neither Verizon nor Spinco owns (directly
or indirectly, beneficially or of record) or is a party to any
agreement, arrangement or understanding for the purpose of acquiring,
holding, voting or disposing of, in each case, any shares of capital stock of
the Company (other than as contemplated by this Agreement), in each case
other than any ownership by pension or other benefit plans sponsored for
employees of Verizon and/or its Subsidiaries.

 

 

5.21 Affiliate Transactions. There are no transactions or Contracts of the
type that would be required to be disclosed by Subsidiaries of
Verizon conducting the Spinco Business under Item 404 of Regulation S-K if
such companies were a company subject to such Item between or among (a)
Verizon, Spinco or any Spinco Subsidiary, on the one hand, and (b)
any individual who is a "named executive officer" (as such term is defined
in Section 402 of Regulation S-K) of Verizon, Spinco or any Spinco
Subsidiary, on the other hand, in each case to the extent such transactions
or Contracts relate to the Spinco Business but in each case excluding
compensation received as an employee in the ordinary course.

each other Transaction Agreement to which the Company is, or as of the
Effective Time will be, a party, nor the consummation by the Company of the

forth in Section 6.3(d) of the Company Disclosure Letter constitute all those
authorizations, consents, approvals and filings that the Company reasonably
believes, as of the date of this Agreement, are necessary to obtain or make
prior to consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
additional State Regulators or other Governmental Authorities not set forth
in Section 6.3(d) of the Company Disclosure Letter may require or seek to
require the Company to obtain authorizations, consents or approvals, or make
filings, prior to consummation of the transactions contemplated by this

Exchange Act for the year ended December 31, 2008, including the Company's

stockholders' equity for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and
2006 (the "Company Financial Statements");

 

 

(ii) the definitive proxy statement in respect of the Company's 2009 annual
meeting of stockholders, filed by the Company with the SEC under the Exchange
Act on April 6, 2009;

 

 

(iii) all current reports on Form 8-K (excluding any Form 8-K that is deemed
"furnished" under the Exchange Act) filed by the Company with the SEC under
the Exchange Act since January 1, 2009 and prior to the date hereof; and

 

 

(iv) each other form, report, schedule, registration statement and definitive
proxy statement filed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with the SEC

Table of Contents

 

 

 

 

 

(b) As of their respective filing dates (and if amended or superseded by a
filing prior to the date of this Agreement, then on the date of such filing),
the Company SEC Documents complied in all material respects, and each other
form, report, schedule, registration statement and definitive proxy statement
filed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries after the date hereof and
prior to the Effective Time (the "Additional Company SEC Documents") will
comply in all material respects, with the requirements of the Securities Act
or the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and, subject to the last sentence of
Section 6.8, none of such Company SEC Documents when filed contained, or will
contain, an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted, or will omit, to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading. The audited consolidated financial statements and
unaudited consolidated interim financial statements included in the Company
SEC Documents and the Additional Company SEC Documents (including any related
notes and schedules) fairly present in all material respects, or will fairly
present in all material respects, the financial position of the Company and
its consolidated Subsidiaries as of the respective dates thereof and the
results of operations and changes in cash flows, changes in stockholders'
equity or other information included therein for the respective periods or as
of the respective dates then ended, in each case except as otherwise noted
therein and subject, in the case of unaudited interim statements, to normal
year-end audit adjustments. The Company Financial Statements and such other
financial statements have been or will be prepared in accordance with GAAP,
consistently applied, except as otherwise noted therein. Since January 1,
2006, the Company has timely filed all reports, registration statements and
other filings required to be filed with the SEC under the rules and
regulations of the SEC. Since December 31, 2008, the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries have not incurred any liabilities or obligations that are of a
nature that would be required to be disclosed on a consolidated balance sheet
prepared consistently with the Company Financial Statements or in the notes
thereto prepared in conformity with GAAP, other than liabilities or
obligations that have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

 

 

(c) The Company and the Company Subsidiaries have designed and maintain a
system of internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rules
13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) sufficient to provide reasonable
assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
with GAAP. The Company has designed and maintains disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange
Act) to ensure that material information required to be disclosed by the
Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the SEC's rules and regulations and is accumulated and
communicated to the Company's management as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications of the
principal executive officer and principal financial officer of the Company
required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002,
as amended (the "Sarbanes-Oxley Act").

not been any state of facts, change, development, event, effect, condition or
occurrence that has had, or would reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.
From December 31, 2008 to the date hereof, none of the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries has taken any action or failed to take any action, which
action or failure, as the case may be, would constitute a breach of Section

date hereof.

(a) There is no material investigation or review pending (or, to the
Company's Knowledge, threatened) by any Governmental Authority (including,

other administrators designated by the FCC or a State Regulator) with respect
to the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries.

 

 

(b) There are no actions, suits, grievances, arbitrations, investigations or
proceedings pending (or, to the Company's Knowledge, threatened) against or
affecting the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or any of their
respective properties at law or in equity before, and there are no Orders of
any Governmental Authority, in each case, which has had or would reasonably
be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
Effect on the Company.

 

 

6.7 Compliance with Laws. The Company and the Company Subsidiaries are
and since January 1, 2006 have been, in compliance with all, and have
received no notice of any violation (as yet unremedied) of any, Laws
applicable to the Company, such Company Subsidiaries or any of their
respective properties or assets, except where such non-compliance, default or
violation has not had, and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.
Notwithstanding anything contained in this Section 6.7, no representation or
warranty shall be deemed to be made in this Section 6.7 in respect of
environmental, Tax, employee benefits, labor or communications Laws matters,
which are the subject of the representations and warranties made in

fringe benefit and similar plans, programs, policies and arrangements,
whether or not subject to ERISA and whether written or oral, sponsored,
maintained or contributed to or required to be maintained or contributed to
by the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, or with respect to which
any Person who is currently, has been or, prior to the Effective Time, is
expected to become, an employee of the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries (collectively, "Company Employees") is entitled to any benefit
(the "Company Benefit Plans"), or with respect to which the Company or any of
the Company Subsidiaries has any liability. Section 6.12(a)(ii) of the
Company Disclosure Letter sets forth, as of the date hereof, a complete and
accurate list of each material employment, consulting, severance, change in
control, retention, termination or other material bilateral contract between
any Company Employee, on the one hand, and the Company or any Company

Company Benefit Agreement, including any amendment thereto, (B) each trust,
insurance, annuity or other funding contract related thereto, (C) the most

ERISA Affiliate of any of them incurring any such liability, other than
liability for premiums due to the PBGC. The present value of accrued benefits
under each Company Benefit Plan that is subject to Title IV of ERISA,
determined based upon the actuarial assumptions used for funding purposes in

Plan or Company Benefit Agreement have been timely made, except for any
contributions in respect of benefits that have become due but that are not
yet payable under the terms of the applicable Company Benefit Plan or Company
Benefit Agreement. Appropriate reserves or accruals have been taken on
the Company's financial statements in accordance with GAAP in respect of any
unpaid liabilities incurred or accrued under or in respect of any Company
Benefit Plan or Company Benefit Agreement. There are no pending or, to
the Company's Knowledge, threatened claims by, on behalf of or against any of
the Company Benefit Plans in effect as of the date hereof or any Assets
thereof, that, if adversely determined would reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company,
and no matter is pending (other than routine qualification determination
filings, copies of which have been furnished to Verizon and Spinco or will be
promptly furnished to Verizon and Spinco when made) with respect to any of
the Company Benefit Plans before the IRS, the United States Department of
Labor or the PBGC.

 

 

(e) Each Company Benefit Plan intended to be "qualified" within the meaning
of Section 401(a) of the Code is so qualified and the trusts
maintained thereunder are exempt from taxation under Section 501(a) of the
Code, each trust maintained under any Company Benefit Plan intended to
satisfy the requirements of Section 501(c)(9) of the Code has satisfied
such requirements and, in either such case, no event has occurred or
condition is known to exist that would reasonably be expected to have a
material adverse effect on such tax-qualified status for any such Company
Benefit Plan or any such trust.

 

 

(f) No Company Benefit Plan or Company Benefit Agreement, and no
contractual arrangements between the Company and any third party, exists that
could result in (i) the payment to any current, former or future director,
officer, stockholder or employee of the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries, or of any entity the assets or capital stock of which have been
acquired by the Company or a Company Subsidiary, of any money or other
property or benefits, (ii) the acceleration of the time of payment or
vesting, or trigger any funding, of any compensation or benefits under any
Company Benefit Plan or Company Benefit Agreement or (iii) the breach or
violation of, default under or limitation on the Company's right to amend,
modify or terminate any Company Benefit Plan or Company Benefit Agreement, in
each case as a result of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
the Transaction Agreements whether or not (a) such payment, acceleration or
provision would constitute a "parachute payment" (within the meaning of
Section 280G of the Code) or (b) some other action or event (including
separation from service) would be required to cause such payment,
acceleration or provision to be triggered.

qualify or publicly propose to withdraw, modify or qualify, in any manner
adverse to Verizon, the Company Board Recommendation, including approving or
recommending a Company Acquisition Proposal or a Company Superior Proposal or
any other alternative course of action (any such action, a "Change of
Board Recommendation"); provided that the Board of Directors of the Company

Section 7.11(c). For the avoidance of doubt, the obligation of the Company
to call and hold the Company Stockholder Meeting for the purpose of voting
upon the items in Section 7.4(a)(i)-(iii) shall not be affected by a Change
of Board Recommendation.

transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (z) be inconsistent with the
express terms of any Transaction Agreement.

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided and without limiting
the foregoing, each of Verizon, Spinco and the Company shall (i) promptly
(but in no event later than 60 days after the date hereof) file all
applications requiring prior approval or other submissions required to be
filed with (x) the FCC (the "FCC Applications"), except those submissions
addressed in Sections 7.6(i) below and 7.6(j), which shall be made as set
forth in those Sections, and except those applications that may be filed with
the FCC for "immediate approval" under 47 C.F.R. Section 1.948(j)(2) or for
approval that permits operation upon application under 47 C.F.R. Section
90.159(c) and (y) the State Regulators in the states listed in Section 4.2(c)
of the Verizon Disclosure Letter and Section 6.3(d) of the Company Disclosure
Letter (each, a "State PUC Application"), in each case to effect the transfer
of control of the Spinco Business and to cause such authorities to permit
consummation of each of the transactions contemplated hereby or by the
Distribution Agreement, and respond as promptly as practicable to any
additional requests for information received from the FCC or any State
Regulator or by any party to a FCC Application or a State PUC Application,
(ii) use all commercially reasonable efforts to cure not later than the
Effective Time any violations or defaults under any FCC Rules or rules of any
State Regulator, (iii) use all commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate
with each other in (A) determining whether any filings are required to be

be obtained from, any other Governmental Authorities in connection with the
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and (B) timely making all such filings and
timely seeking all such consents, permits, authorizations or approvals. All
such filings shall be joint filings, unless Verizon and the Company mutually
agree otherwise.

 

 

(c) Each of the Company and Verizon shall use all commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain the consents of the FCC, the State Regulators in the states
listed in Section 4.2(c) of the Verizon Disclosure Letter and Section 6.3(d)
of the Company Disclosure Letter, any other State Regulators or other
Governmental Authorities relating to communications regulatory matters
(including multichannel video) that may require consents, permits,
authorizations or approvals and any local municipal and county franchise
authorities with respect to video franchises, in each case as are required to
effect the transfer of control of the Spinco Business and permit the
consummation of each of the transactions contemplated hereby or by the
Distribution Agreement (such consents collectively, the
"Telecommunications Regulatory Consents"), and the parties agree to cooperate
fully with each other and with the applicable Governmental Authorities to
obtain the Telecommunications Regulatory Consents at the earliest
practicable date. The Company and Verizon shall cooperate in seeking
to demonstrate that the transactions contemplated hereby meet all
applicable regulatory standards (as they may be in effect from time to time)
and to obtain all Telecommunications Regulatory Consents without any changes
or the imposition of any conditions or restrictions, other than those (i) the
Company may offer in its discretion in any application for an Order approving
the transactions contemplated hereby or in any related filing or testimony or
(ii) that would not reasonably be expected to constitute a Materially Adverse
Regulatory Condition. In the event any Governmental Authority imposes any
such material change, condition or restriction on the grant or receipt of
any Telecommunications Regulatory Consents, each of the Company and Verizon
shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to seek modification or removal
of such change, condition or restriction.

(d) Within 120 days after the date of this Agreement, or such other time as
the parties may agree, the parties will make such filings, if any, as may be
required by the HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. Thereafter, the parties will file as promptly as practicable
all reports or other documents required or requested by the U.S. Federal
Trade Commission or the U.S. Department of Justice pursuant to the HSR Act or
otherwise, including requests for additional information concerning
such transactions, so that the waiting period specified in the HSR Act will
expire as soon as reasonably practicable after the execution and delivery of
this Agreement. The Company shall pay all application fees required
in connection with any filings under the HSR Act.

 

 

(e) Verizon and the Company shall each cause their respective counsel to
furnish the other party such necessary information and reasonable assistance
as the other may reasonably request in connection with its preparation of
necessary filings or submissions under the provisions of the HSR Act or with
respect to any Telecommunications Regulatory Consents.

 

 

(f) Verizon and the Company shall each cause their respective counsel to
supply to the other party copies of all correspondence, filings or written
communications by such party or its Affiliates with any Governmental
Authority or staff members thereof, with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and any related transactions, except for
documents filed pursuant to Item 4(c) of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Notification
and Report Form or communications regarding the same, and except for
documents or information submitted in response to any request for additional
information or documents pursuant to the HSR Act which reveal Verizon's or
the Company's negotiating objectives or strategies or purchase price
expectations.

 

 

(g) The parties shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate
with each other in their communications with any Governmental Authority and
related parties, consultants and advisors relative to matters that relate
directly to or may affect the consummation of Merger or the transactions
contemplated hereby. No party or its advisor shall initiate communications,
orally or in writing, with, or respond to any inquiry or request of, any
Governmental Authority, including the FCC, the U.S. Department of Justice,
State Regulators, state attorney generals and local franchising authorities,
or any consumer advocate which is, or may reasonably be expected to be, a
party to a proceeding before a Governmental Authority, or any third-party
consultant or advisor to any of the foregoing, regarding the Merger or the
transactions contemplated hereby, without providing the other party, when
reasonably practicable, with reasonable advance notice of the communication
or response. If a Governmental Authority or any consumer advocate or any
third-party consultant or advisor to any of the foregoing initiates
communications on matters that relate directly to or may affect the Merger or
the transactions contemplated hereby, the contents or substance of that
communication shall be disclosed as promptly as practicable to the other
parties by providing a copy of any written communication and a summary of any
oral communication.

(h) If any objections are asserted with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby or the Transaction Agreements under any Regulatory Law or
if any suit is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) by any
Governmental Authority or any private party recommending or seeking to deny
the granting of any Telecommunications Regulatory Consent or challenging any
of the transactions contemplated hereby as violative of any Regulatory Law or
otherwise, each of the Company, Verizon and Spinco shall cooperate in all
respects with the other and shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to
contest and resist any such action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted,
reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order,
whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that
prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement on the express terms contemplated hereby and
by the Transaction Agreements without any changes or the imposition of any
conditions or restrictions, other than those (i) the Company may offer in its
discretion in any application for an order approving the transaction
contemplated hereby or in any related filing or testimony or (ii) that would
not reasonably be expected to constitute a Materially Adverse Regulatory
Condition; provided, however, that the foregoing obligations shall not apply
to a final Order of the FCC or any State Regulators. Neither Verizon nor the
Company shall settle any such action, suit or proceeding or fail to perfect
on a timely basis any right to appeal any judgment rendered or order entered
against such party therein without having previously consulted with the other
party. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this
Agreement, nothing in this Section 7.6 shall limit a party's right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1 so long as such party has,
prior to such termination, complied in all respects with its obligations
under this Section 7.6. For purposes of this Agreement, "Regulatory Law"
means the Sherman Antitrust Act, as amended, the Clayton Antitrust Act of
1914, as amended, the HSR Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act of 1914, as
amended, the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, and all other federal,
state or foreign, if any, statutes, rules, regulations, orders, decrees,
administrative and judicial doctrines and other Laws that relate to the
granting of regulatory consents in respect of telecommunications matters or
that are designed or intended to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions
having the purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint of trade or
lessening competition, whether in the communications industry or otherwise
through merger or acquisition.

(i) To the extent necessary to comply with state laws and regulations and FCC
Rules, including those prohibiting "slamming" as set forth in 47
C.F.R. Section 64.1120, at least 60 days prior to the estimated Closing Date
(as reasonably estimated by the parties), (i) the Company shall, at its own
expense, prepare and deliver to Verizon a draft notice providing
the information required by 47 C.F.R. Section 64.1120(e) addressed to
the telecommunications customers of Spinco and the Spinco Subsidiaries, after
giving effect to the Contribution, it being understood that Verizon shall
have the opportunity to review and comment on the contents of such notice;
and (ii) Verizon shall, at the Company's cost and expense (which shall be a
reimbursement of Verizon's out-of-pocket costs and expenses), cause such
notice to be delivered to such customers at least 30 days before the
estimated Closing Date (as reasonably estimated by the parties) by a direct
mailing or in accordance with such method of notice and notification period
that the FCC or State Regulators may order or require. Verizon and/or Spinco
will be responsible for preparing, distributing, and filing (at the Company's
expense) any notices relating to "discontinuance, reduction, or impairment"
of service to the customers of Spinco and the Spinco Subsidiaries after
giving effect to the Contribution required by 47 C.F.R. Sections 63.19 and
63.71.

 

 

(j) On or prior to the Closing Date, the Company, at its own expense, shall
adopt (to the extent permitted by State Regulators) the tariffs, price lists,
schedules of rates, or other statements of terms and conditions, including
special customer arrangements, special assemblies, price flex arrangements,
and individual customer-based arrangements of Verizon and other Verizon
Affiliates for telecommunications services, which are applicable in whole or
in part in the Territory, are effective under applicable Laws, and are in
effect immediately prior to the Closing (collectively, the "Tariffs").
The Company shall maintain the Tariffs in effect at least until the end of
the service term specified in (i) the Tariffs (to the extent permitted by
State Regulators), (ii) agreements implementing such Tariffs with customers
served by Verizon's Affiliates under retained Blended Customer Contracts and
the agreements of customers who do not provide Third Party Consents under
this Agreement (each a "Specified Contract") and (iii) agreements
implementing such Tariffs with Persons who are Affiliates of Verizon on or
before the Closing Date, and any optional renewal term exercisable
by customers which are party to a Specified Contract or such Affiliates in
such agreements or Tariffs. The Company further agrees that, to the
extent such Tariffs or agreements implementing such Tariffs contain rates and
charges or other terms and conditions based on volume of service, amount of
purchase or spend, or similar volume commitments by the customers which are
party to a Specified Contract or such Affiliates (the "Volume
Commitments"), the Company will reduce such Volume Commitments pro-rata,
without a change in rates and charges or other terms and conditions under
such Tariffs or agreements, to reflect the fact that the customers who are
party to a Specified Contract or such Affiliates may, after Closing, take
service from both Verizon Affiliates and the Company and not from Verizon
Affiliates or the Company alone. The pro-rata reduction shall be equal to or
exceed the amount of the Volume Commitment provided by Verizon Affiliates
after Closing. By way of example, and not by limitation, if after
Closing, such customer or Affiliate purchased 75% of a Volume Commitment from
the Company and 25% of a Volume Commitment from Verizon Affiliates, then the
Company would reduce the Volume Commitment by 25% in affected Tariffs and
agreements implementing such Tariffs. At its own expense, the Company shall
make all filings and take all other actions as may be required by applicable
Laws to make the Tariffs and pro-rata reductions of Volume Commitments
adopted or made by the Company under this Section 7.6(j) legally effective
not later than the Effective Time. If the applicable State Regulators do not
permit, in whole or in part, the adoption of such Tariffs by the Company or
the maintenance of such Tariffs during the service terms described above in
this Section 7.6(j), then from and after the Effective Time and through the
date on which the Company would no longer have been required under
this Section 7.6(j) to maintain the applicable Tariffs had such State
Regulators permitted their adoption, the Company will provide service terms,
rates and services equivalent to the applicable Tariffs, including reductions
in Volume Commitments, by means and methods acceptable to the applicable
State Regulators.

(k) In cases in which Verizon or any of its Affiliates is a party to a
Contract with a competitive local exchange carrier, a local exchange carrier,
or an interexchange carrier for interconnection services within the
Territory (collectively, the "Verizon Interconnection Agreements"), Verizon
and the Company agree that until Closing and for a period of six months
following the Closing Date, each of Verizon and the Company shall use all
commercially reasonable efforts to facilitate the negotiation of similar
agreements or modifications to and assignments of the Verizon Interconnection
Agreements that will transfer the benefits and obligations of Verizon
contained in such Verizon Interconnection Agreements to the Company after
Closing.

 

 

7.7 Employee Matters. Verizon, Spinco and the Company agree that throughout
the internal restructurings taken in contemplation of this
Agreement, including the Internal Spinoffs and Internal Restructurings, the
Contribution, Distribution, and the Merger, the Spinco Business Employees
shall maintain uninterrupted continuity of employment, compensation and
benefits, and, also for union-represented employees, uninterrupted continuity
of representation for purposes of collective bargaining and uninterrupted
continuity of coverage under their collective bargaining agreements, in each
case as contemplated by and provided in the Employee Matters Agreement and
other than as set forth in Section 2.3 of the Distribution Agreement.

7.8 Certain Third Party Consents.

 

 

(a) Verizon and Spinco shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to
identify and obtain prior to the Closing any material Verizon Third Party
Consents necessary to be obtained to authorize, approve or permit the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Distribution Agreement
or this Agreement. If such Verizon Third Party Consents have not been
obtained prior to the Closing, Verizon and the Surviving Corporation shall
use all commercially reasonable efforts thereafter to obtain such Verizon
Third Party Consents within six months following the Closing Date; provided,
however, that any consent costs or other considerations to be paid by Verizon
and the Company (or, for periods following the Closing, the Surviving
Corporation) to obtain Verizon Third Party Consents sought pursuant to this
Section 7.8(a) and Verizon IP Consents sought pursuant to Section 7.8(b),
together with costs associated with the separation of any Blended Customer
Contract as provided in Section 7.8(e), shall be borne by the parties as
provided in Section 7.8(a) of the Verizon Disclosure Letter; provided
further, however, that (x) such limitation shall not apply to any filing,
recordation or similar fees payable to any Governmental Authority, which
filing, recordation or similar fees shall be shared equally between Verizon,
on the one hand, and the Company or the Surviving Corporation, on the other
hand, and (y) such calculation of amounts for which the parties have agreed
to share shall exclude any amounts payable by the Surviving Corporation
pursuant to the Software License Agreement.

 

 

(b) Promptly following the date hereof and, if the Closing occurs, for a
period of six months following the Closing Date, Verizon shall use, and shall
cause its Affiliates to use, all commercially reasonable efforts, in
cooperation with the Company or the Surviving Corporation, to identify and
thereafter obtain Verizon IP Consents. The parties shall bear the costs of
obtaining any Verizon IP Consent (collectively, the "Verizon IP
Consent Costs") as provided in Section 7.8(a) of the Verizon
Disclosure Letter. For the avoidance of doubt, (i) Verizon IP Consents shall
include any authorization, approval, consent, waiver or replacement license
of a third Person required to permit the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries, as applicable, to retain rights after the Closing to any
material Network Element Software that is made available to one or more
Contributing Companies pursuant to a Retained Contract and (ii) except to
the extent provided otherwise in Section 7.8(a) of the Verizon
Disclosure Letter, Verizon IP Consent Costs shall not include the costs
attributable to obtaining for the benefit of the Surviving Corporation or its
Subsidiaries any upgrade or maintenance, support or other service used or
useful in the operation of material Network Element Software following the
Closing or the costs attributable to any licenses under Verizon Third Party
Intellectual Property required to receive and use services pursuant to the
Software License Agreement.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, but subject to
the obligations set forth in this Section 7.8(a) and, with respect to the
circumstances described in the first sentence of Section 7.8(f), to the
provisions of Section 7.8(f), to the extent any Verizon Third Party Consent
or Verizon IP Consent is required in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by the Distribution Agreement or this Agreement and
such Verizon Third Party Consent or Verizon IP Consent is not received at or
prior to the Closing, then, (i) if applicable, the Contract that is the
subject of such Verizon Third Party Consent shall not be assigned in the
Contribution and (ii) if applicable, to the extent any such Contract
requiring a Verizon Third Party Consent may only be enjoyed by Verizon or an
Affiliate of Verizon, such Contract shall be transferred to Verizon or
another Affiliate of Verizon, and Verizon agrees in each case to use all
commercially reasonable efforts to make the benefits of any such Contract
available to the Surviving Corporation for the remaining term thereof (it
being understood that Verizon shall not be obligated to renew or extend any
such Contract other than those that are up for renewal or extension within
six months following the Closing Date) and its Subsidiaries following
the Closing Date, subject to (x) the assumption of obligations in respect of
such Contract (to the extent such obligations relate to or arise from the
benefits of such Contract that have been made available to the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries) by the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries and (y) the limitations on required payments set forth in
Sections 7.8(a) and 7.8(b).

 

 

(d) Verizon shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to deliver to the
Company within 60 days of the date hereof (i) a list of all third parties
who are counterparties to a Retained Contract and which Verizon reasonably
believes were paid an aggregate of $250,000 or more in calendar year 2008 by
Verizon or its Subsidiaries as indicated in the accounts payable system of
Verizon in respect of such Contract and (ii) to the extent not prohibited
pursuant to confidentiality obligations contained in any such Contract,
either (A) a copy of such Contract (if such Contract is in writing) or (B) a
description of the products/services which are the subject of the Contract.

 

 

(e) With respect to Blended Customer Contracts, Verizon and the Company will
use all commercially reasonable efforts to obtain prior to the Closing or, if
not obtained, will use all commercially reasonable efforts to obtain within
six months following the Closing Date, from the counterparty to each
Blended Customer Contract any needed consent to separate the portion of such
Contract that relates to the goods or services purchased from or supplied to
the Spinco Business under such Blended Customer Contract, it being agreed
that Verizon and the Company shall not be required to grant any consideration
to any counterparty to such a Blended Customer Contract except to the extent
of any consent costs that are included in the amounts for which Verizon has
agreed to be responsible pursuant to Section 7.8(a). The Contract
constituting the separated portion of any Blended Customer Contract that
relates to the Spinco Business as described in the preceding sentence shall
be assumed by and become the responsibility of Spinco (or the Surviving
Corporation to the extent it is separated following the Closing).

(f) With respect to (x) any Contract associated with a Retained Customer
Account, (y) any failure to assign any customer Contract that would have been
assigned in the Contribution as a Spinco Asset but for the failure to obtain
a Verizon Third Party Consent or (z) any failure to assume any Blended
Customer Contract that would have been assumed in part by Spinco pursuant to
Section 7.8(e) but for the failure of the counterparty to consent to such
assumption, then (i) to the extent such Contract involves the provision to
the customer thereunder of ILEC services that are a part of the Spinco
Business, Verizon shall use the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries
succeeding to the Spinco Business to provide such services to such customer
subject to the rights, if any, of such customer under such Contract to
consent thereto and (ii) to the extent such Contract involves the provision
to the customer thereunder of non-ILEC services, Verizon shall continue to
provide such services to such customer in accordance with such Contract. With
respect to ILEC services delivered by the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries in respect of such Contracts, Verizon shall either (A) remit to
the Surviving Corporation amounts received from the applicable customers
in accordance with the applicable Tariff (which the Surviving Corporation
shall have mirrored in accordance with Section 7.6(j)) or, if applicable,
in accordance with Section 7.6(j), in each case including as to payment terms
or (B) make payment to the Surviving Corporation in accordance with the
terms of the applicable Transferred Affiliate Arrangement, including as to
payment terms. With respect to non-ILEC services and ILEC services
delivered by Verizon or its Subsidiaries under such Contracts without the
assistance of the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries, Verizon shall
remit to the Surviving Corporation its net amounts received (after payment of
third party costs and any applicable taxes) in respect of the delivery of
such services to such customers, which payment shall be made by Verizon
promptly after its receipt of such revenues and in any event no later than 45
days thereafter. The provisions of this Section 7.8(f) shall exclusively
govern the circumstances described in the first sentence
hereof, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or the
Distribution Agreement.

 

 

(g) Verizon will use all commercially reasonable efforts to identify to the
Company prior to the Closing any Verizon Guarantees (as defined in the
Distribution Agreement) and any Spinco Guarantees (as defined in the
Distribution Agreement).

(h) Within ninety days of the date hereof, Verizon shall deliver to Company,
to the best of its knowledge after reasonable diligence, a complete and
accurate list, as of the date of delivery of such list, of all Third Party
Software (as defined in the Software License Agreement and the FiOS Software
License Agreement) used in or with the Software (as defined in the Software
License Agreement), the FS Software (as defined in the FiOS Software License
Agreement), and other material Third Party Software. Such list shall include
the name of the vendor/supplier of each such item of Third Party Software,
the type of license (e.g., facilities based, seat, location based, etc.), and
a good faith estimate of the license fees for each such item of Third Party
Software on such list. Verizon shall update the list promptly if any
additional Third Party Software is used as described above at any time after
the delivery of the initial list and prior to the Closing. Prior to the
Closing, Verizon shall cooperate with Company as reasonably requested by
Company in obtaining licenses to such Third Party Software, including by
waiving any provisions in its agreements with the vendors/suppliers of the
Third Party Software that would prohibit such vendors/suppliers from
licensing such software to Company or its Affiliates.

 

 

(i) The Parties covenant to work in good faith to complete Schedule A of the
Software License Agreement within 30 days of the date hereof. Schedule A
shall include (1) a description of the services to be performed, (2) the
Software to which such services shall be applied, and (3) a breakdown of the
Annual Maintenance Fee (as defined in the Software License Agreement) by each
portion of Software. Verizon shall update the list promptly if any
additional Maintenance Services (as defined in the Software License
Agreement) become applicable to the Software or the FS Software,
respectively, as each is used in the Spinco Business and the Spinco FS
Business (as defined in the FiOS Software License Agreement) at any time
after the delivery of the initial list and prior to the Closing.

 

 

7.9 Tax Matters.

 

 

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement,
Verizon and the Company, as to matters germane to the Merger, shall submit to
the IRS a request (the "Ruling Request") for (i) the IRS Ruling, and (ii)
any other ruling in connection with the Contribution, the Distribution or the
Merger that Verizon, in consultation with the Company, deems to
be appropriate. The initial Ruling Request and any supplemental materials
submitted to the IRS relating thereto (each, an "IRS Submission") shall be
prepared by Verizon. Verizon shall provide the Company with a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on each IRS Submission prior to the filing
of such IRS Submission with the IRS as contemplated by Section 10.01(b) of
the Tax Sharing Agreement; provided that Verizon may redact from any IRS
Submission any information ("Redactable Information") that (A) Verizon,
in its good faith judgment, considers to be confidential and not germane to
the Company's or Spinco's obligations under this Agreement or any of the
other Transaction Agreements, and (B) is not a part of any other publicly
available information, including any non-confidential filing.

Table of Contents

 

 

 

 

 

(b) Verizon shall provide the Company with copies of each IRS Submission as
filed with the IRS promptly following the filing thereof; provided that
Verizon may redact any Redactable Information from the IRS Submission.
Each of Verizon, Spinco and the Company agrees to use all commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain the IRS Ruling and the other rulings set forth
in the Ruling Request, including providing such appropriate information and
representations as the IRS shall require in connection with the Ruling
Request and any IRS Submissions. Solely for the avoidance of doubt, nothing
in this Section 7.9(b) shall provide grounds for Verizon, Spinco or the
Company to alter any obligation or limitation imposed upon it under
this Agreement.

 

 

(c) Each of Verizon, Spinco and the Company agrees to use all commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain the Distribution Tax Opinion. The Distribution
Tax Opinion shall be based upon the IRS Ruling, any other rulings issued by
the IRS in connection with the Ruling Request, and customary representations
and covenants, including those contained in certificates of Verizon, Spinco,
the Company and others, reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to
Verizon Tax Counsel (such representations and covenants, the "Distribution
Tax Representations"). Each of Verizon, Spinco and the Company shall deliver
to Verizon Tax Counsel, for purposes of the Distribution Tax Opinion, the
Distribution Tax Representations.

 

 

(d) Verizon and Spinco, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand,
shall cooperate with each other in obtaining, and shall use all their
respective commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, a written opinion of
their respective tax counsel, Company Tax Counsel, in the case of the
Company, and Verizon Tax Counsel, in the case of Verizon and Spinco, in form
and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Company and Verizon,
respectively (each such opinion, a "Merger Tax Opinion"), dated as of the
Effective Time, to the effect that, on the basis of facts, representations
and assumptions set forth in such opinion, the Merger will be treated as a
tax-free reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and
no gain or loss will be recognized by Spinco or its stockholders (except to
the extent of cash in lieu of fractional share interests) in the Merger. Each
of the Company, Verizon and Spinco shall deliver to Company Tax Counsel and
Verizon Tax Counsel for purposes of the Merger Tax Opinions customary

(e) Prior to the Effective Time, each of Verizon, Spinco and the Company
agrees to use all commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Tax-Free
Status of the Transactions.

 

 

7.10 Access to Information. Upon reasonable notice, each of Verizon, Spinco
and the Company shall, subject to applicable Law, afford to each other and to
each other's respective officers, employees, accountants, counsel and other
authorized representatives, reasonable access during normal business hours,
from the date hereof through to the date which is the earlier of
the Effective Time or the date on which this Agreement is terminated pursuant

Subsidiaries' respective businesses and properties as the others or their
respective duly authorized representatives, as the case may be, may
reasonably request, it being understood that in no event will any party be
required to provide access to its accountants' work papers or to customers
proprietary network information (other than as the parties may mutually agree
in a separate written agreement and, with respect to customer proprietary
network information, to the extent permitted by the FCC Rules) and, in the
case of Spinco and Verizon, the foregoing obligations will be limited
to information regarding the Spinco Business.

 

 

7.11 No Solicitation.

 

 

(a) Except as set forth in Sections 7.11(b) through (d) hereof, the Company
agrees that, following the date of this Agreement and prior to the earlier of
the Effective Time or the date on which this Agreement is terminated pursuant
to Section 9.1, neither it nor any Company Subsidiary shall, and that it
shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to cause its and each of the
Company Subsidiary's officers, directors, employees, advisors and agents not
to, directly or indirectly, (i) knowingly solicit, initiate or encourage any
inquiry or proposal that constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead
to a Company Acquisition Proposal, (ii) provide any non-public information or
data to any Person relating to or in connection with a Company Acquisition
Proposal, engage in any discussions or negotiations concerning a Company
Acquisition Proposal, or otherwise knowingly facilitate any effort or attempt
to make or implement a Company Acquisition Proposal, (iii)
approve, recommend, agree to or accept, or propose publicly to approve,
recommend, agree to or accept, any Company Acquisition Proposal, or (iv)
approve, recommend, agree to or accept, or propose to approve, recommend,
agree to or accept, or execute or enter into, any letter of intent, agreement
in principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement or
other similar agreement related to any Company Acquisition Proposal.
Without limiting the foregoing, any violation of the restrictions set forth
in the preceding sentence by any of the Company Subsidiaries or any of the
Company's or the Company Subsidiaries' officers, directors, employees, agents
or representatives (including any investment banker, attorney or
accountant retained by the Company or the Company Subsidiaries) shall be a
breach of this Section 7.11(a) by the Company. The Company agrees that it
will immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing
activities, discussions or negotiations with any Persons conducted heretofore
with respect to any Company Acquisition Proposal (except with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement).

(b) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Company or the
Company's Board of Directors from, prior to the receipt of the Requisite
Approval, engaging in any discussions or negotiations with, or providing any
non-public information to, any Person, if and only to the extent that (i) the
Company receives from such Person a bona fide Company Superior Proposal or a
Company Acquisition Proposal that the Company's Board of Directors determines
in good faith (after consultation with a financial advisor of nationally
recognized reputation) would reasonably be expected to lead to a Company
Superior Proposal and in either case that was not solicited after the date of
this Agreement, (ii) the Company's Board of Directors determines in good
faith (after consultation with its legal advisors) that its failure to do so
would reasonably be expected to result in a breach of the Board of Directors'
fiduciary duties under applicable Law, (iii) prior to providing any
information or data to any Person in connection with a proposal by any such
Person, such information has been provided to Verizon (or is provided to
Verizon at the same time it is provided to such Person, to the extent
not previously provided or made available to Verizon) and (iv) prior
to providing any non-public information or data to any Person or entering
into discussions or negotiations with any Person, the Company's Board of
Directors notifies Verizon promptly of any such inquiry, proposal or offer
received by, any such information requested from, or any such discussions or
negotiations sought to be initiated or continued with, the Company, any
Company Subsidiary or any of their officers, directors, employees, advisors
and agents after the date of this Agreement indicating, in connection with
such notice, the material terms and conditions of the Company Acquisition
Proposal and the identity of the Person making such Company Acquisition
Proposal. The Company agrees that it shall keep Verizon reasonably informed,
on a reasonably prompt basis (and in any event within 24 hours following
receipt of any Company Acquisition Proposal or any changes thereto), of the
status and material terms of any such proposals or offers, any changes
thereto, and the status of any such discussions or negotiations and will
notify Verizon promptly of any determination by the Company's Board of
Directors that a Company Superior Proposal has been made. For purposes of
this Agreement, a "Company Superior Proposal" means any proposal or offer
made by a third party to acquire, directly or indirectly, by merger,
consolidation or otherwise, for consideration consisting of cash and/or
securities, at least a majority of the shares of the Company Common Stock
then outstanding or all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries and otherwise on terms which the Board of Directors
of the Company (after consultation with its legal and financial advisors)
determines in its good faith judgment to be more favorable to the Company's
stockholders than the Merger (taking into account all of the terms and
conditions of such proposal and of this Agreement as well as any
other factors deemed relevant by the Board of Directors of the Company) and
reasonably capable of being consummated on the terms so proposed, taking into
account all financial, regulatory, legal and other aspects of such proposal.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, but subject to
compliance with this Section 7.11(c), prior to the receipt of the Requisite
Approval, the Board of Directors of the Company may, if it concludes in good
faith (after consultation with its legal advisors) that failure to do so
would reasonably be expected (taking into account any new or revised
proposals made by Verizon) to result in a breach of its fiduciary duties
under applicable Law, effect a Change of Board Recommendation, but only if:

 

 

(i) the Company shall have provided prior written notice to Verizon of its
intention to take any such action at least five Business Days in advance of
taking such action (the "Notice Period"), which notice shall specify (A) if
such Change of Board Recommendation is not being made as a result of a
Company Superior Proposal, the Board of Directors' reasons for taking such
action, and (B) if such Change of Board Recommendation is being made as a
result of a Company Superior Proposal, or involves the recommendation of a
Company Superior Proposal, the material terms and conditions of any such
Company Superior Proposal (including the identity of the party making such
Company Superior Proposal); and

 

 

(ii) prior to effecting such Change of Board Recommendation or recommending
such Company Superior Proposal the Company shall provide Verizon the
opportunity to submit an amended written proposal or to make a new written
proposal to the Board of Directors of the Company during the Notice Period.

 

 

In the event of any material revisions to the Company Superior Proposal, the
Company shall be required to deliver a new written notice to Verizon and to
comply with the requirements of this Section 7.11(c) with respect to such new
written notice except that the Notice Period shall be reduced to two
Business Days.

(d) Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company from taking and
disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 and Rule
14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making any disclosure to
the Company stockholders if, in the good faith judgment of the Board of
Directors of the Company (after consultation with its legal advisors), it is
required to do so in order to comply with its fiduciary duties to the
Company's stockholders under applicable Law; provided, however, that
any disclosure other than a "stop, look and listen" or similar communication
of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act, unless
accompanied by an express rejection of any applicable Company Acquisition
Proposal or an express reaffirmation of the Company Board Recommendation,
shall be deemed to be a Change of Board Recommendation subject to Section
7.11.

 

 

7.12 Director and Officer Matters.

 

 

(a) From and after the date hereof, the Company, the Surviving Corporation
and their respective Subsidiaries shall provide such cooperation and
assistance as Verizon may reasonably request to enable, if Verizon so
chooses, Verizon or a Subsidiary thereof to maintain following the Closing,
at Verizon's expense, directors' and officers' liability insurance policies
and fiduciary liability insurance policies covering each person who is, or
has been at any time prior to the Effective Time, an officer or director of
Verizon or a Contributing Company and each person who served at the request
of a Contributing Company as a director, officer, trustee or fiduciary of
another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, pension or other
employee benefit plan or enterprise, including any person serving in such
capacity with respect to Spinco or a Spinco Subsidiary (the
"Identified Persons").

 

 

(b) At the Closing, the Surviving Corporation will, on behalf of itself,
its Subsidiaries and their respective successors and assigns and for all
parties claiming by, through or under them (the "Surviving
Corporation Releasors"), execute and deliver to each Identified Person a
release irrevocably releasing, remising and forever discharging such
Identified Person, and its estates and heirs, of and from any and all claims,
whether presently known or unknown, which any Surviving Corporation Releasor
has or may have of any kind arising out of or pertaining to acts or
omissions, or alleged acts or omissions, by such Identified Person in the
capacities specified in Section 7.12(a) prior to the Effective Time;
provided, however, that such release shall also include a release, executed
by such Identified Person, on behalf of itself and its estates and heirs and
for all parties claiming by, through or under them (the "Identified
Persons Releasors"), irrevocably releasing, remising and forever discharging
the Surviving Corporation, its Subsidiaries and their respective successors
and assigns, of and from any and all claims, whether presently known or
unknown, which any Identified Persons Releasor has or may have of any kind.

investigation ("Action") arising out of or pertaining to acts or omissions,
or alleged acts or omissions, by the Identified Persons in the capacities
specified in Section 7.12(a) prior to the Closing, from and after the
Effective Time the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall provide
reasonable cooperation, at Verizon's expense, in defense of any such Action.

 

 

7.13 Public Announcements. Verizon and the Company shall consult with each
other and shall mutually agree upon any press release or public announcement
relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Neither of them
shall issue any such press release or make any such public announcement or
statement (including through any advertising, press conference, media
appearance or other forum) prior to such consultation and agreement, except
as may be required by applicable Law or by obligations pursuant to any
listing agreement with any national securities exchange or automated inter-
dealer quotation system, in which case the party proposing to issue such
press release or make such public announcement shall use all commercially
reasonable efforts to consult in good faith with the other party before
issuing any such press release or making any such public announcement.

 

 

7.14 Notification.

 

 

(a) Verizon shall give notice to the Company, and the Company shall give
notice to Verizon, of any occurrence or non-occurrence of any fact or event
that would reasonably be expected to cause the failure of Verizon or its
Affiliates or the Company or its Affiliates, as the case may be, to comply
with or satisfy, in any material respect, any closing condition set forth in
Article VIII.

 

 

(b) Each of the parties hereto shall keep the others informed on a timely
basis as to (i) the status of the transactions contemplated by the
Transaction Agreements and the obtaining of all necessary and appropriate
exemptions, rulings, consents, authorizations and waivers related thereto,
including the Telecommunications Regulatory Consents and (ii) the status of
any other material regulatory proceeding pending as of the date hereof or
arising prior to the Effective Time, affecting the Spinco Business or the
business of the Company, as applicable.

 

 

7.15 Control of Other Party's Business. Nothing contained in this Agreement
shall give Verizon or Spinco, directly or indirectly, the right to control or
direct the Company's operations prior to the Effective Time. Nothing
contained in this Agreement shall give the Company, directly or indirectly,
the right to control or direct the operations of the Spinco Business prior to
the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, Verizon and the Company

7.16 Financial Statements and Related Information.

 

 

(a) Beginning with the fiscal quarter ending on March 31, 2009, Verizon will
deliver to the Company, (i) with respect to each fiscal quarter other than
the last fiscal quarter of a fiscal year, promptly upon their being prepared
(and in any event no later than 40 days after the end of such fiscal
quarter), unaudited combined Statements of Selected Assets, Selected
Liabilities and Parent Funding of the local exchange businesses and related
landline activities of Verizon in the Territory (including Internet access
and certain long distance services provided to customers in those states),
together with the related unaudited combined statements of income, cash flows
and parent funding for the portion of the fiscal year then ended and (ii)
with respect to the last fiscal quarter of a fiscal year, promptly upon their
being prepared (and in any event no later than 75 days after the end of such
fiscal quarter), audited combined Statements of Selected Assets, Selected
Liabilities and Parent Funding of the local exchange businesses and related
landline activities of Verizon in the Territory (including Internet access
and certain long distance services provided to customers in those states),
together with the related audited combined statements of income, cash flows
and parent funding for such fiscal year. Such statements shall be prepared
from the books and records of Verizon and the Contributing Companies (to the
extent relating to the Spinco Business) in accordance with GAAP applied on a
consistent basis throughout the periods involved using the same accounting
principles, practices, methodologies and policies used in preparing the
Spinco Financial Statements (except as may otherwise be required under GAAP),
shall satisfy the requirements of Regulation S-X under the Exchange Act and
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position and
operating results and changes in cash flows and changes in parent funding of
the Spinco Business as of the dates and for the periods indicated therein.

 

 

7.17 Directors of the Surviving Corporation. The Company, Verizon and Spinco
shall take all action reasonably necessary to cause the Board of Directors of
the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time to consist of twelve
members, (i) three of whom shall be designated by Verizon and (ii) nine of
whom shall be designated by the Company, which directors shall be the Board
of Directors of the Surviving Corporation. One of the Company's designees
shall serve as chairman of the board. Within six months following the date of
this Agreement, Verizon shall give the Company written notice setting forth
its designees to the Surviving Corporation's Board of Directors and such
information with respect to each of its designees as is required to be
disclosed in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or would be required to be
disclosed in a proxy statement for an annual meeting. Promptly after Verizon
gives such notice to the Company, and in any event within 20 days thereafter,
the Company shall notify Verizon of its designees to the
Surviving Corporation's Board of Directors. Without limiting the foregoing
and prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions necessary
to obtain the resignations of all members of its Board of Directors who will
not be directors of the Surviving Corporation and for the Board of Directors
of the Company to fill such vacancies with the new directors contemplated by
this Section 7.17. Verizon's director nominees under this Section 7.17 will
(x) not be employees of Verizon, its Affiliates or Cellco Partnership or any
of its Subsidiaries and (y) will satisfy the requirements for director
independence under the rules and regulations of the SEC and the NYSE.

7.18 Financing.

 

 

(a) The parties acknowledge that it is contemplated that the Special Payment
shall be financed through the incurrence of one or more term loan bank
borrowings and/or capital markets issuances by Spinco prior to or
substantially contemporaneous with the Distribution (collectively, the
"Special Payment Financing") and that in connection with the Distribution
Spinco may issue to Verizon or a Verizon Subsidiary Spinco Securities. From
time to time following the date hereof, Verizon and the Company shall meet to
discuss strategy and timing for seeking proposals from reputable lenders
and/or underwriters to provide, arrange and/or underwrite the Special
Payment Financing, which financing may be negotiated, drawn down and/or
issued in one or more tranches.

 

 

(b) Verizon and the Company shall jointly solicit proposals from reputable
financing sources no later than nine months after the date hereof (and, at
such time, Verizon shall provide the Company with its then-current estimate
of its Distribution Date tax basis in Spinco) and the Company shall select
from among the proposals received one or more which the Company reasonably
determines to be the most favorable. Promptly thereafter, the Company and
Verizon shall commence negotiations with the financing sources thereunder.
The Company shall take the lead in such negotiations and shall keep Verizon
informed of all material developments and provide Verizon with an opportunity
to participate in all negotiations. The Company and Verizon shall use all
commercially reasonable efforts to finalize all documentation with respect to
the Special Payment Financing. The Company agrees to discuss and consider
from time to time, at the request of Verizon, the possibility of causing
Spinco to incur a portion of the Special Payment Financing in advance of the
Closing, it being understood that the Company shall be under no obligation to
do so. Subject to Section 7.18(e) and the following proviso, the Company and
Verizon shall be required to accept and execute documentation relating to
(and cause Spinco to execute documentation relating to) the Special Payment
Financing and, if applicable, the Spinco Securities, provided that if at the
time proposed for acceptance and execution of documentation relating to
the Special Payment Financing and, if applicable, the Spinco Securities,
the negotiated terms thereof do not satisfy the requirements of clauses (i)
or (ii) of Section 7.18(e), and if as of such time, the parties
would otherwise be obligated to close the transactions contemplated hereby
due to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Article VIII (other
than those that would be satisfied by action at the Closing and other than
the condition in Section 8.2(d)), the Company shall promptly so notify
Verizon and either the Company or Verizon may elect to defer the Closing
(subject to the satisfaction of such closing conditions on such deferral
date) until the final Business Day of the next calendar month (a "Financial
Market Deferral"). If elected, the parties shall cooperate in seeking to
improve the proposed terms of the Special Payment Financing and,
if applicable, the Spinco Securities during such deferral period.
A Financial Market Deferral may be elected on one or more occasions but no
more than four times in total by the Company and Verizon, and,
notwithstanding the foregoing, if elected for a fourth time, the period of
such deferral shall last until the final Business Day of the second calendar
month following the date on which such deferral is elected.

(c) If Verizon notifies the Company that Spinco Securities are to be issued,
the Company shall take the lead in the negotiation of the terms and
conditions thereof with the financial institutions selected by Verizon to be
party to any Debt Exchange elected to be consummated by Verizon and shall
keep Verizon informed of all material developments and provide Verizon with
an opportunity to participate in all negotiations relating to the terms of
such Spinco Securities. In such event, the Company shall, in consultation
with Verizon, determine the final form of the Spinco Securities and
related agreements (including registration rights arrangements and indenture)
consistent with the terms set forth in Exhibit G of the Distribution
Agreement; provided that the covenants and economic terms thereof would
reasonably be expected to result in the Spinco Securities being exchanged for
Verizon obligations in an equal principal amount. If Verizon elects to
consummate the Debt Exchange, it shall have the sole right to structure the
arrangements relating thereto with underwriters, arrangers and other third
parties relating to the Debt Exchange; provided that Verizon shall keep the
Company reasonably informed regarding such arrangements.

 

 

(d) Notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 7.18(b) and 7.18(c) above, in
the event that (i) all of the conditions set forth in Article VIII (other
than those that would be satisfied by action at the Closing and other than
the condition in Section 8.2(d)) have been satisfied and (ii) the Company (A)
is not actively conducting negotiations with financing sources with respect
to the Special Payment Financing and, if applicable, the Spinco Securities,
and (B) fails to commence such negotiations promptly following notice
from Verizon that Verizon reasonably believes the Company is not actively
conducting such negotiations, then Verizon shall be entitled to assume the
lead role in conducting such negotiations (and shall keep the Company
informed of all material developments with respect thereto) until the Company
so acts.

(e) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 7.18(b) and Section 7.18(c):

 

 

(i) The Company shall not be obligated to accept or execute documentation
relating to the Special Payment Financing or, if applicable, the Spinco
Securities if (w) either (A) the weighted average life of the aggregate of
such financing and securities, together with the Distribution Date Spinco
Indebtedness, is less than five years or (B) any of the Special Payment
Financing or the Spinco Securities would have a final maturity of earlier
than January 1, 2014, other than any bridge financing with a maturity of at
least 364 days in an aggregate amount not in excess of $600 million, (x) such
financing or securities or the Distribution Date Spinco Indebtedness would be
secured by any assets of any operating company, (y) the terms or provisions
of such financing or securities or the Distribution Date Spinco Indebtedness
would cause their incurrence or assumption by the Company in or as a result
of the Merger to be prohibited by or cause (with or without notice or the
lapse of time) a default under the Company's existing credit agreements or
indentures as in effect on the date hereof, or (z) both (I) the proposed
covenants and other terms and conditions in such documentation (excluding (A)
any terms of the Spinco Securities set forth in Exhibit G of the Distribution
Agreement and (B) the rate, yield or tenor thereof) are not, in the
aggregate, substantially in accordance with then prevailing market terms for
similarly sized term loan bank borrowings and/or capital market issuances by
companies of a size and with credit ratings similar to the Surviving
Corporation and (II) the effect of such covenants and other terms and
conditions that are not in accordance with the prevailing market terms
(excluding (A) any terms of the Spinco Securities set forth in Exhibit G of
the Distribution Agreement and (B) the rate, yield or tenor thereof) would,
in the aggregate, be materially adverse to the Surviving Corporation.

 

 

(ii) The Company shall not be obligated to accept or execute documentation
relating to the Special Payment Financing or the Spinco Securities if as a
result thereof the weighted average annual cash interest rate (including
annual accretion of original issue discount with respect to Indebtedness
issued with a material amount of original issue discount) payable on the
aggregate of the Special Payment Financing, the Spinco Securities and the
Distribution Date Spinco Indebtedness (the "Coverage Costs") would exceed
9.5%, unless the Company reasonably determines in good faith that such
Coverage Costs would not be unduly burdensome.

 

 

(f) Each of Verizon, Spinco and the Company shall cooperate in connection
with the preparation of all documents and the making of all filings required
in connection with the Special Payment Financing, the Spinco Securities and
the Debt Exchange (if Verizon elects to consummate the Debt Exchange) and
shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all other things necessary,
proper or advisable to consummate the Special Payment Financing, the issuance
of the Spinco Securities and the Debt Exchange (if Verizon elects to
consummate the Debt Exchange) and the other transactions contemplated in
connection therewith. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each
of Verizon, Spinco and the Company shall use all commercially reasonable
efforts to cause their respective employees, accountants, counsel and other
representatives to cooperate with each other in (i) participating in
meetings, drafting sessions, due diligence sessions, management
presentation sessions, "road shows" and sessions with rating agencies in
connection with the syndication or marketing of the Special Payment
Financing, the Spinco Securities and the Debt Exchange (if Verizon elects to
consummate the Debt Exchange), (ii) preparing offering memoranda, private
placement memoranda, prospectuses and similar documents deemed reasonably
necessary by Verizon, Spinco or the Company, to be used in connection with
consummating the Special Payment Financing, the issuance of the Spinco
Securities and the Debt Exchange (if Verizon elects to consummate the Debt
Exchange), (iii) executing and delivering all documents and instruments
deemed reasonably necessary by Verizon, Spinco or the Company to consummate
the Special Payment Financing, the issuance of the Spinco Securities and the
Debt Exchange (if Verizon elects to consummate the Debt Exchange), including
any underwriting or placement agreements, pledge and security documents,
other definitive financing documents, including any intercreditor or
indemnity agreements, or other requested certificates or documents as may be
reasonably requested in connection with the Special Payment Financing, the
Spinco Securities or the Debt Exchange (if Verizon elects to consummate the
Debt Exchange), provided, however, that (A) no such agreements or documents
shall impose any monetary obligation or liability on Spinco or the Company
prior to the Effective Time and (B) Verizon shall not be obligated to incur
any obligations in connection with the Special Payment Financing (other than
the obligation to pay Spinco Debt Expenses as provided in the Distribution
Agreement and the non-monetary cooperation obligations set forth above in
this Section 7.18(f)), (iv) disclosing the terms and conditions of the
Special Payment Financing, the Spinco Securities and the Debt Exchange (if
Verizon elects to consummate the Debt Exchange), as reasonably appropriate,
in the Registration Statements, and (v) taking all other actions reasonably
necessary in connection with the Special Payment Financing, including any
such actions required to permit the assumption by the Surviving Corporation
of the debt that is part of the Special Payment Financing and the Spinco
Securities at the Effective Time.

(g) Not later than 60 days prior to the reasonably anticipated Closing Date,
Verizon shall deliver to the Company a certificate setting forth the
anticipated amount of the Special Payment, along with Verizon's then-current
estimates of (i) Distribution Date Spinco Indebtedness and (ii) its tax basis
in Spinco as of the Distribution Date. Verizon shall have the right
to update such certificate from time to time in advance of the Closing (but
no later than 15 days prior to the Closing) in light of any updated
information of Verizon regarding its tax basis in Spinco and the amount of
the Distribution Date Spinco Indebtedness.

7.19 Accountants.

 

 

(a) In connection with the information regarding the Spinco Business or
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement provided by Spinco
specifically for inclusion in, or incorporation by reference into, the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus and the Registration Statements, Verizon shall use all
commercially reasonable efforts to cause to be delivered to the Company
letters of Ernst and Young LLP, dated the date on which each of the
Registration Statements shall become effective, the date on which the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus or any Registration Statement is mailed to the Company's
stockholders and the Closing Date, and addressed to the Company, in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to the Company and customary in scope and
substance for letters delivered by independent public accountants in
connection with registration statements similar to the Registration
Statements. In the event that Spinco is treated as the acquiring entity for
accounting purposes pursuant to GAAP, then Verizon shall use all commercially
reasonable efforts to cause any such letter to include such negative
assurance statements regarding the pro forma financial information included
in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and the Registration Statements as are
customary in scope and substance for letters delivered by independent public
accountants in connection with registration statements similar to the
Registration Statements.

 

 

(b) The Company shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to cause KPMG
LLP, the independent auditors of the Company, to provide any unqualified
opinions, consents or customary comfort letters with respect to the financial
statements of the Company needed in connection with the Special Payment
Financing, the Registration Statements and/or the Debt Exchange (if Verizon
elects to consummate the Debt Exchange). The Company agrees to allow
Verizon's accounting representatives the opportunity to review any such
financial statements required in connection therewith and to allow such
representatives reasonable access to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
and supporting documentation with respect to the preparation of such
financial statements; provided that such access shall not include any right
to review the working papers of the independent auditors of the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries. The Company shall use all commercially
reasonable efforts to cause KPMG LLP to participate in the preparation of any
pro forma financial statements necessary or desirable for inclusion in, or
incorporation by reference into, the Registration Statements and for use in
connection with the Special Payment Financing and/or the Debt Exchange (if
Verizon elects to consummate the Debt Exchange).

customary in scope and substance for letters delivered by independent public
accountants in connection with registration statements similar to the
Registration Statements. In the event that the Company is treated as the
acquiring entity for accounting purposes pursuant to GAAP, then the Company
shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to cause any such letter to
include such negative assurance statements regarding the pro forma financial
information included in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and the Registration
Statements as are customary in scope and substance for letters delivered by
independent public accountants in connection with registration statements
similar to the Registration Statements.

 

 

(d) Verizon shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to cause Ernst and
Young LLP, the independent auditors of Spinco, to provide any unqualified
opinions, consents or customary comfort letters with respect to the financial
statements regarding the Spinco Business needed in connection with the
Special Payment Financing, the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, the Registration
Statements and/or the Debt Exchange (if Verizon elects to consummate the
Debt Exchange). Verizon agrees to allow the Company's
accounting representatives the opportunity to review any such financial
statements required in connection therewith and to allow such representatives
reasonable access to records of the Contributing Companies and supporting
documentation with respect to the preparation of such financial statements;
provided, however, that such access shall not include any right to review the
working papers of the independent auditors of Verizon and its Subsidiaries.
Verizon shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to cause Ernst and Young
LLP to participate in the preparation of any pro forma financial statements
necessary or desirable for inclusion in, or incorporation by reference into,
the Registration Statements and for use in connection with the Special
Payment Financing and/or the Debt Exchange (if Verizon elects to consummate
the Debt Exchange).

 

 

7.20 Disclosure Controls. Each of Verizon and the Company shall use
all commercially reasonable efforts to enable the Company to implement such
programs and take such steps as are reasonably necessary to (i) develop
a system of internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in
Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) intended to ensure that
after the Effective Time material information relating to the Surviving
Corporation is timely made known to the management of the Surviving
Corporation by others within those entities, (ii) cooperate reasonably with
each other in preparing for the transition and integration of the financial
reporting systems of Spinco and the Spinco Subsidiaries with the Company's
financial reporting systems following the Effective Time and (iii)
otherwise enable the Surviving Corporation to maintain compliance with the
provisions of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

and at least 30 days prior to the date that any party reasonably expects all
of the required regulatory approvals to have been obtained, the Company shall
make application to the NYSE for the listing of the shares of Company Common
Stock to be issued pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and use all commercially reasonable efforts to cause such shares to
be Approved for Listing.

 

 

7.22 Ancillary Agreements.

 

 

(a) At the Company's request, which shall be made, if at all, prior to March
31, 2010, Verizon and the Company shall cause their respective Affiliates to
enter into an agreement with respect to Video Transport Service incorporating
the terms set forth on the term sheet attached as Exhibit D and such other
terms as may be reasonably related thereto and agreed by their respective
Affiliates (the "Video Transport Service Agreement").

 

 

(b) Verizon and the Company shall cause their respective Affiliates to enter
into an agreement with respect to Back Office Support Services incorporating
the terms set forth on the term sheet attached as Exhibit E and such other
terms as may reasonably related thereto and agreed by their respective
Affiliates (the "Back Office Support Services Agreement").

 

 

7.23 Directories Agreements. Prior to the Merger, Spinco shall offer
to Directories Media Inc. ("Directories") to enter into the proposed
Publishing Agreement, the Non-Competition Agreement and the Branding
Agreement, between Directories and Spinco (or Subsidiaries of Spinco, as
applicable), that are in the form attached hereto as Exhibits F, G and H (the
"Directories Agreements"); provided, however, that Spinco shall not have any
obligation to enter into (or offer to enter into) any such agreement to the
extent the terms of such agreement are not binding upon the Spinco Business
as of immediately prior to the Effective Time. If such agreements are
required but are not entered into prior to the Merger, the Surviving
Corporation (or Subsidiaries of the Surviving Corporation, as applicable)
will offer to enter into such agreements with Directories within 90 days
following the Merger to the extent Directories notifies the
Surviving Corporation within such time period that it wishes to enter into

7.24 Realignment.

 

 

(a) Following the date hereof, Verizon shall undertake to segregate the
operation of the Spinco Business in the Territory (other than West Virginia)
from the Verizon Business (including the completion of the actions
contemplated by Section 7.24(c) and the identification, testing and
validation of personnel, processes and systems to be working properly) such
that the representation set forth in Section 5.17 shall be accurate as of the
Closing in accordance with the standards set forth in Section 8.3(b) (the
"Realignment"). Verizon shall keep the Company reasonably updated from time
to time with respect to the Realignment and shall discuss with the Company
its plans for implementing the various aspects of the Realignment on an
ongoing basis once Verizon has developed its initial plan for effecting the
Realignment. If in connection with the Realignment the Company wishes to
remove or omit particular functions or services that are used or held for use
in the conduct of the Spinco Business or to replace certain third party
vendors of the Spinco business with other third party vendors, the Company
will promptly notify Verizon in writing to this effect. Verizon will have the
right to disapprove such proposed omissions or replacements to the extent
Verizon determines that such omissions or replacements may materially delay
or increase the expense of completing the Realignment. No later than 60 days
prior to the reasonably anticipated Closing Date, Verizon shall provide
written notice to the Company stating that Verizon and its Subsidiaries have
completed the Realignment as of the date of such notice. The Company shall be
granted reasonable rights of access from time to time prior to the Closing in
accordance with Section 7.10 to validate and confirm the completion of the
Realignment (including the functioning of principal operating systems) in
accordance with the first sentence of this Section 7.24.

 

 

(b) In connection with the Realignment, Verizon shall not take any action
that would result in any material increase in the number of employees
performing each material function of the Spinco Business above the number of
such employees performing such function on behalf of the Spinco Business on
the date hereof.

 

 

(c) Prior to March 31, 2010, Verizon shall create a separate instance in
the Fort Wayne, Indiana data center (the "Fort Wayne Data Center") of
Verizon proprietary software systems that will enable Spinco (and following
the Merger, the Surviving Corporation) in all states in the Territory (other
than West Virginia) to provide functionality substantially similar to, but no
less favorable to the Spinco Business than, that which the Spinco Business
received from Verizon and its Affiliates as of the date of this Agreement. As
of the Closing Date, the Fort Wayne Data Center (i) shall be owned by the
Surviving Corporation or an Affiliate thereof and (ii) shall have on site a
majority of the hardware reasonably required to provide functionality to the
Spinco Business in accordance with the foregoing (and the balance of such
hardware, if not held at the Fort Wayne Data Center, shall be available on a
firewall basis from Verizon or a Verizon Subsidiary for up to one year
following the Closing to allow for Verizon to transfer such hardware to the
Fort Wayne Data Center within one year following the Closing).

7.25 California Disclosure. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
the parties acknowledge that the Verizon Disclosure Letter and the Spinco
Disclosure Letter and the Disclosure Letter under the Distribution Agreement
contain no information regarding the portion of the Spinco Business conducted
in California and that such failure shall not constitute a breach of any
representation or warranty herein or any breach of the
Distribution Agreement. Verizon and Spinco shall have the right to update
such Disclosure Letters within 45 days of the date hereof to incorporate
any applicable disclosure relating to portion of the Spinco Business
conducted in California, whereupon such disclosure will be deemed to have
been made as of the date hereof; provided, however, that this Section 7.25
and any disclosure made hereunder shall have no effect with respect to the
representations and warranties made in Section 5.5 or Section 5.17.

 

 

7.26 Joint Defense Agreement. Within 30 days following the date
hereof, Verizon and the Company shall negotiate in good faith the terms of,

interest arising from the transactions contemplated by the Transaction
Agreements (the "Joint Defense Agreement").

such date (i) all Closing conditions (ignoring for this purpose Section
8.2(d)) other than the conditions in Section 8.1(c) or 8.1(d), are satisfied
or capable of being satisfied as of such date (assuming for such purpose that
such date were the Closing Date), or (ii) a Financial Market Deferral is then

Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.1(b) shall not be available to any party
whose failure to perform any of its obligations under this Agreement required
to be performed by it at or prior to such date has been a substantial cause
of, or substantially contributed to, the failure of the Merger to have become
effective on or before such date;

 

 

(c) by any party hereto if (i) a statute, rule, regulation or executive
order shall have been enacted, entered or promulgated prohibiting the
consummation of the Merger or (ii) an Order shall have been entered that
either (A) would result in a failure of a condition set forth in Section
8.1(c) or (B) permanently restrains, enjoins or otherwise prohibits the
consummation of the Merger, and in each case such Order shall have become

to perform in any material respect any of its representations,
warranties, covenants or other agreements contained in this Agreement, which

adjournment, continuation or postponement thereof), the Requisite Approval is
not obtained; provided, however, that the right to terminate this Agreement
under this Section 9.1(f) shall not be available to the Company where such
failure to obtain the Requisite Approval shall have been caused by the action
or failure to act of the Company and such action or failure to act
constitutes a material breach by the Company of this Agreement;

 

 

(g) by Verizon and Spinco, if (i) the Board of Directors of the Company (or
any committee thereof) shall have effected a Change of Board Recommendation
or resolved to effect a Change of Board Recommentation or (ii) the

days after the date on which the SEC shall clear (whether orally or in
writing) the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and, if required by the SEC as a

any party pursuant to Section 9.1(f) (and a Company Acquisition Proposal
shall have been publicly announced prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting)
and (B) within twelve months after the termination of this Agreement, any
Company Acquisition shall have been consummated or any definitive agreement
with respect to any Company Acquisition Proposal (other than, in each case,

exchange, business combination, recapitalization or other similar transaction
or series of related transactions involving the Company or any of its
Significant Subsidiaries following which the stockholders of the Company or

(a) If the Closing occurs, the Surviving Corporation shall indemnify, defend
and hold harmless (i) the Verizon Indemnitees from and against all Losses
arising out of or due to the failure of any member of the Spinco Group (A) to
timely pay or satisfy any Spinco Liabilities, or (B) to perform any of its
obligations under this Agreement or the Distribution Agreement and
(ii) Verizon and each Person, if any, who controls, within the meaning
of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act (any
such Person being hereinafter referred to as a "Controlling Person"), Verizon
from and against, and pay or reimburse each of the foregoing for, all Losses,
arising out of or resulting from, directly or indirectly, or in connection
with, any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact
contained in or incorporated by reference into either of the
Registration Statements or the Proxy Statement/Prospectus (or any amendment
or supplement thereto) or any omission or alleged omission to state therein a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading; provided, however, that the Surviving Corporation shall not
be responsible for information provided by Verizon (or its Affiliates) as to
itself and its Subsidiaries, including Spinco, specifically for inclusion in,
or incorporation by reference into, any such Proxy Statement/Prospectus or
Registration Statement.

 

 

(b) If the Closing occurs, Verizon shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless
(i) the Surviving Corporation Indemnitees from and against all Losses arising
out of or due to (x) the failure of any member of the Verizon Group (A) to
timely pay or satisfy any Verizon Liabilities, or (B) to perform any of its
obligations under this Agreement or the Distribution Agreement or (y) the
actual amount of Distribution Date Spinco Indebtedness exceeding the amount
of Distribution Date Spinco Indebtedness set forth by Verizon and Spinco in
the Closing Statement, and (ii) the Surviving Corporation and each
Controlling Person of the Surviving Corporation from and against, and pay or
reimburse each of the foregoing for, all Losses arising out of or resulting
from, directly or indirectly, or in connection with, any untrue statement or
alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in or incorporated by
reference into either of the Registration Statements or the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or any omission
or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, but only with
respect to information provided by Verizon (or its Affiliates) as to itself
and its Subsidiaries, including Spinco, specifically for inclusion in, or
incorporation by reference into, any such Proxy Statement/Prospectus or
Registration Statement.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein,
indemnification or other claims relating to any Transaction Agreement (other
than the Distribution Agreement) or relating to any ongoing commercial
agreement between any member of the Verizon Group and any member of the
Spinco Group shall be governed by the terms of such agreement and not by this
Article X (except to the extend expressly so stated in such Transaction
Agreement), and indemnification for all matters relating to Taxes shall be
governed by terms, provisions and procedures of the Tax Sharing Agreement and
not this Article X.

 

 

10.3 Limitation on Claims for Indemnifiable Losses. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained herein:

 

 

(a) No claim may be asserted by any Surviving Corporation Indemnitee under
this Article X arising from any failure to transfer any Spinco Asset to
Spinco unless such claim is asserted, if at all, within 18 months from the
Closing Date.

 

 

(b) No Indemnitor shall be liable to or obligated to indemnify any Indemnitee
hereunder for any consequential, special, punitive or exemplary damages
including, but not limited to, damages arising from loss or interruption of
business, profits, business opportunities or goodwill, or any cost or expense
related thereto, except to the extent such damages are payable to or have
been recovered by a third person and are the subject of a Third Party Claim
for which indemnification is available under the express terms of
this Article X.

 

 

(c) Verizon and the Company shall cooperate with each other with respect to
resolving any claim or liability with respect to which one party is obligated
to indemnify the other party (or its Affiliates) hereunder, including by
using all commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate the Losses and resolve
any such claim or liability prior to initiating litigation.

 

 

10.4 Defense of Claims.

Table of Contents

 

 

 

 

 

(a) Third Party Claims. If any Indemnitee receives notice of the assertion
of any claim or of the commencement of any action or proceeding by any entity
that is not either a Surviving Corporation Indemnitee or a Verizon Indemnitee
(each, a "Third Party Claim") against such Indemnitee, with respect to which
an Indemnitor is obligated to provide indemnification under this Agreement,
the Indemnitee will give such Indemnitor prompt written notice thereof, but
in any event not later than ten calendar days after receipt of notice of such
Third Party Claim; provided, however, that the failure of an Indemnitee to
notify the Indemnitor within the time period set forth herein shall only
relieve the Indemnitor from its obligation to indemnify to the extent that
the Indemnitor is materially prejudiced by such failure or delay (whether as
a result of the forfeiture of substantive rights or defenses or otherwise).
Upon receipt of notification of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnitor shall be
entitled, upon written notice to the Indemnitee, to assume the investigation
and defense thereof at such Indemnitor's expense with counsel reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnitee; provided, however, that the Indemnitor shall
not have the right to assume the defense of any Third Party Claim in the
event such Third Party Claim is primarily for injunctive relief or criminal
penalty of the Indemnitee, in which case the reasonable fees and expenses of
counsel to the Indemnitee in connection with such Third Party Claim shall be
considered "Losses" for purposes of this Agreement. Whether or not the
Indemnitor elects to assume the investigation and defense of any Third Party
Claim, the Indemnitee shall have the right to employ separate counsel and to
participate in the investigation and defense thereof; provided, however, that
the Indemnitee shall pay the fees and disbursements of such separate counsel
unless (1) the employment of such separate counsel has been specifically
authorized in writing by the Indemnitor; (2) the Indemnitor has failed to
assume the defense of such Third Party Claim within 20 calendar days after
receipt of notice thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such
Indemnitee; or (3) the named parties to the proceeding in which such Third
Party Claim has been asserted include both the Indemnitor and such Indemnitee
and, in the reasonable judgment of counsel to such Indemnitee, there exists
one or more good faith defenses that may be available to the Indemnitee that
are in conflict with those available to the Indemnitor or that the Indemnitor
and Indemnitee have actual material conflicting interests with respect to
such Third Party Claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnitor shall
not be liable for the fees and disbursements of more than one counsel for
all Indemnitees in connection with any one proceeding or any similar or
related proceedings arising from the same general allegations
or circumstances. Without the prior written consent of an Indemnitee, which
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, the
Indemnitor will not enter into any settlement of or consent to the entry of
judgment in connection with any Third Party Claim that (i) would lead
to liability or create any financial or other obligation on the part of
the Indemnitee, (ii) does not contain, as an unconditional term thereof, the
release of the Indemnitee from all liability in respect of such Third Party
Claim or such Third Party Claim is not dismissed against the Indemnitee with
prejudice and without the imposition of any financial or other obligation on
the Indemnitee or (iii) admits the liability or fault of the Indemnitee (the
"Settlement Requirements"). If a settlement offer solely for money
damages (and otherwise satisfying the Settlement Requirements) is made to
resolve a Third Party Claim and the Indemnitor notifies the Indemnitee in
writing of the Indemnitor's willingness to accept the settlement offer and
pay the amount called for by such offer without reservation of any rights or
defenses against the Indemnitee and if the Indemnitee fails to consent to
such settlement offer within ten calendar days after its receipt of such
notice, Indemnitee may continue to contest such claim, free of any
participation by the Indemnitor, and the amount of any ultimate liability
with respect to such Third Party Claim that the Indemnitor has an obligation
to pay hereunder shall be limited to the lesser of (x) the amount of the
settlement offer that the Indemnitee declined to accept plus the Losses of
the Indemnitee relating to such Third Party Claim through the date of its
rejection of the settlement offer and (y) the aggregate Losses of the
Indemnitee with respect to such claim. The party controlling any defense
shall keep the other party advised of the status of such Third Party Claim
and the defense thereof and shall consider in good faith all reasonable
recommendations made by the other party with respect thereto.

(b)   Direct Claims. Any claim by an Indemnitee for Losses that do
not result from a Third Party Claim (each, a "Direct Claim") shall be
asserted by giving the Indemnitor prompt written notice thereof, but in any
event not later than 60 calendar days after the incurrence thereof or such
Indemnitee's actual knowledge of such event (whichever is later); provided,
however, that the failure of an Indemnitee to notify the Indemnitor within
the time period set forth herein shall only relieve the Indemnitor from its
obligation to indemnify to the extent that the Indemnitor is materially
prejudiced by such failure or delay (whether as a result of the forfeiture of
substantive rights or defenses or otherwise), and the Indemnitor will have a
period of 30 calendar days within which to respond in writing to such Direct
Claim. If the Indemnitor does not so respond within such 30 calendar day
period, the Indemnitor will be deemed to have accepted such claim. If the
Indemnitor rejects such claim, the Indemnitee will be free to pursue such
remedies as may be available to the Indemnitee on the terms and subject to
the provisions of this Article X.

 

 

10.5 Subrogation. If after the making of any Indemnification Payment, the
amount of the Losses to which such payment relates is reduced by recovery,
settlement or otherwise under any insurance coverage, or pursuant to any
claim, recovery, settlement or payment by or against any other Person, the
amount of such reduction (less any costs, expenses, premiums or Taxes
incurred in connection therewith) as and when actually received by the
Indemnitee will promptly be repaid by the Indemnitee to the Indemnitor. Upon
making any Indemnification Payment, the Indemnitor will, to the extent of
such Indemnification Payment, be subrogated to all rights of the Indemnitee
against any third party that is not an Affiliate of the Indemnitee in respect
of the Losses to which the Indemnification Payment relates; provided,
however, that (a) the Indemnitor shall then be in compliance with its
obligations under this Agreement in respect of such Losses, and (b) until
the Indemnitee recovers full payment of its Losses, all claims of the
Indemnitor against any such third party on account of said Indemnification
Payment will be subrogated and subordinated in right of payment to the
Indemnitee's rights against such third party. Without limiting the generality
or effect of any other provision of this Article X, each such Indemnitee
and Indemnitor will duly execute upon request all instruments reasonably
necessary to evidence and perfect the above-described subrogation and
subordination rights.

10.6 Other Rights and Remedies. Following the Closing, the sole and
exclusive remedy at law for Verizon or the Company and all Affiliates thereof
for any claim (whether such claim is framed in tort, contract or otherwise)
arising out of a breach of this Agreement or the Distribution Agreement (to
the extent permitted in Section 6.1 of the Distribution Agreement), other
than a claim for fraud or willful and knowing misconduct, shall be a claim by
Verizon or the Company for indemnification pursuant to this Article X.

(iv) the costs of any filing fees or any advisor or consultant hired by any
Governmental Agency with the mutual consent of Verizon and the Company (or to

reference shall be to an Article or Section of this Agreement unless
otherwise indicated. The table of contents to this Agreement, and the
Article and Section headings contained in this Agreement, are for reference
purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation
of this Agreement. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or
"including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed
by the words "without limitation." The words "hereof," "herein" and
"hereunder" and words of similar import when used in this Agreement shall
refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of
this Agreement. The term "or" is not exclusive. All terms defined in this
Agreement shall have the defined meanings when used in any certificate or
other document made or delivered pursuant hereto unless otherwise defined
herein. The definitions contained in this Agreement are applicable to the
singular as well as the plural forms of such terms and to the masculine as
well as to the feminine and neuter genders of such terms. Unless otherwise
specified, any agreement, instrument or statute defined or referred to herein
or in any agreement or instrument that is referred to herein means such
agreement, instrument or statute as from time to time amended, modified or
supplemented, including (in the case of agreements or instruments) by waiver
or consent and (in the case of statutes) by succession of comparable
successor statutes and includes all attachments thereto and instruments
incorporated therein. References to a person are also to its permitted

(b) Each of the parties hereto has participated in the drafting and
negotiation of this Agreement. If an ambiguity or question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement must be construed as if it is drafted

favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of authorship of any of the
provisions of this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, (i) "the business
of the Company" or similar terms means the business of the Company and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole and (ii) "consistent with past practice"
when used with respect to Spinco or any of its Subsidiaries shall mean the
past practice of Verizon and its Subsidiaries with respect to the conduct of
the Spinco Business.

 

 

(c) Any matter disclosed in any particular Section or Subsection of the
Spinco Disclosure Letter, the Verizon Disclosure Letter or the Company
Disclosure Letter shall be deemed to have been disclosed in any other Section
or Subsection of this Agreement with respect to which such matter is relevant
so long as the applicability of such matter to such other Section or
Subsection of this Agreement is reasonably apparent on its face.

 

 

(d) Unless otherwise expressly stated in this Agreement, any right of
consent, approval or election given to any party hereto may be exercised by
such party in its sole discretion.

 

 

11.4 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement or the application of
any such provision to any Person or circumstance shall be declared judicially
to be invalid, unenforceable or void, such decision shall not have the effect
of invalidating or voiding the remainder of this Agreement, it being the
intent and agreement of the parties hereto that this Agreement shall be
deemed amended by modifying such provision to the extent necessary to render
it valid, legal and enforceable while preserving its intent or, if such
modification is not possible, by substituting therefor another provision that
is valid, legal and enforceable and that achieves the original intent of the
parties hereto.

11.5 Assignment; Binding Effect. Neither this Agreement nor any of the
rights, benefits or obligations hereunder may be assigned by any of the

sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be
enforceable by the parties hereto and their respective successors
and permitted assigns.

 

 

11.6 No Third Party Beneficiaries. Nothing in this Agreement, express
or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any Person (other than

assigns) any legal or equitable right, benefit or remedy of any nature
whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement, and, except as provided in
Article X with respect to Indemnitees, no Person shall be deemed a third

this Agreement, no stockholder, director, officer, Affiliate, agent or
representative of any of the parties hereto, in its capacity as such, shall
have any liability in respect of or relating to the covenants, obligations,
representations or warranties of such party under this Agreement or in
respect of any certificate delivered with respect hereto or thereto and, to
the fullest extent legally permissible, each of the parties hereto, for
itself and its stockholders, directors, officers and Affiliates, waives and
agrees not to seek to assert or enforce any such liability that any such
Person otherwise might have pursuant to applicable Law.

Agreements, the Confidentiality Agreement, the exhibits and the Disclosure
Letters and the other documents delivered pursuant hereto) constitutes the
entire agreement of all the parties hereto and supersedes all prior
agreements and understandings, both written and oral, between or among

CONSENTS TO SUBMIT ITSELF TO THE PERSONAL JURISDICTION OF ANY FEDERAL COURT
