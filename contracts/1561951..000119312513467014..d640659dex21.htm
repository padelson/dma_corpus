exist, and each holder of a Certificate (or uncertificated shares as
reflected in the books and records of the Company) that immediately prior to
the Effective Time represented any such shares of Common Stock shall cease to
have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Per
Share Common Stock Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor
and any dividends or other distributions to which holders become entitled
upon the surrender of such shares of Common Stock in accordance with _Section
2.9(b)_, without interest. For the avoidance of doubt, as provided in _Section
2.9(b)(vi)_, the right of any holder of a share of Common Stock to receive
the Per Share Common Stock Merger Consideration shall be subject to and
reduced by the amount of any required withholding under applicable Tax Law.

 

(c) (i) Each share of Common Stock held by the Company as treasury stock or
held directly by Parent, or a Merger Sub, in each case, immediately prior to
the Effective Time (the " _Canceled Shares_ "), shall be canceled and retired
without any conversion thereof, and no payment or distribution shall be made
with respect thereto.

 

(ii) Each share of Common Stock held by any direct or indirect wholly owned
Subsidiary of the Company, any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of
Parent (other than a Merger Sub) or any direct or indirect wholly owned
Subsidiary of a Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time (the "
_Continuing Shares_ ") shall be converted into such number of shares of
Parent Common Stock equal to the sum of (A) such number of shares of Parent
Common Stock equal to the quotient of the Per Share Cash Amount divided by the
Closing Parent Common Stock Price and (B) the Per Share Stock
Amount (provided, for the avoidance of doubt, that it is understood that in
the event there are any Continuing Shares outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time, the Aggregate Share Amount and related calculations will be
adjusted as necessary to preserve the original intent of the parties).

 



-17- (d) Each Option and EAR outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to
the Effective Time and each Restricted Stock Award and RSU Award, and all
rights in respect thereof, shall become fully vested upon the Initial Merger
and by virtue of the Initial Merger and without any action on the part of the
holder thereof, shall be converted into, and shall represent solely, the
right to receive the applicable payments set forth in _Section 2.9(a)_, and
all such Equity Awards shall otherwise cease to be outstanding, shall be
canceled and cease to exist.

 

2.8. _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, shares of Common Stock that are outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and which are held by stockholders who
shall have not voted in favor of the Mergers or consented thereto in writing
and who shall have properly demanded and are entitled to appraisal for
such shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (collectively, the "
_Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into or represent the right to
receive the Per Share Common Stock Merger Consideration. Such stockholders
instead shall only be entitled to receive payment of the appraised value of
such shares of Common Stock held by them in accordance with the provisions of
Section 262 of the DGCL, except that all Dissenting Shares held by
stockholders who shall have failed to perfect or who effectively shall have
waived, withdrawn, or otherwise are not entitled to, the right to appraisal of
such shares of Common Stock under Section 262 of the DGCL shall thereupon be
deemed to have been canceled and converted into and to have become
exchangeable, as of the Effective Time, for the right to receive, without any
interest thereon, the Per Share Common Stock Merger Consideration upon
surrender in the manner provided in _Section 2.9_. The Company shall (i)
give Parent prompt notice of any notice or demand for appraisal or payment for
shares of Common Stock or any withdrawals of such demands received by the
Company, (ii) give Parent the opportunity to participate in all negotiations
and proceedings with respect to any such demands and (iii) not, without the
prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle
or offer to settle any such demands.

 

2.9. _Payment of Merger Consideration_.

 

(a) Prior to the Closing, Parent shall appoint a bank or trust company of
national recognition reasonably acceptable to the Company, or Parents
transfer agent, to act as exchange agent (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") hereunder.
At the Closing, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the
Exchange Agent, in trust for the benefit of the holders of shares of Common
Stock, for exchange in accordance with this _Section 2.9_, (i) certificates
or evidence of book-entry shares representing the shares of Parent Common
Stock included in the Aggregate Per Share Common Stock Merger
Consideration and (ii) cash representing the sum of (A) the Aggregate Cash
Amount _plus_ (B) cash necessary to pay in lieu of fractional shares pursuant
to _Section 2.9(b)(ix)_ (such shares of Parent Common Stock together with
such cash, the " _Exchange Fund_ "). On the Closing Date, Parent shall cause
the Exchange Agent to pay from the Exchange Fund to each Common Stockholder
who has surrendered its Certificates, if applicable, and a properly completed
and duly executed Letter of Transmittal at least two (2) Business Days prior
to the Closing Date, the Per Share Common Stock Merger Consideration for each
share of Common

 



-18-  Stock held by such Common Stockholder, and following the Closing Date,
Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to pay from the Exchange Fund to each
other Common Stockholder the Per Share Common Stock Merger Consideration for
each share of Common Stock held by such Common Stockholder, in each case in
accordance with the procedures set forth herein, and Parent shall pay (i) to
the Surviving Company for payment to each holder of Restricted Stock Awards
or RSU Awards, the Per Share Common Stock Merger Consideration for each
outstanding Restricted Stock Award or RSU Award held by such individual, less
any applicable withholding Taxes and (ii) cash to the Surviving Company for
payment to each holder of Options or EARs, the Per Option/EAR Merger
Consideration for each outstanding and unexercised Option or EAR held by such
individual, less any applicable withholding Taxes.

 

(b) The following provisions shall be applicable to payment of the Per Share
Common Stock Merger Consideration and the Per Option/EAR
Merger Consideration:

(i) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company will deliver or mail or will
cause to be delivered or mailed to each record holder of shares of Common
Stock a letter of transmittal in a form prepared by Parent and reasonably
satisfactory to the Company (the " _Letter of Transmittal_ "), which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, only upon proper delivery of the
related Certificates (or, for holders of uncertificated shares, upon proper
delivery of a fully executed Letter of Transmittal) in accordance therewith to
the Company or the Surviving Company, as applicable, and instructions for use
in surrendering such shares of Common Stock and receiving the Per Share Common
Stock Merger Consideration in respect of the Common Stock evidenced thereby.
Upon the surrender of each such Certificate, if applicable, and a properly
completed and duly executed Letter of Transmittal at least two (2) Business
Days prior to the Closing Date, the Exchange Agent shall, at the Effective
Time, pay the holder of such shares of Common Stock the Per Share Common
Stock Merger Consideration, in consideration therefor, and such shares of
Common Stock and any related Certificate shall forthwith be canceled. Upon the
surrender of each such Certificate, if applicable, and a properly completed
and duly executed Letter of Transmittal any time after the date that is two
(2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Exchange Agent shall, no
earlier than at the Closing and as soon as reasonably practicable, pay the
holder of such shares of Common Stock the Per Share Common Stock Merger
Consideration, in consideration therefor, and such shares of Common Stock and
any related Certificate shall forthwith be canceled. Until so surrendered,
each such Certificate (other than Certificates representing Canceled Shares
or Continuing Shares) shall represent solely the right to receive the Per
Share Common Stock Merger Consideration relating thereto.

 

(ii) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Surviving Company of any shares of Common Stock that
were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, shares of Common Stock are presented to the Exchange Agent,
they shall be surrendered and canceled against delivery of the Per Share
Common Stock Merger Consideration as provided in this _Article II_.

(iii) No interest shall accrue or be paid on the Per Share Common Stock
Merger Consideration payable upon the delivery of Certificates or Letters of
Transmittal.

 



-19-  None of Parent, the Surviving Company, the Exchange Agent or any of their
respective Affiliates shall be liable to a Common Stockholder or holder of
Equity Awards for any cash or interest thereon delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws. Any
portion of the Exchange Fund remaining unclaimed by Common Stockholders or
amounts unclaimed by holders of Equity Awards twelve (12) months after the
Effective Time (or such earlier date immediately prior to such time when the
amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental
Authority) shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
the property of the Surviving Company free and clear of any claim or interest
of any Person previously entitled thereto. The Exchange Agent will notify
Parent prior to the time that any portion of the Exchange Fund which remains
unclaimed would have to be delivered to a public official pursuant to
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws and, at Parents
option, such portion shall be paid to Parent.

 

(iv) After the Effective Time, any Common Stockholders or holder of Equity
Awards will be entitled to look only to the Surviving Company for payment of
their respective claims for the consideration set forth in this _Article II_,
without interest thereon, but will have no greater rights against the
Surviving Company than may be accorded to general creditors thereof under
applicable Law.

(v) In the event that any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent
will issue, or will cause to be issued, in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate the payments with respect to such Certificate to which
such Person is entitled pursuant to this _Article II_; _provided_ , that the
Person to whom such payments are made shall, as a condition precedent to the
payment thereof, indemnify Parent and the Surviving Company against any claim
that may be made against Parent, a Merger Sub or the Surviving Company with
respect to the Certificate claimed to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

 

(vi) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Exchange
Agent, Parent, the Merger Subs and the Surviving Company shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from any amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement such amounts as are required to be deducted or withheld with respect
to the making of such payment under the Code or any applicable provision of
state, local or foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted or
withheld, such deducted or withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which
such deduction or withholding was made.

(vii) If payment of the Per Share Common Stock Merger Consideration in respect
of a share of Common Stock is to be made to a Person other than the Person in
whose name a surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition to
such payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or
shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting
such payment shall have paid any transfer and other Taxes required by reason
of such payment in a name other than that of the registered holder of the
Certificate surrendered or shall have established to the reasonable
satisfaction of Parent that such Taxes either have been paid or are not
payable.

 



-20- (viii) No dividends or other distributions declared or made with respect
to Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be
paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate (or uncertificated shares
of Common Stock) with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable
upon surrender thereof, and no cash payment with respect any cash portion of
Per Share Common Stock Merger Consideration or in lieu of fractional shares
shall be paid to any such holder, until the surrender of such Certificate (or
uncertificated shares of Common Stock) in accordance with this _Article II_.
Subject to escheat, Tax or other applicable Law, following surrender of any
such Certificate (or uncertificated shares of Common Stock), there shall be
paid to the holder of the certificate representing whole shares of Parent
Common Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest, at the time of
such surrender, (1) the amount of any cash payable in lieu of a fractional
share of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to
_Section 2.9(b)(ix)_ and (2) the amount of dividends or other distributions
declared on the shares of Parent Common Stock with a record date after the
Effective Time and a payment date prior to such surrender that is payable
with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock and, at the
appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with
a record date after the Effective Time and a payment date subsequent to such
surrender payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock.

(ix) No certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock shall be issued upon the conversion of Common Stock pursuant to this
_Article II_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each
holder of shares of Common Stock converted pursuant to the Initial Merger who
would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent
Common Stock (after taking into account all shares of Common Stock exchanged
by such holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without interest) in
an amount equal to such fractional amount multiplied by the Closing Parent
Common Stock Price.

(x) The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund,
as directed by Parent, on a daily basis. Any interest and other income
resulting from such investments shall be paid to Parent upon termination of
the Exchange Fund pursuant to this  _Section 2.9_ and any losses resulting
from such investments will be made up by Parent to the extent necessary to pay
the Per Share Common Stock Merger Consideration.

 

2.10. _Adjustment of Purchase Price_.

 

(a) On or prior to March 28, 2014, the Company shall provide Parent with a
statement setting forth the calculation of 2013 EBITDA, 2013 Adjusted EBITDA
and the Maximum Adjustment Amount, prepared in good faith (the " _2013 EBITDA
Statement_ "), which shall reflect the same 2013 Adjusted EBITDA included in
the Operating Subsidiarys Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC for
the fiscal year ended December 28, 2013 (without giving effect to the Maximum
Adjustment Amount). Not less than five (5) Business Days following the receipt
of the 2013 EBITDA Statement, Parent shall notify the Company in writing

 



-21-  in the event that it disputes any aspect of the 2013 EBITDA Statement, which
note shall include reasonable detail about such disputes (it being understood
and agreed by Parent that any disputes must be limited to disputes relating
to whether 2013 Adjusted EBITDA has been properly calculated in accordance
with the definitions and procedures set forth in this Agreement and the
Exhibits hereto, and may not include any disputes relating to proposed
changes or modifications to such definitions or procedures). During such five
(5) Business Day period, the Company and its accountants will provide Parent
and its accountants with reasonable access to such individuals and
such information, books, records and work papers as may be reasonably
required by Parent in order to reasonably verify such calculations; _provided_
, _however_ , that external accountants shall not be obliged to make any work
papers available to Parent except in accordance with such accountants normal
disclosure procedures and then only after Parent and/or Parents accountants,
as applicable, has signed a customary agreement relating to such access to
work papers in form and substance reasonably acceptable to such accountants.
If Parent does not provide such notice of dispute within such five (5)
Business Day period, the amount set forth on the 2013 EBITDA Statement shall
be the 2013 Adjusted EBITDA for the purposes of the Closing. If Parent
provides such notice of dispute within such five (5) Business Day period, the
Company and Parent shall promptly negotiate in good faith to expeditiously
resolve any such dispute. The amount so agreed following such negotiations
shall be the 2013 Adjusted EBITDA for the purposes of the Closing. If the
Company and Parent are unable to resolve any differences that they may have
with respect to the 2013 EBITDA Statement within five (5) Business Days,
the Company and Parent shall submit all matters that remain in dispute with
respect to the 2013 EBITDA Statement (along with a copy of the 2013 EBITDA
Statement marked to indicate those line items that are not in dispute) to
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, or, if such firm is unable or unwilling to act,
such other independent certified public accountant reasonably mutually
acceptable to Parent and the Company (in any such case, the " _Independent
Accountant_ "). The Independent Accountant, acting as an expert and not an
arbitrator, shall be jointly instructed by Parent and the Company to, within
fifteen (15) Business Days after such Persons selection, make a final
determination, binding on the parties to this Agreement and the holders of
Common Stock, of the appropriate calculation of 2013 Adjusted EBITDA as to
which Parent and the Company disagree. With respect to each disputed
calculation, such determination, if not in accordance with the position
of either Parent, on the one hand, or the Company, on the other hand, shall
not be in excess of the higher, nor less than the lower, of the calculation
advocated by the Company and Parent with respect to such disputed line item.
The Independent Accountants determination shall be made in accordance with
the definition in this Agreement of 2013 EBITDA, 2013 Adjusted EBITDA and the
Maximum Adjustment Amount, as applicable. If after the delivery of the 2013
EBITDA Statement but prior to the Closing, there shall be a change in any
component of the 2013 EBITDA Statement, the Company shall update the 2013
EBITDA Statement accordingly to reflect such change, and Parent shall be given
an equivalent opportunity to dispute any such updated portion of the 2013
EBITDA Statement as applied with respect to the original delivery of such
statement.

(b) The cost of the Independent Accountants review and determination shall
be shared equally by Parent on the one hand and the Company on the other hand.
During the review by the Independent Accountant, the Company and its
accountants will make available to the Independent Accountant interviews with
such individuals, and such information, books, records and work papers as may
be reasonably required by the Independent Accountant to fulfill its
obligations under _Section 2.10(c)_; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the
external accountants shall not

 



-22-  be obliged to make any work papers available to the Independent Accountant
except in accordance with such accountants normal disclosure procedures and
then only after the Independent Accountant has signed a customary agreement
relating to such access to work papers in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to such accountants. In acting under this Agreement, the
Independent Accountant will be entitled to the privileges and immunities of
an arbitrator.

(c) The Company shall, during the Interim Period, engage Mercer to calculate
the Underfunded Amount as of the last day of each quarter following the date
hereof, beginning with the quarter ending December 28, 2013, with such
calculation to be performed in accordance with their customary terms and
procedures prior to the date hereof and to be completed no later than the
18th day following the last day of such applicable quarter and promptly
delivered in writing to Parent with a copy of the calculation prepared by
Mercer.

 

2.11. _Certain Adjustments_. If, during the Interim Period (and as permitted
by _Section 5.2_), the outstanding shares of Common Stock or Parent Common
Stock shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a different
class of shares by reason of any stock dividend, subdivision, reorganization,
reclassification, recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock split,
combination or exchange of shares, or any similar event shall have occurred,
then the Per Share Common Stock Merger Consideration and the Per Option/EAR
Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted, without duplication, to
proportionally reflect such change; _provided_ that nothing in this _Section
2.11_ shall be construed to permit the Company or Parent to take any action
with respect to its securities that is prohibited by the terms of this
Agreement.

 

2.12. _Conversion of Shares in the Follow-On Merger_. At the effective time of
the Follow-On Merger, by virtue of the Follow-On Merger and without any
action on the part of any party, each share of common stock, par value $0.01
per share, of the Company as the surviving corporation in the Initial Merger
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Follow-
On Merger shall be converted into and become one limited liability company
interest of the Surviving Company.

ARTICLE III

 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

 

Except as disclosed in and reasonably apparent from the Company SEC Documents

other than historical facts included therein) or in the disclosure schedule
delivered by the Company to Parent immediately prior to the execution of this
Agreement (the " _Company Disclosure Letter_ ") (each section or subsection of
which qualifies the correspondingly numbered representation, warranty or

and properties as they are now being owned, leased and operated and to carry
on its business as now conducted, except, with respect to the Companys
Subsidiaries other than the Operating Subsidiary, where the failure to be so
duly organized, validly existing or in good standing would not reasonably be
expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is duly qualified to
do business as a foreign corporation and, where such concept is applicable, is
in good standing in all jurisdictions in which it is required to be so
qualified or in good standing, except where the failure to be so qualified or

reorganization or similar Laws now or hereafter in effect which affect the
enforcement of creditors rights generally and by rules of Law governing
specific performance, injunctive relief and equitable principles.

(b) Prior to the date of this Agreement, the Company and its board of
directors have taken all action necessary to exempt under or make not subject

of the execution of this Agreement, the Mergers and any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Company does not have in
effect any "poison pill" or shareholder rights plan.

report financial information, and (ii) any known fraud, whether or not
material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant
role in the Operating Subsidiarys internal controls over financial

the Code).

Taxing Authority has asserted in writing any deficiency, claim or issue with
respect to Taxes or any adjustment to Taxes against the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries with respect to any taxable period for which the period of
assessment or collection remains open or that has not been finally settled. No
jurisdiction (whether within or without the United States) in which the

operation of internal controls over financial reporting that are reasonably
likely to adversely affect in any material respects Parents ability to
record, process, summarize and report financial information, and (ii) any
known fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
employees of Parent who have a significant role in Parents internal controls
over financial reporting.

 

(f) Other than Parent, none of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is, or has at

any, Governmental Authority, court or quasi-judicial or administrative agency

or mediator, pending, or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened against or
affecting any of Parent, its Subsidiaries or their material assets,

 



-45-  (c) there are no settlements or similar written agreements with any
Governmental Authority affecting any of Parent, its Subsidiaries or their
material assets and (d) as of the date hereof, there is no Litigation
involving Parent, its Subsidiaries or their material assets, pending or, to

or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to this Agreement or in connection with
the transactions contemplated hereby.

with all applicable Laws and (ii) none of Parent and its Subsidiaries, nor,
to the Knowledge of Parent, any of their respective officers, directors,
employees or agents has made or offered any payment, gratuity or other thing
of value that is prohibited by any Law to personnel of any Governmental
Authority.

(b) Except as set forth in Section 4.9(b) of the Parent Disclosure Letter or
as would not reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to

Disclosure Letter, since June 29, 2013 and prior to the date hereof, the
businesses of Parent and its Subsidiaries have been conducted only in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice. Since June 29,
2013, there has not been any change, event, fact, effect or occurrence (or
with respect to any change, event, fact, effect or occurrence existing prior
to June 29, 2013, any worsening thereof) that has had, or would reasonably be
expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material
Adverse Effect.

4.11. _Financial Ability_. Parent has, or will have at Closing, all funds
necessary to pay the Aggregate Cash Amount and all other amounts required to
be paid in cash pursuant to this Agreement, including as contemplated by
Section 5.15 and all fees and expenses, and to consummate the transactions

4.12. _Information Supplied_. None of the information supplied or to be
supplied by Parent or either Merger Sub for inclusion or incorporation by

supplement thereto is declared effective under the Securities Act or at the
time it is first sent to the Companys stockholders, contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not
misleading. The Form S-4 will comply as to form in all material respects with
the requirements of the Securities Act and the rules and regulations
thereunder, except that no representation is made by Parent or either Merger
Sub with respect to statements made or incorporated by reference therein
based on information supplied by the Company for inclusion or incorporation by
reference therein.

 



-46- 4.13. _Taxes_. Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is aware of the
existence of any fact, or has taken or agreed to take any action, that would

in this _Article IV_ , neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor any
other Person acting on their behalf, makes any representations or warranties
of any kind or nature, express or implied, in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including, without limitation, any
representations or warranties with respect to any projections, forecasts,
estimates or budgets of future revenues, future results of operations or
future financial condition (or any component thereof) of any of Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries.

5.1. _Access to Information and Facilities_.

(a) From the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the Effective Time or

shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, give Parent and the Merger Subs
and Parents and the Merger Subs representatives, upon reasonable notice,
reasonable access during normal business hours to the offices, facilities,
books and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries, and shall make the
officers and employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries available to Parent
and the Merger Subs and their representatives as Parent, the Merger Subs and
their representatives shall from time to time reasonably request, in each case
to the extent that such access and disclosure would not obligate the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries to take any actions that would unreasonably
interfere with the normal course of their businesses or otherwise result in
any significant interference with the prompt and timely discharge by their
employees of their normal duties or violate any applicable Law ( _provided_
that the Company uses its commercially reasonable efforts to make alternative
arrangements to provide such access and disclosure); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that this _Section 5.1_ does not authorize any invasive or
destructive environmental testing or sampling of the Company Real Property;
_provided_ _further_ , that nothing herein shall require the Company to
provide access or to disclose any information to Parent if such access or
disclosure would be in violation of applicable Laws or confidentiality
agreements entered into by the Company or its Subsidiaries prior to the date
of this Agreement (provided that the Company uses its commercially reasonable
efforts to make alternative arrangements to provide such access or disclosure
in a way that does not violate applicable Laws or confidentiality agreements).
If any of the information or material furnished pursuant to this _Section
5.1_ includes material or information subject to the attorney-client
privilege, work product doctrine or any other applicable privilege concerning
pending or threatened Litigation or governmental investigations, each party
hereto understands and agrees that the parties hereto have a commonality
of interest with respect to such matters and it is the desire, intention and
mutual understanding of the parties hereto that the sharing of such material
or information is not intended to, and shall not, waive or 

 



-47-  diminish in any way the confidentiality of such material or information or
its continued protection under the attorney-client privilege, work product
doctrine or other applicable privilege. All such information provided by the

(e) authorize any of, or agree or commit to do any of, the foregoing actions.

5.4. _Exclusivity_. During the Interim Period, except as otherwise provided
herein, the Company and its Affiliates shall not, and shall cause their
Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives not to, directly or

respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, to any (i) liquidation,

respect to a Competing Transaction. The Company shall, and shall instruct all
Representatives acting on its and its Affiliates behalf to immediately cease
any existing activities, discussions and negotiations with any Persons with
respect to any of the foregoing. As soon as reasonably practicable after the

Merger Subs and their representatives) in possession of confidential
information about the Company that was furnished pursuant to a

 



-52-  confidentiality agreement within the prior twelve (12) months in connection
with any actual or potential proposal by such Person to acquire the Company
(or any portion thereof) to promptly return or destroy all such information,
subject to the terms of such confidentiality agreement.

5.5. _Efforts_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, each party hereto shall use
its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to
do, or cause to be done, all things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable
under applicable Law to consummate and make effective the transactions
contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable, including using its reasonable
best efforts to obtain or make all necessary or appropriate filings required
under applicable Law and to lift any injunction or other legal bar to the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as
practicable after the date of this Agreement. None of the parties shall
knowingly take, cause or permit to be taken any action which such party
reasonably expects is likely to materially delay or prevent consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

(b) The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any
consents required pursuant to the Material Contracts in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and Parent
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with the Company in
such efforts. Anything to the contrary in this Agreement
notwithstanding, nothing herein shall obligate or be construed to obligate
the Company or any of its Affiliates to make, or to cause to be made, any
payment to any third party in order to obtain the consent or approval of such
third party under any Material Contract or otherwise and the Company and its
Affiliates shall not do or commit to do so without the prior written consent
of Parent.

(c) The Company and Parent will, at the time determined by the Parent (but in
any event no earlier than ten (10) Business Days after the date hereof) and on
no less than five (5) Business Days notice to the Company, file with the
United States Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ ") and the Antitrust
Division of the United States Department of Justice (the " _DOJ_ ") the
notification and report forms required for the transactions contemplated
hereby, and subsequent to such filings, Parent and the Company will provide
any supplemental information that may be requested in connection therewith
pursuant to the HSR Act, which notification and report forms and supplemental
information will comply in all material respects with the requirements of the
HSR Act. Each of Parent and the Company will promptly furnish to the other (x)
all necessary information as the other may reasonably request in connection
with the preparation of any filing or submission pursuant to the HSR Act and
(y) copies of all written communications (and memoranda setting forth the
substance of any oral communication) with any Governmental Authority in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Parent or Company can redact discussions of the transaction
value and reasonably designate applicable materials as for review by the
others outside counsel only. The Company will consult with Parent prior to
any meetings, by telephone or in person, with the staff of a Governmental
Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
and Parent will have the right to have a representative present at any
such meeting to the extent permitted by such Governmental Authority and
reasonably practical. Parent will consult with the Company prior to any
meetings, by telephone or in person, with the

 



-53-  staff of a Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and the Company will have the right to have a
representative present at any such meeting to the extent permitted by such
Governmental Authority and reasonably practical.

(d) The parties shall (i) respond as promptly as practicable to any inquiries
or requests for documentation or information or any request for additional
information (a "second request") received from the FTC or the DOJ and to all
inquiries and requests received from any other Governmental Authority in
connection with Competition Law matters, and (ii) use their reasonable best
efforts to resolve objections, if any, as may be asserted by any Governmental
Authority with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
under any Competition Laws and to cause the waiting periods, approvals or
other requirements under the HSR Act and all other Competition Laws to
terminate or expire or be obtained prior to the Termination Date.

 

(e) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in connection with the
efforts referenced in _Sections 5.5(c)_ and (d) to obtain all necessary
consents, approvals, waivers and authorizations of any Governmental Authority
required pursuant to the HSR Act, each party to this Agreement shall: (i)
cooperate fully with the other parties hereto, shall execute and deliver such
further documents, certificates, agreements and instruments and shall take
such other actions as may be reasonably requested by any other party hereto to
evidence or reflect the Mergers (including the execution and delivery of
all documents, certificates, agreements and instruments reasonably necessary
for all filings hereunder); (ii) use reasonable best efforts to give all
notices (if any) required to be made and given by such party to any
Governmental Authority in connection with the Mergers and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (iii) use reasonable best efforts
to obtain each approval, consent, ratification, permission, waiver or
authorization required to be obtained by such party in connection with the
Mergers or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and
(iv) use reasonable best efforts to lift any restraint, injunction or other
legal bar to the Mergers; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing contained in
this Agreement shall require Parent, the Company or a Merger Sub to take, or
cause to be taken, any action with respect to any of the assets, businesses or
product lines of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or of Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Company), or any combination
thereof, (x) that is not conditioned on the consummation of the Mergers or (y)
if such action would require the divestiture or holding separate (or any
other remedy) of or with respect to any assets of Parent, the Company or any
of their Subsidiaries representing, in the aggregate, in excess of
$2,000,000,000 of revenue generated between (and inclusive of) January 1, 2013
and December 31, 2013 (any such requirement set forth in clause (y), a "
_Burdensome Condition_ "). If requested by Parent, the Company will agree to
any action contemplated by this _Section 5.5_, _provided_ that any such
agreement or action is conditioned on the consummation of the Mergers. In
furtherance of the foregoing, each of Parent and each Merger Sub agrees to
provide such assurances as to financial capability, resources and
creditworthiness as may be reasonably requested by any Governmental Authority
or other Person whose consent or approval is sought hereunder. The foregoing
agreement in this section is made solely to facilitate the closing of the
Mergers and does not constitute a representation or admission that
the Mergers, if consummated without any modification, would violate any
Competition Laws or that agreeing to the divestitures, hold separate
conditions or other restrictions permitted herein or suggested by any Person
or authority acting under any Competition Law would not be harmful to the
parties. Notwithstanding

 



-54-  anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Parent shall have the right, but
not the obligation, to oppose by refusing to consent to, through litigation or
otherwise any request, attempt or demand by any Governmental Authority or
other Person for any divestiture, hold separate condition or any other
restriction with respect to any assets, businesses or product lines of either
Parent or the Company and shall have the obligation to defend litigation
instituted by such Governmental Authority or other Person with respect to the
legality of the Mergers under applicable Competition Laws. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Parent shall take all actions required under this  _Section 5.5_,
in a timely manner, as are necessary to achieve the clearance or approval of
the Governmental Authority or other Person prior to the Termination Date,
_provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall not be required to take actions
that would amount to a Burdensome Condition. If there is no decree, order or
injunction restricting or prohibiting the Mergers but an appeal is pending,
Parent shall not be obligated to proceed to close the Mergers until the
Termination Date, as such date may be extended pursuant to Section 8.1(b),
and if such appeal remains pending on such Termination Date, Parent shall be
obligated to close the Mergers on such date, provided that on such date all
other conditions to Closing have then been satisfied. The parties shall take
reasonable efforts to share information protected from disclosure under the
attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine, joint defense privilege or
any other privilege pursuant to this section so as to preserve any applicable
privilege.

5.6. _Certain Tax Matters_. Each of the parties shall, and shall cause each of
its respective Subsidiaries to, use reasonable efforts to obtain the tax
opinion referenced in _Section 7.8_ hereof. None of the parties shall (and
shall cause their respective Subsidiaries not to) take or fail to take any
action which action (or failure to act) would reasonably be expected to
prevent or impede the Initial Merger and the Follow-On Merger, taken together,
from qualifying as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of
the Code.

 

5.7. _Maintenance of Insurance_. The Company and its Subsidiaries shall use
reasonable best efforts to continue to carry their existing insurance through
the Closing in all material respects, and shall use reasonable best efforts
not to allow any material breach, default or cancelation (other than
expiration and replacement of policies in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice) by the Company or its Subsidiaries of such
insurance policies or agreements that are material to the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to occur or exist without the consent of
Parent (not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned).

5.8. _Employment Matters_.

 

(a) _Compensation and Benefits_. Parent shall provide each employee of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries (other than any employee of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries who is covered by a collective bargaining agreement as
of the Closing Date (a " _Union Employee_ ")) as of the Closing, for so long
as they remain employed with Parent or any of its Affiliates (including the
Surviving Company) after the Closing (any such employee, a " _Continuing
Employee_ ") with: (i) from the Closing Date through at least December 31,
2014, an annual rate of base salary or hourly wages, as applicable, that is
the same as the annual rate of base salary or hourly wages, as applicable
provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Closing; (ii)
subject to the final sentence of this section 5.8(a) (A) if the Closing Date
occurs on or prior to the last day of the Companys 2014 fiscal year, within
75 days after the

 



-55-  Closing Date, a payment to each Continuing Employee (whether or not employed
following the Closing Date) of an amount in respect of such Continuing
Employees annual cash bonus otherwise due in respect of the Companys 2014
fiscal year pursuant to the applicable Benefit Plan (the " _2014 Bonus Amount_
"), and such 2014 Bonus Amount shall be prorated based on the period between
December 29, 2013 and the Closing Date relative to 365 days; but if (B) the
Closing Date occurs in 2015, then (x) the Company shall determine and make
payment of each Continuing Employees 2014 Bonus Amount based on the Companys
achievement of the 2014 performance target in the ordinary course of business
and (y) within 75 days after the Closing Date, a payment to each Continuing
Employee (whether or not employed following the Closing Date) of an amount in
respect of such Continuing Employees annual cash bonus otherwise due in
respect of the Companys fiscal year ending on December 31, 2015 pursuant to
the applicable Benefit Plan (the " _2015 Bonus Amount_ "), and such 2015 Bonus
Amount shall be prorated based on the period between the first day of the
Companys 2015 fiscal year and the Closing Date relative to 365 days; and
(iii) from the Closing Date through at least the last day of the Companys
2014 fiscal year, employee benefits on the same terms and conditions as
provided under the Benefit Plans as in effect immediately prior to the
Closing; _provided_ , however, if the Closing occurs in 2015, then such
employee benefits as shall be determined by Parent in consultation reasonably
and in good faith with the Companys senior management, taking into account
the terms of such employee benefits as they existed prior to the Closing;
provided, further, that in all cases, the U.S. Foodservice, Inc. Defined
Pension Benefit Plan (the " _Defined Benefit Plan_ ") shall be maintained as
in effect on the date of this Agreement through the last day of the Companys
2014 fiscal year. In respect of clause (ii) of this Section 5.8(a), the 2014
Bonus Amount and the 2015 Bonus Amount shall be based on a bonus opportunity
and performance criteria established by the Company reasonably and in good
faith in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice under
the applicable Benefit Plan that is an annual cash bonus plan in which such
Continuing Employee participates (and for the avoidance of doubt the Company
may adjust in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice
the target opportunity of any Continuing Employee who is promoted in a manner
otherwise permitted under Section 5.2(c) of this Agreement).

 

(b) _Recognition of Service; Pre-existing Conditions_. Periods of employment
with the Company or any of its current or former Affiliates, to the extent
previously recognized under any analogous Benefit Plan of the Company and its
Affiliates, shall be taken into account for all purposes, including, as
applicable, eligibility for participation, vesting, level of benefits, and
benefit accrual of any Continuing Employee under the corresponding employee
benefit plan offered by Parent or an Affiliate of Parent to the Continuing
Employees, including vacation plans or arrangements, defined contribution, and
any severance and welfare plans; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent and its
Affiliates shall not be required to recognize such service (x) for purposes of
benefit accrual under defined benefit pension plans (other than the Defined
Benefit Plan), (y) for purposes of plans which are frozen to new
participants, or (z) to the extent such credit would result in duplication of
benefits. Additionally, Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
(i) waive any limitation on health insurance coverage of the Continuing
Employees and their eligible dependents due to pre-existing conditions under
all applicable medical plans of Parent or an Affiliate of Parent to the extent
such condition was satisfied or waived under the comparable Benefit Plan
prior to the Closing Date and (ii) credit all Continuing Employees and their
eligible dependents with all payments credited against out-of-pocket maximums
and deductible payments and co-payments paid by such Person, in each case,
under the comparable Benefit Plan prior to

the purpose of determining the extent to which any such Person has satisfied
his or her deductible and whether he or she has reached the out-of-pocket
maximum under any health insurance plans of Parent or an Affiliate of Parent
for such year.

(c)  _Severance_. Notwithstanding anything in subsection (a) above, with
respect to any Continuing Employee whose employment is terminated by Parent or
any of its Affiliates on or prior to June 30, 2015, under any circumstances
that would give rise to a right to severance payments and benefits under the
US Foods, Inc. Severance Plan, restated effective as of July 31, 2013 (the "
_Severance Plan_ "), subject to such Continuing Employees execution of a
release of claims in a form customarily provided by Parent to its similarly
situated employees, Parent shall provide each such Continuing Employee with
the greater of (a) the severance payments and benefits that such Continuing
Employee would have received under the Severance Plan and (b) the severance
payments and benefits due to a similarly situated employee of Parent or its
Affiliates, as applicable, pursuant to the Sysco Corporation Involuntary
Severance Plan or any successor plan thereto in effect on the date of such
termination (and for the avoidance of doubt in each case, such Continued
Employee shall be credited for all service with the Company, Parent and their
respective Affiliates as provided in Section 5.8(b) above); _provided_ ,
_however_ , if any such Continuing Employee is entitled to severance benefits
under an individual severance, employment or similar agreement, the terms of
such agreement and not this Section 5.8(c) shall govern. 

(d) _Union Matters_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any Union
Employee, Parent shall provide for such compensation and benefits as are
required to be provided to such Union Employee pursuant to the terms of any
applicable collective bargaining agreement.

 

(e) _Third Party Beneficiaries_. Nothing in this Section 5.8 shall (i) be
treated as an amendment of, or undertaking to amend, any employee benefit
plan or (ii) prohibit Parent or any of its Affiliates from amending or
terminating any employee benefit plan or from terminating the employment of
any Continuing Employee or Union Employee. The provisions of this Section 5.8
are solely for the benefit of the respective parties to this Agreement and
nothing in this Section 5.8, express or implied, shall confer upon any
Continuing Employee or Union Employee, or legal representative or
beneficiary thereof or other Person, any rights or remedies, including any
right to employment or continued employment for any specified period, or
compensation or benefits of any nature or kind whatsoever under this Agreement
or a right of any employee or beneficiary of such employee or other Person
under an employee benefit plan that such employee or beneficiary or other
Person would not otherwise have under the terms of that employee benefit plan
without regard to this Agreement.

 

5.9. _Section 280G_. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall have
submitted to a vote of the shareholders of the Company for
their determination all payments or benefits that in the absence of such a
vote could reasonably be viewed as "parachute payments" (within the meaning of
Section 280G of the Code and the regulations thereunder), made to any
individuals that are "disqualified individuals" (within the meaning of
Section 280G(c) of the Code and the regulations thereunder); provided that in
no event shall this _Section 5.9_ be construed to require the Company or any
Subsidiary to actually obtain shareholder approval. Such shareholder vote

 



-57-  shall be carried out pursuant to the procedures and requirements of Section
280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and the regulations thereunder, and at least five
(5) Business Days prior to the date the Company submits all relevant
arrangements for such shareholder approval, the Company shall provide Parent,
for its review and reasonable comment, a copy of the documentation proposed to
be submitted (including any waivers necessary to validly hold the vote
referenced above) and the calculations prepared under Section 280G of the
Code, upon which the shareholder vote is being sought. Within forty-five (45)
days following the date of this Agreement, with respect to each "disqualified
individual" of the Company (as defined above), the Company shall furnish (i) a
schedule that sets forth (A) the Companys reasonable, good faith estimate of
all payments or benefits that could be provided to such disqualified
individual as a result of any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (alone or in combination with any other event), and (B) the "base
amount" (as defined in Section 280G(b)(3) of the Code) for each such
individual, and (ii) the underlying data and documentation on which such
schedule is based.

5.10. _Public Announcements_. The Company and Parent shall agree on a press
release announcing the entering into of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby. Thereafter, each party hereto will consult with the other
party before issuing any other press release or otherwise making any public
statements or disclosures with respect to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including the terms hereof, and each party shall not, without
the prior written consent of the other party (which consent will not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), issue any such press release
or make any such public statement with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, except as may be required by applicable Law or
regulation (including any New York Stock Exchange requirement).

5.11. _Indemnification of Directors and Officers_.

 

(a) For six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, (i) Parent shall
cause the Surviving Company to indemnify and hold harmless all past and
present employees, agents, officers and directors of the Company and of its
Subsidiaries to the same extent such Persons are currently indemnified by the
Company and its Subsidiaries pursuant to the Companys and its Subsidiaries
Organizational Documents as in effect on the date hereof for acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, and for such period of time
Parent shall not, and shall not permit the Surviving Company or
its Subsidiaries to, amend, repeal or modify any provision in the Surviving
Companys or any of its Subsidiaries Organizational Documents relating to the
exculpation or indemnification of present and former officers and directors as
in effect in the Companys or any of its Subsidiaries Organizational
Documents immediately prior to the Effective Time, except as required by
applicable Law and (ii) Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to honor any
indemnification agreements in effect between the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries and any past or present employees, agents, officers or directors
of the Company or its Subsidiaries as in effect as of the date hereof. If the
Surviving Company or any of its successors or assigns shall: (x) consolidate
with or merge into any other corporation or entity and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger;
or (y) transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
individual, corporation or other entity, then and in each such case, to the
extent necessary, proper provisions shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of the Surviving Company shall assume all of the obligations set
forth in this _Section 5.11_.

 



-58- (b) Parent shall cause the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries to maintain
in effect for six (6) years from the Closing Date directors and officers
liability insurance covering those Persons who are currently covered by the
Companys and its Subsidiaries directors and officers liability insurance
for events occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (" _D andO Insurance_")
on terms not less favorable than such existing insurance coverage; _provided_
that the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries shall not be required,
and Parent shall not be required to cause the Surviving Company and its
Subsidiaries, to pay for the DandO Insurance in an annual amount in excess of
two hundred fifty percent (250%) of the annual premium currently paid as of
the date hereof by the Company and its Subsidiaries for such insurance;
_provided_ , _further_ , that if the annual premiums of such insurance
coverage exceed such amount, Parent or the Surviving Company shall be
obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost
not exceeding such maximum amount. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, the Company and its Subsidiaries will, with Parents prior
written consent, and at Parents request shall, prior to the Effective Time,
purchase six (6) years run-off directors and officers liability insurance
that is dedicated to the Company and its Subsidiaries and not shared with any
other entity that is unrelated to the Company and its Subsidiaries (" _Runoff
D andO Insurance_"); _provided_ that payment for such insurance coverage
provided by such Runoff DandO Insurance shall not exceed two hundred fifty
percent (250%) of the annual premium currently paid as of the date hereof by
the Company and its Subsidiaries for such insurance without Parents prior
written consent. If the cost of the Runoff DandO Insurance would require an
expenditure that exceeds such amount and Parent does not so consent, the
Surviving Company shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to,
obtain policies with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding
such maximum amount. Any such Runoff DandO Insurance policies will
satisfy Parents obligation under this _Section 5.11(b)_ to provide DandO
Insurance; _provided_ that in the event that any claim is brought under such
DandO Insurance, the policy shall be maintained until final disposition
thereof. 

(c) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall
release, waive or impair any rights to directors and officers insurance
claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any of their respective directors,
officers or other employees, it being understood and agreed that
the indemnification provided for in this _Section 5.11_ is not prior to or
in substitution for any such claims under such policies.

 

(d) This covenant is intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, each of the past and present officers and directors of the
Company and of its Subsidiaries and their respective heirs and legal
representatives. The rights to indemnification and advancement and the other
rights provided for herein shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights
to which such a Person is entitled, whether pursuant to applicable Law,
contract or otherwise.

5.12. _Termination of Affiliate Agreements_. At or prior to the Effective
Time, unless otherwise directed in writing by Parent or provided elsewhere
herein, the Company shall terminate, or otherwise amend to exclude the Company
and any of its Subsidiaries as a party thereto, all Affiliate Agreements to
the extent provided on Section 5.12 of the Disclosure Letter and shall take
such other actions specified on Section 5.12 of the Company Disclosure Letter.

 



-59- 5.13. _Appraisal Notice_. The Company shall prepare and mail (which may be
included in the S-4) an appraisal notice as and to the extent required
pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL to any holder of Common Stock that has not
consented to this Agreement and the Mergers that complies with applicable Law,
in a form reasonably acceptable to Parent and at a time reasonably agreed
with Parent.

5.14. _Financing_. The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries
to, and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause its and its
Subsidiaries officers, directors, employees, agents, and other
representatives (collectively, " _Representatives_ ") to, provide all
cooperation that is reasonably requested by Parent to assist Parent and the
Merger Subs in the arrangement of any third party debt financing (including
any debt capital markets financing) for the purpose of funding the payment of
the Aggregate Cash Amount and the repayment, redemption, purchase, defeasance
or discharge of any outstanding Indebtedness for borrowed money of the Company
and its Subsidiaries (including pursuant to a Debt Offer, the Existing Credit
Facility Terminations or a CMBS Transaction)), and the payment of fees and
expenses incurred in connection therewith (the " _Financing_ "), including but
not limited to (i) as promptly as reasonably practicable, furnishing to Parent
and the Financing Sources such financial and other information relating to
the Company customary or reasonably necessary for the completion of such
Financing to the extent reasonably requested by Parent to assist in
preparation of customary offering or information documents to be used for
the completion of the Financing (" _Financing Offering Materials_ "); (ii)
using commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with the marketing efforts
of Parent and the Financing Sources, including using commercially
reasonable efforts to participate in a reasonable number of requested

management and Representatives, presentations, roadshows, due diligence
sessions, drafting sessions and sessions with rating agencies in connection
with the Financing; (iii) delivering (A) audited consolidated balance sheets
and related audited statements of comprehensive income (loss), stockholders
equity and cash flows of the Company (the "Audited Annual Financials") for

2013) prior to the Closing Date (and the audit reports for such financial
statements shall not be subject to any "going concern" qualifications) and (B)
unaudited consolidated balance sheets and related unaudited statements of
comprehensive income (loss) and cash flows of the Company (the "Quarterly
Financials") for each subsequent interim quarterly period that has ended at
least 40 days prior to the Closing Date, in the case of each of clauses
(iii)(A) and (iii)(B), meeting the requirements of Regulation S-X under the
Exchange Act as would be applicable to an Annual Report on Form 10-K or a
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, as applicable (it being further agreed
that (x) the Company shall deliver to Parent the consolidated financial
statements of the Company described in this clause (iii) in respect of any
such fiscal period (other than Audited Annual Financials for its 2011 and 2012
fiscal years) no later than the date upon which the corresponding
consolidated financial statements of the Operating Subsidiary for such fiscal
period are filed with the SEC and (y) the Company shall deliver to Parent the
Audited Annual Financials for its 2011 and 2012 fiscal years no later than
the date upon which it delivers the Audited Annual Financials for its 2013
fiscal year); (iv) using commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
Companys independent accountants to provide reasonable assistance to Parent
consistent with their customary practice (including to consent to the use of

SEC or pursuant to the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, and to provide any
"comfort letters" necessary and reasonably requested by Parent in connection
with any debt capital markets transaction comprising a part of the Financing,
in each case, on customary terms and consistent with their customary
practice); and (v) to the extent that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
are to be party to the Financing following the occurrence of the Effective
Time, (x) using commercially reasonable efforts to obtain customary legal
opinions and executing and delivering customary closing certificates and
documents at the Closing as may be reasonably requested by Parent in
connection with the Financing, (y) using commercially reasonable efforts to

Business Days prior to the Closing Date, providing to the Financing Sources,
at least five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, all customary and
reasonable documentation and other information required by regulatory
authorities with respect to the Company under applicable "know your customer"
and anti-money laundering rules and regulations, including without limitation
the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, as amended; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing
in this _Section 5.14_ shall require such cooperation to the extent it would
(A) unreasonably disrupt or interfere with the business or operations of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the conduct thereof or (B) require the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to pay any fees, incur or reimburse any
costs or expenses, or make any payment in connection with the Financing, prior
to the occurrence of the Effective Time (except to the extent Parent promptly
reimburses (in the case of ordinary course out-of-pocket costs and expenses)

therefor), or incur any liability in connection with the Financing that is
effective prior to the occurrence of the Effective Time, or (C) subject to

request, to reimburse the Company and its Subsidiaries for all of
their reasonable out-of-pocket costs, fees and expenses (including fees and
disbursements of counsel) in connection with the Financing promptly following
the incurrence thereof (limited, in the case of any costs, fees and expenses
for preparing the consolidated financial statements of the Company described
in clause (iii) of the preceding sentence, to the incremental costs, fees and
expenses for preparing such financial statements in excess of the costs, fees
and expenses of preparing the corresponding financial statements of the
Operating Subsidiary). Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company,
the Significant Stockholders, its and their respective Affiliates, and its and
their respective Representatives from and against any and all liabilities,
obligations, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses, awards, judgments and
penalties of any type actually suffered or incurred by any of them in
connection with any action taken, or cooperation provided, by the Company
or its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives at the request
of Parent pursuant to this _Section 5.14_ and/or the provision of information
utilized in connection therewith (other than information provided in writing
by the Company or its Subsidiaries specifically for use in connection
therewith); in each case, except to the extent that any such obligations,
losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses, awards, judgments and penalties,
fees, costs or other liabilities are suffered or incurred as a result of the
Companys

 



-61-  or its Representatives gross negligence, bad faith, willful misconduct or
material breach of this Agreement, as applicable. The Company hereby consents
to the use of its and its Subsidiaries logos in connection with the
Financing, provided such logos are used solely in a customary manner that is
not intended to or reasonably likely to harm or disparage the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries or the reputation or goodwill of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries and on such other customary terms and conditions as the
Company shall reasonably impose. Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree
that the obtaining of the Financing, or any alternative financing, is not a
condition to the Closing and reaffirm their obligation to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement irrespective and independently of
the availability of the Financing or any alternative financing, subject
to fulfillment or waiver of the conditions set forth in _Article VI_.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary provided herein or in the
Confidentiality Agreement, Parent shall be permitted to share all information
subject to such agreements with its potential financing sources, subject to
customary confidentiality undertakings by such potential financing sources
with respect thereto.

 

5.15. _Treatment of Certain Indebtedness_.

 

(a) The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
Operating Subsidiary to commence, as soon as reasonably practicable after the
receipt of a written request from Parent to do so subsequent to the date of
this Agreement, (i) a consent solicitation with respect to any and all of the
Operating Subsidiarys outstanding 8.5% Senior Notes due 2019 (the " _Notes_
") on substantially the terms and conditions of the draft Consent Solicitation
Statement provided by Parent to the Company on December 8, 2013 (the "
_Consent Solicitation_ ") and (ii) if the requisite consents are not received
in the Consent Solicitation, an offer to purchase any and all of the Notes on
or (if required) after the Closing Date on terms and conditions that satisfy
the requirements for a "Change of Control Offer" as defined in the Note
Indenture (the " _Change of Control Offer_ ", and together with the Consent
Solicitation, collectively, the " _Debt Offers_ "); _provided_ , that (A) the
Company shall not be required to commence any Debt Offer until Parent shall
have provided the Company with the necessary offer to purchase, consent
solicitation statement, letter of transmittal, supplemental indenture or other
related documents in connection with such Debt Offer (collectively, the "
_Debt Offer Documents_ ") a reasonable period of time in advance of commencing
the applicable Debt Offer (it being understood and agreed that Parent has
provided the Company the necessary documents related to the Consent
Solicitation a reasonable period of time in advance of the date hereof), (B)
Parent will consult with the Company regarding the timing and commencement of
the Debt Offers and any tender or consent deadlines for the Debt Offers in
light of the regular financial reporting schedule of the Operating
Subsidiary, the requirements of applicable Law and the requirements of the
Note Indenture, (C) Parent shall consult with the Company and afford the
Company a reasonable opportunity to review the material terms and conditions
of the Debt Offers (it being understood and agreed that the Company has had a
reasonable opportunity to review the terms and conditions of the Consent
Solicitation prior to the date of this Agreement), (D) the Company shall not
be required to commence any Change of Control Offer prior to the date that is
60 days prior to the first date on which the Company and Parent reasonably
expect the Closing may occur and (E) the Company will not be required to pay,
purchase or otherwise retire any Indebtedness prior to the occurrence of the
Effective Time, or seek any waiver or consent from any holder of Indebtedness
or agent or representative thereof, in connection with the Change of
Control Offer. The closing of the Change of Control Offer, if any, shall be
expressly conditioned on the occurrence of the "Change

 



-62-  of Control" (as defined in the Note Indenture) pursuant to this Agreement at
the Closing. Each Debt Offer shall be conducted in compliance with applicable
Law, including SEC rules and regulations, to the extent applicable. None of
the Notes shall be required to be accepted for purchase or purchased prior to
the Closing Date. The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause its and its
Subsidiaries Representatives to, provide all cooperation reasonably requested
by Parent in connection with the Debt Offers; _provided_ , _however_ , that
nothing herein shall (x) require such cooperation to the extent it would
unreasonably disrupt or interfere with the business or operations of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the conduct thereof, or (y) require the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to pay any fees, incur or reimburse any
costs or expenses, or make any payment, prior to the occurrence of the
Effective Time (except to the extent that Parent promptly reimburses (in the
case of ordinary course out-of-pocket costs and expenses) or provides the
funding (in all other cases) to the Company or such Subsidiary therefor).
Without limiting the foregoing, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall, or
shall cause their counsel to, furnish legal opinions in customary form and
scope relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries or required by the Note
Indenture, in each case, required in connection with the Consent Solicitation.

(b) Following the commencement of the Debt Offers, the Company shall not, and
shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, make any change to the terms and
conditions of the Debt Offers, unless such change is previously approved by
Parent in writing or is required by Applicable Law, or (in the case of the
Change of Control Offer) is required pursuant to the terms of the Note
Indenture.

(c) Subject to  _Section 5.15(a)_, the Company shall not, without the
written consent of Parent, waive any condition to the Debt Offers other than
as agreed in writing between Parent and the Company.

 

(d) The Company covenants and agrees that, promptly following the expiration
date of the Consent Solicitation, if the requisite valid consents from
holders of the Notes have been received in accordance with the Note Indenture
and the terms of the Consent Solicitation, the Company shall cause the
Operating Subsidiary and its other Subsidiaries party to the Note Indenture
to, and to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Note Trustee to,
execute a supplemental indenture to the Note Indenture for which the requisite
consent has been received, to implement the amendments to the Note Indenture
described in the Debt Offer Documents with respect to the Consent
Solicitation; _provided_ , that no such amendment shall (x) be effective until
immediately prior to the Effective Time unless the operative provisions of
such supplemental indenture would, by their terms, revert and be deemed never
to have been in effect in the event that this Agreement is terminated in
accordance with the provisions hereof or would cease to apply if the Effective
Time never occurs or (y) be operative with respect to any period prior to the
Effective Time.

(e) Parent shall prepare all necessary and appropriate documentation in
connection with the Debt Offers, including the Debt Offer Documents. Parent
and the Company shall, and the Company shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause its and its Subsidiaries
Representatives to, reasonably cooperate with each other in the preparation
of the Debt Offer Documents (including all amendments and supplements proposed
by Parent). The Debt Offer Documents (including all amendments or supplements
thereto) and 

 



-63-  all other communications with the holders of the Notes in connection with
the Debt Offers (including, without limitation, any materials provided,
furnished or filed pursuant to the next succeeding sentence) shall be subject
to prior review of, and comment by, Parent and the Company and shall be
reasonably acceptable to each of them. If at any time prior to the completion
of the Debt Offers, any information should be discovered by the Company or
Parent that either the Company or Parent reasonably believes should be set
forth in an amendment or supplement to the Debt Offer Documents, so that the
Debt Offer Documents shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
in order to make the statements therein, in light of circumstances under which
they are made, not misleading, the party that discovers such information shall
use reasonable best efforts to promptly notify the other party, and an
appropriate amendment or supplement prepared by Parent describing such
information shall be disseminated by or on behalf of the Company to the
holders of the applicable Notes (which amendment or supplement and
dissemination may, at the reasonable direction of Parent, take the form of the
furnishing or filing of a Current Report on Form 8-K). Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this _Section 5.15_, the Company shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to, and shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause its Subsidiaries to, comply with the requirements of Rule
14e-l under the Exchange Act, to the extent applicable, and (to the extent
permitted by the Note Indenture) any other applicable Laws to the extent such
Laws are applicable in connection with the Debt Offers and such compliance
will not be deemed a breach of this _Section 5.15_.

 

(f) In connection with the Consent Solicitation, Parent may select one or more
solicitation agents, tabulation agents, information agents, depositaries and
other agents, in each case as shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company,
to provide assistance in connection therewith, and the Company shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to
use commercially reasonable efforts to, enter into customary agreements with
such parties so selected (subject to Section 5.15(i) hereof). The Company
shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use commercially reasonable
efforts to cooperate with such parties so selected.

(g) If requested by Parent in writing, in lieu of or in addition to commencing
or consummating a Debt Offer for the Notes, the Company shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to use
commercially reasonable efforts to, (i) issue one or more notices of optional
redemption for all of the outstanding aggregate principal amount of such
Notes, pursuant the Note Indenture in order to effect a redemption on (or, at
the option of Parent, following) the Closing Date; _provided_ that (A) such
redemption notice shall be subject to and conditioned upon the occurrence of
the Effective Time, and (if Parent elects) the receipt by Parent of financing
in an amount sufficient to effect such redemption in full, and (if the Company
elects) the receipt by the Company no later than the redemption time
specified in such redemption notice of funds in an amount sufficient to
effect such redemption in full and (B) the Company shall not be required to
issue any such notice while any prior such notice is outstanding, or any

to any comments of the SEC with respect thereto, Parent (i) shall provide the
Company an opportunity to review and comment on such document or response
(including the proposed final version of such document or response), (ii)
shall consider in good faith all comments reasonably proposed by the Company

thereto or the suspension of the qualification of the shares of Parent Common
Stock included in the Per Share Common Stock Merger Consideration for offering
or sale in any jurisdiction, and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts
to have any such stop order or suspension lifted, reversed or otherwise
terminated. Each of the Company and Parent shall also take any other action
(other than qualifying to do business in any jurisdiction in which it is not
now so qualified) required to be taken under the Securities Act, the Exchange
Act, any applicable foreign or state securities or "blue sky" laws and the
rules and regulations thereunder in connection with the Mergers and the

described in an amendment of, or a supplement to, the Form S-4, Parent shall
promptly notify the Company of such event, and Parent and the Company shall
cooperate in the prompt filing with the SEC of any necessary amendment or
supplement to the Form S-4 and, as required by Law, in disseminating the

of any party under _Section 5.16(a)._

 

(c) If prior to the Effective Time, any event occurs with respect to the
Company or any Subsidiary, or any change occurs with respect to

Form S-4, the Company shall promptly notify Parent of such event, and Parent
and the Company shall cooperate in the prompt filing with the SEC of any
necessary amendment or supplement to the Form S-4 and, as required by Law, in
disseminating the information contained in such amendment or supplement to the
Companys stockholders. Nothing in this _Section 5.16(c)_ shall limit the
obligations of any party under _Section 5.16(a)._

 



-67- (d) The Company shall cause the consent solicitation statement/prospectus
included in the Form S-4 to be mailed to the Companys stockholders as
promptly as practicable after the Form S-4 is declared effective under the
Securities Act and, upon a request by Parent, seek the Company Stockholder
Approval via written consent as soon as practicable after the Form S-4
becomes effective and solicit the Company Stockholder Approval. The Company
shall, through the Company Board, recommend to its stockholders that they give
the Company Stockholder Approval and shall include such recommendation in the
Form S-4, subject to its fiduciary duties under applicable Law and
notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company Board shall be
permitted to take such actions as may be necessary to carry out such
fiduciary duties.

(e) Parent shall promptly prepare and submit to the New York Stock Exchange a
listing application covering the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable in
the Initial Merger, and shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain, prior to
the Effective Time, approval for the listing of such Parent Common Stock,
subject to official notice of issuance, and the Company shall cooperate with
Parent with respect to such listing.

5.17. _No Solicitation_. Each of Parent and the Company shall not, and shall
cause its respective Affiliates not to, without the prior written consent of
the other party, directly or indirectly, use information received from the
other party, its Subsidiaries or representatives in connection with the
evaluation and negotiation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
for purposes of soliciting to employ or hire (whether as an officer, employee
or consultant or other independent contractor) any individual who is currently
or hereafter becomes a senior officer of the other party or any of its
Subsidiaries; provided, however, that the restrictions of this Section 5.17
shall not apply (i) to any general advertisement, or any search firm
engagement which, in any such case, is not directed or focused on personnel
employed by the other party or its Affiliates or (ii) the solicitation or
hiring of any individual whose employment or term in office was terminated by
the other party or its Subsidiary.

to the Closing Date, whether before or after the Company Stockholder Approval
has been received:

 

(a) With the mutual written consent of each of the Company, Parent and the
Merger Subs;

 

(b) By either the Company or Parent, if the Closing of the Mergers shall not
have occurred on or before March 8, 2015 (the " _Termination Date_ ");
_provided_ , _however_ , that if all of

 



-70-  the conditions to Closing, other than the conditions set forth in _Section

satisfied at such time, the Termination Date may be extended by either the
Company or Parent from time to time by written notice to the other party, in
each case for sixty days, up to a date not beyond September 8, 2015, the
latest of any of which dates shall thereafter be deemed to be the Termination
Date;

(c) By the Company, if Parent shall have breached or failed to perform any of
its representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements contained in
this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (A) would give rise, if
occurring or continuing at the Effective Time, to the failure of a condition
set forth in  _Section 7.1_ or _Section 7.2_ and (B) has not been or is
incapable of being cured by Parent prior to the earlier of the (x) Termination
Date and (y) sixtieth (60th) calendar day after its receipt of written notice
thereof from the Company;

(d) By Parent, if the Company shall have breached or failed to perform any of
its representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements contained in
this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (A) would give rise, if
occurring or continuing at the Effective Time, to the failure of a condition
set forth in _Section 6.1_ or _Section 6.2_ and (B) has not been or is
incapable of being cured by the Company prior to the earlier of the (x)
Termination Date and (y) sixtieth (60th) calendar day after its receipt of

(e) By either the Company or Parent, if (i) there shall be any Law that makes
consummation of the Mergers illegal or (ii) any Governmental Authority having

such Order or other action shall have become final and nonappealable; or

five percent (95%) of the outstanding Common Stock do not enter into a Voting
Agreement substantially in the form attached as Exhibit C hereto within one
Business Day following the date hereof.

 

Notwithstanding anything else contained in this Agreement, the right to
terminate this Agreement under this _Section 8.1_ shall not be available
to any party whose breach of its representations or warranties set forth
herein or whose failure to fulfill its obligations or to comply with its
covenants under this Agreement has been the primary cause of, or primarily
resulted in, the failure to satisfy any condition to the obligations of the
other party hereunder.

8.2. _Expenses_. Whether or not the Mergers are consummated and except as
otherwise provided in this Agreement or the other transaction documents to be
entered into in connection with this Agreement and the transactions

and the transactions contemplated hereby (including any applicable stock
transfer or similar Taxes) shall be paid by the party incurring such expenses.

 

8.3. _Effect of Termination; Termination Fee_.

 

(a) If this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company pursuant to
_Section 8.1(e)(ii)_ as a result of an order, decree, ruling or other action
under Competition Laws or _Section 8.1(b)_ and all of the conditions to
Closing set forth in _Article VI_ and _Article VII_ (other

 



-71-  than (i) the conditions set forth in _Section 6.3_ and _Section 7.3_ and
(ii) those other conditions that, by their nature, cannot be satisfied until
the Closing Date, but, in the case of clause (ii), which conditions would be
capable of satisfaction if the Closing Date were to occur on the date of such
termination) have been satisfied or waived on or prior to the date of such
termination, then Parent shall pay to the Company a fee of $300,000,000 (the
" _Reverse Termination Fee_ ") (which fee shall be payable within two (2)
business days after written notice of such termination, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by the
Company). If Parent fails to timely pay the Reverse Termination Fee when due
pursuant to this _Section 8.3_, Parent shall pay to the Company interest on
such amount at the prime rate of Citibank, N.A. in effect on the date such
payment was required to be made through the date such payment was actually
received. The Company agrees that in the event that the Reverse Termination
Fee is paid to the Company pursuant to this _Section 8.3_, (i) the payment
of such Reverse Termination Fee shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the
Company, its equityholders and all of their Affiliates against Parent, the
Merger Subs or any of their directors, officers and other Affiliates for, and
(ii) in no event will the Company, its equityholders or any of their
Affiliates be entitled to recover any other money damages or any other remedy
based on a claim in law or equity with respect to, (1) any loss suffered as a
result of the failure of the Mergers to be consummated, (2) the termination
of this Agreement, (3) any liabilities or obligations arising under this
Agreement, or (4) any claims or actions arising out of or relating to any
breach, termination or failure of or under this Agreement, and upon payment
to the Company of the Reverse Termination Fee in accordance with this _Section
8.3(a)_, neither Parent, the Merger Subs nor any of their directors, officers
or other Affiliates shall have any further liability or obligation to the
Company, its equityholders or any of their Affiliates relating to or arising
out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in any circumstance in which the
Reverse Termination Fee is paid (whether due to any willful, intentional or
unintentional breach by Parent or a Merger Sub, or for any other reason), then
the Companys sole and exclusive remedy (whether at law, in equity, in
contract, in tort or otherwise) against Parent, the Merger Subs or any of
their Affiliates, equityholders, controlling persons, stockholders, directors,
officers, employees, agents or other representatives (the " _Parent
Related Parties_ ") for any breach, loss or damage shall be to terminate this
Agreement and receive payment of the Reverse Termination Fee, only to the
extent provided for by this _Section 8.3(a)_, and upon payment of such amount
in accordance with this _Section 8.3(a)_ no Person shall have any rights or
claims against any of the Parent Related Parties under this Agreement, in
respect of any oral representations made or alleged to be made in connection
herewith, in respect of the transactions contemplated hereby, whether at law
or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise, and none of the Parent Related
Parties shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising
out of this Agreement, in respect of any oral representations made or alleged
to be made in connection herewith or therewith, or in respect of the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. Nothing herein shall limit the
Companys rights under _Section 8.4_ prior to the termination of this
Agreement or the Companys right to seek payment of and be paid the Reverse
Termination Fee in accordance with this Agreement if the Company has pursued
alternative remedies hereunder in lieu of pursuing the Reverse Termination
Fee and the Company ceases to pursue such remedies without having obtained
them.

(b) Each of the Company, Parent and each Merger Sub acknowledges that (i) the
agreements contained in this _Section 8.3_ are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by

 



-72-  this Agreement, (ii) the Reverse Termination Fee is not a penalty, but is
liquidated damages, in a reasonable amount that will compensate the Company
and its Affiliates in the circumstances in which such fee is paid for the
efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating
this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, which amount would
otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision, and (iii) without these
agreements, the parties would not enter into this Agreement.

 

(c) In the event of termination of this Agreement by either the Company or
Parent as provided in _Section 8.1_, this Agreement will forthwith become
void and have no further force or effect, without any Liability (other than,
except as otherwise provided in this _Section 8.3_, with respect to fraud or
willful breach or as set forth in _Section 8.2_ or this  _Section 8.3_) on
the part of Parent, any Merger Sub or the Company. The provisions of _Section
8.2_, this _Section 8.3_, _Section 9.7_, _Section 9.11_, _Section 9.12_, 
_Section 9.15_ and _Section 9.16_ and will survive any termination hereof.

8.4. _Specific Performance_.

 

(a) Subject to _Section 8.3_, the parties agree that irreparable damage, for
which monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy,
would occur if any provision of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with the terms hereof and that the parties shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions, specific performance and other equitable remedies
to prevent and restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement or
to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof in
any court specified in _Section 9.15_, in addition to any other remedy to
which they are entitled at law or in equity. The parties hereby waive, in any
action for specific performance, the defense of adequacy of a remedy at law
and the necessity of demonstrating damages or posting any bond or other
security in connection therewith.

or to such other individual or address as a party hereto may designate for
itself by notice given as herein provided.

 

9.4. _Waivers_. The failure of a party hereto at any time or times to require
performance of any provision hereof shall in no manner affect its right at a
later time to enforce the same. No waiver by a party of any condition or of
any breach of any term, covenant, representation or warranty contained in this
Agreement shall be effective unless in writing, and no waiver in any one or
more instances shall be deemed to be a further or continuing waiver of any
such condition or breach in other instances or a waiver of any other condition
or breach of any other term, covenant, representation or warranty.

 



-74- 9.5. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts and such
counterparts may be delivered in electronic format (including by fax and
email). Such delivery of counterparts shall be conclusive evidence of the
intent to be bound hereby and each such counterpart and copies produced
therefrom shall have the same effect as an original. To the extent
applicable, the foregoing constitutes the election of the parties hereto to
invoke any Law authorizing electronic signatures.

 

9.6. _Interpretation_. The headings preceding the text of Articles and
Sections included in this Agreement and the headings to Sections of the
Company Disclosure Letter are for convenience only and shall not be deemed
part of this Agreement, the Company Disclosure Letter or the Parent Disclosure
Letter or be given any effect in interpreting this Agreement, the Company
Disclosure Letter or the Parent Disclosure Letter. The use of the masculine,
feminine or neuter gender herein shall not limit any provision of this
Agreement. The use of the terms "including" or "include" shall in all cases
herein mean "including, without limitation" or "include, without limitation,"
respectively. Underscored references to Articles, Sections or Exhibits shall
refer to those portions of this Agreement. Any singular term in this Agreement
shall be deemed to include the plural, and any plural term in this Agreement
the singular. "Writing", "written" and comparable terms refer to printing,
typing and other means of reproducing words (including electronic format) in
a visible form. If any action under this Agreement is required to be done or
taken on a day that is not a Business Day, then such action shall be required
to be done or taken not on such day but on the first succeeding Business Day
thereafter. The words "hereof", "herein" and "hereunder" and words of like
import used in this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not
to any particular provision of this Agreement. Any capitalized term used in
any Exhibit, the Company Disclosure Letter or the Parent Disclosure Letter
but not otherwise defined therein shall have the meaning given to such term in
this Agreement. References from or through any date shall mean, unless
otherwise specified, from and including or through and including,
respectively. All references to dollars or to "$" shall be references to
United States dollars.

 

9.7. _APPLICABLE LAW_. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED AND
ENFORCED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE INTERNAL LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE
WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO THE PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAW THEREOF.

9.8. _Binding Agreement_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to
the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and
permitted assigns.

9.9.  _Assignment_. This Agreement and all of the provisions hereof shall be
binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the
parties hereto and their respective heirs, successors and permitted assigns;
_provided_ that neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations hereunder shall be assigned (including by operation of law) by
Parent or the Surviving Company without the prior written consent of the
Company; _provided_ that with the consent of Parent, either Merger Sub may
assign (in whole but not in part) its rights and obligations under this
Agreement to another wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent, but no such assignment
shall relieve Parent of its obligations under this Agreement. Any purported
assignment in contravention of this _Section 9.9_ shall be null and void.

 



-75- 9.10. _Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement is solely for the benefit of
the parties hereto and, except for _Section 5.11_ _,_ _Section 8.3_,
_Section 9.11_ and _Section 9.12_ no provision of this Agreement shall be
deemed to confer upon third parties, either express or implied, any remedy,
claim, liability, reimbursement, cause of action or other right.

9.11. _No Recourse_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein or otherwise, this Agreement may only be enforced against, and any
claims or causes of action that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to
this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, may only be made against
the entities and Persons that are expressly identified as parties to this
Agreement in their capacities as such and no former, current or future
stockholders, equity holders, controlling persons, directors, officers,
employees, general or limited partners, members, managers, agents or
Affiliates of any party hereto, or any former, current or future direct or
indirect stockholder, equity holder, controlling person, director, officer,
employee, general or limited partner, member, manager, agent or Affiliate of
any of the foregoing (each, a " _Non-Recourse Party_ ") shall have any
liability for any obligations or liabilities of the parties to this Agreement
or for any claim (whether in tort, contract or otherwise) based on, in respect
of, or by reason of, the transactions contemplated hereby or in respect of any
oral representations made or alleged to be made in connection herewith.
Without limiting the rights of any party against the other parties hereto, in
no event shall any party or any of its Affiliates seek to enforce this
Agreement against, make any claims for breach of this Agreement against, or
seek to recover monetary damages from, any Non-Recourse Party.

9.12. _Release_. Effective upon the Closing, Parent, on its own behalf and on
behalf of the Surviving Company and each of its former, present and future
Subsidiaries (each of the foregoing, a " _Releasing Party_ "), hereby releases
and forever discharges each former, current or future stockholders, equity
holders, controlling persons, directors, officers, employees, general or
limited partners, members, managers, agents or Affiliates of the Company and
its Subsidiaries or any former, current or future stockholders, equity
holders, controlling persons, directors, officers, employees, general or
limited partners, members, managers, agents or Affiliates of the foregoing (or
a fiduciary of any employee benefit plan of the Company or of any of its
present or former Subsidiaries) (each of the foregoing, a " _Released Party_
") from any and all claims, rights, obligations, debts, liabilities, actions
or causes of action of every kind and nature, whether foreseen or unforeseen,
contingent or actual, and whether now known or hereafter discovered, which
any of the Releasing Parties had, now has or may in the future have, at law
or in equity, against any Released Party in any way arising out of, in
connection with, pertaining to or by reason of (i) their respective status as
such or (ii) any acts or omissions, or alleged acts or omissions, by any of
them in their respective capacities as such, which acts or omissions existed
or occurred at or prior to the Closing (each, a " _Released Claim_ ");
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that the Releasing Parties expressly do not release
their rights and interests (i) under (y) this Agreement or the Stockholders
Agreement or (z) the Confidentiality Agreement and the joint defense agreement
between the Company and Parent, (ii) with respect to claims, actions, causes
of action or any liabilities that arise as a result of actual fraud,
intentional misrepresentation or other criminal act by the Released Party or
(iii) with respect to any claim of, or liability to, the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries (or any successor thereof) against any Released Party to the
extent resulting from the Released Partys status as an employee of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Each of Parent and each Merger Sub
covenants and agrees that it will honor such

 



-76-  release and will not, and will cause the Surviving Company and its
Subsidiaries not to, take any action inconsistent therewith (including
commencing any Litigation with respect to, or directly or indirectly
transferring to another Person, any Released Claim). This _Section 9.12_
shall survive the Closing, is intended for the benefit of and may be enforced
directly by each of the Released Parties, and shall be binding on
all successors and permitted assigns of Parent and the Surviving Company.

9.13. _Further Assurances_. Upon the reasonable request of Parent or the
Surviving Company, each party will, on and after the Closing Date, execute and
deliver to the other parties such other documents, assignments and other
instruments as may be reasonably required to effectuate the Mergers and to
effect and evidence the provisions of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby.

9.14. _Entire Understanding_. The Exhibits, the Company Disclosure Letter and
the Parent Disclosure Letter identified in this Agreement are incorporated
herein by reference and made a part hereof. This Agreement, the
Confidentiality Agreement and the confidentiality and joint defense agreement
between the parties set forth the entire agreement and understanding of the
parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede any and
all prior agreements, arrangements and understandings among the parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof.

9.15. _JURISDICTION OF DISPUTES_. IN THE EVENT ANY PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT
COMMENCES ANY LITIGATION, PROCEEDING OR OTHER LEGAL ACTION IN CONNECTION WITH
OR RELATING TO NEGOTIATION, EXPLORATION, DUE DILIGENCE WITH RESPECT TO OR
ENTERING INTO OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY MATTERS DESCRIBED OR CONTEMPLATED
HEREIN, THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT HEREBY (A) AGREE THAT ANY SUCH
LITIGATION, PROCEEDING OR OTHER LEGAL ACTION SHALL BE INSTITUTED EXCLUSIVELY
IN A COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION LOCATED WITHIN THE STATE OF DELAWARE,
WHETHER A STATE OR FEDERAL COURT; (B) AGREE THAT IN THE EVENT OF ANY SUCH
LITIGATION, PROCEEDING OR ACTION, SUCH PARTIES WILL CONSENT AND SUBMIT TO
PERSONAL JURISDICTION IN ANY SUCH COURT DESCRIBED IN CLAUSE (A) OF THIS
_SECTION 9.15_ AND TO SERVICE OF PROCESS UPON THEM IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE
RULES AND STATUTES GOVERNING SERVICE OF PROCESS; (C) AGREE TO WAIVE TO THE
FULL EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW ANY OBJECTION THAT THEY MAY NOW OR HEREAFTER HAVE
TO THE VENUE OF ANY SUCH LITIGATION, PROCEEDING OR ACTION IN ANY SUCH COURT OR
THAT ANY SUCH LITIGATION, PROCEEDING OR ACTION WAS BROUGHT IN AN INCONVENIENT
FORUM; (D) AGREE AS AN ALTERNATIVE METHOD OF SERVICE TO SERVICE OF PROCESS IN
ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING BY MAILING OF COPIES THEREOF TO SUCH PARTY AT ITS ADDRESS
SET FORTH IN _SECTION 9.3_ FOR COMMUNICATIONS TO SUCH PARTY; (E) AGREE THAT
ANY SERVICE MADE AS PROVIDED HEREIN SHALL BE EFFECTIVE AND BINDING SERVICE IN
EVERY RESPECT; AND (F) AGREE THAT NOTHING HEREIN SHALL AFFECT THE RIGHTS OF
ANY PARTY TO EFFECT SERVICE OF PROCESS IN ANY OTHER MANNER PERMITTED BY LAW;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT ANY DISPUTE REGARDING THE CALCULATION OF 2013 ADJUSTED
EBITDA SHALL BE GOVERNED EXCLUSIVELY BY THE PROVISIONS OF _SECTION 2.10_.

 



-77- 9.16. _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY
CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE
COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES OF FACT AND LAW, AND THEREFORE, EACH SUCH
PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY
OTHERWISE HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE NEGOTIATION, EXPLORATION, DUE
DILIGENCE WITH RESPECT TO OR ENTERING INTO OF THIS AGREEMENT, OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES
AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER
PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD
NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (B)
EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER,
(C) EACH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (D) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN
INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL
WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 9.16_.

9.17. _Disclosure Letters_. Disclosure in any section or subsection of the
Company Disclosure Letter or the Parent Disclosure Letter shall apply only to
the indicated Section of this Agreement, except to the extent that it is
reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure that such disclosure is
applicable to or relevant to another Section of this Agreement. The inclusion
of information in the Company Disclosure Letter or the Parent Disclosure
Letter shall not be construed as an admission that such information is
material to any of the Company or its Subsidiaries or to any of Parent or its
Subsidiaries, as applicable. In addition, matters reflected in the Company
Disclosure Letter or the Parent Disclosure Letter are not necessarily limited
to matters required by this Agreement to be reflected in the Company
Disclosure Letter or the Parent Disclosure Letter. Such additional matters
are set forth for informational purposes only and do not necessarily include
other matters of a similar nature. Neither the specifications of any dollar
amount in any representation, warranty or covenant contained in this
Agreement nor the inclusion of any specific item in the Company Disclosure
Letter or the Parent Disclosure Letter is intended to imply that such amount,
or higher or lower amounts, or the item so included or other items, are or
are not material, and shall not be construed as an admission of liability or
responsibility under any Law or in any dispute or controversy. Further,
neither the specification of any item or matter in any representation,
warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement nor the inclusion of any
specific item in the Company Disclosure Letter or the Parent Disclosure Letter
is intended to imply that such item or matter, or other items or matters, are
or are not in the ordinary course of business (except where expressly stated
in the relevant representation, warranty or covenant), and shall not be
construed as an admission of liability or responsibility under any Law or in
any dispute or controversy.

 

9.18. _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid
or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect the
validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or the
validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any other
situation or in any other situation or in any other jurisdiction. If the

 



-78-  final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction declares that any term
or provision hereof is invalid or unenforceable, all other conditions and
provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and
effect. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid,
illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in
good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of
the parties as closely as possible to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law in an acceptable manner to the end that the transactions
contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent possible.

 

9.19. _Construction_. The parties have participated jointly in the negotiation
and drafting of this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or question of
intent or interpretation arises, the language shall be construed as mutually
chosen by the parties to express their mutual intent, and no rule of strict
construction shall be applied against any party. Any reference to any
federal, state, local or foreign statute or Law shall be deemed also to refer
to all rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, unless the context
requires otherwise.
