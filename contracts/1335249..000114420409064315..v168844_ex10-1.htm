WHEREAS, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company desire to make certain

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein, and
intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto agree as follows:

 

 

ARTICLE I. 

 

 

THE MERGER

 

 

1.1 The Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, and in accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law
(the "DGCL") and the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act (the "DLLCA"),
the Company shall be merged with and into Merger Sub at the Effective Time.
Following the Merger, the separate corporate existence of the Company shall
cease and Merger Sub shall continue as the surviving limited liability
company (the "Surviving Company") under the name "Manor LLC."

 

 

1.2 Closing. Unless this Agreement shall have been terminated pursuant to the
provisions of Section 7.1, the closing of the Merger (the "Closing") will
take place on the tenth Business Day after the end of the first calendar
month in which each of the conditions set forth in Section 6.1 and Section
6.2(c) is satisfied or waived (subject to Applicable Law), subject to the
satisfaction or, where permitted, waiver of each of the conditions set forth
in Article VI as of the Closing and the parties having finalized the Special
Dividend Amount in accordance with Section 5.2 or, unless another time or
date is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto (the date of the Closing,
the "Closing Date"). The Closing shall be held at the offices of Ropes and
Gray LLP, One International Place, Boston, Massachusetts, unless
another place is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto.


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1.3 Effective Time. Upon the Closing, the parties shall file with
the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware a certificate of merger (the
"Certificate of Merger") in such form as is required by and executed in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL and the DLLCA, and make
all other filings or recordings required under the DGCL and the DLLCA. The
Merger shall become effective at such time as the Certificate of Merger is
duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such
subsequent time as Parent and the Company shall agree and as shall be
specified in the Certificate of Merger (the date and time the Merger becomes
effective being the "Effective Time").

 

 

1.4 Effects of the Merger. At and after the Effective Time, the Merger will
have the effects set forth in the DGCL and the DLLCA. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time
all the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company
and Merger Sub shall be vested in the Surviving Company, and all debts,
liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts,
liabilities and duties of the Surviving Company.

 

 

1.5 Certificate of Formation. The certificate of formation of Merger Sub, as
in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the certificate
of formation of the Surviving Company, until thereafter changed or amended
as provided therein or by Applicable Law.

 

 

1.6 Limited Liability Company Agreement. The limited liability company
agreement of Merger Sub as in effect at the Effective Time shall be the
limited liability company agreement of the Surviving Company until thereafter
changed or amended as provided therein or by Applicable Law.

 

 

1.7 Management of Surviving Company. The officers and directors of the
Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall submit their
resignations to be effective as of the Effective Time. From and after the
Effective Time, the business and affairs of the Surviving Company shall be
managed as provided in the limited liability company agreement of Merger Sub.

 

 

1.8 Effect on Capital Stock. At the Effective Time by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of the holder thereof:

 

 

(a) Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than Treasury Shares and Dissenting Shares
but including Converted Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive
such number of shares of Parent Common Stock as is equal to the Exchange
Ratio (the "Merger Consideration"), subject to Section 2.5 with respect to
fractional shares.


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) As a result of the Merger and without any action on the part of the
holders thereof, at the Effective Time, all shares of Company Common Stock
(other than shares referred to in Sections 1.8(c) and (e)) shall cease to
be outstanding and shall be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each
holder of a certificate (a "Certificate") or book-entry credit (a "Book-
Entry Share") which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any
such shares of Company Common Stock shall thereafter cease to have any rights
with respect to such shares of Company Common Stock, except the right to
receive the applicable Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued or paid in
consideration therefor and any dividends or other distributions to which
holders become entitled all in accordance with Article II upon the surrender
of such Certificate.

 

 

(c) Each Treasury Share at the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger,
cease to be outstanding and shall be canceled and no Merger Consideration or
other consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

 

 

(d) The limited liability company membership interests of Merger Sub issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be converted
into and become validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable limited
liability company membership interests of the Surviving Company, and such
limited liability company membership interests shall constitute the only
outstanding membership interests of the Surviving Company.

 

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, shares of
Company Common Stock that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and that are owned by stockholders that are entitled to demand
and have properly demanded rights of appraisal in accordance with Section 262
of the DGCL (the "Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into the right
to receive the Merger Consideration, unless and until such stockholders shall
have failed to perfect or have effectively withdrawn or lost such right of
appraisal under Applicable Law, but, instead, the holders thereof shall be
entitled to payment of the appraised value of such Dissenting Shares in
accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL. If any such holder shall fail to
perfect or shall effectively withdraw or lose such right of appraisal, the
shares of Company Common Stock held by such stockholder shall not be deemed
Dissenting Shares for purposes of this Agreement and shall thereupon be
deemed to have been converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration in accordance with Section 1.8(a), without interest. The
Company shall give Parent (A) prompt notice of any written demands for
appraisal filed pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL received by the Company,
withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served or delivered in
connection with such demands pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company
and (B) the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings
with respect to demands made pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL. The Company
shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, (x) make any
payment with respect to any such demand, (y) offer to settle or settle any
such demand or (z) waive any failure to timely deliver a written demand for
appraisal or timely take any other action to perfect appraisal rights in
accordance with the DGCL.


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(f) If prior to the Effective Time, Parent or the Company, as the case may
be, should (after obtaining the consent required by Section 4.1 or Section
4.2, as the case may be) split, combine or otherwise reclassify the Parent
Common Stock or the Company Common Stock, or pay a stock dividend or other
stock distribution in Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock, as
applicable, or otherwise change the Parent Common Stock or Company Common
Stock into any other securities, or make any other such stock dividend or
distribution in capital stock of Parent or the Company in respect of the
Parent Common Stock or the Company Common Stock, respectively (in each case
other than pursuant to Section 1.9), then any number or amount contained
herein which is based upon the price of the Parent Common Stock or the number
of shares of Company Common Stock or Parent Common Stock, as the case may be,
will be appropriately adjusted to reflect such split, combination, dividend,
reclassification or other distribution or change.

 

 

1.9 Treatment of Company Series B Preferred Stock. As soon as practicable
following the date of this Agreement, the Board of Directors of the Company
(or a committee thereof) shall adopt such resolutions or take such other
actions as may be required in accordance with the terms of the Certificate of
Designation of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock of the Company to provide

EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

 

 

2.1 Exchange Fund. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall
deposit with Continental Stock Transfer and Trust Company or such other bank or
trust company as Parent shall determine prior to the mailing of the Proxy

"Exchange Agent"), in trust for the benefit of holders of shares of Company
Common Stock, for exchange in accordance with Section 1.8, all the
certificates representing the Aggregate Merger Consideration to be issued
pursuant to this Agreement in exchange for outstanding Company Common Stock
and cash sufficient to pay cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to

2.2 Exchange Procedures. As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time
(but in any event within two Business Days thereafter), the Exchange
Agent will send to each record holder of a Certificate or Book Entry Shares
(other than Certificates or Book Entry Shares, to be canceled pursuant to
Section 1.8(c) and Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in respect of Dissenting
Shares), (a) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall
be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only
upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent or, in the case of
Book-Entry Shares, upon adherence to the procedures set forth in the letter
of transmittal), and shall be in customary form and have such other
provisions as Parent and the Company shall mutually agree, and (b)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or Book
Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration. As soon as reasonably
practicable after the Effective Time, each holder of a Certificate or Book-
Entry Shares, upon surrender of a Certificate or Book Entry Shares to the
Exchange Agent together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and
such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent,
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a certificate or
certificates or book-entry credit representing the number of full shares of
Parent Common Stock and the amount of cash in lieu of fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.5 and in respect of any dividends
or other distributions to which holders are entitled pursuant to Section 2.3,
if any, into which the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock
previously represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares shall have
been converted pursuant to this Agreement. The Exchange Agent shall accept
such Certificates and Book Entry Shares upon compliance with such reasonable
terms and conditions as the Exchange Agent may impose to effect an orderly
exchange thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices. No interest
will be paid or will accrue on any cash payable pursuant to Section 1.8,
Section 2.3 or Section 2.5. In the event of a transfer of ownership of
Company Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of the
Company, one or more shares of Parent Common Stock evidencing, in the
aggregate, the proper number of shares of Parent Common Stock and cash in
lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.5
and any dividends or other distributions to which such holder is entitled
pursuant to Section 2.3, shall be issued with respect to such Company Common
Stock to such a transferee only if the Certificate representing such shares
of Company Common Stock is presented to the Exchange Agent, or otherwise
delivered in the case of Book-Entry Shares, accompanied by all documents
required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any
applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid.

2.3 Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares. No dividends or other
distributions declared or made with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock
with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of
any unsurrendered Certificate or Book Entry Shares with respect to the shares
of Parent Common Stock that such holder would be entitled to receive upon
surrender of such Certificate or Book Entry Shares and no cash payment in
lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be paid to any such
holder pursuant to Section 2.5 until such holder shall surrender such
Certificate or Book Entry Shares in accordance with Section 2.2. Subject to
the effect, if any, of Applicable Laws, following surrender of any such
Certificate or Book Entry Shares, there shall be paid to such holder of
shares of Parent Common Stock issuable in exchange therefor, without
interest, promptly after the time of such surrender, the amount of any cash
payable in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which such
holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.5 and the amount of dividends or
other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore
paid with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock. For purposes
of dividends or other distributions in respect of Parent Common Stock, all
shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the Merger shall be
entitled to dividends pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence as if
such shares of Parent Common Stock were issued and outstanding as of the
Effective Time.

 

 

2.4 No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock. All shares of Parent
Common Stock issued and cash paid upon conversion of shares of Company Common
Stock in accordance with the terms of Article I and this Article II
(including any cash paid pursuant to Section 2.3 or Section 2.5) shall be
deemed to have been issued or paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock.

 

 

2.5 No Fractional Shares of Parent Common Stock. (a) No certificates or scrip
or shares of Parent Common Stock or book-entry credit therefor representing
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender
for exchange of Certificates and such fractional share interests will not
entitle the owner thereof to vote or to have any rights of a stockholder of
Parent or a holder of shares of Parent Common Stock.

 

 

(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of
shares of Company Common Stock exchanged pursuant to the Merger who would
otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent
Common Stock (after taking into account all Certificates delivered by such
holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without interest) in an amount
equal to the product of (i) such fractional part of a share of Parent Common
Stock multiplied by (ii) the Parent Reference Price. As promptly as
practicable after the determination of the amount of cash, if any, to be paid
to holders of fractional interests, the Exchange Agent shall so notify
Parent, and Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to forward payments to such
holders of fractional interests subject to and in accordance with the terms
hereof.

2.6 Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which
remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates or Book Entry Shares for
one year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Company
or otherwise on the instruction of the Surviving Company, and any holders
of Certificates or Book Entry Shares who have not theretofore complied with
this Article II shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Company or
Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar laws) for the
Merger Consideration with respect to the shares of Company Common Stock
formerly represented thereby to which such holders are entitled pursuant to
Section 1.8, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to

distributions with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock to which such
holders are entitled pursuant to Section 2.3.

 

 

2.7 No Liability. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving
Company or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any
Merger Consideration from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

 

 

2.8 Investment of the Exchange Fund. Any funds included in the Exchange Fund
may be invested by the Exchange Agent, as directed by Parent; provided that
such investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United
States of America and backed by the full faith and credit of the United
States of America or in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or
better by Moody's Investors Services, Inc. or Standard and Poor's
Corporation, respectively. Any interest and other income resulting from
such investments shall promptly be paid to Parent.

 

 

2.9 Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Surviving Company, the posting by such Person of a bond in
such reasonable amount as the Surviving Company may direct as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate or other documentation (including an indemnity in customary form)
requested by Parent, the Exchange Agent will deliver in exchange for such
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the applicable Merger Consideration
with respect to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented
thereby, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock, and
unpaid dividends and distributions on shares of Parent Common Stock
deliverable in respect thereof, pursuant to this Agreement.

 

 

2.10 Withholding Rights. Each of the Surviving Company and Parent shall
be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Company Common
Stock such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to
the making of such payment under the Code and the Treasury Regulations, or
any provision of state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts
are so withheld by the Surviving Company or Parent, as the case may be, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company Common Stock, in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving
Company or Parent, as the case may be.

2.11 Further Assurances. At and after the Effective Time, the officers
and directors of the Surviving Company will be authorized to execute and
deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company or Merger Sub, any deeds,
bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to take and do, in the name and
on behalf of the Company or Merger Sub, any other actions and things to vest,
perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving Company any and
all right, title and interest in, to and under any of the rights, properties
or assets acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Company as a result of,
or in connection with, the Merger.

 

 

2.12 Stock Transfer Books. At the close of business, Boston time, on the day
the Effective Time occurs, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be
closed and there shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of
Company Common Stock thereafter on the records of the Company. From and
after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates shall cease to have any
rights with respect to such shares of Company Common Stock formerly
represented thereby, except as otherwise provided herein or by law. On or
after the Effective Time, any Certificates presented to the Exchange Agent or
Parent for any reason shall be converted into the Merger Consideration with
respect to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented thereby,
any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which the
holders thereof are entitled pursuant to Section 2.5 and any dividends or
other distributions to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to
Section 2.3.

 

 

ARTICLE III. 

 

 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

 

 

3.1 Representations and Warranties of the Company. Except as disclosed in (i)
the Company SEC Reports filed prior to the date hereof (other than in the
"Risk Factors" or "Forward Looking Statements" sections thereof), or (ii)
the disclosure schedule delivered by the Company to Parent prior to the
execution of this Agreement (the "Company Disclosure Schedule") (which
Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth, among other things, items the
disclosure of which is necessary or appropriate either in response to an
express disclosure requirement contained in a provision hereof or as an
exception to one or more representations or warranties contained in
this Section 3.1, or to one or more of the Company's covenants contained
herein; provided, however, that disclosure in any Section of the Company
Disclosure Schedule shall apply only to the indicated Section of this
Agreement except to the extent that it is reasonably apparent that such
disclosure is relevant to another Section of this Agreement, and provided,
further, that, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
the mere inclusion of an item in such Schedule as an exception to a
representation or warranty shall not be deemed an admission that such item
represents a material exception or material fact, event or circumstance or
that such item has had or would be reasonably likely to have a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company), the Company hereby represents and warrants to
Parent and Merger Sub that:


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(a) Organization and Qualification. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries
is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of
the jurisdiction of its organization, with the corporate or similar power
and authority to own and operate its business as presently conducted. The
Company and each of its Subsidiaries is duly qualified as a foreign
corporation or other entity to do business and is in good standing in each
jurisdiction where the character of its properties owned or held under lease
or the nature of its activities makes such qualification necessary, except
for such failures of the Company and any of its Subsidiaries to be so
qualified as would not individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. The Company has
previously made available to Parent true and complete copies of its
certificate of incorporation and by-laws and the charter documents and by-
laws or other organizational documents of each of its Subsidiaries, as
currently in effect, and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is
in violation of its respective charter documents and by-laws or other
organizational documents in any material respects.

 

 

(b) Authorization; Validity and Effect of Agreement. The Company has the
requisite corporate power and authority to execute, deliver and perform its
obligations under this Agreement and, subject to obtaining the Required
Company Votes, to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The
execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company and the performance
by the Company of its obligations hereunder and the consummation by the
Company of the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly authorized by
the Board of Directors of the Company (acting upon the recommendation of the
Special Committee), and all other necessary corporate action on the part of
the Company, other than the adoption of this Agreement by the shareholders of
the Company, and no other corporate proceedings on the part of the Company
are necessary to authorize this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by
the Company and assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by Parent
and Merger Sub, constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the
Company, enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, subject to the
effects of bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization,
moratorium and other similar laws relating to or affecting creditors' rights
generally, general equitable principles (whether considered in a proceeding
in equity or at law) and an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.

the Company Warrants, the Company Series B Preferred Stock and the Company
Rights, there are no options, warrants, calls, subscriptions, convertible
securities or other securities, agreements, commitments, or obligations which
would require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to issue, deliver or

no commitments, obligations or understandings to purchase or redeem or
otherwise acquire any shares of Company Common Stock or the capital stock of
any of its Subsidiaries or to provide funds to or make any investment (in the
form of a loan, capital contribution or otherwise) in any such Subsidiary or
any other entity. Except as set forth on Section 3.1(c) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, there are no stockholders' agreements, voting trusts or
other agreements or understandings to which the Company is a party or by
which it is bound relating to the voting or registration of any shares of
capital stock of the Company or any preemptive rights with respect thereto.
As of the date hereof, the record and beneficial ownership of and voting
power in respect of, the capital stock of the Company with respect to the
signatories to the Voting Agreement set forth in the Voting Agreement, is
accurate in all material respects. No Subsidiary of the Company owns any
Company Common Stock.

outstanding ownership interests in Aston are validly issued, fully paid, non-
assessable and free of preemptive rights, rights of first refusal or similar
rights. Except as provided by the Restated LP Agreement or disclosed on
Section 3.1(d) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company owns directly
all of the issued and outstanding ownership interests or securities of Aston,
free and clear of any claim, lien, pledge, option, right of first refusal or
offer, preemptive right, charge, security interest, mortgage, right-of-way,
covenant, restriction, encumbrance or other rights of third parties
("Encumbrances"). There are no existing options, warrants, calls,
subscriptions, convertible securities or other securities, agreements,
commitments or obligations of any character relating to the outstanding
interests or other securities of Aston, or which would require Aston or the
Company to issue or sell any shares of its capital stock, ownership interests
or securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of its capital
stock or ownership interests.

 

 

(e) Other Interests. Neither the Company nor Aston owns, directly
or indirectly, any interest or investment in (whether equity or debt)
any corporation, partnership, limited liability company, joint venture,
business, trust or other Person (other than the Company's ownership
of Aston).

 

 

(f) No Conflict; Required Filings and Consents.

 

 

(i) Except as set forth in Section 3.1(f)(i) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule with respect to clause (C) below, none of the execution and delivery
of this Agreement, the performance by the Company of its obligations
hereunder or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, will:
(A) violate or conflict with the Company's certificate of incorporation or
by-laws; (B) assuming adoption of this Agreement by shareholders of the
Company and assuming satisfaction of the requirements set forth in Section
3.1(f)(ii) below, violate any statute, law, ordinance, rule or regulation,
applicable to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
properties or assets; or (C) except for the consents, approvals and notices
required to be obtained from or delivered to (as applicable) Clients under
the Advisory Contracts pursuant to this Agreement, violate, breach, be in
conflict with or constitute a default (or an event which, with notice or
lapse of time or both, would constitute a default) under, or permit the
termination of any provision of, or result in the termination of,
the acceleration of the maturity of, or the acceleration of the performance
of any obligation of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under, or result
in the creation or imposition of any Encumbrance upon any properties, assets
or business of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under, any note,
bond, indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, lease, franchise, permit,
authorization, license, contract, instrument or other agreement or commitment
or any order, judgment or decree to which the Company or any of its

the case of clauses (B) and (C), for such violations, breaches, conflicts,
defaults, terminations, accelerations, encumbrances, purchase or repurchase
obligations or other occurrences, which individually or in the aggregate,
would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company.


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(ii) Except for (A) the pre-merger notification requirements of the Hart-
Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and the rules
and regulations thereunder (the "HSR Act"), (B) state securities or "blue

Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated

consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

 

(g) Compliance. (i) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries is in compliance
with all foreign, federal, state and local laws and regulations applicable to
its operations or with respect to which compliance is a condition of engaging
in the business thereof, except for such failure as would not, individually
or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect
on the Company. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has
received any notice from a Governmental Authority asserting a failure, or
possible failure, to comply with any such law or regulation, the subject of
which notice has not been resolved, except for such failure as would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect. The Company and its Subsidiaries have all permits,
licenses, grants, authorizations, easements, consents, certificates,
approvals, orders and franchises (collectively, "Permits") from Governmental
Authorities required to conduct their respective businesses as they are now
being conducted, except for such Permits the failure of which to
obtain, would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. The Company and
its Subsidiaries are in compliance with the terms of the Permits, except for
such noncompliance which would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

 

 

(ii) The Company and each of its officers are in compliance in all material
respects with the applicable provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and
the related rules and regulations promulgated under such act or the Exchange

Parent the information required to be disclosed by the Company and certain of
its officers to the Company's Board of Directors or any committee thereof
pursuant to the certification requirements contained in Form 10-K and Form
10-Q under the Exchange Act. Except as permitted by the Exchange Act, since
the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, neither the Company nor any of
its Affiliates has made, arranged or modified personal loans to any
executive officer or director of the Company.


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13

and procedures to ensure that material information relating to the Company,
including its consolidated Subsidiaries, is made known to the management of
the Company by others within those entities, and (B) disclosed, based on its
most recent evaluation prior to the date hereof, to the Company's auditors
and the audit committee of the Company's Board of Directors (x) any

to record, process, summarize and report financial data and have identified
for the Company's auditors any weaknesses in internal controls and (y) any
fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees
who have a significant role in the Company's internal controls. The Company

Subsidiaries is required to file periodic reports with the SEC pursuant to
Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act.

 

 

(ii) The audited consolidated financial statements and unaudited consolidated
interim financial statements of the Company included in the Company SEC

rules and regulations of the SEC, including those pursuant to the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act, with respect thereto in effect at the time such Company SEC

SEC Reports or referred to in the notes thereto, (B) liabilities or

Company Disclosure Schedule and except for the transactions expressly
contemplated hereby, since December 31, 2008, (A) the Company and its
Subsidiaries have conducted their respective businesses only in the ordinary
and usual course consistent with past practices and (B) there has not been
any change, circumstance, event, development or effect that would,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company.

 

 

(j) Litigation. As of the date hereof, there is no material action, order,
writ, injunction, judgment or decree outstanding or claim, suit, litigation,
proceeding, arbitration, investigation or inquiry by or before any court,
governmental or other regulatory or administrative agency or commission or

(e) The Revenue Run-Rate of such Advisory Contract.

 

 

Except as specifically described in Section 3.1(z) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule by express disclosure thereon relating to a particular Advisory
Contract, there are no contracts, agreements, arrangements or understandings
pursuant to which the Company or any of its Affiliates or employees or
representatives of any of them has undertaken or agreed to cap, waive,
offset, reimburse or otherwise reduce any or all fees or charges payable by
or with respect to any of the Clients set forth in Section 3.1(z) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule. As of the date hereof, except as is set forth in
Section 3.1(z) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, no Client of Aston (or, in
the case of a Client that is a Proprietary Fund or Program Sponsor,
underlying investors, beneficiaries or participants therein, as applicable)
has, to the knowledge of the Company, expressed to the Company or any of its
Affiliates or any employees or representatives of any of them (or, in the
case of an investor, beneficiary or participant in a Proprietary Fund or
Program Sponsor, to the Proprietary Fund or Program Sponsor) an intention to
terminate or reduce its investment relationship with Aston or adjust the fee
schedule with respect to any contract in a manner which would reduce the fees
or other payments to Aston (including after giving effect to the Closing) in
connection with such Client relationship. None of the Aston Management
Owners, the Company or any of its Affiliates provides Investment Management
Services to any Person other than pursuant to a written Advisory Contract set
forth in Section 3.1(z) of the Company Disclosure Schedule. None of the
Company or any of its Affiliates other than Aston provides, or has ever
provided Investment Management Services to any Person, and is not, and has at
no time been, a party to any Advisory Contract.

 

 

(f) Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company, (x) each Advisory
Contract has at all times since its effective date been (and currently is)
duly authorized, executed and delivered by Aston and, to the knowledge of the
Company, each other party thereto and, to the extent applicable, adopted and
subsequently renewed in compliance with Section 15 of the Investment Company
Act, and at all such times has been a valid and binding agreement of Aston
and, to the knowledge of the Company, each other party thereto, enforceable
in accordance with its terms (subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium,
fraudulent transfer and similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally
and to general equity principles), and (y) Aston has been at all times since
November 30, 2006 (and currently is) in compliance with the material terms of
each Advisory Contract to which it is a party (including the applicable
investment guidelines and restrictions thereunder, where applicable), and no
event has occurred or condition exists that constitutes or with notice or the
passage of time would reasonably be expected to constitute a default
thereunder.

(g) Each Client to which Aston provides Investment Management Services that
is (i) an employee benefit plan, as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, that is
subject to the fiduciary responsibility provisions of Title I of ERISA or to
Section 4975 of the Code, or (ii) a person acting on behalf of such plan, or
(iii) an entity whose assets include the assets of such a plan, within the
meaning of Section 3(42) of ERISA and applicable regulations of the
Department of Labor (any such plan, person or entity, an "ERISA Client")
has been managed by Aston such that Aston in the provision of such services
is in compliance in all material respects with the applicable requirements of
ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code. Section 3.1(z) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule identifies each Client that is an ERISA Client with a footnote to
that effect. Aston meets the Advisers Act registration, minimum assets under
management and minimum shareholders' or partners' equity requirements to
qualify as a qualified professional asset manager (a "QPAM") under Prohibited
Transaction Class Exemption 84-14) (the "QPAM Exemption"). Aston is not
disqualified from relying on the QPAM Exemption with respect to transactions
negotiated for ERISA Clients due to the application of Section I(e) or
Section I(g) of the QPAM Exemption.

 

 

(h) Any Client that is a Proprietary Fund is identified as such on Section
3.1(z) of the Company Disclosure Schedule with a footnote to that effect.
Any Client that is a Program Sponsor is identified as such on Section 3.1(z)
of the Company Disclosure Schedule with a footnote to that effect.
Other than the Proprietary Funds, no Subsidiary of the Company provides
Investment Management Services to or through (i) any issuer or other Person
that is an investment company, unit trust or SICAV (or similar Person)
(within the meaning of the Investment Company Act), (ii) any issuer or other
Person that would be an investment company, unit trust or SICAV (or similar
Person) (within the meaning of the Investment Company Act) but for the
exemptions contained in Section 3(c)(1), Section 3(c)(7), the final clause of
Section 3(c)(3) or the third or fourth clauses of Section 3(c)(11) of the
Investment Company Act, or (iii) any issuer or other Person that is or is
required to be registered under the laws of the appropriate securities
regulatory authority in the jurisdiction in which the issuer is domiciled
(other than the United States or the states thereof), which is or holds
itself out as engaged primarily in the business of investing, reinvesting or
trading in securities. At no time during the past five years has the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries had "custody" of client funds within the meaning
of Rule 206(4)-2 under the Advisers Act or any other similar laws.

 

 

(i) To the knowledge of the Company, no controversy or disagreement exists
between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any Client.

regulatory relief have been obtained, nor are any requests pending therefor,
by or with respect to (i) the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) any
officer, member of the board of managers, partner, shareholder, owner,
employee or representative, as applicable, of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or (iii) any Client (in connection with the provision of
Investment Management Services to such Client) except as set forth on Section
3.1(z) of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

Advisory Contract in effect at the time the investments were made, and has
been held thereafter in all material respects in accordance with such
investment policies, guidelines and restrictions.

 

 

(aa) Regulatory Compliance. Except where the violation of any of the

Material Adverse Effect on the Company:

registered as an investment company under the Investment Company Act; (B) the
shares of each Proprietary Fund are duly and validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable and are qualified for sale, or an exemption therefrom is in
full force and effect; (C) all outstanding shares of each Proprietary Fund
that were required to be registered under the Securities Act have been sold
pursuant to an effective registration statement filed thereunder; and (D) in
the case of prospectuses applicable to the Proprietary Funds, no such

material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated
therein in order to make the statements therein not misleading or is subject

that have occurred or been made, except as reflected in compliance reports
submitted to the applicable Board of Directors.


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

29  

 

 

 

 

 

 


 

(iv) Neither the Company, any of its Subsidiaries nor any Proprietary Fund,
and, to the Company's knowledge, no person "associated" (as defined under the
Investment Advisers Act) with the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any
Proprietary Fund, has for a period not less than five years prior to the date
hereof been convicted of any crime or is or has been subject to any
disqualification that would be a basis for denial, suspension or revocation
of registration of an investment adviser under Section 203(e) of the
Investment Advisers Act or Rule 206(4)-4(b) thereunder or of a broker-dealer
under Section 15 of the Exchange Act, or for disqualification as an
investment adviser for any registered Investment Company pursuant to Section
9(a) of the Investment Company Act, and to the Company's knowledge there is
no basis for, or proceeding or investigation that is reasonably likely to
become the basis for, any such disqualification, denial, suspension or
revocation.

the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any Proprietary Fund been advised
since December 31, 2005 by any Regulatory Agency or other Governmental
Authority that it is considering issuing or requesting any such Company
Regulatory Agreement.

 

 

(cc) Books and Records. The books, records and accounts of the Company
and each of its Subsidiaries are maintained, in all material respects, in
accordance with the requirements of Section 13(b)(2) of the Exchange Act

acknowledges that neither the Company, nor any other Person on behalf of the
Company, makes or has made any other express or implied representation or
warranty with respect to the Company or with respect to any other information
provided to Parent or Merger Sub. Neither the Company nor any other Person

Parent, Merger Sub or any other Person resulting from the distribution to
Parent or Merger Sub, or Parent's or Merger Sub's use of, any such
information, including any information, documents, projections, forecasts or

or (ii) the disclosure schedule delivered by Parent to the Company prior to
the execution of this Agreement (the "Parent Disclosure Schedule") (which
Parent Disclosure Schedule sets forth, among other things, items the
disclosure of which is necessary or appropriate either in response to an
express disclosure requirement contained in a provision hereof or as an
exception to one or more representations or warranties contained in
this Section 3.2, or to one or more of Parent's covenants contained herein,
provided, however, that disclosure in any Section of the Parent Disclosure
Schedule shall apply only to the indicated Section of this Agreement except
to the extent that it is reasonably apparent that such disclosure is relevant
to another Section of this Agreement, and provided, further
that, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the mere
inclusion of an item in such schedule as an exception to a representation or
warranty shall not be deemed an admission that such item represents a
material exception or material fact, event or circumstance or that such item
has had or would be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on
Parent), Parent and Merger Sub hereby, jointly and severally, represent and
warrant to the Company that:

(a) Organization and Qualification. Parent is duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware, with
the corporate power and authority to own and operate its business as
presently conducted. Merger Sub is duly organized, validly existing and in
good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware. Parent is
duly qualified as a foreign corporation or other entity to do business and is
in good standing in each jurisdiction where the character of its properties
owned or held under lease or the nature of its activities makes such
qualification necessary, except for such failures of Parent to be so
qualified as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Parent. Each of Parent and
Merger Sub has previously made available to the Company, true and correct
copies of its certificate of incorporation and by-laws, certificate of
formation and limited liability company agreement, as the case may be, in
each case as currently in effect.

 

 

(b) Authorization; Validity and Effect of Agreement. Each of Parent and
Merger Sub has the requisite corporate or limited liability company power and
authority, as the case may be, to execute, deliver and perform its
obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by each of
Parent and Merger Sub and the performance by each of Parent and Merger Sub of
its obligations hereunder, including the Merger and the issuance of Merger
Consideration by Parent, and the consummation of the transactions by Parent
and Merger Sub contemplated hereby have been duly authorized by the Board of
Directors of Parent (or a duly authorized committee thereof) and the member
of Merger Sub and all other necessary corporate or limited liability company
action on the part of Parent and Merger Sub, and, subject to the succeeding
sentence, no other corporate or limited liability company proceedings on the
part of Parent or Merger Sub are necessary to authorize this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby. Following execution of this Agreement
by the parties hereto, Parent shall execute and deliver to Merger Sub a
written consent adopting this Agreement in its capacity as sole member of
Merger Sub. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered
by each of Parent and Merger Sub and, assuming due authorization, execution
and delivery by the Company, constitutes a legal, valid and binding
obligation of each of Parent and Merger Sub, enforceable against it in
accordance with its terms, subject to the effects of bankruptcy, insolvency,
fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws
relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally, general equitable
principles (whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law) and an
implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.

Governmental Authority asserting a failure, or possible failure, to comply

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

 

 


 

5.1 Preparation of Proxy Statement and Registration Statement; Company
Stockholders Meeting. (a) As promptly as practicable after the execution
of this Agreement, the Company shall prepare the Proxy Statement, and Parent
shall prepare and file the Registration Statement (in which the Proxy
Statement will be included) with the SEC. Parent and the Company shall
cooperate with each other and use their reasonable best efforts to cause the
Registration Statement to become effective under the Securities Act as soon
after such filing as practicable and to keep the Registration Statement
effective as long as is necessary to consummate the Merger and ensure that
the Registration Statement and the Proxy Statement comply as to form in all
material respects with the rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC under
the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, respectively. Parent shall make all
necessary filings with respect to the Merger under all applicable state
securities laws and Blue Sky Laws and use reasonable best efforts to obtain
all permits and approvals necessary thereunder to carry out the Merger. The
Proxy Statement shall include the recommendation of the Board of Directors of
the Company in favor of adoption of this Agreement and the Merger, except to
the extent the Board of Directors of the Company (acting upon the
recommendation of the Special Committee) shall have withdrawn or modified its
approval or recommendation of this Agreement as permitted by Section 5.5(c).
The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy
Statement to be mailed to its stockholders as promptly as practicable after
the Registration Statement becomes effective. The parties shall promptly
provide copies, consult with each other and prepare written responses with
respect to any written comments received from the SEC with respect to the
Proxy Statement and the Registration Statement and advise one another of any
oral comments received from the SEC. The Registration Statement and the Proxy
Statement shall comply as to form in all material respects with the rules and
regulations promulgated by the SEC under the Securities Act and the Exchange
Act, respectively.

 

 

(b) Parent and the Company shall make all necessary filings with respect to
the Merger and the transactions contemplated thereby under the Securities Act
and the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder. Each party
will advise the other, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of the time
when the Registration Statement has become effective or any supplement or
amendment has been filed, the issuance of any stop order, the suspension of
the qualification of the Parent Common Stock issuable in connection with the
Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or any request by the SEC
for amendment of the Proxy Statement or the Registration Statement or
comments thereon and responses thereto or requests by the SEC for additional
information. No amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement or the
Registration Statement shall be filed without the approval of both parties
hereto, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed. If at any time prior to the Effective Time, any information relating
to Parent or the Company, or any of their respective Affiliates, officers or
directors, should be discovered by Parent or the Company that should be set
forth in an amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement or the
Proxy Statement, so that such documents would not include any misstatement of
a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, the party that discovers such information shall promptly
notify the other parties and Parent and the Company will cooperate in the
prompt filing with the SEC of an appropriate amendment or supplement
describing such information and, to the extent required by law, dissemination
thereof to the stockholders of the Company.


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

42  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 


 

(c) Subject to Section 5.5(c), the Company shall cause the Company
Stockholders Meeting to be duly called as soon as reasonably practicable, and
held as soon as reasonably practicable following the mailing of the Proxy
Statement in accordance with this Section 5.1, for the purpose of obtaining
the Required Company Votes. In connection with such meeting, the Company will
(i) subject to Section 5.5(c), use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the
Required Company Votes and (ii) otherwise comply with all legal requirements
applicable to such meeting.

 

 

5.2 Special Dividend.

 

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 4.1, immediately
prior to the Closing, the Board of Directors of the Company is permitted,
subject to compliance with Applicable Law and this Section 5.2, to declare a
special cash dividend (the "Special Dividend"), payable on the Closing Date,
to each holder of record of Company Common Stock (including the Converted
Shares) immediately prior to the Closing in an amount equal to (x) the
Special Dividend Amount divided by (y) the number of shares of Company Common
Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Closing (including the Converted
Shares), provided, that the Special Dividend shall only be declared if the
Special Dividend Amount is greater than zero.

 

 

(b) Not less than five Business Days prior to the Closing, the Company will
deliver to Parent a certificate (the "Special Dividend Certificate") setting
forth: (i) each line item of the Current Assets and the Liabilities of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, in each case as of the
Closing Measurement Date, prepared in accordance with GAAP on a basis
consistent with prior periods, (ii) the Working Capital as of the Closing
Measurement Date and (iii) the Special Dividend Amount (if any), in each case
giving pro forma effect to the Closing as if the Closing occurred on such
date. The Company shall (x) provide Parent reasonable access during normal
business hours to the work papers and other books and records of the Company
for purposes of assisting Parent in its review of the Special Dividend
Certificate and (y) cooperate in good faith to answer any questions and
resolve any issues raised by Parent in connection with its review of the
Special Dividend Certificate.

 

 

(c) Within three Business Days of the Company's delivery of the Special
Dividend Certificate to Parent pursuant to Section 5.2(b), Parent may dispute
any amounts reflected on the Special Dividend Certificate by notifying the
Company in writing of each disputed item, specifying the amount thereof in
dispute and setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for such dispute.
Parent may dispute any such amount only on the basis that (x) such amount was
not determined on a basis that complies with Section 5.2(b) or (y) there
are mathematical errors in the calculation. If Parent notifies the Company
of disputed items in accordance with the preceding sentence, Parent and the
Company shall use good faith efforts to reach agreement on the disputed items
or amounts in order to finally determine the Special Dividend Certificate and
the amounts reflected thereon. If the Company and Parent are unable to reach
agreement concerning the Special Dividend Certificate and the amounts
reflected thereon within ten days of the Company's delivery of the estimated
Special Dividend Certificate pursuant to Section 5.2(b), the Parties shall
promptly thereafter submit such dispute to the Accounting Referee
for resolution in accordance with the procedure set forth in Section 5.2(d).
If Parent fails to notify the Company of any disputed items in accordance
with this Section 5.2(c), the Special Dividend Certificate and the
calculations of the Working Capital and the Special Dividend Amount shall
become final for all purposes of this Agreement on the fourth Business Day
after the delivery of the Special Dividend Certificate by the Company to
Parent pursuant to Section 5.2(b).


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

43  

 

 

 

 

 


 

(d) If the Company and Parent are unable to reach agreement concerning the
Special Dividend Certificate and the amounts reflected thereon pursuant to
Section 5.2(c), the parties shall submit such dispute to Deloitte and Touche
LLP (the "Accounting Referee") for resolution and instruct the Accounting
Referee to review the disputed items or amounts for the purpose of final
determination of the Special Dividend Certificate and the Company's
calculation of the amounts reflected thereon on the basis that any such
amounts were not determined on the basis that complies with Section 5.2(c).
In making such determination and calculations, the Accounting Referee shall
consider only those items or amounts in the Special Dividend Certificate
and/or the Company's calculation of the Working Capital as to which Parent
has disagreed in writing. The Company and Parent shall instruct the
Accounting Referee to use its best efforts to deliver to the Company and
Parent as promptly as practicable (but in no event later than ten Business
Days after submission) a report selecting either the Company's calculation or
Parent's calculation of each disputed amount (but not any other amount) in
either case that were most recently submitted to the Accounting Referee prior
to its review and that are closest to the Accounting Referee's calculations
thereof. Such report shall be final and binding upon the Company and Parent
and the resulting Special Dividend Certificate and the calculations of the
Working Capital and the Special Dividend Amount shall be final for all
purposes of this Agreement. The fees, expenses and costs of the Accounting
Referee shall be borne equally by each party. Other than such fees and
expenses of the Accounting Referee, the Company and Parent shall each be
responsible for its own costs and expenses incurred in connection with any
actions taken pursuant to this Section 5.2.

 

 

(e) If any dispute relating to the Special Dividend Certificate has been
submitted by the parties to the Accounting Referee for resolution pursuant
to Section 5.2(d), then either (i) if (x) the aggregate amount remaining
in dispute relating to the Special Dividend Certificate is less than $500,000
or (y) at the joint election of both the Company and the Parent, the parties
shall proceed with the Closing, in which case the Special Dividend Amount
payable on the Closing Date shall be reduced by an amount equal to the
aggregate amount of the disputed items submitted for resolution to the
Accounting Referee, or (ii) if the aggregate amount remaining in dispute
relating to the Special Dividend Certificate is in excess of $500,000 and
there is no joint election of both the Company and the Parent, the Closing
shall be delayed (notwithstanding the satisfaction or waiver of the
conditions set forth in Article VI) until all such disputed items have been
finally resolved in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section
5.2(d). If the parties proceed or elect to proceed with the Closing pursuant
to clause (i) of this Section 5.2(e) prior to such time as all of the
disputed items submitted for resolution to the Accounting Referee have been
finally resolved then, following final resolution of all such disputed items
by the Accounting Referee in accordance with the procedures set forth in
Section 5.2(d), the Surviving Company shall pay (or cause to be paid) to each
holder of record of Company Common Stock (including the Converted Shares)
immediately prior to the Closing an amount in cash equal to (x) the aggregate
amount of such disputed items (if any) finally resolved in favor of the
Company, divided by (y) the number of shares of Company Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Closing (including the Converted
Shares).

records, in each case to the extent Parent reasonably requests, and, during
such period, the Company shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) furnish
promptly to Parent and its Representatives, consistent with its legal

(b) The Company shall promptly provide to Parent, as and when available (and
in any event within 10 Business Days after each month end), (i) copies of
monthly financial statements for the Company and its Subsidiaries, including
balance sheet and income statement, certified by the Chief Financial Officer
of the Company, which financial statements shall be prepared in accordance
with GAAP applied consistently using the accrual method of accounting (except
that they need not include footnotes) and shall present fairly in all
material respects the financial condition of the Company at the dates of said
statements and the results of its operations for the periods covered thereby,
(ii) complete and correct information regarding the aggregate assets under
management by the Company and its Subsidiaries (broken out by product type)
as of such month end, and investment performance and client flows for the
month then ended, and (iii) such other correct information regarding such
assets under management as of such month end, broken out by category of
Client, product type, asset class and/or similar types of information, in the
case of this clause (iii) to the extent such information already is prepared
by the Company or its Subsidiaries in the ordinary course.

 

 

(c) Parent shall hold any such information that is non-public in confidence
to the extent required by, and in accordance with, the provisions of the
letter dated October 31, 2009 between the Company and Parent (the
"Confidentiality Agreement"). Any investigation by the Company or Parent
shall not affect the representations and warranties or the conditions to
the obligations of the Company or Parent, as the case may be.


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

45

the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement as soon as practicable

the SEC as are necessary, proper or advisable under Applicable Law to allow
the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries to operate their businesses

and to supply as promptly as practicable any additional information and
documentary material that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act and to
take all other actions necessary to cause the expiration or termination of
the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act as soon as practicable and
(y) if any state takeover statute or similar law becomes applicable to the
Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, take all
action necessary to ensure that the Merger and such other transactions may be
consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this
Agreement and use reasonable best efforts to otherwise minimize the effect of
such law on the Merger and such other transactions.

(b) Each of Parent and the Company shall, in connection with the efforts
referenced in Section 5.4(a) to obtain all requisite approvals and
authorizations for the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under the
HSR Act or any other Regulatory Law, use its reasonable best efforts to (i)
cooperate in all respects with each other in connection with any filing or
submission and in connection with any investigation or other inquiry,
including any proceeding initiated by a private party; (ii) promptly inform
the other party of any communication received by such party from, or given by
such party to, the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (the
"DOJ"), the Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC") or any other Governmental
Authority and of any material communication received or given in connection
with any proceeding by a private party, in each case regarding any of the
transactions contemplated hereby; and (iii) permit the other party to
review any communication given by it to, and consult with each other in
advance of any meeting or conference with, the DOJ, the FTC or any such other
Governmental Authority or, in connection with any proceeding by a private
party, with any other Person, and to the extent permitted by the DOJ, the FTC
or such other applicable Governmental Authority or other Person, give the
other party the opportunity to attend and participate in such meetings
and conferences. For purposes of this Agreement, "Regulatory Law" means the
Sherman Act, as amended, the Clayton Act, as amended, the HSR Act,
the Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, and all other federal, state
and foreign, if any, statutes, rules, regulations, orders, decrees,
administrative and judicial doctrines and other laws that are designed or
intended to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or
effect of monopolization or restraint of trade or lessening of competition
through merger or acquisition. In furtherance and not in limitation of the
covenants of the parties contained in Section 5.4(a) and this Section 5.4(b),
each party hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to resolve
objections, if any, as may be asserted with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement under any Regulatory Law. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, in connection with any
filing or submission required or action to be taken by either Parent or the
Company to consummate the Merger, in no event shall Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates be obligated to propose or agree to accept any
undertaking or condition, to enter into any consent decree, to make any
divestiture or accept any operational restriction, or take or commit to take
any action that, in the sole discretion of Parent, would reasonably be
expected to limit (A) the freedom of action of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates with respect to the operation of, or Parent's or
any of its Subsidiaries' or Affiliates' ability to retain, the Company or any
businesses, product lines or assets of the Company, or (B) the ability to
retain, own or operate any material portion of the businesses, product lines,
or assets, of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates, or alter or
restrict in any way the business or commercial practices of the Company,
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates.

 

 

(c) (i) The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts (A) to obtain
consents of all third parties necessary, proper or advisable for the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, provided,
that, in connection with obtaining such consents, the Company shall not
modify or amend any of the contracts referenced in Section 5.4(c)(ii) to
provide for increased fees or other terms adverse to the Company; and (B) to
provide any notices to third parties required to be provided prior to the
Effective Time, including under any Leases or insurance policies.

 

 

(ii) Without limiting the foregoing, with respect to each Advisory Contract
for which the consent of a Client to the assignment or deemed assignment of
such Advisory Contract as a result of the Merger is required by Applicable
Law and/or by the terms of such Advisory Contract (other than Clients that
are Investment Companies), as promptly as practicable following the date
hereof, the Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, send
a written notice (a "Notice") informing such Clients of the Merger and
requesting written consent to the assignment or deemed assignment of such
Client's Advisory Contract. All Notices and related materials distributed to
Clients shall be in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent, and
Parent shall be provided a reasonable opportunity to review all such Notices
prior to distribution and to have its reasonable comments reflected therein.
The Company shall make available to Parent copies of all substantive
correspondence between it or any of its Subsidiaries and Clients (or their
representatives or counsel) relating to the consent solicitation provided for
in this Section 5.4(c)(ii).

For each Client that is registered as an investment company under the
Investment Company Act (a "Registered Investment Company"), the Company
shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain in accordance with Section 15 of
the Investment Company Act, as promptly as practicable following the date
hereof, the due consideration and approval by the board of trustees of the
Registered Investment Company ("Fund Board Approval") of (i) a new Advisory
Contract with Aston to be in effect as of, and subject to, the Closing, on
terms substantially identical (and identical with respect to fee rates) to
the terms of Aston's existing Advisory Contract with such
Registered Investment Company, (ii) the election of those nominees (the
"Board Nominees") to serve as trustees of the Registered Investment Company
subject to and immediately following the Closing, the names of which Board
Nominees are set forth on Section 5.4(c)(ii) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, and (iii) the continuation of each existing Sub-Advisory Contract,
to be in effect as of, and subject to, the Closing, on terms identical to the
terms of such Sub-Advisory Contract as of the date hereof. To the extent Fund
Board Approval has been obtained with respect to a new Advisory Contract,
continuation of the existing Sub-Advisory Contracts and election of the Board
Nominees in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence, the Company
shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain in accordance with Section 15 of
the Investment Company Act, as promptly as practicable following such Fund
Board Approval, the due consideration and approval by the shareholders of
such Registered Investment Company ("Fund Shareholder Approval") (except, in
the case of any Registered Investment Company other than a Proprietary Fund,
to the extent such shareholder approval is not required by law for the
effectiveness of such new advisory agreement) of such new Advisory Contract
and election of Board Nominees described in the immediately preceding
sentence. All proxy and related materials distributed in connection with the
approvals described in this paragraph shall be in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to Parent, and Parent shall be provided a reasonable
opportunity to review all such proxies and other materials prior to
distribution and to have its reasonable comments reflected therein. For the
avoidance of doubt, the Company shall be solely responsible for the costs of
such shareholder solicitations.

 

 

For each Client that is an Investment Company but not a Registered Investment
Company, the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain in
accordance with the constituent documents of such Investment Company and
Applicable Law, as promptly as practicable following the date hereof, the
consent and approval (as applicable) of any governing body of such Investment
Company and of its investors required by such constituent documents and
Applicable Law of either (a) the continuation of each Advisory Contract
between Aston and such Investment Company to the assignment or deemed
assignment of such Advisory Contract as a result of the Merger (to the extent
any such agreement may continue in effect following the Merger with such
consent) or (b) a new Advisory Contract between Aston and such Investment
Company, to the extent the existing advisory agreement will terminate as a
result of the Merger) (in each case to be in effect with Aston as of, and
subject to, the Closing) on terms substantially identical (and identical with
respect to fee rates) to the terms of Aston's existing Advisory Contract with
such Investment Company. The manner of consent and approval solicited with
respect to each such Investment Company that is not a Registered Investment
Company shall be reasonably acceptable to Parent, and all solicitation and
related materials distributed in connection with the consents and approvals
described in this paragraph shall be in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to Parent and Parent shall be provided a reasonable opportunity to
review all such solicitation and related materials prior to distribution and
to have its reasonable comments reflected therein.


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

48  

 

 

 

 

 


 

With respect to each of the foregoing Clients where the relationship between
Aston and the ultimate underlying Client is through a financial intermediary
(e.g., a "wrap" sponsor or managed account program sponsor) (each, a "Program
Sponsor"), the Company shall, and shall cause Aston to, send a separate
written notice to each Program Sponsor informing such Program Sponsor of the
Merger and (A) requesting written consent to the assignment or deemed
assignment of such Program Sponsor's master agreement (the "Master
Agreement") with Aston resulting from the Merger (where such Master Agreement
may by its terms and under Applicable Law remain in effect following
consummation of the Merger with such consent of the Program Sponsor), or (B)
requesting such Program Sponsor to enter into a new Master Agreement with
Aston (where the existing Master Agreement will terminate as a result of the
Merger by its terms or under Applicable Law) to be in effect with Aston as
of, and subject to, the Closing on terms substantially identical (and
identical with respect to fee rates) to the terms of Aston's existing Master
Agreement with such Program Sponsor. All notices and related materials
distributed to Program Sponsors shall be in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to Parent, and Parent shall be provided a reasonable opportunity
to review all such notices prior to distribution and to have its reasonable
comments reflected therein. The Company shall make available to Parent copies
of all substantive correspondence between it or any of its Subsidiaries and
Program Sponsors (or their representatives or counsel) relating to the
consent solicitation provided for in this Section 5.4(c)(ii).

 

 

With respect to all other Clients not addressed by the foregoing paragraphs
of this Section 5.4(c)(ii), as promptly as practicable following the date
hereof, the Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to,
deliver written notices to such Clients informing them of the transactions
contemplated hereby that are substantially identical to the Notice; provided,
that consent of such Clients shall not be sought by such written notices
unless required by Applicable Law and/or the terms of the applicable Advisory
Contracts to which such Clients are parties.

 

 

(d) Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the Merger to be treated as a reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and shall not knowingly take or fail to
take any action which action or failure to act would reasonably be expected
to jeopardize the qualification of the Merger as a reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. Unless required by law, none
of Parent, Merger Sub, or the Company shall file any Tax Return or take
any position inconsistent with the treatment of the Merger as a
reorganization described in Section 368(a) of the Code.


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

49  

 

 

 

 

 


 

(e) Each of the parties hereto shall execute any additional instruments
reasonably necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.
Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the parties agree to
use reasonable best efforts to cause the Effective Time to occur as soon
as practicable after the Company stockholder vote with respect to
the Merger. If at any time after the Effective Time any further action
is necessary to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, the proper officers
and directors of each party hereto shall take all such necessary action.

 

 

5.5 Acquisition Proposals. (a) Subject to Sections 5.5(b) and 5.5(c),
the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not (whether directly or indirectly
through Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, advisors,
representatives, agents or other intermediaries), nor shall the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries authorize or permit any of its or their Affiliates,
directors, officers, employees, advisors, representatives, agents or other
intermediaries to, (i) solicit, initiate or take any action to knowingly
facilitate or knowingly encourage the submission of inquiries, proposals or
offers from any Person (as defined below) relating to any Acquisition
Proposal, or agree to or endorse any Acquisition Proposal; (ii) enter into
any agreement to (w) facilitate or further the consummation of, or
consummate, any Acquisition Proposal, (x) facilitate the making of any
inquiry with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, (y) approve or endorse any
Acquisition Proposal or (z) in connection with any Acquisition Proposal,
require it to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the Merger; (iii)
enter into or participate in any discussions or negotiations in
connection with any Acquisition Proposal or inquiry with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal, or furnish to any Person any information with respect
to its business, properties or assets in connection with any Acquisition
Proposal or inquiry with respect to an Acquisition Proposal; or (iv) agree to
resolve or take any of the actions prohibited by clause (i), (ii) or (iii) of
this sentence. The Company and its Subsidiaries shall immediately cease, and
cause its advisors, agents and other intermediaries to immediately cease, any
and all existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any parties
conducted heretofore with respect to any of the foregoing and shall demand
the return or destruction of any information previously provided with respect
to such activities, discussion or negotiations. For purposes of this Section
5.5, the term "Person" means any person, corporation, entity or "group," as
defined in Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act, other than Parent or any
Subsidiaries of Parent.


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

50  

 

 

 

 

 


 

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement to
the contrary, the Board of Directors of the Company, directly or indirectly
through advisors, agents or other intermediaries, may (i) comply with Rule
14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act with regard to any
Acquisition Proposal, (ii) engage in negotiations or discussions with any
Person that has made an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal
not resulting from or arising out of a breach of Section 5.5(a) and (iii)
furnish to such Person nonpublic information relating to the Company or any
of the Subsidiaries pursuant to a confidentiality agreement with terms no
less favorable to the Company than those contained in the Confidentiality
Agreement; provided, that the Board of Directors of the Company (acting upon
the recommendation of the Special Committee) shall be permitted to take an
action described in the foregoing clauses (ii) or (iii) if, and only if,
prior to taking such particular action, the Board of Directors of the Company
(acting upon the recommendation of the Special Committee) has determined in
good faith by a majority vote that (x) such Acquisition Proposal is
reasonably likely to result in a Superior Proposal and (y) after considering
the advice of its outside legal counsel and financial advisor, that failure
to take such particular action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties.

 

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 5.5 or elsewhere in this
Agreement to the contrary but subject to Section 5.5(d), if, at any time
prior to the approval of the Merger and this Agreement by the Company's
stockholders by the Required Company Votes, the Company's Board of Directors
(acting upon the recommendation of the Special Committee) determines in good
faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal
counsel, that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under Applicable Law (whether or not it has received an
Acquisition Proposal), the Company may: (i) withdraw or modify or change in
any manner its approval or recommendation of this Agreement or the Merger (it
being understood that a "stop, look and listen" or similar communication of
the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act shall not be
deemed to constitute such withdrawal, modification or change), and/or (ii)
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(f)(ii), provided that, the
Board of Directors of the Company shall not take any action pursuant to
clause (i) above pursuant to this Section 5.5(c) prior to providing Parent
written notice thereof.

 

 

(d) The Company shall notify Parent promptly (but in any event within 24
hours) after receipt by the Company of (i) any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) any
request for information with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or (iii) any
inquiry, proposal, discussions or negotiation with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal. Any such notice shall include a summary of the
material terms and conditions of any such Acquisition Proposal, request for
information, inquiry, proposal, discussion or negotiation, as well as the
identity of the Person making any of the foregoing. The Company shall keep
Parent reasonably informed of the status and material details of any such
Acquisition Proposal, indication or request, including material amendments or
proposed amendments as to price and other material terms thereof. The
Company shall promptly provide to Parent any non-public information
concerning the Company provided to any other Person in connection with any
Acquisition Proposal that was not previously provided to Parent. Provided
that the Company has received an Acquisition Proposal, the Board of Directors
of the Company shall not take any action under Sections 5.5(c)(i) or (ii)
until after two (2) Business Days following Parent's receipt of written
notice (it being understood and agreed that any amendment to the amount or
form of consideration of an Acquisition Proposal shall require a new notice
and a new two (2) Business Day period) advising Parent that the Company's
Board of Directors (acting upon the recommendation of the Special Committee)
intends to cause the Company to take such action, and that the Company shall,
during such two (2) Business Day period, negotiate in good faith with Parent
to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement such
that any action under Sections 5.5(c)(i) or (ii) is no longer necessary.


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

51  

 

 

 

 

 


 

5.6 Employee Benefits Matters.

 

 

(a) Between the date of this Agreement and the Closing, neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries shall (i) maintain any Company Plan other than
the Company Plans listed on Section 3.1(l)(i) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule (but they shall maintain such Company Plans) or (ii) amend or
terminate any such Company Plans (other than as required by Applicable Laws).
To the extent that any salary, bonus or other compensation or benefits
payable to any of the Aston Management Owners or other employees of the
Company or its Subsidiaries in respect of periods prior to the Closing
(including all of the calendar year in which the Closing occurs through the
Closing) has not been paid in full by the Company or its Subsidiaries prior
to the Closing, then such amounts (including a reasonable discretionary bonus
accrual for each such Person for that portion of the calendar year in which
the Closing occurs that has elapsed prior to the Closing, and for the
immediately preceding calendar year) shall be fully accrued as current
liabilities on the balance sheet of the Company for purposes of
the calculation of the Special Dividend Amount.

 

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, no
provision of this Agreement is intended to, or does (i) prohibit the
Surviving Company or its Affiliates from amending or terminating any Company
Plan in accordance with its terms and Applicable Law, (ii) require the
Surviving Company to keep any person employed for any period of time, or
(iii) constitute the establishment or adoption of, or amendment to, any
Company Plan, and no person participating in any such Company Plan maintained
by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall have any claims or cause of
action, under ERISA or otherwise, in respect of any provisions of this
Agreement as it relates to any such Company Plan or otherwise.

other persons entitled to indemnification under the certificate of
incorporation and by-laws of the Company as in effect on the date hereof, as
well as any indemnification agreements to which the Company is a party with
such directors and officers, against any costs or expenses (including
reasonable attorneys' fees) judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or
liabilities (collectively, "Costs") (but only to the extent such Costs are
not otherwise covered by insurance and paid) incurred in connection with any
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to matters
existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, including the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, whether asserted or claimed
prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the extent the Company would
have been required to do so under the certificate of incorporation and by-
laws of the Company as in effect on the date hereof or under such
indemnification agreements (and Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Company to, also advance expenses as incurred to the fullest extent Parent or
the Surviving Company would have been required to do so under the certificate
of incorporation and by-laws of the Company as in effect on the date hereof
or under such indemnification agreements, provided the person to
whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if
it is finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction that such
person is not entitled to indemnification). Parent shall cause the Surviving
Company to and the Surviving Company shall include and maintain in effect in
its limited liability company agreement or other governing documents for a
period of at least six (6) years from the Closing, the same provisions
regarding elimination of liability of directors and indemnification of
officers, directors, employees and other persons contained in the limited
liability company agreement of Merger Sub as in effect on the date hereof as
set forth in Section 5.8 of the Company Disclosure Schedule. Prior to the
Closing, the Company shall purchase a "tail policy" to extend for a period of
at least six (6) years from the Closing, coverage under the current policies,
in such amounts not less than the existing coverage and retention amounts, of
directors' and officers' liability insurance and fiduciary liability
insurance maintained by the Company with respect to claims arising from facts
or events that occurred on or before the Effective Time; including in respect
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

that no public release or announcement concerning the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be issued by any party without the
prior written consent of the Company and Parent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), except as such release or
announcement may be required by law or the rules or regulations of any
applicable United States securities exchange, in which case the party
required to make the release or announcement shall use its reasonable best
efforts to allow each other party reasonable time to comment on such release
or announcement in advance of such issuance, it being understood that the
final form and content of any such release or announcement, to the extent so
required, shall be at the final discretion of the disclosing party.

5.11 Qualification of the Proprietary Funds. Subject to applicable fiduciary
duties to the Proprietary Funds, the Company will take, and will cause its
Subsidiaries to take, no action (i) that would prevent any Proprietary Fund

marketing materials.

 

 

5.12 Section 15(f) of the Investment Company Act. (a) The Company shall use
reasonable best efforts to assure, prior to the Effective Time, the

such stockholder litigation brought, or threatened, against the Company
and/or the members of its Board of Directors and keep Parent reasonably
informed with respect to the status thereof.

to maintain in full force and effect through the Closing Date all
insurance policies applicable to the Company and its Subsidiaries and their

any provisions in such insurance policies that would allow the insurer to
terminate or adversely modify coverage upon consummation of the Merger.

 

 

5.15 Termination of Certain Agreements. The Company and its Subsidiaries
shall cause each of the agreements set forth in Schedule 5.15 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule to be terminated effective as of immediately prior to

Agreements shall be in full force and effect and shall not have been amended,
and the individuals identified on Section 6.2(d) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule shall be employed by Aston as of the Closing on a full-time basis,
(ii) the Restated LP Agreement shall have become effective, shall remain in
full force and effect, shall not have been amended and shall not have been
breached by the Company or any of the individuals identified on Section
6.2(d) of the Company Disclosure Schedule and the Initial Points (as defined

6.3 Additional Conditions to Obligations of the Company. The obligations of
the Company to effect the Merger are subject to the satisfaction of, or
waiver by the Company, on or prior to the Closing Date of the following
additional conditions:

 

 

(a) Representations and Warranties. The representations and warranties of the
Company set forth in this Agreement shall be true and correct (disregarding
all qualifications or limitations as to "materiality," "Material Adverse
Effect" and words of similar import set forth therein) as of the date hereof
and at and as of the Closing Date as if made at and as of the Closing Date
(except to the extent such representations and warranties expressly relate to
an earlier date, in which case as of such earlier date), except where the
failure of such representations and warranties to be so true and correct
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect. The Company shall have received a certificate of an
executive officer of Parent to the effect of the foregoing.

 

 

(b) Performance of Obligations of Parent. Parent shall have performed in all
material respects and complied in all material respects with all agreements

not have occurred any changes, circumstances or effects that, individually or
in the aggregate, have had or would reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on Parent.

 

 

6.4 Frustration of Closing Conditions. Neither Parent, Merger Sub nor the
Company may rely on the failure of any condition set forth in this Article VI
to be satisfied if such failure was caused by such party's breach of a
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement set forth in this Agreement.

 

 

ARTICLE VII. 

 

 

TERMINATION AND AMENDMENT

 

 

7.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the
Effective Time, by action taken or authorized by the Board of Directors (in
the case of the Company, acting upon the recommendation of the Special
Committee) of the terminating party or parties, and except as provided below,
whether before or after approval of the matters presented in connection with
the Merger by the stockholders of the Company:

 

 

(a) By mutual written consent of Parent and the Company;

 

 

(b) By either the Company or Parent if the Effective Time shall not have
occurred on or before August 13, 2010 (the "Termination Date"); provided,
however, that the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 7.1(b)
shall not be available to any party whose failure to fulfill any obligation
under this Agreement has been a principal cause of, or resulted in, the
failure of the Effective Time to occur on or before the Termination Date and
such action or failure to perform constitutes a breach of this Agreement;

 

 

(c) By either the Company or Parent if any Governmental Authority shall have
issued an order, decree or ruling or taken any other action permanently
restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting or making illegal the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and such order, decree, ruling
or other action shall have become final and nonappealable;

 

 

(d) By either the Company or Parent if the approval by the stockholders of
the Company required for the consummation of the Merger shall not have been
obtained by reason of the failure to obtain the Required Company Votes at the
Company Stockholders Meeting (or any adjournment or postponement thereof);

 

 

(e) By Parent if prior to the Company Stockholder Meeting, the Board of
Directors of the Company (acting upon the recommendation of the Special
Committee) shall have failed to recommend or shall have withdrawn or modified
or changed in a manner adverse to Parent its approval or recommendation of
this Agreement or the Merger or shall have approved or recommended a Superior
Proposal (or the Board of Directors of the Company (acting upon the
recommendation of the Special Committee) resolves to do any of the
foregoing), (ii) the Company shall fail to call or hold the Company
Stockholders Meeting in accordance with Section 5.1(c) or (iii) the Company
shall have breached any of its material obligations under Section 5.5;


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

58  

 

 

 

 

 


 

(f) By the Company (i) if there shall have been a breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of Parent or
Merger Sub contained in this Agreement such that the conditions set forth in
Sections 6.3(a) or 6.3(b) would not be satisfied and (A) such breach is not
reasonably capable of being cured or (B) in the case of a breach of a
covenant or agreement, if such breach is reasonably capable of being cured,
such breach shall not have been cured prior to the earlier of (I) 10 Business
Days following notice of such breach and (II) the Termination Date; provided,
that the Company shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 7.1(f)(i) if the Company is then in material breach
of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained
in this Agreement or (ii) prior to the approval of the Merger and this
Agreement by the Required Company Votes and subject to compliance with the
last sentence of Section 5.5(d) if applicable, the Company's Board of
Directors (acting upon the recommendation of the Special Committee)
determines in good faith after consultation with its financial advisors and
outside legal counsel that failure to terminate this Agreement would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law;

 

 

(g) By Parent if there shall have been a breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of the Company contained in this
Agreement such that the conditions set forth in Sections 6.2(a) or 6.2(b)
would not be satisfied and (A) such breach is not reasonably capable of being
cured or (B) in the case of a breach of a covenant or agreement, if such
breach is reasonably capable of being cured, such breach shall not have been
cured prior to the earlier of (I) 10 Business Days following notice of such
breach and (II) the Termination Date; provided, that Parent shall not have
the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(g)
if Parent or Merger Sub is then in material breach of any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement;

 

 

(h) By Company if a Material Adverse Effect shall have occurred as to Parent,
and by Parent if a Material Adverse Effect shall have occurred as to
the Company.

 

 

7.2 Effect of Termination. (a) In the event of termination of this
Agreement by either the Company or Parent as provided in Section 7.1, this
Agreement shall forthwith become void and there shall be no liability or
obligation on the part of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company or their
respective officers or directors except with respect to the first sentence of
Section 5.3(c), Section 5.7, this Section 7.2 and Article VIII; provided,
that the termination of this Agreement shall not relieve any party from any
liability for fraud or for any willful or intentional breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement in this Agreement occurring
prior to termination.


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

59  

 

 

 

 

 


 

(b) Parent and the Company agree that if the Company or Parent shall
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(d), the Company shall pay to
Parent all of Parent's reasonably documented Expenses, up to an aggregate
amount of $1,000,000 (the "Parent Expenses") within five Business Days after
delivery to the Company of written notice of the amount of such Parent
Expenses. Parent and the Company agree that if: (i) Parent shall terminate
this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(e); or (ii) the Company shall
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(f)(ii); or (iii) if (x) the
Company or Parent shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(d)
or Parent shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(g), (y) at
the time of the event giving rise to such termination there shall exist an
Acquisition Proposal with respect to the Company that has been publicly
disclosed or announced or otherwise disclosed to the Board of Directors (or
Special Committee) of the Company, and (z) within 12 months of the
termination of this Agreement, (I) the Company enters into a definitive
agreement with respect to any Acquisition Proposal (whether or not such
Acquisition Proposal was commenced, publicly disclosed, publicly proposed or
otherwise communicated to the Company prior to such termination) and
such Acquisition Proposal is subsequently consummated or (II) the Company
consummates any Acquisition Proposal (whether or not such Acquisition
Proposal was commenced, publicly disclosed, publicly proposed or otherwise
communicated to the Company prior to such termination), then the Company
shall pay to Parent an amount equal to $3.6 million less any previously paid
Parent Expenses paid by the Company pursuant to the first sentence of this
Section 7.2(b), if any (the "Termination Fee"); provided, that, for purposes
of this Section 7.2(b), the term "Acquisition Proposal" shall have the
meaning assigned to such term in Section 8.11(a), except that the references
to "more than 20%" and "at least 80%" in the definition of "Acquisition
Proposal" shall be deemed to be references to "more than 50%" and "at least
50.1%", respectively.

 

 

(c) The Termination Fee, if any, required to be paid pursuant to Section
7.2(b) shall be paid to Parent at or prior to the time of termination, or if
payable only upon the subsequent consummation by the Company of an
Acquisition Proposal, then at or prior to the time of such event. All
payments under this Section 7.2 shall be made by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account designated by Parent.

 

 

(d) The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section
7.2 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and are not a penalty, and that, without these agreements, Parent would not
enter into this Agreement. If the Company fails to pay promptly the fee due
pursuant to this Section 7.2, the Company will also pay to Parent Parent's
reasonable costs and expenses (including legal fees and expenses) in
connection with any action, including the filing of any lawsuit or other
legal action, taken to collect payment, together with interest on the amount
of the unpaid fee under this Section 7.2, accruing from its due date, at an
interest rate per annum equal to two percentage points in excess of the prime
commercial lending rate quoted by Citibank, N.A. Any change in the interest
rate hereunder resulting from a change in such prime rate will be effective
at the beginning of the date of such change in such prime rate.

7.3 Amendment. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto (or
successors thereto), by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards
of Directors (in the case of the Company, acting upon the recommendation of
the Special Committee), at any time before or after approval of the matters
presented in connection with the Merger by the stockholders of the Company,
but, after any such approval, no amendment shall be made which by law
requires further approval by such stockholders without such further approval.
This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed
on behalf of each of the parties hereto (or successors thereto).

 

 

7.4 Extension; Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the
parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of

Special Committee), may, to the extent legally allowed, (i) extend the time
for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other
parties hereto, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and
warranties contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and
(iii) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained
herein. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or
waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on
behalf of such party. The failure of any party to this Agreement to assert
any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a
waiver of those rights.

index of defined terms and headings contained in this Agreement are for

interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever the words "include", "includes" or
"including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed
by the words "without limitation".

 

 

8.4 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts,
all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become
effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the
parties and delivered to the other party, it being understood that both

62  

 

 

 

 

 


 

8.5 Entire Agreement; No Third Party Beneficiaries. (a) This Agreement
constitutes the entire agreement and supersedes all prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof, other than the Confidentiality Agreements, which shall
survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement.

 

 

(b) This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of
each party hereto, and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is
intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any right, benefit or
remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement, other

Persons covered thereby and may be enforced by such Persons).

 

 

8.6 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed and construed
in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the laws

invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any law or public policy,
all other terms and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in
full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the

adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other
provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties
hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect
the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable
manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated as
originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible.

 

 

8.8 Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties hereto, in
whole or in part (whether by operation of law or otherwise), without the
prior written consent of the other party, and any attempt to make any such
assignment without such consent shall be null and void, except that Merger
Sub may assign, in its sole discretion, any or all of its rights, interests
and obligations under this Agreement to any wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent
without the consent of the Company, but no such assignment shall relieve
Parent or Merger Sub of any of its obligations under this Agreement. Subject
to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the
benefit of and be enforceable by the parties and their respective successors
and assigns.

the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms. It is accordingly agreed that the
parties shall be entitled to specific performance of the terms hereof, this
being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in
equity. In addition and notwithstanding any prior agreement of the parties to
the contrary, each of the parties hereto (i) consents to submit itself to the
personal jurisdiction of any court of the United States located in the State
of Delaware or of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware in the event

personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such

Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any court
other than a court of the United States located in the State of Delaware or
the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware.

to terminate its Advisory Contract or investment relationship with Aston
(whether such termination is to occur prior to or following the Closing), or
(y) such Client's objection (or other non-consent) to the assignment or
deemed assignment of its Advisory Contract resulting from the Merger, shall
be deemed not to have provided its Consent for any purpose under this
Agreement;

 

 

provided, further, that in any of the foregoing cases (i)-(iv), no Client
shall be deemed to have given its Consent if after the Base Date and prior to
the Closing the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
directors, officers, members of the board of managers, partners, employees,
representatives or agents has agreed or entered into an understanding to cap,
reduce, waive, reimburse or otherwise modify the fees payable by (or in
respect of) such Client in connection with obtaining such Client's consent to
the Merger (other than any such effective fee reductions that are disclosed
to Parent in writing prior to the Closing); and
