(a) Not more than five Business Days, but in no event less than one Business
Day, before the Closing, the Sellers shall prepare and deliver to the
Purchaser an unaudited combined balance sheet of the Business and a statement
setting forth the Sellers estimate of Working Capital of the Business (the "
_Estimated Working Capital_ ") as of the close of business on October 30, 2011
( _provided_ , _however_ , that the Sellers estimate of accrued property
taxes shall be as of the Closing Date). The Cash Consideration payable at the
Closing will be decreased by the amount by which Estimated Working Capital is
less than $9,800,000; if the Estimated Working Capital exceeds $9,800,000
there will be no adjustment to the Cash Consideration and the Purchaser will
be entitled to the benefit of such excess without payment of any additional

(b) Within 45 days after the Closing Date, the Sellers will prepare, or cause
to be prepared, and deliver to the Purchaser an unaudited balance sheet of the
Business and a statement (the " _Statement of Working Capital_ ") setting
forth the Sellers calculation of the Working Capital, in each case as of the
close of business on the day immediately preceding the Closing Date (the "
_Closing Working Capital_ ").

 

(c) Upon receipt from the Sellers, the Purchaser shall have 30 days to review
the Statement of Working Capital (the " _Review Period_ "). If the Purchaser
disagrees with the

 



13  Sellers computation of Closing Working Capital, the Purchaser may, on or
prior to the last day of the Review Period, deliver a notice to the Sellers
(the " _Notice of Objection_ "), which sets forth its objections to the
Sellers calculation of Closing Working Capital; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the Notice of Objection shall include only objections based on (i) non-
compliance with the accounting principles used in preparation of the
illustrative calculation of Working Capital set forth on _Section 1.1(c) of
the Sellers Disclosure Schedule_ or (ii) mathematical errors in the
computation of Closing Working Capital. Any Notice of Objection shall specify
those items or amounts with which the Purchaser disagrees, together with a
detailed explanation of the reasons for disagreement with each such item or
amount, and shall set forth the Purchasers calculation of Closing Working
Capital based on such objections. To the extent not set forth in the Notice of
Objection, the Purchaser shall be deemed to have agreed with the Sellers
calculation of all other items and amounts contained in the Statement
of Working Capital.

(d) Unless the Purchaser delivers the Notice of Objection to the Sellers
within the Review Period, the Purchaser shall be deemed to have accepted the
Sellers calculation of Closing Working Capital and the Statement of Working
Capital shall be final, conclusive and binding on the parties hereto. If the
Purchaser delivers the Notice of Objection to the Sellers within the Review
Period, the Sellers and the Purchaser shall, during the 30 days following such
delivery or any mutually agreed extension of such time period, use their
commercially reasonable efforts to reach agreement on the disputed items and
amounts in order to determine the amount of Closing Working Capital. If, at
the end of such period or any mutually agreed extension thereof, the Purchaser
and the Sellers are unable to resolve their disagreements, they shall jointly
retain and refer their disagreements to KPMG (the " _Independent Expert_ ")
or, if such firm is unwilling or unable so to act, each of the Purchaser and
the Seller shall select one such firm and those two firms shall select
a third firm, which third firm shall be the "Independent Expert". The parties
shall instruct the Independent Expert promptly to review this Section 2.6 and
to determine, solely with respect to the disputed items and amounts
so submitted, whether and to what extent, if any, the Closing Working Capital
set forth in the Statement of Working Capital requires adjustment. The
Independent Expert shall base its determination solely on written submissions
by the Purchaser and the Sellers and not on an independent review. The
Purchaser and the Sellers shall make available to the Independent Expert all
relevant books and records and other items reasonably requested by the
Independent Expert. The parties shall request that the Independent Expert
deliver to the Purchaser and the Sellers, as promptly as practicable but in no
event later than 45 days after its retention, a written report that sets forth
its resolution of the disputed items and amounts and its calculation of
Closing Working Capital; _provided_ , _however_ , that with respect to each
disputed item in relation to the computation of the Closing Working Capital,
the Independent Expert shall adopt the position of either the Sellers or the
Purchaser with respect to such item. The decision of the Independent Expert
shall be final, conclusive and binding on the parties. The costs and expenses
of the Independent Expert shall be allocated between the parties based upon
the percentage which the portion of the contested amount not awarded to each
party bears to the amount actually contested by such party. Each party hereto
agrees to execute, if requested by the Independent Expert, a customary
engagement letter, including customary indemnities in favor of the
Independent Expert.

 



14 (e) Within three Business Days after Closing Working Capital has been finally
determined pursuant to this Section 2.6:

(i) if the Closing Working Capital is less than the Estimated Working Capital,
the Sellers shall pay to the Purchaser, as an adjustment to the Purchase
Price, in the manner and with interest as provided in Section 2.6(f), an
amount of cash equal to the difference between the Estimated Working Capital
and Closing Working Capital; or

(ii) if the Closing Working Capital exceeds the Estimated Working Capital, the
Purchaser shall pay to the Sellers, in the manner and with interest as
provided in Section 2.6(f), an amount of cash equal to the difference between
(A) the lesser of (1) the Closing Working Capital or (2) $9,800,000 and (B)
the Estimated Working Capital.

(f) Any payment required to be made pursuant to Section 2.6(e) shall be made
by the party required to make such payment by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account designated in writing by the party entitled to
receive such payment at least one Business Day prior to such transfer. The
amount of any such payment shall bear interest from and including the Closing
Date to but excluding the date of payment at a rate per annum equal to the
"prime rate" as published in the Wall Street Journal, Eastern Edition, in
effect from time to time during the period from the Closing Date to but
excluding the date of payment. Such interest shall be calculated daily on the
basis of a year of 365 days and the actual number of days elapsed, without
compounding.

 

2.7 _Allocation of Purchase Price_. The parties hereto shall use their
commercially reasonable efforts during the 120 days following the Closing
Date to reach agreement on a reasonable allocation of the consideration for
the Purchased Assets to the various categories of Purchased Assets in
accordance with their respective fair market values. If the parties reach
such agreement, each shall execute and file all Tax Returns (including Form
8594) in a manner consistent with the allocation determined pursuant to this
Section 2.7. Such agreement shall not be a condition to Closing. In the event
that the parties do not agree to a purchase price allocation then each party
shall file its Tax Returns in the manner each party in good faith deems
appropriate.

2.8 _Consents_. The Purchaser acknowledges that consents and waivers with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements may be required from parties to Contracts to which one or more of
the Sellers is a party, including certain of the Contracts listed on the
_Sellers Disclosure Schedule_ , or with respect to other assets, and that such
consents and waivers may not be obtained. The Sellers agree (x) to give
required notices to third parties, and (y) to use commercially reasonable
efforts for a period of up to three months after the Closing, to obtain all
such third-party consents. The Sellers and the Purchaser shall cooperate
in any reasonable arrangement pursuant to which the Sellers shall, to the
greatest extent permitted by Law and any such Contract (including by acting as
an agent of the Purchaser), hold such Contract or any claim, right or benefit
arising thereunder or resulting therefrom in trust for the benefit of the
Purchaser such that the Purchaser receive the interest of the Sellers in the
benefits therefrom, net of any reasonable expenses incurred by the Seller or
any Affiliate thereof in connection with such arrangement until such time as
such authorization, approval, consent or waiver is obtained. The Purchaser
agrees that: (a) the Sellers shall not have any liability to the Purchaser
arising out of or relating to the failure to obtain any consents or waivers
that may be required in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements or because of the termination of any
Contract as a result 

 



15  thereof; and (b) no representation, warranty or covenant of the Sellers
contained herein shall be breached or deemed breached, and no condition shall
be deemed not satisfied, as a result of (i) the failure to obtain any such
consent or waiver, (ii) any such termination or (iii) any lawsuit, action,
proceeding or investigation commenced or threatened by or on behalf of any
person arising out of or relating to the failure to obtain any such consent
or any such termination. Notwithstanding that any such consent is not obtained
prior to the Closing, the Closing shall take place on the terms set forth
herein.

and effect and constitute the legal, valid and binding obligations of the
Purchaser and the other parties thereto. There are no conditions precedent or
other contingencies related to the funding of the full amount of the Financing
(including any "flex" provisions) other than as expressly set forth in the
Financing Commitments. The aggregate proceeds to be disbursed pursuant to the
agreements contemplated by the Financing Commitments will be sufficient for
the Purchaser to pay the Cash Consideration and all related fees and expenses.
No event has occurred which would result in any breach or violation of or
constitute a default (or an event which with notice or lapse of time or both
would become a default) by the Purchaser under the Financing Commitments, and
the Purchaser does not have any reason to believe that any of the conditions
to the Financing will not be satisfied or that the Financing will not be
available to the Purchaser on the Closing Date. The Purchaser has fully paid
all commitment and other fees required to be paid on or prior to the date
hereof pursuant to the Financing Commitments. The obligations of the
Purchaser hereunder are not subject to any conditions regarding the ability of
the Purchaser or any Affiliate thereof to obtain financing for the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

5.7 _Brokers or Finders_. No broker, finder or investment banker is entitled
to any brokerage, finders or other fee or commission in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement based upon arrangements made by or
on behalf of the Purchaser.

5.8 _Approvals_. No fact or circumstance exists, including any current holding
and any transaction under consideration by the Purchaser or any of the
entities under common management control with the Purchaser, that would
reasonably be expected to prevent or delay the filings or approvals required
under the HSR Act or any Other Antitrust Laws.

Business in a manner substantially consistent with current practices. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, during such period, except as

shall do any of the following, in each case with respect to the Business,
without the consent of the Purchaser (which shall not be unreasonably

otherwise) any Person or business; or

(f) agree in writing to take any of the foregoing actions. 

6.2 _Access to Information; Investigation_. Each Seller shall afford to the
Purchaser, its accountants and other representatives reasonable access, upon
reasonable advance notice during normal business hours prior to the Closing,
to the Senior Management, properties, books, Contracts and records of the
Business; _provided_ , _however_ , that such access complies with applicable
Law, Permitted Liens and Contracts of the Business and does not disrupt the
normal operations of the Business; and _provided_ , _further_ , that the
Purchaser shall not (a) have access to individual performance or evaluation
records, medical histories or other information (in any form whatsoever,
including through oral conversations) that in the Sellers opinion is
sensitive or the disclosure of which could reasonably be expected to subject
the Sellers to risk of liability, (b) have access to documents or information
which, in the opinion of the Sellers, could jeopardize attorney-client
privilege, and (c) be entitled to conduct any invasive sampling or testing
with respect to any Real Property (including with respect to groundwater,
soil, air, asbestos, surface water or sediment).

 



30 6.3 _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Sellers will give prompt written
notice to the Purchaser of any fact, event or occurrence which, if existing
or known as of the date hereof, would have been required to be set forth or
described in the _Sellers Disclosure Schedule_. No such disclosure by the
Sellers pursuant to this Section 6.3 shall be deemed to amend or supplement
the _Sellers Disclosure Schedule_ for the purpose of determining the
satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Sections 7.2(a) and (b);
_provided_ , _however_ , that if the Closing occurs the _Sellers Disclosure
Schedule_ shall be deemed amended and supplemented by any such disclosure of a
fact, event or occurrence that is non-material (provided that all such
disclosures are not in the aggregate material) or that occurs after the date
of this Agreement for all purposes, including determining the rights of the
Purchaser to indemnification pursuant to Article IX.

6.4 _Confidentiality_. From and after the Closing Date until the second
anniversary thereof, except as required by applicable Law, each Seller will,
and will cause its Affiliates to, hold, and will use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cause its and their respective representatives to hold,
in confidence any and all information, whether written or oral, concerning the
Business, the Purchased Assets and the other parties, except to the extent
that such information (a) is in the public domain through no fault of such
Seller or any of its Affiliates or their respective representatives or (b) is
lawfully acquired by such Seller or any of its Affiliates after the
Closing Date from sources that are not prohibited from disclosing such
information by a legal, contractual or fiduciary obligation. If a Seller or
any of its Affiliates or representatives is compelled to disclose any such
information by judicial or administrative process or by other requirements of
Law, such Seller shall promptly notify the Purchaser and shall disclose only
that portion of such information that is legally required to be disclosed;
_provided_ that such Seller shall exercise its commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain an appropriate protective order or other reasonable
assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded such information.

 

6.5 _Regulatory Approvals_.

(a) The Purchaser and the appropriate Seller shall each promptly apply for,
and take all reasonably necessary actions to obtain or make, as applicable,
all Orders and Permits of, and all filings with, any Governmental Entity or
other Person required to be obtained or made by it for the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each party shall cooperate with
and promptly furnish information to the other party necessary in connection
with any requirements imposed upon such other party in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, if required, the Purchaser and the
appropriate Seller shall make an appropriate filing required of each of them
(i) pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated
hereby within ten Business Days following the execution of this Agreement (if
not already made), which filings shall not request early termination of the
waiting period prescribed by the HSR Act, and (ii) pursuant to any applicable
Other Antitrust Laws with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby
prior to any legal deadline and in any event within ten Business Days
following the execution of this Agreement (or, if required to do so, submit
the draft filing at that time). The Purchaser and the Sellers shall each be
responsible for one-half of all filing and similar fees payable in connection
with such filings and for any local counsel fees.

(b) Each of the Purchaser and the Sellers agrees to instruct its respective
counsel to cooperate with each other and use their respective commercially
reasonable efforts to facilitate and expedite the identification and
resolution of any issues arising under the HSR Act 

 



31  and any Other Antitrust Laws at the earliest practicable dates. Such efforts
and cooperation include, counsels undertaking (to the extent permitted by Law
and in each case regarding the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and without waiving attorney-client or any other applicable privilege) to (i)
furnish to each others counsel such necessary information and reasonable
assistance as the other may request in connection with its preparation of any
filing or submission that is necessary under the HSR Act and any Other
Antitrust Laws, (ii) permit the other party to review and incorporate the
other partys reasonable comments in any filings or other communication given
by it to any Governmental Entity or in connection with any proceeding by a
private party related to the HSR Act or any Other Antitrust Laws. None of the
Purchaser and the Sellers nor any of their respective counsel
shall independently contact any Governmental Entity or participate in any
meeting or discussion (or any other communication by any means ) with any
Governmental Entity in respect of any such filings, applications,
investigation or other inquiry without giving, in the case of the Purchaser,
the appropriate Seller, and in the case of the Sellers, the Purchaser, prior
reasonable notice of the meeting or discussion, the opportunity to confer with
each other regarding appropriate contacts with and responses to personnel of
said Governmental Entity, the opportunity to review and agree to the contents
of any representations (oral or otherwise) expected to be communicated at the
meeting or discussion, and, to the extent permitted by the
relevant Governmental Entity, the opportunity to attend and participate at
the meeting or discussion (which, at the request of Parent or the Company, as
applicable, shall be limited to outside antitrust counsel only).

 

6.6 _Public Announcements_. Neither the Purchaser nor the Sellers shall issue
any press releases or otherwise make any public statements with respect to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement without the prior consent of
the other; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Purchaser or the Sellers may,
without such approval, make such press releases or other public announcement
as it believes are required pursuant to any listing agreement with any
national securities exchange or stock market or applicable securities Laws, in
which case the party required to make the release or announcement shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to allow the other party reasonable time
to comment on such release or announcement in advance of such issuance.

6.7 _Names_. Reasonably promptly following the Closing Date, the Sellers shall
execute and file all such executed documents as may be required to change the
name of any Seller, the name of which includes the name of any Purchased
Publication to a name that does not include such words.

6.8 _Employees_.

 

(a) Excluding employees who are part of a collective bargaining unit, all of
whom shall be hired by the Purchaser, not less than five days prior to the
Closing, the Purchaser will provide to the Sellers a list of Business
Employees that the Purchaser does not intend to make offers of employment to.
Such list will be prepared without any further access to individuals or
personnel records than the Purchaser has had prior to the date hereof. The
number of individuals on such list will not exceed 10% of the combined number
of Business Employees as of the date of this Agreement and will not include a
number of the combined number of Business Employees at any single or combined
site of employment that would create any obligation or liability to any
Business Employee under WARN.

 



32 (b) The Purchaser will make offers of employment to all of the Business
Employees that are not on the list provided pursuant to Section 6.8(a) to
commence effective upon the Closing. Such offer of employment shall be at
comparable wage rates or base salary and bonus levels as are identified in
Section 4.16(a), and, if at a location different from the Business Employees
current location of employment with the applicable Seller, at a commuting
distance no greater than 50 miles farther each way than the Business
Employees current commuting distance. With respect to each Business Employee
who accepts the Purchasers offer of employment (a " _Transferred Employee_
"), the Purchaser shall credit periods of service prior to the Closing for
purposes of determining eligibility, vesting and benefit entitlement under
all compensation and benefit plans, programs and policies maintained by the
Purchaser after the Closing. In determining which Business Employees will be
offered employment, the Purchaser shall, and shall cause its employers and
representatives to, comply with all applicable Laws. Within a reasonable time
prior to the Closing, the Purchaser shall provide to the Sellers, in a manner
and form satisfactory to the Sellers, the complete terms of offers
of employment (including period of employment, location of employment,
compensation, benefits, job title and responsibility) that the Purchaser has
made or will make to any Business Employee, including copies of any writings
directed to such Business Employee, transcripts of any oral presentations or
discussions, as well as proof of any acceptance, and subsequent hiring and
employment status, of any such Business Employee. Not later than the Closing
Date, the Sellers will provide to the Purchaser such information with respect
to each Transferred Employee as may be reasonably necessary to permit the
Purchaser to comply with its covenants in this Section 6.8 with respect to the
Transferred Employees.

 

(c) The Purchaser further agrees that it will not engage in any action within
90 days following the Closing that will create any obligation or liability
under WARN to any Business Employee or Transferred Employee, including
terminating in excess of 49 Transferred Employees at any single or combined
site of employment, less the number of Business Employees terminated by any
Seller at any such single or combined site of employment, other than for
cause, in the 90-day period prior to the Closing.

 

(d) Without limiting the scope of Section 6.8(b), the Purchaser shall cause
each Transferred Employee (and his or her eligible dependents) to be covered
on the first day of the calendar month following the Closing by a group health
plan (within the meaning of section 5000(b)(1) of the Code) that (i) does not
limit or exclude coverage on the basis of any pre-existing condition of such
Transferred Employee or dependent, (ii) provides each Transferred Employee
full credit, for the year during which the Closing occurs, with any deductible
already incurred by a Transferred Employee under the Sellers group health
plan and with any other out-of-pocket expenses that count against any maximum
out-of-pocket expense provision of the Sellers or the Purchasers group
health plan, and (iii) except as set forth in _Section 6.8(d) of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule_, provides health benefits that are comparable to the
benefits identified in Section 4.15(a). The Sellers shall remain responsible
for all claims incurred by Transferred Employees prior to the first day of
the calendar month following Closing under the Sellers group health plans
and the Purchaser shall be responsible for all claims incurred on and after
the Closing under its group health plans. For purposes of clarity, a claim
shall be considered incurred when the treatment for a given condition is
provided, and not when the condition arose.

 



33 (e) Effective as of the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall establish a health
flexible spending arrangement under Section 125 of the Code (the " _Health
FSA_ ") or shall amend its existing Health FSA, to provide coverage to any
Transferred Employee who participated in the Sellers Health FSA immediately
prior to the Closing Date. The Purchasers Health FSA will provide the same
level of coverage as under the Sellers Health FSA, will treat each such
Transferred Employee as if his or her participation had been continuous from
the beginning of the Sellers Health FSAs plan year, will apply such
Transferred Employees existing salary reduction elections to the Purchasers
Health FSA and will provide for reimbursement of expenses incurred at any time
during the remainder of the Sellers Health FSAs plan year (including with
respect to claims incurred prior to the Closing Date) up to the amount of the
Transferred Employees election and reduced by amounts previously reimbursed
by the Sellers. In the event that, as of the Closing Date, the aggregate
amount withheld from the Transferred Employees compensation with respect to
the Sellers Health FSA exceeds the amount reimbursed to the Transferred
Employees, such excess amount shall be treated as a current liability in the
determination of Closing Working Capital and reduce the amount of the Closing
Working Capital. In the event that, as of the Closing Date, the aggregate
amount withheld from the Transferred Employees compensation with respect to
the Sellers Health FSA is less than the amount reimbursed to the Transferred
Employees, the amount of such deficit shall be treated as a current asset in
the determination of Closing Working Capital and increase the amount of the
Closing Working Capital. The Sellers will provide the Purchaser with all
information reasonably necessary to enable the Purchaser to treat such
Transferred Employees as if they participated continuously in the
Purchasers Health FSA for the calendar year in which the Closing takes
place. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this subsection shall not apply to any
Transferred Employee who elects to continue coverage under the Sellers Health
FSA pursuant to the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985,
as amended.

(f) Effective as of the Closing, the Purchaser shall establish a defined
contribution plan with a 401(k) feature, or cause an existing defined
contribution plan with a 401(k) feature, to cover the Transferred Employees
who are not subject to a collective bargaining agreement. The Purchaser
shall permit such Transferred Employees to rollover any distribution from the
Sellers defined contribution plan to its defined contribution plan. The
Purchaser shall permit any Transferred Employee who is a participant in the
Sellers defined contribution plan and who has a loan outstanding as of the
date of the Closing to rollover the note evidencing the loan in-kind, provided
that such rollover is made within 60 days following the Closing.

 

(g) With respect to Transferred Employees who are included in any collective
bargaining unit covered by a collective bargaining agreement that is set
forth in _Section 6.8(g) of the Sellers Disclosure Schedule_ (the "
_Collective Bargaining Agreements_ "), on the Closing Date, the Purchaser
shall assume the Collective Bargaining Agreements as they relate to
such Transferred Employees and shall (or, if applicable, shall cause one of
its Subsidiaries to) agree and become party to and be bound by the terms and
conditions, including existing seniority dates, of the Collective Bargaining
Agreements, including the obligation of the Purchaser to recognize the
relevant organization as a collective bargaining agent, the obligation to
apply the terms and conditions of the Collective Bargaining Agreements to the
Transferred Employees regardless of the number of hours the Transferred
Employees are scheduled to work, the duty to continue existing wages, hours
and terms and conditions of employment consistent with Sections 8(a)(5) and
8(d) of the National Labor Relations Act, as amended, 29 U.S.C. Sections
158(a)(5) and 158(d), including the obligation to contribute to the Benefit
Plans set forth on _Section 4.15(a) of the Sellers Disclosure Schedule_.

 



34 (h) The provisions of this Section 6.8 are solely for the benefit of the
respective parties to this Agreement and nothing in this Section 6.8, express
or implied, shall confer upon any Business Employee, or legal representative
or beneficiary thereof, any rights or remedies, including any right to
employment or continued employment for any specified period, or compensation
or benefits of any nature or kind whatsoever under this Agreement.

(i) If the Sellers as of the Closing Date incur Liability for NYT Severance
Benefits of less than $3,000,000 (the " _Severance Cap_ ") with respect to
Business Employees to whom the Purchaser does not make an offer of employment
in accordance with Section 6.8(b) (collectively, " _Severance Costs_ "), the
Cash Consideration shall be reduced at Closing as set forth in Section 2.5 by
the difference between the Severance Cap and the amount of such
severance costs (such difference, if any, the " _Severance Adjustment_ ").
Not fewer than two days prior to Closing, the Sellers will provide the
Purchaser with a schedule detailing their calculation of the Severance
Adjustment.

 

6.9 _Taxes_.

(a) The Sellers, on the one hand, and the Purchaser, on the other hand, shall
each pay 50% of all federal, state and local sales and use, documentary and
real estate and other transfer taxes, if any, due as a result of the
purchase, sale or transfer of the Purchased Assets in accordance herewith,
whether imposed by Law on the Sellers or the Purchaser; _provided_ , _however_
, that the Purchaser shall pay 100% of any such taxes that are attributable
or with respect to a loan or mortgage (including the recording or filing of
any related documentation). The Purchaser and the Sellers shall cooperate in
the preparation, execution and filing of all Tax Returns regarding any
transfer taxes which become payable as a result of the transfer of the
Purchased Assets from the Sellers to Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement.

(b) All real property Taxes, personal property Taxes and similar ad valorem
obligations levied with respect to the Purchased Assets for a taxable period
that includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date shall be apportioned
between the Sellers and the Purchaser as of the Closing Date based on the
number of days of such taxable period included in the period ending with and
including the Closing Date (with respect to any such taxable period, the "
_Pre-Closing Tax Period_ "), and the number of days of such taxable period
beginning after the Closing Date (with respect to any such taxable period, the
" _Post-Closing Tax Period_ "). The Sellers shall be liable for
the proportionate amount of such Taxes that is attributable to the Pre-
Closing Tax Period, and the Purchaser shall be liable for the proportionate
amount of such Taxes that is attributable to the Post-Closing Period. If bills
for such Taxes have not been issued as of the Closing Date and if the amount
of such Taxes for the period including the Closing Date is not then known, the
apportionment of such Taxes shall be made at Closing on the basis of the prior
periods Taxes. After Closing, upon receipt of bills for the period including
the Closing Date, adjustments to the apportionment shall be made by the
parties, so that if either party paid more than its proper share at the
Closing, the other party shall promptly reimburse such party for the excess
amount paid by such party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent the
apportionment of any Taxes is included as part of the purchase price
adjustment pursuant to Section 2.6, any amount so included will not be
subject to the apportionment described in this Section 6.9(b).

 



35 (c) The Purchaser and the Sellers agree to furnish or cause to be furnished to
each other, upon request, as promptly as practicable, such information and
assistance relating to the Business, the Purchased Assets and Assumed
Liabilities (including access to books and records) as is reasonably necessary
for the filing of all Tax Returns, the making of any election relating to
Taxes, the preparation for any audit by any Taxing Authority, and the
prosecution or defense of any Action relating to any Tax. Any expenses
incurred in furnishing such information or assistance shall be borne by the
party requesting it.

(d) The Purchaser shall prepare and file any Local Tax Returns of the Sellers
due after the Closing Date (including any final returns, as appropriate) for
(i) taxable periods ending after the Closing Date or which include the Closing
Date or (ii) the last taxable period ending prior to the Closing Date if the
Tax Return is due after the Closing Date. Such Local Tax Returns will be
prepared consistent with prior practice. The Sellers will reimburse the
Purchaser for any Taxes shown due on such returns to the extent that such
Taxes are not Assumed Liabilities under Sections 2.3 and 2.4. Prior to filing
any Local Tax Returns in accordance with this Section 6.9(d), the Purchaser
will provide the Sellers a copy of any such returns for their review and
comment, which comments shall be incorporated into such Local Tax Returns
prior to filing. After the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall control on the
Sellers behalf any tax audits with respect to Local Tax Returns of the
Sellers (including the Florida voluntary sales tax audit disclosed in 
_Section 4.6 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule_), and will cooperate with the
applicable taxing authority to reach a resolution of any such audit. The
Purchaser shall (x) keep the Sellers informed of the status of any such audit,
and (y) will not agree to a settlement or resolution without the Sellers
prior written consent. The Sellers shall be responsible for the liability
resulting from such audit to the extent that such liability is not an Assumed
Liability. 

6.10 _Bulk Sales Laws_. The Purchaser and the Sellers hereby waive compliance
by the Sellers and the Purchaser with the bulk sales Laws and any other
similar Laws in any applicable jurisdiction in respect of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements.

6.11 _Access to Books and Records_. Each of the Sellers and the Purchaser
shall preserve until the seventh anniversary of the Closing Date all records
possessed or to be possessed by such party relating to any of the assets,
Liabilities or business of the Business prior to the Closing. After the
Closing Date, where there is a legitimate business purpose, such party shall
provide the other party with reasonable access, upon prior reasonable written
request specifying the need therefor, during regular business hours, to (a)
the officers and employees of such party and (b) the books of account and
records of such party, but, in each case, only to the extent relating to
the assets, Liabilities or business of the Business prior to the Closing, and
the other party and its representatives shall have the right to make copies of
such books and records at their sole cost; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
foregoing right of access shall not be exercisable in such a manner as to
interfere unreasonably with the normal operations and business of such party.
Such records may nevertheless be destroyed by a party if such party sends to
the other party written notice of its intent to destroy records, specifying
with particularity the contents of the records to be destroyed. Such records
may then be destroyed after the 60th day after such notice is given unless the
other party objects to the destruction, in which case the party seeking to
destroy the records shall deliver such records to the objecting party at the
objecting partys cost.

 



36 6.12 _Further Assurances_. The Purchaser and the Sellers shall execute such
documents and other instruments and take such further actions as may be
reasonably required or desirable to carry out the provisions of this Agreement
and the Ancillary Agreements and to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions hereof, the
Purchaser and the Sellers shall each use their respective commercially
reasonable efforts to take or cause to be taken all actions and to do or cause
to be done all other things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and
make effective as promptly as practicable the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements. If requested by the Sellers, the
Purchaser will provide written confirmation to the other parties to any
Assigned Contract of the Purchasers assumption thereof in the form required
by such Assigned Contract or otherwise reasonably requested by the Sellers. If
at any time after the Closing: (a) any Seller receives any cash in respect
of any Purchased Assets, such Seller shall remit such cash to the Purchaser
or its designee promptly following such receipt; and (b) the Purchaser or any
Subsidiary thereof receives any cash in respect of any Excluded Asset, the
Purchaser or such Subsidiary shall remit such amount to NYT or its designee
promptly following such receipt.

6.13 _Financing_. The Purchaser shall not take any action that could make the
Financing unavailable or its overall cash resources to fund the Cash
Consideration and the other fees and expenses associated with the transactions
contemplated hereby insufficient for any reason. The Purchaser shall use its
best efforts to consummate the Financing, including (a) satisfying the terms,
conditions, representations and warranties set forth in any documents
governing the Financing, and (b) enforcing its rights under the Financing
Commitments. The Purchaser shall keep the Seller apprised as to the status of
the Financing and shall promptly notify the Seller if it becomes aware of any
fact or circumstance that could make such Financing unavailable or
its overall cash resources insufficient to fund the Cash Consideration and
the other fees and expenses associated with the transactions contemplated
hereby for any reason. Without the prior written consent of the Sellers, the
Purchaser will not amend or modify or consent to any amendment or
modification of any Debt Financing Agreement that has the effect of reducing
the amount funded under any Debt Financing Agreement, amending or modifying
any condition precedent contained in any Debt Financing Agreement, or
delaying the Closing.

6.14 _Support Services_. Except as set forth in the Transition Services
Agreement, the Purchaser agrees that as of the Closing Date, the Sellers and
their respective Affiliates shall have no obligation to provide any support or
other services to the Business (including any of the services for which
allocations were previously paid by the Business).

6.15 _Lease Guaranty_. The Purchaser shall assume all obligations of
reimbursement under each guaranty by any Seller or any of its Affiliates for
any Leased Real Property and use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
from the applicable beneficiary a full release of all parties liable, directly
or indirectly, for reimbursement in connection with such guaranty. To the
extent the Purchaser is unable, notwithstanding its compliance with the
immediately preceding sentence, to obtain such release, the Purchaser shall
indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Sellers and their
respective Affiliates against, and reimburse the Sellers and their respective
Affiliates for, any and all Losses in connection with such guaranty, and shall
in any event promptly reimburse the Sellers and their respective Affiliates to
the extent such guaranty is called upon and any of the Sellers or any of
their Affiliates makes any payment thereunder.

 



37 6.16 _Noncompetition and Related Covenants_.

 

(a) For a period of three years after the Closing Date, no Seller or any
Affiliate thereof will invest in, own, manage, operate, finance, control,
advise or guarantee the obligations of any Person whose principal purpose is
gathering and disseminating local news content that is targeted to those
individual markets that the Business presently serves; _provided_ , _however_
, that in no event shall any of the following be deemed a breach or violation
of this Section 6.16: (i) ownership of less than 10% of any publicly traded
company; (ii) investing in, owning, managing, operating, financing,
controlling, advising or guaranteeing the obligations of any Person whose
business operates at a national level, even if a portion of that business
competes in the individual markets that the Business presently serves; or
(iii) any current activity of any Seller or any Affiliate other than the
activities of the Business.

(b) For a period of two years after the Closing Date, no Seller or any
Affiliate thereof will induce or attempt to induce any individual who is then
an employee or independent contractor of the Purchaser to leave the employ or
service, as applicable, of the Purchaser, or in any way knowingly
interfere with the relationship between the Purchaser, on the one hand, and
any such employee or independent contractor thereof, on the other hand;
_provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this Section 6.16 shall prohibit any
Seller or any Affiliate thereof from engaging in any general employment
solicitation (including solicitations through recruiting firms and the
Internet), or from hiring any individual who responds to any such
solicitations.

 

(c) If a final judgment of a court or tribunal of competent jurisdiction
determines that any term or provision contained in this Section 6.16 is
invalid or unenforceable, then the parties agree that the court or tribunal
will have the power to reduce the scope, duration or geographic area of the
term or provision, to delete specific words or phrases or to replace
any invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a term or provision that
is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of
the invalid or unenforceable term or provision. This Section 6.16 will be
enforceable as so modified after the expiration of the time within which the
judgment may be appealed ( _provided_ , for the purpose of clarity, that in no
event shall this Section 6.16 be binding upon any Seller or any Affiliate
thereof following the third anniversary of the Closing Date in the case of
Section 6.16(a), or the second anniversary of the Closing Date in the case of
Section 6.16(b) (or, if the term of this Section 6.16 is reduced by such court
or tribunal, following the expiration of such modified term). This Section
6.16 is reasonable and necessary to protect and preserve the Purchasers
legitimate business interests and the value of the Business.

 

6.17 _Exclusivity_ __. From the date hereof until the Closing, the Sellers
will not (a) solicit, initiate or encourage the submission of any proposal
or offer from any Person relating to the acquisition of any capital stock or
other voting securities, or any substantial portion of the assets, of any
Seller (including any acquisition structured as a merger, consolidation, or
share exchange) or (b) participate in any discussions or negotiations
regarding, furnish any information with respect to, assist or participate in,
or facilitate in any other manner any effort or attempt by any Person to do
or seek any of the foregoing.

 



38 6.18 _Maintenance of Real Property_. From the date hereof until the
Closing: (a) the Sellers shall maintain the Owned Real Property, including
all of the Improvements, in substantially the same manner as is currently
maintained as of the date of this Agreement, ordinary wear and tear and
casualty damage excepted; (b) Sellers shall maintain the Leased Real Property
in substantially the same manner as is currently maintained as of the date of

result of the termination of employment of any Transferred Employee; and

 

(e) any claims related to or based upon the post-closing relationship between

9.4 _Indemnification Procedures for Third Party Claims_.

(a) In the event that any claim or demand for which an Indemnitor may be
liable to an Indemnitee hereunder is asserted by a third party (a " _Third
Party Claim_ "), the Indemnitee shall promptly, and in any event within 30
days, provide written notice to the Indemnitor of such Third Party Claim (a "
_Claim Notice_ "). The Claim Notice shall (i) state that the Indemnitee has
paid or properly accrued Losses or anticipates that it will incur liability
for Losses for which the Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification pursuant
hereto, and (ii) specify in reasonable detail each individual item of Loss
included in the amount so stated, the date such item was paid or properly
accrued, the basis for any anticipated liability and the representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement curtained herein to which each such item is
related and the computation of the amount to which such Indemnitee claims to
be entitled hereunder. The Indemnitee shall enclose with the Claim Notice a
copy of all papers served with respect to such Third Party Claim and any other
documents evidencing such Third Party Claim.

 

(b) The Indemnitor will have 60 days from the date on which the Indemnitor
received the Claim Notice to notify the Indemnitee that the Indemnitor has
elected to assume the defense or prosecution of such Third Party Claim and any
litigation resulting therefrom with counsel of its choice and at its sole cost
and expense (a " _Third Party Defense_ "). If the Indemnitor assumes the
Third Party Defense in accordance herewith: (i) the Indemnitee may retain
separate co-counsel at its sole cost and expense (as to which the Indemnitee
shall not be entitled to indemnification) and participate in the defense of
the Third Party Claim but the Indemnitor shall control the investigation,
defense and settlement thereof; (ii) the Indemnitee will not file any papers
or consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with
respect to the Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the
Indemnitor; and (iii) the Indemnitor will not consent to the entry of any
judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to the Third Party Claim to
the extent such judgment or settlement provides for equitable relief without
the prior written consent of the Indemnitee. The parties hereto will use
commercially reasonable efforts to minimize Losses from Third Party Claims,
act in good faith in responding to, defending against, settling or otherwise
dealing with such claims, and cooperate in any such defense and give each
other reasonable access to and copies of all information, records and
documents relevant thereto. Whether or not the Indemnitor has assumed
the Third Party Defense, the Indemnitor will not be obligated to indemnify
the Indemnitee hereunder for any settlement entered into or any judgment that
was consented to without the Indemnitors prior written consent.

 



44 (c) If the Indemnitor does not assume the Third Party Defense within 60 days
of receipt of the Claim Notice, the Indemnitee will be entitled to assume the
Third Party Defense at its sole cost and expense (or, if the Indemnitee incurs
a Loss with respect to the matter in question for which the Indemnitee is
entitled to indemnification pursuant to Section 9.2 or 9.3, as applicable, at
the expense of the Indemnitor) upon delivery of notice to such effect to the
Indemnitor; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnitor (i) shall have the
right to participate in the Third Party Defense at its sole cost and expense,
but the Indemnitee shall control the investigation, defense and settlement
thereof; (ii) may at any time thereafter assume the Third Party Defense, in
which event the Indemnitor shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses
of the Indemnitees counsel incurred prior to the assumption by the Indemnitor
of the Third Party Defense; and (iii) will not be obligated to indemnify the
Indemnitee hereunder for any settlement entered into or any judgment that was
consented to without the Indemnitors prior written consent.

9.5  _Indemnification Procedures for Non-Third Party Claims_. The Indemnitee
will provide written notice to the Indemnitor promptly, and in any event
within 30 days, following its discovery of any matter for which the Indemnitor
may be liable hereunder that does not involve a Third Party Claim, which
Claim Notice shall (i) state that the Indemnitee has paid or properly accrued
Losses or anticipates that it will incur liability for Losses for which the
Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification pursuant hereto, and (ii) specify
in reasonable detail each individual item of Loss included in the amount so
stated, the date such item was paid or properly accrued, the basis for any
anticipated liability and the representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
contained herein to which each such item is related and the computation of the
amount to which such Indemnitee claims to be entitled hereunder. If the
Indemnitor does not acknowledge in writing its obligation to indemnify the
Indemnitee with respect to such Losses within 60 days after its receipt of the
Claim Notice, the Indemnitor will be deemed to have rejected such claim, in
which event the Indemnitee will be free to pursue such remedies as may be
available to it hereunder. The Indemnitee will reasonably cooperate with and
assist the Indemnitor in determining the validity of any claim for indemnity
by the Indemnitee and in otherwise resolving such matters. Such
assistance and cooperation will include providing reasonable access to and
copies of information, records and documents relating to such matters,
furnishing employees to assist in the investigation, defense and resolution of
such matters and providing legal and business assistance with respect to such
matters.

9.6 _Limitations on Indemnification_.

 

(a) No party hereto shall be required to indemnify, defend or hold harmless
any Person pursuant to this Article IX: (i) unless a Claim Notice is timely
delivered pursuant to this Article IX; and (ii) with respect to a claim
pursuant to Section 9.2(a) or 9.3(a) for the breach of a representation and
warranty other than the Specified Representations unless and until the
aggregate Losses of (A) the Purchaser, in the case of the Sellers, with
respect to any such claims, or (B) the Sellers, in the case of the Purchaser,
with respect to any such claims, exceed $1,000,000, at which point such
party shall be liable for all such Losses exceeding $500,000.

(b) In no event shall the cumulative indemnification obligations of the
Sellers pursuant to Section 9.2(a) with respect to breaches of representations
and warranties other than the Specified Representations on the one hand, or
the Purchaser pursuant to Sections 9.3(a) with respect to breaches
of representations and warranties other than the Specified Representations on
the one hand on the other hand, exceed $21,450,000.

 



45 (c) The amount of Losses payable under this Article IX by the Indemnitor shall
be reduced (i) by any amounts recoverable by the Indemnitee under insurance
policies or from any other Person and (ii) to take account of any Tax benefit
of the Indemnitee arising from the incurrence or payment of any such
indemnified amount. 

(d) No party hereto shall be obligated to indemnify any other Person with
respect to (i) any item disclosed in the Seller Disclosure Schedule or any
supplement thereto, or if the Purchaser had knowledge of such item as of the
Closing, (ii) any covenant or condition waived by another party on or prior to
the Closing, (iii) any indirect, special, incidental, consequential or
punitive damages, or (iv) any Loss with respect to any matter raised in the
calculation of the adjustment of the Purchase Price pursuant to Section 2.6.
Each party hereto agrees that, for so long as such party has any right of
indemnification under Article IX, it shall not, and shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to ensure that its Affiliates do not, voluntarily or by
discretionary action, accelerate the timing or increase the cost of
any obligation of any other party under this Article IX, except to the extent
that such action is taken (x) for a reasonable legitimate purpose and not with
a purpose of discovering a condition that would constitute a breach of
any representation or warranty, covenant or agreement of any other party
hereto or (y) in response to a discovery by such party, without violation of
the immediately preceding clause (x), of meaningful evidence of a condition
that constitutes a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement of any other party hereunder. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, an Indemnitor shall not be obligated to indemnify an
Indemnitee for any Loss to the extent arising from any such voluntary or
discretionary action, other than as so excepted.

(e) In addition to the other limitations set forth in this Article IX, with
respect to any claim by the Purchaser for indemnification or otherwise arising
out of, relating to or resulting from: (x) any breach of any representation
and warranty set forth in Section 4.17, or (y) any Excluded Liability
relating to environmental matters or Environmental, Health and Safety
Requirements, including Pre-Closing Environmental Liabilities (collectively, "
_Environmental Losses_ "), the Sellers shall have no obligation to indemnify,
defend or hold harmless the Purchaser: (i) unless the Environmental Loss
arises out of a Third Party Claim that is neither instigated nor encouraged by
the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates, representatives or agents; (ii)
if the Environmental Loss would not have arisen but for any intrusive
investigation or disclosure to any third party (including any Governmental
Entity) by the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates, representatives or agents,
except to the extent such investigation or disclosure was required by
applicable Environmental, Health and Safety Requirements; (iii) to the extent
such Loss exceeds the cost of the most cost effective standard or remedy
acceptable under Environmental, Health and Safety Requirements (including
engineering or institutional controls or any lesser standards resulting from
any site-specific risk assessments) based on an industrial use of the relevant
facility or property; and (iv) for any Environmental Loss that arises out of,
results from or is related to (A) any act or omission of the Purchaser, any
Affiliate of the Purchaser or any other Person on or after the Closing Date
that causes, contributes to, precipitates or exacerbates any condition
or circumstance forming the basis of any Environmental Loss, or (B) any
change in use or zoning or the redevelopment of any Real Property.

 



46 (f) Except for the Purchasers rights to indemnification pursuant to Section
9.2, the Purchaser shall have no claim or right to indemnification, and none
of the Sellers or any other Person shall have or be subject to any liability
to the other party hereto or any other Person, with respect to any
information, documents or materials furnished or made available to the
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates, officers, directors, employees, agents or
advisors by the Sellers or Affiliates thereof or any of their respective
officers, directors, employees, agents or advisors, whether orally or in
writing, in certain "data rooms", management presentations, functional "break
out" discussions, responses to questions submitted on behalf of the Purchaser
or in any other form in contemplation of the transactions contemplated
hereby.

(a) If the Purchaser seeks indemnification for any Environmental Losses, it
shall follow the claim procedures set forth in Section 9.4 as modified and
supplemented by the procedures set forth in this Section 9.7. Any Claim Notice
provided by the Purchaser for an Environmental Loss must: (i) comply with the
requirements and procedures set forth in Section 9.4 and also must set forth
with reasonable particularity the nature of the condition or event underlying
or giving rise to the Environmental Loss; and (ii) include, to the extent
known, the estimated amount of any Environmental Losses incurred or
reasonably expected to be incurred by the Purchaser with respect to such
Environmental Loss. The Purchaser shall also provide the Sellers with copies
of any environmental reports, data, proposals, claims and correspondence in
the possession of the Purchaser or any Affiliate thereof relevant to the
Environmental Loss.

(b) The Sellers shall have the sole and exclusive right to conduct, direct,
manage, implement and control the resolution of any Environmental Loss for
which they have an indemnification responsibility or liability under this
Agreement, including the right to (i) select and retain counsel and
consultants of their choosing, and (ii) raise timely and reasonable objections
and defenses to any obligations imposed on the Sellers with respect thereto.

(c) The Purchaser shall provide continuous reasonable access to the relevant
Real Property to the Sellers and their representatives and agents to enable
the Sellers to comply with their indemnification obligations hereunder with
respect to Environmental Losses. The Sellers shall use commercially reasonable
efforts not to materially interfere with the Purchasers operations at the
relevant Real Property in connection with such access. 

(d) With respect to any Environmental Loss for which the Sellers have an
indemnification obligation hereunder, the Sellers agree to provide the
Purchaser with the following to the extent requested by the Purchaser: (i)
copies of material draft reports and final reports, plans and other material
documents prior to the submission thereof to any Governmental Entity, and an
opportunity to comment on the same (which comments will be given due
consideration so long as they are timely submitted); and (ii) an opportunity
to meet with the Sellers and their representatives prior to and following any
material substantive communications or meetings with any Governmental Entity.
The Purchaser shall not contact, communicate, meet or submit any reports,
plans or other documents with or to any Governmental Entity with respect to
any Environmental Loss for which the Sellers have an indemnification
obligation hereunder.

 



47 9.8 _Exclusive Remedy_. The Purchaser and the Sellers acknowledge and agree
that, except for the right to specific performance pursuant to Section 10.12,
following the Closing, the indemnification provisions of Section 9.2 and
Section 9.3 shall be the sole and exclusive remedies of the Purchaser and the
Sellers for any breach by other party hereto of the representations and
warranties in this Agreement or the certificates delivered pursuant to
Sections 7.2(c) and 7.3(c) and for any failure by the other party to perform
and comply with any covenants and agreements in this Agreement, and anything
herein to the contrary notwithstanding, no breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement contained herein shall give rise to any right
on the part of the Purchaser or the Sellers after the Closing to rescind this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby. In furtherance of
the foregoing, each party hereto, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates,
hereby waives any and all rights, claims and causes of action which such
party may have against any other party hereto or any of its Affiliates arising
under or based upon any Law or otherwise, other than pursuant to this Article
IX.

9.9 _Mitigation_. Each party hereto shall take all reasonable steps to
mitigate its Losses upon and after becoming aware of any event which could
reasonably be expected to give rise to any Losses. 

9.10 _Treatment of Indemnity Benefits_. All payments made by the Sellers or
the Purchaser pursuant to obligations under this Agreement shall be treated
as adjustments to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes.
