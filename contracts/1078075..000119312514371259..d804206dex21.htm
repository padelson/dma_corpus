Time, by virtue of the First Merger and without any further action on the

NetScout:

(i) any Newco Membership Interest owned by Danaher or any Subsidiary of Newco
immediately prior to the Effective Time (or held in Newcos treasury) shall be
canceled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in
exchange therefor;

(ii) any Newco Membership Interest owned by NetScout, Merger Sub or any other
Subsidiary of NetScout immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be

3 (iii) except as provided in clauses "(i)" and "(ii)" above and subject to
_Sections 1.5(c)_ and _1.5(d)_ , each Newco Membership Interest outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into the right to
receive an aggregate number of duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid
and nonassessable shares of NetScout Common Stock equal to (x) 62.5 million
shares of NetScout Common Stock plus the product of (A) 1.46 multiplied by (B)
the number of shares of NetScout Common stock issued in any acquisition
contemplated by _Section 4.3(b)(v)_, divided by (y) the aggregate number of
Newco Membership Interests issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time (other than shares canceled in accordance with  _Sections
1.5(a)(i)_ and _1.5(a)(ii)_ ) (the "Per Share Merger Consideration"); and

 

(iv) each share of the common stock, $0.001 par value per share, of Merger Sub

Surviving Entity shall continue without dissolution.

 

(b) If, during the period from the date of this Agreement through the
Effective Time, the outstanding Newco Common Units or shares of NetScout
Common Stock are changed into a different number or class of shares by reason
of any stock or interest split, division or subdivision of shares, stock
dividend, distribution of limited liability company interests, reverse stock
or interest split, combination of shares, reclassification, recapitalization
or other similar transaction, or if a distribution of limited liability
company interests or stock dividend is declared by Newco or NetScout,
respectively, during such period, then the payment calculations set forth in
_Section 1.5(a)(iii)_ shall be adjusted to the extent appropriate to provide
the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such
action.

 

(c) If any Newco Membership Interest outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time is unvested or is subject to a repurchase option, risk of
forfeiture or other condition under any applicable restricted equity purchase
agreement or other Contract with Newco or under which Newco has any rights,
then (except to the extent provided in any binding agreement between Newco
and the holder thereof): (i) the shares of NetScout Common Stock issued in
exchange for such Newco Membership Interests will also be unvested and subject
to the same repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or other condition; and (ii)
such shares of NetScout Common Stock, whether represented by certificates or
in book entry form, may accordingly be marked with appropriate legends. Prior
to the Effective Time, Newco shall ensure that, from and after the Effective
Time, NetScout or the First Merger Surviving Entity or Second Merger
Surviving Entity, as applicable, is entitled to exercise any such repurchase
option or other right set forth in any such restricted stock or interest
purchase agreement or other Contract.

 

(d) No fractional shares of NetScout Common Stock shall be issued in
connection with the First Merger, and no certificates or scrip for any such
fractional shares shall be issued. Any holder of Newco Membership Interests
who would otherwise be entitled to receive a fraction of a share of NetScout
Common Stock (after aggregating all fractional shares of NetScout Common Stock
issuable to such holder) shall, in lieu of such fraction of a share, be paid
in cash the dollar amount (rounded to the nearest whole cent), after deducting
any required withholding taxes, on a pro rata basis, without interest,
determined by multiplying such fraction by the closing price of a share of
NetScout Common Stock on the NASDAQ Global Select Market on the last business
day prior to the date on which the First Merger becomes effective. Payment of
cash in lieu of fractional shares of NetScout Common Stock shall be made
solely for the purpose of avoiding the expense and inconvenience to NetScout
of issuing fractional shares of NetScout Common Stock and shall not represent
separately bargained-for consideration.

 



4 1.6 Exchange of Newco Membership Interests.

 

(a) Pursuant to Article III of the Distribution Agreement, the Exchange Agent
(as defined below) shall hold, for the account of the relevant Danaher
stockholders, the global certificate(s) representing all of the outstanding
Newco Common Units distributed in the Distribution. Such Newco Common Units
shall be converted into shares of NetScout Common Stock in accordance with
the terms of this _Section 1_.

(b) Prior to the Closing Date, Danaher shall appoint a reputable bank or trust
company reasonably satisfactory to NetScout as exchange agent in the First
Merger (the "Exchange Agent"). Prior to the Effective Time, NetScout shall
issue and cause to be deposited with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of
the holders of Newco Common Units, for exchange in accordance with this
_Section 1_, non-certificated shares of NetScout Common Stock represented by
book entry issuable pursuant to _Section 1.5_ (such shares of NetScout Common
Stock, together with any dividends or distributions pursuant to _Section
1.6(c)_ received by the Exchange Agent with respect to such shares of NetScout
Common Stock, are referred to collectively as the "Exchange Fund"). For the
purposes of such deposit, NetScout will assume that there will not be any
fractional shares of NetScout Common Stock. NetScout will make available to
the Exchange Agent, for addition to the Exchange Fund, from time to time as
needed or as reasonably requested by Danaher, cash sufficient to pay cash in
lieu of fractional shares in accordance with _Section 1.5(d)_. Following the
Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable
instructions, deliver the NetScout Common Stock to be issued pursuant to this
_Section 1_ from the shares of NetScout Common Stock held in the Exchange
Fund. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose.

 

(c) Promptly after the Effective Time, and to the extent not previously
distributed in connection with the Distribution, the Exchange Agent will mail
to the Persons who were record holders of Newco Membership Interests
immediately prior to the Effective Time: (i) a letter of transmittal in
customary form; and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the exchange of
any Newco Membership Interests for the Per Share Merger Consideration. Upon
surrender of a duly executed letter of transmittal, together with such other
customary documents as may be reasonably required by the Exchange Agent or
NetScout, the holder of such Newco Membership Interests shall be entitled to
receive, and the Exchange Agent shall (and NetScout shall cause the Exchange
Agent to) in exchange therefor transfer from the Exchange Fund to such holder
the number of whole shares of NetScout Common Stock that such holder has the
right to receive pursuant to the provisions of _Section 1.5(a)(iii)_ (and
cash in lieu of any fractional share of NetScout Common Stock pursuant to
_Section 1.5(d)_ and any dividends or other distributions pursuant to
_Section 1.6(d)_). From and after the Effective Time, any certificates
formerly representing Newco Membership Interests will represent only the right
to receive shares of NetScout Common Stock (and cash in lieu of any
fractional share of NetScout Common Stock as contemplated by _Section 1.5(d)_
and any dividends or other distributions pursuant to _Section 1.6(d)_).

 

(d) No dividends or other distributions declared or made with respect to
NetScout Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be
paid or otherwise delivered to the holder of any unsurrendered Newco
Membership Interest with respect to the shares of NetScout Common Stock that
such holder has the right to receive in the First Merger until such holder
exchanges such Newco Membership Interest in accordance with this _Section
1.6_ (at which time such holder shall be entitled, subject to the effect of
applicable abandoned property law, escheat law or other Legal Requirement, to
receive all such dividends and distributions theretofore paid or, at the
appropriate payment date, payable, in each case, without interest). NetScout
shall deposit all such dividends and distributions in the Exchange Fund.

 



5 (e) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to holders of
unexchanged Newco Membership Interests as of the date that is one year after
the Effective Time shall be delivered to NetScout upon demand, and any holders
of Newco Membership Interests who have not theretofore exchanged their Newco
Membership Interests in accordance with this _Section 1.6_ shall thereafter
look only to NetScout for satisfaction of their claims for NetScout Common
Stock, cash in lieu of fractional shares of NetScout Common Stock as
contemplated by _Section 1.5(d)_ and any dividends or distributions pursuant
to _Section 1.6(d)_ with respect to shares of NetScout Common Stock, in each
case without interest thereon.

 

(f) Each of the Exchange Agent, NetScout and the First Merger Surviving Entity
or Second Merger Surviving Entity, as applicable, shall be entitled to deduct
and withhold from any consideration payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant
to this Agreement to any holder or former holder of Newco Membership Interest
such amounts as may be required to be deducted or withheld from
such consideration under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign
tax law or under any other applicable Legal Requirement. To the extent such
amounts are so deducted or withheld and paid to the appropriate Governmental
Body, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as
having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been
paid.

 

(g) Neither NetScout nor the First Merger Surviving Entity nor Second Merger
Surviving Entity shall be liable to any holder or former holder of Newco
Membership Interests or to any other Person with respect to any shares of
NetScout Common Stock (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto), or
for any cash amounts, required to be delivered to any public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property law, escheat law or other Legal
Requirement.

1.7 Closing of Transfer Books. From and after the Effective Time, the
membership transfer books of Newco shall be closed and no transfer shall be
made of any Newco Membership Interests that were outstanding as of the
Effective Time.

 

1.8 Tax Consequences. For U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Mergers are
intended to be treated as integrated steps in a single transaction and
together qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a)(1)
of the Code. The parties to this Agreement adopt this Agreement as a "plan of
reorganization" within the meaning of Sections 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a) of
the U.S. Treasury Regulations. Each party hereto shall cause all Tax Returns
relating to the Mergers filed by such party to be filed on the basis of
treating the Mergers as a reorganization within the meaning of Section
368(a)(1) of the Code unless otherwise required by a "determination" (within
the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code).

1.9 Further Action. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further
action is determined by NetScout or the First Merger Surviving Entity or
Second Merger Surviving Entity to be necessary or desirable to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement or to vest the First Merger Surviving Entity or
Second Merger Surviving Entity with full right, title and possession of and to
all rights and property of Merger Sub and Newco, the officers and directors of
the First Merger Surviving Entity or Second Merger Surviving Entity and
NetScout shall be fully authorized (in the name of the Merger Subs, in the
name of Newco and otherwise) to take such action.

 

1.10 Conversion of Shares in the Second Merger. Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, at the Second Merger Effective Time, by virtue
of the Second Merger and without any further action on the part of NetScout,
the First Merger Surviving Entity, Merger Sub II or any stockholder of
NetScout:

 



6 (a) each limited liability company interest of the First Merger Surviving
Entity outstanding immediately prior to the Second Merger Effective Time
shall be canceled and shall cease to exist and no consideration shall be
delivered in exchange therefor; and

 

(b) each limited liability company interest in Merger Sub II outstanding
immediately prior to the Second Merger Effective Time shall remain unchanged
and continue to remain outstanding as a limited liability company interest in
the Second Merger Surviving Entity. At the Second Merger Effective Time,
NetScout shall continue as the sole member of the Second Merger Surviving
Entity, and the Second Merger Surviving Entity shall continue without
dissolution.

1.11 Adjustment.

 

(a) Promptly following the delivery of the Audited Financial Statements
pursuant to _Section 5.13_, Danaher shall cause to be delivered to NetScout
a statement setting forth a calculation of the Operating Profit derived from
the audited financial statements of the Communications Business for the year
ended December 31, 2013 included in the Audited Financial Statements (the "
_Operating Profit_ ").

(b) In the event that the Operating Profit is less than the amount set forth
on  _Schedule 1.11(b)_ , then Danaher shall pay to NetScout an amount equal
to the product of (x) such shortfall _multiplied_ by (y) 13.1; provided,
however, that in no event shall such payment amount exceed $150,000,000 in
cash. Such amount shall be paid to NetScout only in the event that the
Closing occurs and shall be payable by wire transfer of same-day funds within
three (3) business days after the Closing Date. The foregoing adjustment shall
not impact NetScouts rights to terminate this Agreement under _Section 8_
or its closing conditions under _Section 6_.

(c) Any payment made pursuant to this _Section 1.11_ is intended to be
treated as a contribution by Danaher to Newco occurring immediately prior to
the Closing Date.

Part 2.4(a) of the Danaher Disclosure Letter) describing the basis of
presentation and adjustments that would be necessary to derive financial
statements on the same basis of presentation (included in Part 2.4(a) of the
Danaher Disclosure Letter) as the Year End Communications Business Unaudited
Financials) (the "Unaudited Interim Communications Business Financial Data")
(together with the Year-End Communications Business Unaudited Financial
Statements, the "Communications Business Unaudited Financial Statements").
The Communications Business Unaudited Financial Statements were prepared in
good faith and derived from the books and records of Danaher and its
Subsidiaries and were prepared in accordance with GAAP, consistently applied,
as at the dates and for the periods presented (except as noted therein), and
present fairly in all material respects the financial position and results of
operations of the Communications Business as of the dates and for the periods
presented on the basis by which the Communications Business Unaudited
Financial Statements were prepared (subject to adjustments which are not
material, individually or in the aggregate) (it being understood, however,
that the Communications Business has not been operating historically as a
separate "standalone" entity or reporting segment and, therefore, the
Communications Business Unaudited Financial Statements will reflect certain
cost allocations made that may not reflect what would have been incurred if
the Communications Business had been a standalone business).

(b) When delivered pursuant to _Section 5.13_, the Audited Financial
Statements shall present fairly in all material respects the financial
position and results of operations of the Communications Business as of the
dates thereof or for the periods covered thereby, and will have been prepared
in accordance with GAAP consistently applied based on the historic practices
and accounting policies of Danaher to the extent compliant with GAAP (it being
understood, however, that the Communications Business has not been operating
historically as a separate "standalone" entity or reporting segment and,
therefore, the Audited Financial Statements will reflect certain cost
allocations made that may not reflect what would have been incurred if the
Communications Business had been a standalone business). The Audited
Financial Statements shall conform in all material respects to the published
rules and regulations of the SEC applicable to financial statements for each
of the periods that will be required to be included in the NetScout Form S-4
Registration Statement.

(c) Danaher maintains a system of internal controls over financial reporting
which is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with GAAP, in each case, with respect to
Danaher and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. To the Knowledge of Danaher,
since December 31, 2013, neither Danaher nor any of its Subsidiaries has
identified or been made aware of any material illegal act or fraud related to
the business of the Communications Business.

 

(d) None of the information to be supplied by or on behalf of Danaher or Newco
for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the NetScout Form S-4
Registration Statement or the Newco Registration Statements will, at the time
the NetScout Form S-4 Registration Statement or the Newco Registration
Statements, respectively, is filed with the SEC or at the time it, or any
amendment or supplement thereto, becomes effective under the Securities Act,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they are
made, not misleading. None of the information supplied or to be supplied by or
on behalf of Danaher or Newco for inclusion or incorporation by reference in
the Proxy Statement/Prospectus will, at the time the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus is mailed to the stockholders of NetScout or at the time
of the NetScout Stockholders Meeting (or any adjournment or postponement
thereof), contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state
any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make
the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they are
made, not misleading. The

 



10  Newco Registration Statements will comply as to form in all material
respects with the provisions of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the
rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC thereunder, except that no
representation or warranty is made by Danaher or Newco with respect to
statements made or incorporated by reference therein based on information
supplied by or on behalf of NetScout for inclusion or incorporation
by reference in the Newco Registration Statements.

(e) After giving effect to the Distribution and the other
transactions contemplated by the Distribution Agreement, the Communications
Business has not incurred any liabilities or obligations of any nature
whatsoever (whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise) that are
required to be reflected in the Communications Business Unaudited Financial
Statements in accordance with GAAP, as in effect on the date of this
Agreement, except for (i) those liabilities that are reflected or reserved for
in the Unaudited Interim Communications Business Financial Data, (ii)
liabilities that have been incurred by the Communications Business since June
27, 2014 in the ordinary course of the Communications Business consistent with
past practice, (iii) liabilities under this Agreement or incurred in
connection with the Contemplated Transactions and (iv) liabilities that are
not, individually or in the aggregate, material to the Communications
Business, or that are described in Part 2.4(e) of the Danaher Disclosure
Letter. 

2.5 Absence of Changes. Except as expressly contemplated by this Agreement,
since June 27, 2014 through the date of this Agreement, (a) except for
discussions, negotiations and transactions related to this Agreement or the
other Transaction Documents (including the Internal Restructuring described in
the Distribution Agreement), the Communications Business has operated in all
material respects in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice and (b) there has not occurred any event, change, action, failure to
act or transaction that, individually or in the aggregate, has had or
would be reasonably expected to have, a Newco Material Adverse Effect. Except
as expressly contemplated by this Agreement, since June 27, 2014 through the
date of this Agreement, neither the Communications Business nor the
Communications Companies have taken any actions which, had such actions been
taken after the date of this Agreement, would have required the written
consent of NetScout pursuant to _Sections 4.2(b)(iv)_ and _4.2(b)(vii)_ -
_(xii)_.

 

2.6 Title to and Sufficiency of Assets.

 

(a) After giving effect to the Contemplated Transactions described in or
contemplated by the Distribution Agreement, the Communications Companies will
have good and valid title to all of the Newco Assets transferred under the
Distribution Agreement. All of said assets are, or after the Distribution will
be, owned by the Communications Companies free and clear of any
Encumbrances, except where (i) the conveyance of any such assets requires a
Consent which is not obtained, in which case the provisions of Section 1.08 of
the Distribution Agreement will govern or (ii) the failure to have such good
and valid title results from any liens described in Part 2.6(a) of the
Danaher Disclosure Letter, liens created or otherwise imposed by the NetScout
Companies or any other Permitted Encumbrance. After giving effect to the
Distribution and the other Contemplated Transactions described in or
contemplated by the Distribution Agreement, the Communications Companies are
the lessees of, and hold valid leasehold interests in, all assets purported to
have been leased by them and the Communications Companies enjoy undisturbed
possession of such leased assets, except where (i) the conveyance of any such
assets requires a Consent which is not obtained, in which case the provisions
of Section 1.08 of the Distribution Agreement will govern or (ii) the failure
to have such valid leasehold interest results from any liens described in Part
2.6(a) of the Danaher Disclosure Letter, liens created or otherwise imposed by
the NetScout Companies or any other Permitted Encumbrance.

 

(b) At the Effective Time, the Newco Assets and the properties and rights of
the Communications Companies, taken together with the benefits of any
alternative arrangements provided

 



11  pursuant to Section 1.08 of the Distribution Agreement, the services
available from Danaher under the Transition Services Agreement and the
licenses from Danaher under the Trademark License Agreement, the IP License
Agreement and the DBS License Agreement, will be sufficient for NetScout and
the Communications Companies to operate the Communications Business
immediately following the Effective Time in all material respects as it
is currently conducted.

(c) No representation is made in this _Section 2.6_ with respect to title to
or the sufficiency of any intellectual property assets.

2.7 Real Property; Leasehold.

 

(a) No Communications Company owns any real property.

 

(b) Part 2.7(b) of the Danaher Disclosure Letter sets forth an accurate list
of each lease pursuant to which any of the Communications Companies leases or
uses real property from any other Person for annual rent payments in excess of
$500,000. (All real property leased to or used by the Communications Companies
pursuant to the real property leases identified or required to be identified
in Part 2.7(b) of the Danaher Disclosure Letter, including all buildings,
structures, fixtures and other improvements leased to the Communications
Companies, is referred to as the "Newco Leased Real Property.") To
the Knowledge of Danaher, there is no existing plan or study by any
Governmental Body or by any other Person that challenges or otherwise
adversely affects the continuation of the use or operation of any Newco Leased
Real Property. Part 2.7(b) of the Danaher Disclosure Letter contains an
accurate and complete list of all subleases, occupancy agreements and other
Newco Contracts granting to any Person (other than any Communications Company)
a right of use or occupancy of any of the Newco Leased Real Property in
effect as of the date of this Agreement. Except as set forth in the leases or
subleases identified in Part 2.7(b) of the Danaher Disclosure Letter, there is
no Person in possession of any Newco Leased Real Property other than
a Communications Company.

2.8 Intellectual Property; Privacy.

 

(a) Registered IP. Part 2.8(a)(i) of the Danaher Disclosure Letter identifies,
as of the date of this Agreement: (i) each material item of Registered IP in
which Danaher or any of its Subsidiaries (including the Communications
Companies) has or purports to have (including as a result of the transfers
under the Distribution Agreement) an ownership interest of any nature
(whether exclusively, jointly with another Person, or otherwise) and that
either: (A) covers any Newco Product or (B) that covers or that would be
infringed by the operation of the Communications Business, including the
manufacture, development, sale, import, support, maintenance or testing of
any Newco Product or the provision of any service or test using the Newco
Product (the "Newco Material Registered IP"); and (ii) any Person other than
the Communication Companies that has an ownership interest in such item of
Newco Material Registered IP and the nature of such ownership interest. Except
as set forth in Parts 2.8(a)(ii) and 2.8(c) of the Danaher Disclosure Letter,
and except with regard to non-exclusive licenses granted to Communications
Companies distributors, resellers and end-user customers in connection with
the sale, distribution or use of the Newco Products in the ordinary course of
business of the Communications Companies, no material licenses, covenants not
to sue, or other similar rights under the Newco Material Registered IP have
been granted to any Person, including as a result of any participation in an
industry association, standard setting organization or similar body. 

(b) Inbound Licenses. Part 2.8(b) of the Danaher Disclosure Letter accurately
identifies each Contract in effect as of the date of this Agreement pursuant
to which any Intellectual Property Right or Intellectual Property is or has
been licensed by any Person to Danaher, its Subsidiaries or the Communications
Companies, which Contract is material to the Communications Business, 

 



12  including material licenses to any Intellectual Property included in, or
Intellectual Property Rights embodied by, the Newco Products or used in
connection with or necessary to any development, manufacture, distribution,
other commercialization, maintenance or support of the Newco Products as
currently conducted ("Newco Material Inbound License"), other than (1)
Contracts between Danaher or its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and their
respective employees, on the other hand, in Danahers standard form thereof,
(2) licenses for standard commercially available off the shelf software or
hardware with annual fees of less than $200,000 ("Shrink-Wrap"), (3) licenses
to Open Source Code, other than that set forth in _Section 2.8(i)_, (4)
licenses for technology used exclusively by the data communication cable
installation and communications service provider business of Danaher and its
Subsidiaries, and (5) non-exclusive licenses to third-party software or
hardware that is not incorporated into, or necessary for the development,
manufacturing, testing, distribution, maintenance, or support of, any Newco
Product and that is not otherwise material to the Communications Business
(together with Newco Material Inbound Licenses, the "Newco Inbound Licenses").
To the Knowledge of Danaher, no material royalties or similar amounts in
excess of $200,000 during any calendar year are payable by Danaher or its
Subsidiaries or, after or as a result of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, will be payable by the Communications Companies under
the terms of any Newco Inbound Licenses other than Newco Material Inbound
Licenses.

(c) Outbound Licenses. Part 2.8(c) of the Danaher Disclosure Letter
identifies each material Contract, other than non-exclusive customer or sales
channel Contracts for Newco Products entered into in the ordinary course of
business and that does not materially differ in substance from standard
form agreements and other than Contracts listed in _Section 2.9(a)_, to
which any Person has been granted any license under, or otherwise has received
or acquired any right (whether or not currently exercisable) or interest in,
any Newco IP, in each case in effect as of the date of this Agreement.

(d) Ownership Free and Clear. The Communications Companies exclusively
own all right, title, and interest to and in the Newco IP free and clear of
any Encumbrances other than licenses and similar rights granted by any
Communications Company (including as set forth in Parts 2.8(a), 2.8(b) and
2.8(c) of the Danaher Disclosure Letter, and subject to the exceptions set
forth in _Sections 2.8(a)_ , _2.8(b)_ and _2.8(c)_ ) and other than Permitted
Encumbrances. Without limiting the foregoing, to the Knowledge of Danaher,
neither Danaher nor any of its Subsidiaries has transferred to, or permitted
under any Contract to which Danaher or its Subsidiary is a party, any Person
other than the Communications Companies to retain ownership of, or an
exclusive license to: (i) the Intellectual Property Rights in or to any
Derivatives of any Proprietary Newco Product, whether developed by or for
Danaher or its Subsidiaries, or by or for such other Person, under any such
Contract; or (ii) any interfaces developed by, with, or on behalf of, Danaher
or its Subsidiaries between any Newco Product and any Persons software or
product; except in the foregoing (i) and (ii) under any Contract set forth in
Parts 2.8(a), 2.8(b) or 2.8(c) of the Danaher Disclosure Letter or that is
not otherwise material to the Communications Business. As of the date of this
Agreement, no material item of Newco IP is subject to any action or
outstanding Order or settlement agreement or stipulation in litigation that
restricts in any manner the use, provision, transfer, assignment or licensing
thereof by Danaher or its Subsidiaries (including any Communications Company)
or affects the validity, use, ownership, registrability or enforceability of
such Newco IP. Except with regard to certain Danaher corporate names and
marks set forth in Part 2.8(d) of the Danaher Disclosure Letter, no rights,
title or interest in the names or other indicia of commercial source or origin
used to designate any material Newco Products prior to Closing are owned by
any Entity (including Danaher or its Subsidiaries) other than the
Communications Companies.

(e) Valid and Enforceable. To the Knowledge of Danaher, none of the material
Newco IP is invalid or unenforceable.

 



13 (f) Protection of Proprietary Information. Danaher and each of its
Subsidiaries (including the Communications Companies) have taken commercially
reasonable steps to maintain the confidentiality of and otherwise protect and
enforce their respective rights in all material proprietary information
pertaining to the Communications Business and all Proprietary Newco Products,
and except as set forth in Part 2.8(f) of the Danaher Disclosure Letter, no
source code owned by Danaher or its Subsidiaries for any Proprietary Newco
Product has been disclosed or delivered to any Person who is not a Newco
Employee.

(g) Sufficiency. Danaher or its Subsidiaries owns or otherwise has, and after
the Closing the Communications Companies will have (including as a result of
the transfers under the Distribution Agreement), taken together with the
benefits of any alternative arrangements provided pursuant to Section 1.08 of
the Distribution Agreement, the services available from Danaher under the
Transition Services Agreement and the licenses from Danaher under the
Trademark License Agreement, the IP License Agreement and the DBS License
Agreement, all Intellectual Property and Intellectual Property Rights needed
to conduct the Communications Business in all material respects as it is
currently conducted, including as may be necessary to so design, develop,
copy, modify, make, test, support, maintain, market, license, sell or
otherwise commercialize (as applicable) the Newco Products without infringing
the Intellectual Property Rights of Danaher or its Affiliates; provided that
the foregoing is not a representation or warranty with respect to
infringement, misappropriation or other violation of third party Intellectual
Property Rights or unfair competition, which solely is covered under _Section
2.8(i)_.

 

(h) Third-Party Infringement of Newco IP. To the Knowledge of Danaher, no
Person in the past three (3) years has infringed, misappropriated, or
otherwise violated, and no Person is currently infringing, misappropriating,
or otherwise violating, any material Newco IP.

 

(i) No Infringement of Third Party IP Rights. To the Knowledge of Danaher, the
conduct of the Communications Business and of the Communications Companies as
conducted in the past three (3) years, including the development, manufacture,
use, import, export, offer for sale, sale or other commercialization of any of
the Newco Products as so conducted, does not and has not in the past three
(3) years infringed (directly, contributorily, by inducement, or otherwise),
misappropriated, or otherwise violated or made unlawful use of any
Intellectual Property Right of any other Person. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, as relates to the Communications Business,
including Newco IP or the Newco Products, as of the date of this Agreement, no
infringement, misappropriation, or similar claim or Legal Proceeding is
pending or, to the Knowledge of Danaher, threatened in writing against
Danaher or its Subsidiaries (including the Communications Business and
Communications Companies) or, to the Knowledge of Danaher, against any other
Person who is or may be entitled to be indemnified, defended, held harmless,
or reimbursed by Danaher or its Subsidiaries (including the Communications
Business and Communications Companies) of the foregoing with respect to such
claim or Legal Proceeding, and except as set forth in Part 2.8(i) of the
Danaher Disclosure Letter, no Person has made a written request against
Danaher or its Subsidiaries (including the Communications Business and
Communications Companies) to be indemnified, defended, held harmless, or
reimbursed with respect to any such claim or Legal Proceeding. No Proprietary
Newco Product contains, is derived from, or is distributed with Open Source
Code in a manner that has resulted in a requirement or condition that any
Proprietary Newco Product or part thereof (1) be disclosed or distributed in
source code form, (2) be licensed for the purpose of making modifications or
derivative works, or (3) be redistributable at no charge.

 

(j) To the Knowledge of Danaher, (i) Danaher and its Subsidiaries have since
January 1, 2012 materially complied with, and, as of the date of this
Agreement, no Person (including any Governmental Body) has asserted a claim
against, or otherwise tendered written notice to, Danaher or its Subsidiaries,
in connection with the Communications Business, alleging a material violation
of any

 



14  privacy policy of the Communications Companies (including those posted on
the Newco Web Sites) or the applicable Legal Requirements pertaining to
privacy and data (including Personal Data) protection, and (ii) there have
been no unauthorized intrusions or breaches of the security of the
Communications Companies information technology systems resulting in any
material data breach.

 

(k) This _Section 2.8_ contains the sole and exclusive representations and
warranties of Danaher and Newco under this Agreement with respect to
Intellectual Property matters (other than Contracts required to be disclosed
pursuant to _Section 2.9(a)(iii)_).

subsections (i) and (ii) of this _Section 2.9(c)_.

 

(d) Except as set forth in Part 2.9(d) of the Danaher Disclosure Letter:

2.10 Compliance with Legal Requirements; Regulatory Matters. The
Communications Business and each of the Communications Companies is, and
since January 1, 2012 has been, in compliance with all applicable Legal
Requirements, except where the failure to so comply would not, individually or
in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Newco Material Adverse
Effect.

 



16  Since January 1, 2012, neither Danaher nor any of its Subsidiaries (with
respect to the Communications Business) nor any of the Communications
Companies has received any written notice or other written communication from

and (iii) has received any notice from, or voluntarily provided any notice

period between January 1, 2009 and such acquisition.

material Governmental Authorizations necessary to enable the Communications
Companies to conduct their respective businesses in the manner in which
such businesses are currently being conducted, including all Governmental
Authorizations required under Environmental Laws, except where the failure to
so hold would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to
have a Newco Material Adverse Effect. All such Governmental Authorizations
are valid and in full force and effect. Danaher and its Subsidiaries
(including each Communications Company) are, and at all times since January 1,
2012 have been, in compliance with the terms and requirements of such
Governmental Authorizations, except where the failure to so comply would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Newco

2.13 Tax Matters.

 



17 (a) Each material Tax Return required to be filed by or on behalf of the
respective Communications Companies or with respect to the Communications

(c) No claim or Legal Proceeding is pending or, to the Knowledge of Danaher,
has been threatened against or with respect to any Communications Company or

document which are being contested in good faith by the Communications
Companies and with respect to which adequate reserves for payment have been
established on the Communications Business Unaudited Financial Statements).
There are no liens for material Taxes upon any of the Newco Assets except
liens for current Taxes not yet due and payable.

 

(d) No written claim has ever been made by any Governmental Body in a
jurisdiction where a Communications Company does not file a Tax Return that
it is or may be subject to taxation by that jurisdiction which has resulted or

3.5 Absence of Changes. Except as expressly contemplated by this Agreement,
since June 30, 2014 through the date of this Agreement, (a) except for
discussions, negotiations and transactions related to this Agreement or the

the Distribution Agreement), the NetScout Companies have operated in all
material respects in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice and (b) there has not occurred any event, change, action, failure to
act or transaction that, individually or in the aggregate, has had or
would be reasonably expected to have, a NetScout Material Adverse Effect.
Except as expressly contemplated by this Agreement since June 30, 2014,
through the date of this Agreement, the NetScout Companies have not taken any
actions which, had such actions been taken after the date of this Agreement,
would have required the written consent of Danaher pursuant to _Section

good and valid title to, all assets purported to be owned by them, including:

inventory sold or otherwise disposed of in the ordinary course of business
since the date of the NetScout Interim Balance Sheet); and (b) all other
assets reflected in the books and records of the NetScout Companies as being
owned by the NetScout Companies. All of said assets are owned by the NetScout
Companies free and clear of any Encumbrances, except (i) for Encumbrances
securing the NetScout Credit Agreements, (ii) where the failure to have such
good and valid title results from any liens described in Part 3.6 of the

NetScout Companies are the lessees of, and hold valid leasehold interests in,
all assets purported to have been leased by them and the NetScout Companies

to have such valid leasehold interest results from any liens described in
Part 3.6 of the NetScout Disclosure letter, liens created or otherwise imposed
by Danaher or the Communications Companies or any other Permitted Encumbrance.
No representation is made in this  _Section 3.6_ with respect to the title

identified or required to be identified in Part 3.7(b) of the NetScout
Disclosure Letter, including all buildings, structures, fixtures and other
improvements leased to the NetScout Companies, is referred to as the "NetScout
Leased Real Property.") To the Knowledge of NetScout, there is no existing
plan or study by any Governmental Body or by any other Person that challenges
or otherwise adversely affects the continuation of the use or operation of any

contains an accurate and complete list of all subleases, occupancy agreements
and other NetScout Contracts granting to any Person (other than any NetScout
Company) a right of use or occupancy of any of the NetScout Leased Real
Property in effect as of the date of this Agreement. Except as set forth in

interest of any nature (whether exclusively, jointly with another Person, or
otherwise) and that either: (A) covers any NetScout Product or (B) that
covers or that would be infringed by the operation of the business of the
NetScout Companies, including the manufacture, development, sale, import,
support, maintenance or testing of any NetScout Product or the provision of
any service or test using the NetScout Product (the "NetScout Material
Registered IP"); and (ii) any Person other than the NetScout Companies that

end-user customers in connection with the sale, distribution or use of
NetScout Products in the ordinary course of business of the NetScout
Companies, no material licenses, covenants not to sue, or other similar rights

"NetScout Inbound Licenses"). To the Knowledge of NetScout, no material
royalties or similar amounts in excess of $200,000 during any calendar year
are payable by NetScout or its Subsidiaries under any NetScout Inbound
License.

 



28 (c) Outbound Licenses. Part 3.8(c) of the NetScout Disclosure Letter
identifies each material Contract, other than non-exclusive customer or sales
channel Contracts for NetScout Products entered into in the ordinary course of
business and that does not materially differ in substance from standard form
agreements and other than the Contracts listed in _Section 3.9(a)_, to which
any Person has been granted any license under, or otherwise has received or
acquired any right (whether or not currently exercisable) or interest in, any
NetScout IP, in each case in effect as of the date of this Agreement.

(d) Ownership Free and Clear. The NetScout Companies exclusively own all

NetScout Disclosure Letter, and subject to the exceptions set forth in
_Sections 3.8(a)_ , _3.8(b)_ and _3.8(c)_ ) and other than Permitted

no NetScout Company has transferred to, or permitted under any Contract to
which a NetScout Company is a party, any Person other than the NetScout
Companies to retain ownership of, or an exclusive license to: (i) the
Intellectual Property Rights in or to any Derivatives of any Proprietary
NetScout Product, whether developed by or for NetScout or its Subsidiaries, or
by or for such other Person, under any such Contract; or (ii) any interfaces
developed by, with, or on behalf of, any NetScout Company between any
NetScout Product and any Persons software or product; except in the foregoing
(i) and (ii) under any Contract set forth in Parts 3.8(a), 3.8(b) and 3.8(c)
of the NetScout Disclosure Letter or that is not otherwise material to the
business of the NetScout Companies. As of the date of this Agreement, no
material item of NetScout IP is subject to any action or outstanding Order or
settlement agreement or stipulation in litigation that restricts in any
manner the use, provision, transfer, assignment or licensing thereof by the
NetScout Companies or affects the validity, use, ownership, registrability or
enforceability of such NetScout IP. Except with regard to certain
NetScout corporate names and marks set forth in Part 3.8(d) of the NetScout
Disclosure Letter, no rights, title or interest in the names or other indicia
of commercial source or origin used to designate any material NetScout
Products prior to Closing are owned by any Entity other than the NetScout
Companies.

(e) Valid and Enforceable. To the Knowledge of NetScout, none of the material
NetScout IP is invalid or unenforceable.

(f) Protection of Proprietary Information. Each NetScout Company has
taken commercially reasonable steps to maintain the confidentiality of and

Letter, no source code owned by a NetScout Company for any NetScout Product
has been disclosed or delivered to any Person who is not a NetScout Employee.

 

(g) Sufficiency. The NetScout Companies own or otherwise have, and after the
Closing will continue to have, all Intellectual Property and Intellectual
Property Rights needed to conduct the business of the NetScout Companies in
all material respects as it is currently conducted; provided that the
foregoing is not a representation or warranty with respect to
infringement, misappropriation or other violation of third party Intellectual
Property Rights or unfair competition, which solely is covered under _Section
3.8(i)_.

 

(h) Third-Party Infringement of NetScout IP. To the Knowledge of NetScout, no
Person in the past three (3) years has infringed, misappropriated, or
otherwise violated, and no Person is currently infringing, misappropriating,
or otherwise violating, any material NetScout IP.

 



29 (i) No Infringement of Third Party IP Rights. To the Knowledge of NetScout,
the conduct of the business of any of the NetScout Companies as conducted in
the past three (3) years, including the development, manufacture, use, import,
export, offer for sale, sale or other commercialization of any of the NetScout
Products as so conducted, does not and has not in the past three (3) years
infringed (directly, contributorily, by inducement, or otherwise),
misappropriated, or otherwise violated or made unlawful use of any
Intellectual Property Right of any other Person. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, as relates to the NetScout IP or the NetScout
Products, as of the date of this Agreement, no infringement, misappropriation,
or similar claim or Legal Proceeding is pending or, to the Knowledge

request against a NetScout Company to be indemnified, defended, held harmless,

distributed in source code form, (2) be licensed for the purpose of making
modifications or derivative works, or (3) be redistributable at no charge.

 

(j) To the Knowledge of NetScout (i) the NetScout Companies have since January

than in the ordinary course of business, other than pursuant to the Debt
Financing;

 

(viii) lend money to any Person (other than routine travel and business

past practices, incur or guarantee any indebtedness in excess of $5,000,000 in

or

 

(xii) agree or commit to take any of the actions described in clauses "(i)"
through "(xi)" of this _Section 4.3(b)_.

(c) During the Pre-Closing Period, NetScout shall promptly notify Danaher in

have or result in a NetScout Material Adverse Effect. No notification given
to Danaher pursuant to this _Section 4.3(c)_ shall limit or otherwise affect
any of the representations,

 



44  warranties, covenants or obligations of NetScout contained in this Agreement
or the conditions to the obligations of the parties under this Agreement;
provided, however, that a failure to comply with this _Section 4.3(c)_ will
not constitute the failure of any condition set forth in _Section 7_ to be
satisfied unless the underlying event, condition, fact or circumstance would
independently result in the failure of a condition set forth in _Section 7_
to be satisfied.

4.4 Control of Other Partys Business. Nothing contained in this Agreement
shall give Danaher or Newco, directly or indirectly, the right to control or
direct NetScouts operations prior to the Effective Time. Nothing contained in

_provided_ ,  _however_ , that nothing in this Agreement shall preclude
Danaher from considering, engaging in any discussions or negotiations
regarding, or furnishing to any Person any information in connection with or
in furtherance of, or entering into any agreement providing for or in
connection with, any Acquisition

 



45  Proposal with respect to Danaher, its Subsidiaries, assets or businesses
(other than the Communications Business, the Newco Assets or a Communications

 _provided_ , _however_ , that prior to the approval of the issuance of shares

Required NetScout Stockholder Vote (and in no event after obtaining the
Required NetScout Stockholder Vote), this _Section 4.5(b)_ shall not prohibit
NetScout from furnishing information regarding the NetScout Companies (it
being understood that in no event shall any of the NetScout Companies or
their respective Representatives furnish any information regarding Danaher or
any of its Subsidiaries (including the Communications Companies) or the
Communications Business) to, or entering into discussions and negotiations
with, any Person in response to a bona fide Acquisition Proposal made after
the date of this Agreement that is submitted to NetScout by such Person (and
not withdrawn) which after consultation with its financial advisor and
outside legal counsel, the NetScout Board determines in good faith is, or is
reasonably expected to, result in a NetScout Superior Offer if: (A) such
Acquisition Proposal did not result from any material breach of any of the
provisions set forth in this _Section 4.5(b)_; (B) the NetScout Board
concludes in good faith, after having consulted with its outside legal
counsel, that failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to
constitute a breach of the fiduciary duties of the NetScout Board to
NetScouts stockholders under applicable Legal Requirements; (C) prior to
furnishing any such information to such Person, NetScout receives from such
Person an executed confidentiality agreement containing customary provisions
(including nondisclosure provisions, use restrictions and non-solicitation
provisions) at least as favorable to NetScout as the provisions of the
Confidentiality Agreement as in effect immediately prior to the execution of
this Agreement and allows for NetScout to comply with its obligations in this
Agreement; (D) NetScout gives Danaher written notice of the identity of such
Person and (E) NetScout furnishes or Makes Available such information to
Danaher (to the extent such information has not been previously furnished or

with the time it is provided or made available to such Person.

 



46 (c) Each of NetScout and Danaher shall promptly (and in no event later than 24
hours after receipt of any Acquisition Proposal with respect to either (i)
the Communications Business, the Newco Assets or a Communications Company or
(ii) NetScout, as the case may be, or Acquisition Inquiry with respect to
either (x) the Communications Business, the Newco Assets or a Communications
Company or (y) NetScout, as the case may be) advise the other party to this
Agreement orally and in writing of any such Acquisition Proposal or
Acquisition Inquiry (including the identity of the Person making or
submitting such Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry and the terms
thereof, including a copy of any written Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition
Inquiry and any other documentation in respect of such Acquisition Proposal
or Acquisition Inquiry received from the proponent thereof or its
Representative) that is made or submitted by any Person during the Pre-Closing
Period. Each party receiving an Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry
shall keep the other party reasonably informed on a reasonably prompt basis
with respect to: (i) the status of any such Acquisition Proposal or
Acquisition Inquiry, including, with respect to an Acquisition Proposal or
Acquisition Inquiry received by NetScout only, any negotiations with respect
thereto; and (ii) the status and terms of any material modification or
proposed material modification thereto, including copies of any written
materials (including e-mail correspondence) received from the proponent
thereof or its Representative in connection with any such Acquisition Proposal
or Acquisition Inquiry.

(d) Each of NetScout and Danaher shall, and shall cause their respective
Subsidiaries and Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be
terminated any discussions conducted on or before the date of this Agreement
with any Person that relate to any Acquisition Proposal with respect to
either (i) the Communications Business, the Newco Assets or a Communications
Company or (ii) NetScout, as the case may be, or Acquisition Inquiry with
respect to either (x) the Communications Business, the Newco Assets or a
Communications Company or (y) NetScout, as the case may be, and request the
prompt return or destruction of all confidential information previously
furnished.

 

(e) Each of NetScout and Danaher (solely with respect to the Communications
Business, the Newco Assets and the Communications Companies) agrees not to
release or permit the release of any Person from, or to waive or permit the
waiver of any provision of, any confidentiality, non-solicitation, no hire,
"standstill" or similar Contract to which any such party or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party or under which any such party or any of its
Subsidiaries has any rights, and will use its reasonable efforts to cause each
such agreement to be enforced at the request of the other party to this
Agreement except, in the case of NetScout, to the extent that the NetScout
Board determines in good faith, after having consulted with its outside legal
counsel, that failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to
constitute a breach of the fiduciary duties of the NetScout Board to its
stockholders under applicable Legal Requirements.

of NetScout Common Stock pursuant to the First Merger and, in the case of
Danaher, the issuance of Newco Common Units in the Distribution.

 

5.2 NetScout Stockholders Meeting.

 

(a) As promptly as practicable following the date on which the SEC shall clear
(whether orally or in writing) the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, NetScout: (i)
shall take all action necessary under all applicable Legal Requirements to
call, give notice of and hold a meeting of the holders of NetScout Common
Stock (the "NetScout Stockholders Meeting") to vote on a proposal to approve
the

 



48  issuance of shares of NetScout Common Stock pursuant to the First Merger
pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635 and (ii) shall submit such proposal to
such holders at the NetScout Stockholders Meeting. NetScout shall not submit
any other proposals for approval at the NetScout Stockholders Meeting without
the prior written consent of Danaher. NetScout in consultation with Danaher
shall set a record date for Persons entitled to notice of, and to vote at,
the NetScout Stockholders Meeting and shall not change such record date
without the prior written consent of Danaher (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). NetScout shall use its
reasonable best efforts to ensure that all proxies solicited by the NetScout
Companies and their Representatives in connection with the NetScout
Stockholders Meeting are solicited in compliance with all applicable Legal
Requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, NetScout may after consultation with Danaher adjourn or postpone
the NetScout Stockholders Meeting: (i) to the extent necessary to ensure that
any supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus that is
required by applicable Legal Requirement (or in connection with the settlement
of any applicable litigation) is timely provided to NetScouts stockholders;
(ii) if as of the time for which the NetScouts Meeting is originally
scheduled there are insufficient shares of NetScout Common Stock represented
(either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the
business to be conducted at the NetScout Stockholders Meeting; or (iii) if
additional time is reasonably required to solicit proxies in favor of the
approval of the issuance of shares of NetScout Common Stock pursuant to the
First Merger. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to relieve
NetScout of its obligation to submit the issuance of shares of NetScout Common
Stock pursuant to the First Merger to its stockholders for a vote on the
approval thereof. NetScout agrees that, unless this Agreement shall have been
terminated in accordance with _Section 8_, its obligations to hold the
NetScout Stockholders Meeting pursuant to this _Section 5.2(a)_ shall not be
affected by the commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or
communication to NetScout of any Acquisition Proposal with respect to NetScout
or Acquisition Inquiry with respect to NetScout or by any NetScout Change in
Recommendation.

 

(b) Except to the extent permitted by _Section 5.2(c)_: (i) the NetScout
Board shall recommend that NetScouts stockholders vote in favor of the
issuance of shares of NetScout Common Stock pursuant to the First Merger at
the NetScout Stockholders Meeting, (ii) the Proxy Statement/Prospectus shall
include a statement to the effect that the NetScout Board recommends that
NetScouts stockholders vote to approve the issuance of shares of NetScout
Common Stock pursuant to the First Merger at the NetScout Stockholders
Meeting (such determination and recommendation being referred to as the
"NetScout Board Recommendation") and (iii) except as expressly permitted by
_Section 5.2(c)_, the NetScout Board Recommendation shall not be directly or
indirectly withdrawn or modified (or proposed to be withdrawn or modified) by
the NetScout Board nor any committee thereof in a manner adverse to Danaher (a
"NetScout Change in Recommendation").

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section 5.2(a)_ or
elsewhere in this Agreement, at any time prior to the approval of the
issuance of shares of NetScout Common Stock pursuant to the First Merger by
the Required NetScout Stockholder Vote, the NetScout Board may effect, or
cause NetScout to effect, as the case may be, a NetScout Change
in Recommendation:

(i) if: (A) NetScout has not materially breached its obligations under 
_Section 4.5_; (B) after the date of this Agreement, an unsolicited, bona
fide written Acquisition Proposal is made to NetScout and is not withdrawn;
(C) the NetScout Board determines in its good faith judgment, after
consulting with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that such
Acquisition Proposal constitutes a NetScout Superior Offer; (D) the NetScout
Board does not effect, or cause NetScout to effect, a NetScout Change in
Recommendation at any time within four (4) business days (together with any
subsequent shorter period as contemplated by clause (E) below, the "Notice

 



49  Period") after Danaher receives (x) written notice from NetScout that the
NetScout Board has determined that such Acquisition Proposal is a NetScout
Superior Offer and (y) a summary of the material terms and conditions of the
Acquisition Proposal and other information required to be provided pursuant to
_Section 4.5_ (provided, a new notice shall be required with respect to each
material modification to such offer (it being understood that any change in
the purchase price or form of consideration in such offer shall be deemed a
material modification) and a new Notice Period (of three (3) business days)
shall begin); (E) during the applicable Notice Period, if requested by
Danaher, NetScout engages in good faith negotiations, and directs its
financial advisors and outside legal advisors to, engage in good faith
negotiations, with Danaher to amend this Agreement in such a manner that
the competing Acquisition Proposal does not constitute a NetScout Superior
Offer; (F) at the end of the applicable Notice Period, such Acquisition
Proposal has not been withdrawn and constitutes a NetScout Superior Offer
(taking into account any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by
Danaher as a result of the negotiations required by clause "(E)" or
otherwise); and (G) the NetScout Board determines in good faith, after having
consulted with its outside legal counsel, that, in light of such NetScout
Superior Offer, a failure to make a NetScout Change in Recommendation would be
reasonably likely to constitute a breach of the fiduciary duties of the
NetScout Board to NetScout stockholders under applicable Legal Requirements;
or

(ii) if other than in connection with or as a result of the making of an
Acquisition Proposal with respect to NetScout or an Acquisition Inquiry with
respect to NetScout, a material development or change in circumstances that
was not known or reasonably foreseeable (or if known or reasonably
foreseeable, the probability or magnitude of consequences of which were not
known or reasonably foreseeable) to the NetScout Board on the date of this
Agreement occurs or arises after the date of this Agreement, which material
development or change in circumstances becomes known to the NetScout Board
prior to the approval of the issuance of shares of NetScout Common Stock
pursuant to the First Merger by the Required NetScout Stockholder Vote (such
material development or change in circumstances being referred to as
an "Intervening Event" (it being understood that that in no event shall (i)
any action taken by either party pursuant to and in compliance with the
affirmative covenants set forth in _Section 5.3_, and the consequences of
any such action or (ii) the receipt, existence of or terms of an Acquisition
Proposal with respect to NetScout or an Acquisition Inquiry with respect to
NetScout or the consequences thereof constitute an Intervening Event); (A)
the NetScout Board determines in its good faith judgment, after consulting
with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel that an Intervening Event
has occurred; (B) the NetScout Board does not effect, or cause NetScout to
effect, a NetScout Change in Recommendation at any time within four (4)
business days after Danaher receives written notice from NetScout that the
NetScout Board has determined that an Intervening Event requires the NetScout
Board to effect, or cause NetScout to effect, a NetScout Change in
Recommendation (provided, a new notice shall be required with respect to any
change in circumstances and a new notice period of three (3) business days
shall begin); (C) during such applicable period, if requested by Danaher,
NetScout engages in good faith negotiations, and directs its financial
advisors and outside legal advisors to, engage in good faith negotiations,
with Danaher to amend this Agreement in such a manner that obviates the need
for the NetScout Board to effect, or cause NetScout to effect, a NetScout
Change in Recommendation as a result of such Intervening Event; and (D) the
NetScout Board determines in good faith, after having consulted with its
outside legal counsel, that, in light of such Intervening Event, a failure to
make a NetScout Change in Recommendation would be reasonably likely to
constitute a breach of the fiduciary duties of the NetScout Board to
NetScouts stockholders under applicable Legal Requirements.

 



50 (d) (i) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.2_ will prohibit NetScout
from taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position required by Rule
14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act and (ii) no
disclosure that the NetScout Board may determine in good faith (after
consultation with outside counsel) that it or NetScout, as applicable, is
required to make under applicable Legal Requirements will constitute a
violation of this Agreement; provided, however, that in any event under clause
(i) or (ii) the NetScout Board shall not make a NetScout Change in
Recommendation except in accordance with this _Section 5.2_. It is expressly
understood and agreed by the parties that a "stop, look and listen" or similar
communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) of the Exchange Act
shall not be deemed a NetScout Change in Recommendation; provided that the
NetScout Board expressly reaffirms the NetScout Board Recommendation within
five (5) business days of the public announcement of any applicable
Acquisition Proposal.

5.3 Regulatory Approvals and Related Matters.

 

(a) Each party shall file all notices, reports and other documents required to
be filed by such party with any Governmental Body with respect to the Mergers
and the other Contemplated Transactions, and to submit promptly any additional
information requested by any such Governmental Body. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing or _Section 5.3(b)_ below, NetScout and Danaher
each shall, promptly (and in any event, with respect to clause (x), within 10
business days after the date of this Agreement), prepare and file (x) the
notifications required under the HSR Act and (y) any applicable
mandatory foreign competition act filings in connection with the Merger.
NetScout and Danaher each shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the
expiration or early termination of any waiting period under the HSR Act, and
NetScout and Danaher shall each (i) cooperate with the other party in
connection with any filing or submission and in connection with any
investigation or other inquiry, including any proceeding initiated by a
private party, (ii) promptly supply the other party with any information
which may be required in order to effectuate notices, reports, documents or
other filings with any Governmental Body required to be made pursuant to the
HSR Act and any applicable mandatory foreign competition act filings
(the "Antitrust Filings"); and (iii) promptly supply any additional
information which reasonably may be required by any Governmental Body in
connection with Antitrust Filings or which the parties may reasonably deem
appropriate. Each of NetScout and Danaher will notify the other party
promptly upon the receipt of (and, if in writing, share a copy of) any
communication received by such party from, or given by such party to, any
Governmental Bodies and of any material communication received or given in
connection with any proceeding by a private party, in each case in connection
with the Contemplated Transactions. Whenever any event occurs that is required
to be set forth in an amendment or supplement to any Antitrust Filings,
NetScout or Danaher, as the case may be, will promptly inform the other party
of such occurrence and cooperate in filing with the applicable Governmental
Body (and share a copy of) such amendment or supplement. Each of NetScout and
Danaher shall give the other party prompt notice of the commencement or known
threat of commencement of any Legal Proceeding by or before any Governmental
Body with respect to the Mergers or any of the other Contemplated
Transactions, shall keep the other party reasonably informed as to the status
of any such Legal Proceeding or threat, and, in connection with any such Legal
Proceeding, will permit authorized representatives of the other party to be
present at each meeting or conference relating to any such Legal Proceeding
and to have access to and be consulted in connection with any document,
opinion or proposal made or submitted to any Governmental Body in connection
with any such Legal Proceeding.

 

(b) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement
and subject to _Section 5.3(b)_, each of NetScout, Danaher, Merger Sub and
Newco agrees to use its

 



51  reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary
or advisable to satisfy each of the conditions set forth in _Sections 6_ and
_7_ , consummate the Mergers and make effective the other Contemplated
Transactions (provided that no party shall be required to waive any of the
conditions set forth in _Sections 6_ or _7_ , as applicable, to its
obligations to consummate the Mergers and the other Contemplated
Transactions). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, but subject
to _Section 5.3(b)_, each party to this Agreement agrees to use its
reasonable best efforts to: (i) as promptly as practicable, prepare and file
all filings (if any) and give all notices (if any) required to be made and
given by such party in connection with the Mergers and the other Contemplated
Transactions; (ii) obtain each Consent (if any) required to be
obtained (pursuant to any applicable Legal Requirement or Contract, or
otherwise) by such party in connection with the Mergers or any of the other
Contemplated Transactions (including NetScout providing a guarantee of Newcos
obligations reasonable necessary to obtain such Consents); and (iii) lift any
restraint, injunction or other legal bar to the Mergers.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 5.3_, neither
NetScout, Danaher, Merger Sub nor Newco shall have any obligation under this
Agreement (except as specifically set forth in this Agreement, the
Distribution Agreement or any other Transaction Document) to divest or agree
to divest (or cause any of its Subsidiaries to divest or agree to divest) any
of its respective material businesses, material product lines or material
assets, or to take or agree to take (or cause any of its Subsidiaries to take
or agree to take) any other material action or agree (or cause any of its
Subsidiaries to agree) to any material limitation or material restriction on
any of its respective material businesses, material product lines or material
assets, except as would not, or as would not reasonably be expected to,
involve the divestiture of assets that generated in the aggregate more than
10% of the combined gross revenues of the Communications Companies and the
NetScout Companies for the 12 months ending June 27, 2014 (a "Burdensome
Condition") (it being understood that no such action shall be considered for
purposes of determining whether a NetScout Material Adverse Effect or
Newco Material Adverse Effect has occurred or is reasonably likely to occur
and the parties shall not be required to take any of the foregoing actions in
this clause (c) unless the effectiveness of such action is conditioned on the
Closing). Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such divestiture of assets may
occur if such divestiture would constitute a Disqualifying Action (as defined
in the Tax Matters Agreement).

 

(d) Each party shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, acquire or
agree to acquire any business or entity, or otherwise acquire or agree to
acquire any assets, if doing so could reasonably be expected to delay or
prevent consummation of the Contemplated Transactions, increase the risk of
not obtaining any consents of any Governmental Body necessary to consummate
the Contemplated Transactions or give rise to a requirement to obtain any
additional Governmental Authorizations not currently required to consummate
the Contemplated Transactions.

 

5.4 Disclosure. NetScout and Danaher shall consult with each other before
issuing any press release or otherwise making any public statement regarding
this Agreement or the Contemplated Transactions. Danaher shall consult with
NetScout and consider the views and comments of NetScout before any of the
Communications Companies or any of their Representatives sends any emails
or other documents to the Newco Associates generally or otherwise communicate
with the Newco Associates generally, with respect to the Mergers or any of the
other Contemplated Transactions. NetScout shall consult with Danaher and
consider the views and comments of Danaher before any of the NetScout
Companies or any of their Representatives sends any emails or other documents
to the Danaher Associates generally or otherwise communicate with the Danaher

without such consultation or consent, make any public statement in response to

public statements made jointly by the parties (or individually, if approved
by the other party), (ii) each

 



52  party may, without the prior consent of the other party hereto, issue any
such press release or make any such public announcement or statement as may be
required by Legal Requirement or the rules and regulations of the NASDAQ
Global Select Market (with respect to NetScout) and the New York Stock
Exchange (with respect to Danaher), in which case such party shall use its
reasonable best efforts to consult in good faith with the other party hereto
prior to issuing any such press release or making any such public announcement

(i) is unwilling or unable to serve at the Effective Time, (ii) is unwilling

Effective Time, each of NetScout, Danaher and Newco shall take all such steps
as may be required (to the extent permitted under applicable Legal
Requirements) to approve in advance in accordance with the procedures set

set forth in this Agreement. Danaher shall take all action necessary to cause
Newco, prior to the Effective Time, to perform its obligations under this
Agreement and to consummate the Contemplated Transactions upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement.

5.12 Securityholder Litigation.

 

(a) Danaher shall give NetScout the right to participate in the defense or
settlement of any securityholder litigation against Danaher and/or the
Danaher Board relating to the Contemplated Transactions. In no event shall
Danaher enter into or agree to any settlement with respect to such
securityholder litigation without NetScouts prior written consent (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 



54 (b) NetScout shall give Danaher the right to participate in the defense or
settlement of any securityholder litigation against NetScout and/or the
NetScout Board relating to the Contemplated Transactions. In no event shall
NetScout enter into or agree to any settlement with respect to such

(c) For purposes of this _Section 5.12_, "participate" means that the non-
litigating party will be kept apprised of proposed strategy and other
significant decisions with respect to any securityholder litigation by the
litigating party (to the extent the attorney-client privilege between the
litigating party and its counsel is not undermined or otherwise affected), and
the non-litigating party may offer comments or suggestions with respect to the
litigation but will not be afforded any decision making power or authority
over the litigation, except for the right to consent to any settlement as set
forth in _Section 5.12(a)_ or _Section 5.12(b)_, as applicable.

 

5.13 Financial Statements.

 

(a) Danaher shall engage its auditors to perform an audit of the financial
statements of (x) the Communications Business and (y) Newco (before giving
effect to the Internal Restructuring) and will use its reasonable best efforts
to provide NetScout, as promptly as practicable after the date hereof and
prior to November 15, 2014, with (i) the audited combined and consolidated
financial statements of (x) the Communications Business and (y) Newco (before
giving effect to the Internal Restructuring), including the combined and
consolidated balance sheets of (x) the Communications Business and (y) Newco
(before giving effect to the Internal Restructuring) as of December 31, 2012
and December 31, 2013, and the combined and consolidated statements of
earnings, cash flows and parent equity of (x) the Communications Business and
(y) Newco (before giving effect to the Internal Restructuring) for the years
ended December 31, 2011, December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2013 together with
a report on the financial statements from the independent accounts for the
Communications Business (collectively, the "Audited Financial Statements") and
(ii) the unaudited combined and consolidated financial statements of (x) the
Communications Business and (y) Newco (before giving effect to the Internal
Restructuring) for applicable interim periods ending prior to the date of this
Agreement required for SEC filings, prepared from the books and records of
Danaher and its Subsidiaries and in accordance with GAAP consistently applied
and the rules and regulations of the SEC, including the requirements of
Regulation S-X and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board Rules, and
which present fairly in all material respects the combined financial position
and combined results of operations of (x) the Communications Business and (y)
Newco (before giving effect to the Internal Restructuring) as of the dates and
for the periods shown therein (except as otherwise noted therein) (it being
understood, however, that the Communications Business has not been operating
historically as a separate "standalone" entity or reporting segment and,
therefore, the Audited Financial Statements and the unaudited
interim financial statements of the Communications Business will reflect
certain cost allocations made that may not reflect what would have been
incurred if the Communications Business had been a standalone business).
Danaher will use reasonable best efforts to procure, at its expense, the
delivery of the consents of its independent accountants required to be filed
with the NetScout Form S-4 Registration Statement or any future registration
statement until such independent accountant consents are no longer required.

(b) Danaher shall use its reasonable best efforts to, as promptly as
practicable and no later than forty five (45) calendar days after the end of
any fiscal quarter or sixty (60) calendar days after the end of any fiscal
year (or as promptly thereafter as possible), prepare and furnish to NetScout
copies of financial statements of the Communications Business as of and for
the periods ending on any fiscal quarterly and annual periods ending after the
date of this Agreement and prior to the Closing Date, in each case together
with the notes thereto, and prepared from the books and records of Danaher

 



55  and its Subsidiaries and in accordance with GAAP with no exception or
qualification thereto (it being understood, however, that the Communications
Business has not been operating historically as a separate "standalone"
entity or reporting segment and, therefore, the financial statements of the
Communications Business will reflect certain cost allocations made that may
not reflect what would have been incurred if the Communications Business had
been a standalone business) applied on a consistent basis through the periods
involved (except as may otherwise be required under GAAP) and the rules and
regulations of the SEC, including the requirements of Regulation S-X, and, in
the case of the combined financial statements of the Communications Business
for any fiscal year, Danaher shall use its reasonable best efforts to ensure
that such financial statements shall be audited and accompanied by a report of
the independent accountants for the Communications Business and for any
quarterly period, Danaher shall use its reasonable best efforts to ensure that
such financial statements shall be reviewed by the independent accountants for
the Communications Business. When delivered, such financial statements shall
present fairly in all material respects the combined financial position and
combined and consolidated results of operations of the Communications Business
as of the dates and for the periods shown therein. Danaher acknowledges that
NetScouts ability to comply with its obligations under _Section 5.1_ depend,
in part, on Danahers timely compliance with this _Section 5.13_, and
therefore NetScout shall be afforded a reasonable period to comply with such
obligations based upon the timing of Danaher providing the financial
statements herein contemplated.

 

(c) In connection with the filing of the NetScout Form S-4 Registration
Statement and other SEC filings, Danaher shall use its reasonable efforts
during the Pre-Closing Period and after the Closing to (i) cooperate with
NetScout to prepare pro forma financial statements that comply with the rules
and regulations of the SEC to the extent required for SEC filings, including
the requirements of Regulation S-X and (ii) provide and make reasonably
available upon reasonable notice the senior management employees of Danaher to
discuss the materials prepared and delivered pursuant to this  _Section
5.13(c)_. NetScout shall, promptly upon request by the Danaher, reimburse
Danaher for all documented and reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred by
Danaher or its Subsidiaries for actions taken at the request of NetScout
pursuant to this _Section 5.13(c)_ following the Closing.

5.14 Financing. Danaher and the Communications Companies shall, and shall
cause their respective Representatives to, use commercially reasonable efforts
to provide such cooperation (including with respect to timeliness) to
NetScout, at NetScouts sole expense, in connection with the arrangement of
the Debt Financing as may be reasonably requested by NetScout, including by
using commercially reasonable efforts in providing to NetScout and its Debt
Financing Sources from time to time information regarding the Communications
Companies reasonably requested by the lenders providing the Debt Financing
(it being understood that such information shall not be required to be of a
level of detail greater than the information made available by Danaher to
NetScout in the virtual data room maintained by Danaher on the Data Site from
Merrill Corporation); provided that, in all cases, such activities do not
interfere with or disrupt the operation and management of the Communications
Business; provided, however, that, irrespective of the above, no obligation
of Danaher or its Subsidiaries (including the Communications Companies) under
any certificate, document or instrument shall be effective until the Effective
Time (except for customary pre-filing of UCC financing statements) and none
of Danaher or its Subsidiaries (including the Communications Companies) shall
be required to take any action (A) under any certificate, document or
instrument that is not contingent upon the Closing (including the entry into
any agreement that is effective before the Effective Time) or that would be
effective prior to the Effective Time (except, in any such case, for customary
pre-filing of UCC financing statements) or (B) that would reasonably be
expected to cause any director, officer or employee of Danaher or its
Subsidiaries (including the Communications Companies) to incur any personal
liability. For the avoidance of doubt, none of the Danaher or the
Communications Companies shall be required to pay any commitment or
other similar fee in connection with, or incur any other expenses or costs
associated with NetScouts arrangement of the Debt Financing. NetScout shall,
promptly upon request by the Danaher, reimburse

 



56  Danaher for all documented and reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred by
Danaher or its Subsidiaries (including the Communications Companies) in
connection with this _Section 5.14_. NetScout shall indemnify and hold
harmless Danaher and its Subsidiaries (including the Communications Companies)
and their respective Representatives from and against any and all liabilities,
losses, damages, claims, costs, reasonable expenses, interest, awards,
judgments and penalties suffered or incurred in connection with the
arrangement of the Debt Financing (including any action taken in accordance
with this _Section 5.14_) and any information utilized in
connection therewith (other than information relating to Danaher and its
Subsidiaries (including the Communications Companies) provided by Danaher in
writing specifically for use in the Debt Financing offering documents);
provided, however, that NetScout shall not be obligated to indemnify and hold
harmless Danaher and its Subsidiaries (including the Communications Companies)
and their respective Representatives pursuant to this sentence the extent any
such otherwise indemnifiable proximately resulted from the willful
misconduct, gross negligence or fraud of Danaher and its Subsidiaries
(including the Communications Companies). Further, and for avoidance of doubt,
NetScouts obligations to effect the Contemplated Transactions shall not
be subject to its ability to obtain Debt Financing, or any alternative
financing, nor shall they be subject to any form of financing contingency.

 

5.15 Covenant Not to Compete.

 

(a) In furtherance of the Mergers and the Contemplated Transactions, Danaher
covenants and agrees that, for a period beginning on the Effective Time and
ending on the two (2) year anniversary of the Effective Time, neither Danaher
nor any of its Subsidiaries shall, without the prior written consent of
NetScout, engage in, directly or indirectly, the Communications Business as
conducted as of the Effective Time (the "NetScout Restricted Business")
anywhere throughout the world. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the
foregoing:

 

(i) Nothing in this _Section 5.15(a)_ shall prohibit Danaher or its
Subsidiaries from engaging in the businesses conducted by Danaher or its
Subsidiaries (excluding the Communications Business) as of the Effective Time;

 

(ii) The restrictions set forth in this _Section 5.15(a)_ shall not apply to
any joint venture or non-consolidated entity in which Danaher or its
Subsidiaries owns a non-controlling interest;

(iii) Danaher may acquire interests in or securities of any Person engaged in
the NetScout Restricted Business where the revenues of such Person that are
derived from the NetScout Restricted Business are (A) thirty-five percent
(35%) or less of such Persons total revenues or (B) less than $50,000,000
annually;

(iv) In the event that Danaher completes a business combination transaction
with a Person that is engaged in any NetScout Restricted Business, which
transaction results in the holders of the voting securities of Danaher
outstanding immediately prior to the consummation of such transaction owning
less than 50% of the voting power of the voting securities of Danaher or the
surviving entity in the transaction or any parent thereof outstanding
immediately after the consummation of such transaction, such surviving entity
or parent or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates (but not Danaher or any of
its Subsidiaries) may engage in any NetScout Restricted Business;

 

(v) Nothing set forth in this _Section 5.15(a)_ shall prohibit Danaher or its
Subsidiaries from owning not in excess of 10% in the aggregate of any class
of capital stock or other equity interest of any publicly traded Person
engaged in the NetScout Restricted Business;

 



57 (vi) Danaher may acquire interests in or securities of any Person as
an investment by their pension funds or funds of any other benefit plan of
Danaher whether or not such Person is engaged in any NetScout Restricted
Business; and

 

(vii) Danaher may perform its obligations under this Agreement and the
Transaction Documents.

 

The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that nothing herein shall be deemed
to require Danaher to give notice to or obtain the consent of NetScout in
order to engage in any activity or transaction of the types described in
_Section 5.15(a)(i)_ through _(vii)_.

(b) Danaher acknowledges and agrees that the covenants included in _Section
5.15(a)_ are, taken as a whole, reasonable in their geographic and temporal
coverage and Danaher shall not raise any issue of geographic or temporal
reasonableness in any proceeding to enforce such covenant; provided, however,
that (i) if the final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction declares
that any term or provision of this _Section 5.15_ is invalid or
unenforceable, the parties hereto agree that the court making such
determination shall have the power to limit the term or provision, to delete
specific words or phrases, or to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or
provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that
comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term
or provision, and this _Section 5.15_ shall be enforceable as so modified and
(ii) in the event such court does not exercise the power granted to it in the
prior clause, the parties hereto agree to replace such invalid or
unenforceable term or provision with a valid and enforceable term or provision
that will achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business and
other purposes of such invalid or unenforceable term. Danaher acknowledges
and agrees that in the event of a breach by Danaher of the provisions of this
_Section 5.15_, monetary damages shall not constitute a sufficient remedy.
Consequently, in the event of any such breach, NetScout may, in addition to
any other rights and remedies existing in its favor, apply to any court of law
or equity of competent jurisdiction for specific performance and/or
preliminary and final injunctive relief or other relief in order to enforce
or prevent any violation of the provisions hereof, without the necessity of
proving actual damages or posting a bond.

 

5.16 Non-Solicitation of Employees. Danaher and NetScout each agree that,
except as specifically set forth below, for a period of three (3) years from
and after the Closing Date (the "Non-Solicit Period"), they shall not, and
they shall cause their respective Subsidiaries not to, without the prior
written consent of the other party, directly or indirectly, solicit to hire
(or cause or seek to cause to leave the employ of the other party or the other
partys Subsidiary), or solicit to enter into a consulting agreement with, (a)
for the first year of the Non-Solicit Period, any employee or category of
employee and (b) for the second and third year of the Non-Solicit Period, any
executive officer or senior manager, in each case, of the other party or the
other partys Subsidiaries. The restrictions set forth in this  _Section
5.16_ shall not apply to (i) general solicitations (such as advertisements)
for employment placed by a party or any partys Subsidiary and not
specifically targeted at the other partys employees (or the employees of a
Subsidiary of the other party), (ii) responding to or hiring any employee of
the other party (or of the other partys Subsidiary) who contacts a party
without any prior solicitation (other than as permitted by clause (i)
above) or (iii) the solicitation or hiring of (or entering into a consulting
agreement with) any employee of the other party (or the other partys
Subsidiary) who is contacted by a recruitment agency (provided that such party
and its Representatives did not identify any employees of the other party to
such recruitment agency or otherwise instruct such agency to target any
employees of the other party), in each case with no other action by such party
or its Representatives in violation of this provision.

 



58 5.17 Agreement for Exchange of Information.

 

(a) Generally. NetScout and its Affiliates, on the one hand, and Danaher and

part of such efforts, to the extent reasonably necessary for the preparation
of financial statements or completing an audit or review of financial

NetScout will authorize and direct its auditors to make available to Danahers
auditors, within a reasonable time prior to the date of Danahers auditors

perform the annual audits and quarterly reviews of Newco and (y) work papers

control of the Communications Companies and (y) the officers and employees of
the Communications Companies, so that Danaher may conduct reasonable audits

Companies; provided, however, that such access will not be unreasonably
disruptive to the business and affairs of the Communications Companies.

third-party costs, if any, incurred in connection with this Section
5.17(b)(ii).

(c) Ownership of Information. Any Information owned at a particular moment in
time by a party hereto that is provided to another party hereto pursuant to

NetScout will take all actions necessary, including adopting any required plan
amendments and obtaining any necessary consents, such that the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (either alone or in connection with any
other circumstance or event) will not (i) constitute a change in control,

(a) by mutual written consent of NetScout and Danaher;

 

(b) by either NetScout or Danaher if the First Merger shall not have been
consummated by October 12, 2015 (such applicable date, the "End Date");
provided, further, that a party shall not be permitted to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(b)_ if the failure to consummate the
First Merger by the End Date is primarily attributable to a failure on the
part of such party to perform any covenant or obligation in this Agreement
required to be performed by such party at or prior to the Effective Time;

 

(c) by either NetScout or Danaher if a court of competent jurisdiction or
other Governmental Body shall have issued a final and nonappealable Order, or

been held and completed and NetScouts stockholders shall have taken a final
vote on the issuance of shares of NetScout Common Stock pursuant to the First
Merger; and (ii) the issuance of shares of NetScout Common Stock pursuant to
the First Merger shall not have been approved at the NetScout Stockholders

but only within the first twenty (20) business days after NetScout has
confirmed in writing to Danaher that a NetScout Triggering Event has
occurred;

(f) by NetScout if: (i) any of Danahers or Newcos representations and
warranties contained in this Agreement shall be inaccurate as of the date of
this Agreement such that the condition set forth in _Section 6.1(a)_ or the
condition set forth in _Section 6.1(b)_ would not then be satisfied, or
shall have become inaccurate as of a date subsequent to the date of this
Agreement (as if made on such subsequent date) such that the condition set
forth in _Section 6.1(a)_ or the condition set forth in  _Section 6.1(b)_
would not then be satisfied; or (ii) any of Danahers or Newcos covenants or
obligations contained in this Agreement shall have been breached such that the
condition set forth in _Section 6.2_ would not be satisfied; provided,
however, that, for purposes of clauses "(i)" and "(ii)" above, if an
inaccuracy in any of Danahers or Newcos representations and warranties (as
of the date of this Agreement or as of a date subsequent to the date of this
Agreement) or a breach of a covenant or obligation by Danaher or Newco is
curable by Danaher or Newco by the End Date and Danaher and Newco is
continuing to exercise its reasonable best efforts to cure such inaccuracy or
breach, then NetScout may not terminate this Agreement under this _Section
8.1(f)_ on account of such inaccuracy or breach unless such inaccuracy or
breach shall remain uncured for a period of 30 days commencing on the
date that NetScout Danaher gives Danaher notice of such inaccuracy or breach

condition set forth in  _Section 7.1(b)_ would not then be satisfied, or
shall have become inaccurate as of a date subsequent to the date of this
Agreement (as if made on such subsequent date) such that the condition set
forth in _Section 7.1(a)_ or the condition set forth in _Section 7.1(b)_
would not then be satisfied; or (ii) any of NetScouts or Merger Subs
covenants or obligations contained in this Agreement shall have been breached
such that the condition set forth in _Section 7.2_ would not be satisfied;
provided, however, that, for purposes of clauses "(i)" and "(ii)" above, if an
inaccuracy in any of NetScouts or Merger Subs representations and warranties
(as of the date of this Agreement or as of a date subsequent to the date of
this Agreement) or a breach of a covenant or obligation by NetScout or the
Merger Subs is curable by NetScout or the Merger Subs by the End Date and
Danaher is continuing to exercise its reasonable best efforts to cure such
inaccuracy or breach, then Danaher may not terminate this Agreement under this
_Section 8.1(g)_ on account of such inaccuracy or breach unless such
inaccuracy or breach shall remain uncured for a period of 30 days commencing
on the date that Danaher gives NetScout notice of such inaccuracy or breach;
or

(h) by NetScout, on or after June 30, 2015, if all of the conditions set
forth in _Section 6_ and _Section 7_ have been satisfied or waived (other
than conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing;
provided that such conditions are capable of being satisfied by such date)
other than: (i) _Sections 6.5_ and _7.5_ (but only to the extent that such
condition remains unsatisfied solely due to the failure of _Section 7.7(a)_
to be satisfied or waived); and (ii) _Section 7.7(a)_; provided that
NetScout shall not be permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
_Section 8.1(h)_ without providing Danaher with at least 14 calendar days
prior written notice (during which period Danaher may satisfy or waive such
condition).

 



65 8.2 Effect of Termination. In the event of the termination of this Agreement
as provided in _Section 8.1_, this Agreement shall be of no further force or

_Section 9_ shall survive the termination of this Agreement and shall remain
in full force and effect; (ii) the Confidentiality Agreement shall survive the
termination of this Agreement and shall remain in full force and effect in
accordance with its terms; and (iii) the termination of this Agreement shall
not relieve any party from any liability for any willful and material breach
of any representation, warranty, covenant, obligation or other provision
contained in this Agreement.

 

8.3 Fees and Expenses.

 

(a) Except as set forth in this _Section 8.3_, all fees and expenses incurred
in connection with this Agreement and the Contemplated Transactions shall be
paid by the party incurring such expenses, whether or not the Mergers are
consummated; provided, however, that NetScout and Danaher shall share equally
all printing costs and all filing fees incurred in connection with the filing
by the parties hereto of any notice or other document under the HSR Act and
applicable foreign competition filings. For the avoidance of doubt, all
Liabilities incurred by the Communications Companies in connection with
the Contemplated Transactions are deemed to be Liabilities of Danaher.

(b) In the event that:

 

(i) this Agreement is terminated by Danaher pursuant to _Section 8.1(e)_; or

 

(ii) this Agreement is terminated (x) by either NetScout (but only if Danaher
could have terminated pursuant to  _Section 8.1(b))_ or Danaher pursuant to
_Section 8.1(b)_ or (y) by Danaher pursuant to _Section 8.1(g)_, and (A)
after the date of this Agreement but before any such termination a bona fide
Acquisition Proposal with respect to NetScout shall have been made or
communicated to NetScout or shall have been made directly to the shareholders
of NetScout generally, and (B) within nine (9) months after such termination
NetScout shall have reached a definitive agreement to consummate, or shall
have consummated, such Acquisition Proposal; provided that for purposes of
this clause (B) all references in the definition of Acquisition Proposal to
15% shall instead refer to 50%;

 

then NetScout shall pay to Danaher, in cash by wire transfer of same-day
funds, (1) in the case of a fee payable pursuant to clause (b)(i) above,
within two business days after termination of this Agreement or (2) in the
case of a fee payable pursuant to clause (b)(ii) above, upon consummation of
an Acquisition Proposal, a nonrefundable fee in the amount of $55,000,000 (the
"NetScout Termination Fee"). Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, for
purposes of this _Section 8.3(b)_, any termination of this Agreement under
_Section 8.1(b)_ by NetScout shall be deemed to be a termination of this
Agreement under _Section 8.1(g)_ if Danaher is entitled to terminate this
Agreement under _Section 8.1(e)_ or _Section 8.1(g)_ (or would have been
entitled to terminate this Agreement but for Danahers inability to
terminate this Agreement as a result of any applicable waiting or notice
period as prescribed in such provisions), respectively, at the time of such
termination by NetScout.

 

(c) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by NetScout or Danaher
pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)_, and (A) after the date of this Agreement but
before the termination of this

 



66  Agreement a bona fide Acquisition Proposal with respect to NetScout shall
have been made or communicated to NetScout or shall have been made directly to
the shareholders of NetScout generally, and (B) within nine (9) months after
such termination NetScout shall have reached a definitive agreement to
consummate, or shall have consummated, an Acquisition Proposal, then NetScout
shall, upon consummation of an Acquisition Proposal, pay Danaher the NetScout
Termination Fee, in cash by wire transfer of same-day funds; provided that for
purposes of this clause (B) all references in the definition of Acquisition
Proposal to 15% shall instead refer to 50%.

 

(d) In the event that Danaher shall be entitled to receive the NetScout
Termination Fee, such fee is not a penalty but shall be liquidated damages in
a reasonable amount for any and all losses or damages suffered or incurred by
Danaher in connection with the matter forming the basis for such termination.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, other
than as provided in this _Section 8.3(d)_, the parties agree that the
payments contemplated by _Section 8.3(b)_ and _Section 8.3(c)_ represent the
sole and exclusive remedy of Danaher in respect of a termination pursuant to
_Section 8.1_ and that, except for the payment expressly set forth in this
_Section 8.3_, Danaher and its Affiliates shall not be entitled to bring or
maintain any other claim, action or proceeding against NetScout or its
Affiliates, shall be precluded from any other remedy against the other, at law
or in equity or otherwise, and shall not seek to obtain any recovery, judgment
or damages of any kind against NetScout (or any partner, member, stockholder,
director, officer, employee, Subsidiary, affiliate, agent or other
representative of the NetScout Companies) in connection with or arising out of
the termination of this Agreement, any breach of or by any party giving rise
to such termination or the failure of the Mergers and the other Contemplated
Transactions to be consummated. The parties hereby agree that the NetScout
Termination Fee (including the right to receive such fee or the payment of
such fee) shall not limit in any respect any rights or remedies available to
Danaher and Newco relating to any willful breach or willful failure to perform
any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement set forth in this
Agreement resulting, directly or indirectly, in the right to receive
such NetScout Termination Fee.

(e) If a party fails to pay when due any amount payable by such party under
this  _Section 8.3(e)_, then: (i) such party shall reimburse the other party
for all costs and expenses (including reasonable fees and disbursements of
counsel) incurred in connection with the collection of such overdue amount and
the enforcement by the other party of its rights under this _Section
8.3(e)_; and (ii) such party shall pay to the other party interest on such
overdue amount (for the period commencing as of the date such overdue amount
was originally required to be paid through the date such overdue amount is
actually paid to the other party in full) at a rate per annum equal to the
lower of: (A) 350 basis points over the "prime rate" (as announced by Bank of
America, N.A. or any successor thereto) in effect on the date such overdue
amount was originally required to be paid; or (B) the maximum rate permitted
by applicable Legal Requirements.

 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
NetScout in no event shall be obligated to pay more than one such NetScout
Termination Fee with respect to all such agreements and occurrences and such
termination.

9\. MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS

 

9.1 Amendment. This Agreement may be amended with the approval of the
respective NetScout Board and Danaher Board at any time prior to the
Effective Time (whether before or after approval of the issuance of NetScout
Common Stock pursuant to the First Merger by NetScouts stockholders);
provided, however, that, after any such approval of the issuance of shares of
NetScout Common Stock pursuant to the First Merger by NetScouts
stockholders, no amendment shall be made which by law or regulation of the
NASDAQ Global Select Market requires further approval of NetScouts
stockholders without the further approval of such stockholders. This
Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed by an
authorized representative of each of the parties hereto.

 



67 9.2 Waiver.

 

(a) No failure on the part of any party to exercise any power, right,
privilege or remedy under this Agreement, and no delay on the part of any
party in exercising any power, right, privilege or remedy under this
Agreement, shall operate as a waiver of such power, right, privilege or
remedy; and no single or partial exercise of any such power, right, privilege
or remedy shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or of any
other power, right, privilege or remedy.

(b) No party shall be deemed to have waived any claim arising out of this
Agreement, or any power, right, privilege or remedy under this Agreement
(including under _Section 6_, with respect to NetScout and Merger Sub and
_Section 7_ with respect to Danaher and Newco), unless the waiver of such
claim, power, right, privilege or remedy is expressly set forth in a written
instrument duly executed and delivered on behalf of such party; and any such
waiver shall not be applicable or have any effect except in the specific
instance in which it is given.

9.3 No Survival of Representations, Warranties and Agreements. The covenants
and agreements that by their terms are to be performed following the Closing
pursuant to this Agreement, the Distribution Agreement or any other
Transaction Agreement shall survive the Closing in accordance with their
terms, and all other covenants and agreements herein and therein shall
terminate and shall not survive the Closing. Except as provided in the
immediately following sentence, none of the representations and warranties
contained in this Agreement or in any certificate or instrument delivered
pursuant to this Agreement shall survive the Closing. Solely for purposes of
the indemnification provisions set forth in Article IV of the Distribution
Agreement, the representations and warranties set forth in the first sentence
of  _Section 2.6(a)_, _Section 2.6(b)_, the first sentence of _Section
2.8(d)_ and _Section 2.8(g)_ shall survive until the one (1) year anniversary
of the Closing. The Confidentiality Agreement shall survive the execution and
delivery of this Agreement and any termination of this Agreement, and the
provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement shall apply to all information and
material furnished by any party or its representatives thereunder
or hereunder.

9.4 Entire Agreement; Counterparts; Exchanges by Facsimile. This Agreement,
including the schedules, exhibits and amendments hereto and the other
agreements referred to herein constitute the entire agreement and supersede
all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among or
between any of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and
thereof; provided, however, that the Confidentiality Agreement shall not be
superseded and shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with its
terms (it being understood that no provision in the Confidentiality Agreement
shall limit any partys rights or remedies in the case of fraud). This
Agreement may be executed in several counterparts, each of which shall be
deemed an original and all of which shall constitute one and the same
instrument. The exchange of a fully executed Agreement (in counterparts or
otherwise) by facsimile or electronic transmission shall be sufficient to bind
the parties to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

 

9.5 Applicable Law; Jurisdiction; Specific Performance; Remedies. This
Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of
the State of Delaware, regardless of the laws that might otherwise govern
under applicable principles of conflicts of laws thereof. In any action
between any of the parties arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any
of the Contemplated Transactions: (a) each of the parties irrevocably and
unconditionally consents and submits

 



68  to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the Court of Chancery of the
State of Delaware or, if under applicable Legal Requirements, exclusive
jurisdiction over such matter is vested in the federal courts, any federal
court in the State of Delaware and any appellate court from any thereof; and
(b) each of the parties irrevocably waives the right to trial by jury. Each of
the parties hereto further agrees that, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law, service of any process, summons, notice or document by U.S.
registered mail to such Persons respective address set forth in _Section
9.8_ will be effective service of process for any claim, action, suit or
other proceeding in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or, to the
extent required by law, any federal court in the State of Delaware, with
respect to any matters to which it has submitted to jurisdiction as set forth
in this paragraph. The parties hereto hereby agree that a final judgment in
any such claim, suit, action or other proceeding will be conclusive, subject
to any appeal, and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the
judgment or in any other manner provided by applicable law. The parties agree
that irreparable damage would occur and that the parties would not have any
adequate remedy at law in the event that any of the provisions of this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were
otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be
entitled to specific performance and injunctive or other equitable relief to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms
and provisions of this Agreement without the requirement for the posting of
any bond, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at law or in equity. All rights and remedies existing under this
Agreement are cumulative to, and not exclusive of, any rights or remedies
otherwise available.

9.6 Disclosure Letters. The Danaher Disclosure Letter shall be arranged in
separate parts corresponding to the numbered and lettered sections contained
in _Section 2_. The NetScout Disclosure Letter shall be arranged in separate
parts corresponding to the numbered and lettered sections contained in 
_Section 3_. For purposes of this Agreement: (a) each statement or other item
of information set forth in the Danaher Disclosure Letter is intended only to
qualify and limit the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements
of Danaher and Newco contained in this Agreement and shall not be deemed to
expand in any way the scope or effect of any such representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements; and (b) each statement or other item of information
set forth in the NetScout Disclosure Letter is intended only to qualify and
limit the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of NetScout
and Merger Sub contained in this Agreement and shall not be deemed to expand
in any way the scope or effect of any such representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements. The Danaher Disclosure Letter and NetScout
Disclosure Letter shall each be delivered as of the date hereof, and no
amendments or modifications thereto shall be made without the prior written
consent of Danaher and NetScout, as applicable. Any purported update or
modification to the Danaher Disclosure Letter or NetScout Disclosure Letter
after the date hereof without the prior written consent of Danaher and
NetScout, as applicable, shall be disregarded.

9.7 Assignability; No Third Party Rights. This Agreement shall be binding
upon, and shall be enforceable by and inure solely to the benefit of, the
parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns; provided, however,
that neither this Agreement nor any partys rights or obligations hereunder
may be assigned or delegated by such party without the prior written consent
of the other parties, and any attempted assignment or delegation of this
Agreement or any of such rights or obligations by any party without the prior
