the Post-Closing NWC Statement, provide written notice thereof to the
Purchaser (the " _NWC Dispute Notice_ "), which shall provide reasonable
detail concerning each item that it disputes on the Post-Closing NWC Statement
and include reasonable support for each such position. During such thirty

Statement is being disputed as provided in this _Section 2.5(b)_, the
Purchaser shall provide the Seller and its representatives with reasonable
access, upon reasonable notice and during times mutually and reasonably
agreeable to the Purchaser and the Seller to the books, records and working

16  delivers an NWC Dispute Notice within the thirty (30) day period, such Post-

period of fifteen (15) Business Days after receipt by the Purchaser of the NWC
Dispute Notice, the Purchaser and the Seller shall use good faith commercially
reasonable efforts to resolve the disputed items on the NWC Dispute Notice
between themselves and, if they are able to resolve all of such disputed items

the " _Final Post-Closing NWC Statement_ ", and shall be final and binding
upon all parties. If the Purchaser and the Seller are unable to resolve all of

Business Day period, they shall jointly engage a nationally-recognized
accounting firm reasonably acceptable to the Purchaser and the Seller, with no
prior relationship with any of the parties or any of their
respective Affiliates (the " _Independent Accountants_ ") and submit the
disputed items to the Independent Accountants for resolution. The Independent
Accountants shall act as experts and not arbiters and shall determine only
those items on the Post-Closing NWC Statement being disputed by the Purchaser
and the Seller as of the time of engagement of the Independent Accountants.
The Purchaser and the Seller shall instruct the Independent Accountants to not
assign a dollar amount to any item in dispute greater than the greatest
dollar amount for such item assigned by the Purchaser, on the one hand, or the
Seller, on the other hand (as applicable), or less than the dollar amount for
such item assigned by the Purchaser, on the one hand, or the Seller, on the
other hand (as applicable). Promptly, but no later than thirty (30) days after
engagement, the Independent Accountants shall deliver a written report to the
Purchaser and the Seller as to their resolution of the disputed items, which
include the resulting Post-Closing NWC Statement incorporating such
resolution. The Post-Closing NWC Statement, as determined by the Independent
Accountants, shall be conclusively deemed the " _Final Post-Closing
NWC Statement_ " and shall be final and binding upon the parties. The NWC as
of the Effective Time set forth on the Final Post-Closing NWC Statement is
referred to herein as the " _Final NWC_." The fees and expenses of
the Independent Accountants incurred in connection with the resolution of

exceptions set forth in the Purchaser Disclosure Schedule, as follows:

5.1 _Existence; Good Standing; Authority; Enforceability_.

 

(a) The Purchaser is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in
good standing under the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia and has all
requisite power and authority to own and operate its properties and to conduct
its business as now conducted. The Purchaser is duly licensed or qualified to
do business as a foreign corporation and is in good standing under the laws
of each other jurisdiction under which such licensing or qualification is
necessary, except where the failure to be so licensed or qualified or to be in
good standing would not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse
effect upon on the ability of the Purchaser to perform its obligations under
this Agreement.



 

34 (b) The Purchaser has the requisite corporate power and authority to execute
and deliver this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents to which it is
a party, to perform its obligations hereunder and thereunder and to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. The execution and delivery
of this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents to which it is a party,
the performance by the Purchaser of its obligations hereunder and thereunder,
and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, have
been duly authorized by all requisite corporate action on the part of the
Purchaser, and no other corporate authorization or proceedings on the part of
the Purchaser are required therefor.

 

(c) This Agreement and each other Transaction Document to which it is a party
has been duly executed and delivered by the Purchaser and, assuming the due
authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Seller and the
other parties thereto (as applicable), each constitutes a legal, valid and
binding obligation of the Purchaser, enforceable against the Purchaser
in accordance with its terms, except for the Equitable Exceptions.

5.2 _No Conflict_. Except as set forth in  _Section 5.2_ of the Purchaser
Disclosure Schedule, neither the execution, delivery or performance by the
Purchaser of this Agreement nor the consummation by the Purchaser of the
Transactions to which it is a party will: (a) violate, conflict with, breach
or constitute a default under (in each case, with or without the giving of
notice, the lapse of time or both), any of the provisions of: (i) any of the
Organizational Documents of the Purchaser; (ii) any material Contract to
which the Purchaser is a party, or by which the Purchaser or any of its
properties is bound; or (iii) any Law applicable to the Purchaser or any of
its properties or assets; or (b) give any Governmental Entity or

applicable Law. Except as listed in _Section 5.2_ of the Purchaser Disclosure
Schedule, no consent of any other Person, no notice to any other party under

filing or registration with, or authorization, consent or approval of, any
Governmental Entity or Judicial Authority is required to be made or obtained
by the Purchaser in connection with the execution and delivery by the
Purchaser of this Agreement or any of the other Transaction Documents to which
it is a party or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Purchaser
knows of no fact or circumstance relating to the Purchaser that would prevent
the issuance of any Required Seller Governmental Approvals.

 

5.3 _Investment Representations_. The Purchaser was not formed for the purpose
of acquiring the Equity Interests. The Purchaser is purchasing the Equity
Interests for investment purposes and not with a present view to, or for sale

been registered under the Securities Act or qualified under applicable state
securities laws and understands the restrictions on resale of the Equity
Interests imposed by the Securities Act and such applicable state
securities laws. The Purchaser also acknowledges that the Seller has no
obligation to register the Equity Interests, that there is presently no public
market for the Equity Interests, that there may never be a public market for
the Equity Interests, and that, even if such a market develops, the Purchaser
may never be able to sell or dispose of such Equity Interests and,
accordingly, the Purchaser must bear the economic risk of this investment
potentially indefinitely. The Purchaser is an "accredited investor," as that
term is defined in Rule 501 under Regulation D promulgated under the
Securities Act.

obligation, commitment, restriction or liability of any kind, in each case
that would impair or adversely affect such resources and capabilities.

 

5.5 _Brokers_. No broker, finder, investment banker or other Person is
entitled to any brokerage, finders or other fee or commission in connection
with the Transactions for which the Seller may become liable.

5.6 _No Other Representations or Warranties_. Except for the representations
and warranties contained in this _Article V_ , the Purchaser does not make any
express or implied representation or warranty concerning itself.

and its Affiliates, and its and their respective officers, employees,
accountants, counsel, financial advisers and other representatives, with
access during regular business hours upon reasonable prior notice to the
facilities and books and records (including Contracts) of the Company and the

6.5 _Confidentiality_.

 

(a) The Mutual Non-disclosure Agreement dated April 6, 2010 by and between the
Seller and the Purchaser is hereby terminated. During the Pre-Closing Period
and, if this Agreement is terminated without the Transactions being
consummated, for two (2) years after such termination, the Purchaser shall
not, except as and to the extent required by Law, use for any purpose
other than in connection with the consummation of the Transactions (including
disclosures to those of its directors, officers and employees and
representatives of its legal, accounting and financial advisors) or disclose
to the detriment of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, or the Seller, any
Confidential Information with respect to the Company or the Seller provided,
or to be provided, by the Company, any Company Subsidiary or the Seller or any
of their respective Affiliates, partners, directors, officers, consultants,
employees, agents, representatives or stockholders, including any information
provided pursuant to _Section 6.4_ (collectively, the " _Company Supplied
Information_ "). If the Purchaser is required by Law to disclose any Company
Supplied Information by or to any Judicial Authority or Governmental



 

38  Entity, the Purchaser shall, prior to such disclosure, to the extent legally
permitted, promptly notify the Seller of such requirement. The Seller shall
have the right, at its expense, to object to such disclosure and to seek
confidential treatment of any Company Supplied Information to be disclosed on
such terms as it shall determine and, while the Seller objects and seeks
confidential treatment, the Purchaser shall, so long as it may lawfully do
so, not disclose such Company Supplied Information.

(b) Upon the termination of this Agreement pursuant to  _Article IX_ , the
Seller may deliver a written request to the Purchaser for the return or
destruction of the Company Supplied Information. Upon receipt of such written
request, the Purchaser shall, in accordance with the Sellers direction,
promptly either: (i) return to the Seller or (ii) destroy any such Company
Supplied Information in its possession, and shall, in either case, certify in
writing to the Seller that it has done so.

 

6.6 _Regulatory and Other Authorizations_.

 

(a) _Generally_. During the Pre-Closing Period, the Purchaser shall, and the
Seller shall (and shall cause the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to),
in good faith and in a reasonably timely manner, use their respective
commercially reasonable efforts to: (i) take or cause to be taken all
appropriate action, do or cause to be done all things necessary, proper
or advisable, and execute and deliver such documents, as may be required to
carry out the provisions of this Agreement and consummate and make effective
the Transactions; and (ii) cause the Closing conditions contained in _Article
VIII_  applicable to such Person to be satisfied. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the Purchaser shall, and the Seller shall (and
shall cause the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to), in good faith and in
a reasonably timely manner, use their respective commercially reasonable
efforts to cause all Consents listed in Sections _3.3_ , _4.2_ and _11.17(c)_
of the Company Disclosure Schedule to be obtained on or prior to the Closing
Date; provided, however, that the Seller will afford the Purchaser the
opportunity to review, approve and revise the form of any such Consent prior
to delivery to the applicable third party, such approval not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed. With respect to the contracts listed as
items #9 and 12 on _Section 3.3_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule
(collectively, the " _Relevant Contracts_ "), the Seller shall (and, prior to
the Closing, shall cause the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to) use
commercially reasonable efforts to assist the Purchaser in obtaining from the
counterparty to each Relevant Contract either: (i) an amendment to clarify
that, from and after the Closing, the Purchaser and its Affiliates (including
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries), on the one hand, and the Seller
and its Affiliates (including the Parent Company), on the other hand, shall
each not be responsible for the others actions or omissions under such
Relevant Contract; or (ii) a new contract between such counterparty, on the
one hand, and the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, on the other hand,
that is identical in all respects to such Relevant Contract, with the sole
exception being that the Seller and its Affiliates (including the Parent
Company) will not be parties thereto (collectively, the " _Relevant Contract
Amendments/New Contracts_ "). For the avoidance of doubt, the parties agree
and acknowledge that the Purchaser having received the Relevant Contract
Amendments/New Contracts shall not be a condition to the Purchasers
obligation to consummate the Closing. All consent or similar fees required to
be paid by the Seller, the Company or any Company Subsidiary to
contractual counterparties as a condition to receiving their consents will be
paid by the Seller. Except as otherwise permitted in this _Section 6.6_, the

 



 

39  parties will not take, or fail to take, any action that will have the effect
of delaying, impairing or impeding the Consents listed in Sections _3.3_ ,
_4.2_ and _11.17(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule from being obtained
on or prior to the Closing Date.

(b) _HSR_. If necessary, the Purchaser and the Seller shall: (i) make or
cause to be made all filings required of each of them or any of their
respective Affiliates under the HSR Act with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable and, in any event, within
seven (7) Business Days after the date of this Agreement; (ii) comply at the
earliest practicable date with any request under the HSR Act for additional
information, documents or other materials received by each of them from the
Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ "), the Antitrust Division of the United
States Department of Justice (the " _Antitrust Division_ ") or any other
Governmental Entity in respect of such filings or such transactions; (iii)
seek early termination of filings under the HSR Act; and (iv) use commercially
reasonable efforts to cooperate with each other in connection with any such
filing and in connection with resolving any investigation or other inquiry of
any of the FTC, the Antitrust Division or other Governmental Entity with
respect to any such filing. The Purchaser and the Seller shall each pay fifty
percent (50%) of the filing fees required to be paid under the HSR Act
in connection with such filings. The Purchaser and the Seller shall, to the
extent permissible under applicable law: (i) use commercially reasonable
efforts to furnish to each other all information required for any application
or other filing to be made pursuant to the HSR Act in connection with the
Transactions and otherwise coordinate their efforts in connection with such
filing; (ii) promptly inform the other party of any material written or oral
communication with any Governmental Entity regarding any such filing or
additional request (which shall include copies of any such written
communications); and (iii) otherwise reasonably consult and cooperate with one
another in connection with any analyses, appearances, presentations,
memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals made or submitted by or
on behalf of any party relating to proceedings under the HSR Act.

 

(c) _FCC and State PUCs_.

 

(i) Within five (5) Business Days after the date of this Agreement, the
parties shall commence preparing the necessary applications, notifications
and related filings for obtaining the Required Seller Governmental Approvals
from FCC and State PUCs, and such applications, notifications, and related
filings shall be filed with the applicable authorities as soon as reasonably
practicable thereafter but in no event later than ten (10) Business Days after
execution of this Agreement. Each party shall provide the other party with all
information necessary for the preparation of such applications, notifications
and filings on a timely basis, including those portions of such applications,
notifications and filings which are required to be completed by each party.
Counsel to the Purchaser shall prepare the initial draft of the
applications, notifications and filings for review and comment by the Seller
but all such applications, notifications and filings shall only be submitted
to the applicable Governmental Entity in a form reasonably acceptable to both
the Purchaser and the Seller. 

(ii) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the
parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to prosecute the FCC and
State PUC applications in good faith and with due diligence before the FCC and
the State PUCs and, in connection therewith, take such actions as may be
necessary or reasonably required in 



 

40  connection with the applications, including furnishing to the FCC and the
State PUCs any documents, materials, or other information requested by the FCC
and the State PUCs in order to obtain the Required Seller Governmental
Approvals as expeditiously as reasonably practicable. In addition, to the
extent reasonably practicable, the parties shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to: (A) promptly notify the other parties of any material
communication to that party from the FCC, any State PUC or any other Person
with respect to the FCC or the State PUC applications, as applicable; (B)
permit a representative of the other party reasonably acceptable to the first
party to attend and participate in substantive meetings (telephonic or
otherwise) with the FCC or any State PUC; and (C) permit the other party to
review in advance, as reasonable, any proposed written communication to the
FCC or any State PUC. No party shall, without the written consent of the
other party, knowingly take, or fail to take, any action if the intent or
reasonably anticipated consequence of such action or failure to act is, or
would be, to cause or materially increase the probability of the FCC or any
State PUC not to grant approval of any FCC application or of any State PUC
application or materially delay any such approval, to the material detriment
of the other parties. If there are any petitions for reconsideration, appeals
or similar filings made seeking to overturn the grant of the FCC Approval or
grant of any of the Consents of State PUCs, or if the FCC or a State PUC seeks
to reconsider such grant on its own motion, then the parties shall each use
commercially reasonable efforts to defend the applicable grants against such
actions. Each party shall be responsible for payment of its own attorneys
fees and related costs and expenses associated with obtaining any such
Consents of State PUCs or the FCC Approval.

6.7 _Disclosures Concerning the Transaction_.

 

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement, the
Purchaser and the Seller shall mutually agree upon a joint initial press
release concerning this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
which shall be disseminated at such time and in such manner as is agreed upon
in writing by Purchaser and the Seller. After such initial press release
is disseminated, each party may issue further press releases and similar
announcements without the consent of the other party, provided that each such
press release or similar announcement contains, with respect to information
concerning this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, solely
the information that is contained in such initial press release. Except as
provided above in this _Section 6.7(a)_, the Purchaser and the Seller will,
and will cause each of their respective officers, directors, employee, agents
and representatives to, maintain this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby in strict confidence, and will not, and will cause each of
their respective officers, directors, employee, agents and representatives to
not, issue or cause the publication of any press release or other public
announcement with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby without the prior consent of the other party.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in _Section 6.7(a)_, either
party may make such disclosures concerning this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby as are required under applicable law and
legal process or securities exchange listing requirements, in each case as
long as the disclosing party: (i) provides reasonable advance notice of
such requirement to the non-disclosing party so that the non-disclosing party
may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy; (ii) reasonably
cooperates with the non-disclosing party to obtain an appropriate protective
order or other reliable assurance that confidential



 

41  treatment will be accorded to such information; and (iii) discloses only
such information as the disclosing party is advised by legal counsel that such
disclosing party is legally required to disclose.

6.8 _Exclusivity_. During the Pre-Closing Period, the Seller shall, and shall
cause the Company, the Company Subsidiaries and their respective directors,
officers, partners, members, managers, trustees, employees, agents and
advisors (collectively, the " _Seller Representatives_ ") to, deal exclusively
with the Purchaser and its designated representatives regarding any and all
acquisitions of and investments in the FiberNet Business, whether by way of
merger, consolidation or other business combination with any other Person,
purchase or exchange of capital stock or other equity interests, purchase of
assets or otherwise (an " _Alternative Transaction_ ") and, without the prior
consent of the Purchaser, the Seller shall not, and shall cause the Company,
the Company Subsidiaries and the Seller Representatives to not: (a) solicit,
initiate or otherwise engage in any negotiations, discussions or other
communications with any other Person relating to any Alternative Transaction;
(b) provide information or documentation to any other Person with respect to
the Company, any of the Company Subsidiaries or any of their respective assets
in respect of any Alternative Transaction; or (c) enter into any Contract or
understanding with any other Person in respect of any
Alternative Transaction. The Seller shall, and shall cause the Company, the
Company Subsidiaries and the Seller Representatives to, cease immediately all
discussions and negotiations that commenced prior to the date of this
Agreement regarding any Alternative Transaction or would reasonably be
expected to lead to an Alternative Transaction.

6.9 _Notification_. During the Pre-Closing Period, the Purchaser and the
Seller shall each give written notice to the other promptly (and in any event
within five (5) Business Days) after acquiring actual knowledge of the
occurrence of any omission, event or action that: (a) has caused, or is
reasonably likely to cause the failure of such party to comply with or satisfy
in any material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied
with or satisfied by it under this Agreement; (b) is reasonably likely to
cause any of the respective representations and warranties of the Purchaser or
the Seller or Parent Company set forth in this Agreement to not be true and
correct in all material respects as of the Closing (disregarding for this
purpose any materiality or Material Adverse Effect qualifications contained
therein) and is not capable of cure prior to the Closing; (c) has caused, or
is reasonably likely to cause any condition to the other partys obligation
to consummate the Closing to not be satisfied; or (d) would otherwise be
reasonably expected to materially delay or prevent the consummation of the
Closing.

 

6.10 _Officer and Director/Manager Indemnification and Insurance_.

 

(a) The Purchaser agrees that all rights to indemnification and exculpation
from liability for acts or omissions occurring on or prior to the Closing
Date now existing in favor of the current or former directors, limited
liability company managers, officers or employees of the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries, as provided in their respective Organizational Documents
or in indemnification agreements (copies of which were provided by the Seller
to the Purchaser prior to the date of this Agreement), in each case in effect
as of the Closing, shall survive the Closing Date and shall continue in full
force and effect in accordance with their respective terms for a period of
not less than six (6) years after the Closing Date.



 

42 (b) The Seller shall be responsible for paying the cost of a non-cancelable
run-off insurance policy, for a period of six (6) years after the Closing
Date to provide insurance coverage for events, acts or omissions occurring on
or prior to the Closing Date for all persons who were directors, limited
liability company managers or officers of the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries on or prior to the Closing Date, which the Seller shall cause the
Company to procure and put into effect on or prior to the Closing Date.

 

6.11 _Employee Benefits_.

 

(a) Prior to the Closing, the Purchaser will identify for the Seller those
Company Benefit Plans which the Purchaser wants the Company and each Company
Subsidiary to terminate prior to Closing, and the Company and each Company
Subsidiary will cease participation in any other Company Benefit Plan.
Following the Closing, the employees of the Company and each Company
Subsidiary will be entitled to participate in any employee benefit plans,
programs and arrangements that the Purchaser provides for similarly-situated
employees, pursuant to the terms of such plans, programs and arrangements. The
Purchaser and the Company and each Company Subsidiary will take all necessary
action and cooperate to carry out the requirements of the foregoing. The
Purchaser shall cause the Company and each Company Subsidiary to honor all
rights to paid time off, including vacation, personal and sick days, accrued
by employees of the Company and each Company Subsidiary under any Company
Benefit Plan prior to the Closing. Until at least the first (1st) anniversary
of the Closing, the Purchaser shall cause the Company and each
Company Subsidiary to provide employee benefits under employee benefit plans
to the employees of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries that are, in the
aggregate, no less favorable than those provided to such persons pursuant to
Company Benefit Plans as of the Closing.

(b) With respect to any employee benefit plan, policy, program or arrangement
in which any employee of the Company or any Company Subsidiary first becomes
eligible to participate, on or after the Closing, and in which such employee
did not participate prior to the Closing, the Purchaser shall cause the
Company and each Company Subsidiary to: (i) waive all pre-existing
conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and
coverage requirements applicable to such employee under any such new plans in
which such employee may be eligible to participate after the Closing, except
to the extent such pre-existing conditions, exclusions or waiting periods
would apply under the analogous Company Benefit Plan; (ii) provide each such
employee with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid prior to
the Closing (to the same extent such credit was given under the analogous
Company Benefit Plan prior to the Closing) in satisfying any applicable
deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under any such new plan in which such
employee may be eligible to participate after the Closing; and (iii)
recognize all service of such employee for all purposes (including purposes of
eligibility to participate, vesting, and, entitlement to benefits, and, except
with respect to defined benefit pension plans, benefit accrual) in any such
new plan in which such employee may be eligible to participate after the
Closing.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 6.11_, in no
event shall this _Section 6.11_ be interpreted to: (i) prohibit any changes
to any employee benefit plan, policy, program or arrangement that
are required by applicable law; or (ii) require the Purchaser or the Company
or any Company Subsidiary to continue any particular Company Benefit Plan or

 



 

43  prevent the amendment or termination thereof. This _Section 6.11_ is not
intended to, and shall not be interpreted to, create any right of continued
employment for any employee of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries
and constitutes an agreement solely between the Purchaser and the Seller,
which shall not be enforceable by any such employee, or constitute an
agreement under which any such employee otherwise has any rights.

6.12 _Maintenance of Books and Records_. For a period of at least seven (7)
years after the Closing Date: (a) the Purchaser shall cause the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries to maintain their respective books and records in
existence as of the Closing Date; and (b) upon reasonable written notice, the
Purchaser shall cause the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to provide the
Seller and its representatives, employees, counsel and accountants access,
during normal business hours and upon reasonable advance notice, such books
and records relating to periods prior to the Closing Date, and shall permit
such Persons to examine and copy, at the sole cost and expense of the party
seeking access, such books and records to the extent reasonably requested by
any such Persons as is reasonably necessary for financial
reporting, accounting and Tax matters, the preparation and filing of any
returns, reports or forms or the defense of any claim or assessment;
_provided, however,_ that the Purchaser shall not be required to cause the
Company or any Company Subsidiary to furnish such books and records pursuant
to this _Section 6.12_ to the extent such books and records contain attorney-
client work product or the disclosure of such documents or materials would
violate any attorney-client privilege, confidentiality agreement or Law. The
parties agree to cooperate so that such access does not unreasonably disrupt
the normal operations of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries.

 

6.13 _Financing Matters_.

 

(a) The Seller acknowledges that the Purchaser will be obtaining financing to
fund a portion of the Purchase Price after the date of this Agreement,
although the Purchaser agrees and acknowledges that its obligation to
consummate the Closing will not be conditioned upon its receipt of any
financing or any of the terms thereof. In furtherance of such efforts, the
Purchaser will need to provide third parties, including lenders from whom the
Purchaser is obtaining such financing (the " _Financing Parties_ ") certain
information about the Company and the Company Subsidiaries that the Seller and
the Company have provided to the Purchaser in the negotiation of this
Agreement or otherwise (the " _Company Information_ "). Upon the reasonable
request of the Purchaser, the Seller agrees to provide the Company Information
to a Financing Party upon the execution by such Financing Party of a
confidentiality agreement, of scope and content reasonably acceptable to the
Seller. In addition, the Seller agrees to provide reasonable cooperation, as
reasonably requested by the Purchaser, in connection with the arrangement of,
and the negotiation of agreements with respect to, any such financing.

(b) Beginning on the date hereof and continuing following Closing, the Seller
shall use commercially reasonable efforts, at the Purchasers sole expense, to
provide the Purchaser with such information as the Purchaser may reasonably
request (including management representation letters required for any audit)
in connection with (i) the Purchasers efforts to cause the Annual Financial
Statements to be audited and to comply with Regulation S-X, and (ii) the
Purchasers preparation of  _pro forma_ financial information for purposes of
its reports or other filings (including any registration statement, any
amendment thereto, or any prospectus or prospectus supplement in connection
therewith) in accordance with Securities Act 



 

44  or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended; _provided, however_ ,
that the Purchaser agrees and acknowledges that completion of such audit,
compliance with Regulation S-X or preparation of such _pro forma_ financial
information shall not be a condition to its obligation to consummate the
Closing.

 

(c) Beginning on the date hereof and continuing following Closing, in the
event the SEC has comments or questions on any of the Annual Financial
Statements, the Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts, at the
Purchasers sole expense, to assist and reasonably cooperate with the
Purchaser, the Purchasers independent accountants and the SEC to resolve any
such issues and questions regarding such Annual Financial Statements and take
such commercially reasonably actions with respect to such Annual Financial
Statements as are necessary for the Purchaser to satisfy its obligations under
Regulation S-X. 

(d) Beginning on the date hereof and continuing following Closing, the Seller
shall use commercially reasonable efforts, at the Purchasers sole expense,
to cooperate with the Purchasers reasonable requests in connection with the
Purchasers compliance with applicable Laws with respect to the transactions
hereunder, including (i) providing access to its management upon reasonable
prior notice during normal business hours to assist with SEC reporting
obligations of the transactions hereunder, including the preparation by the
Purchaser of _pro forma_ financial statements and addressing purchase
accounting issues and (ii) allowing access to the Sellers independent
accountants (including to the extent required by such accountants, consent to
the release of their work papers to the Purchaser or the
Purchasers independent accountants), and discussing with the Sellers
independent accountants appropriate consents to fulfill the Purchasers
reporting requirements, including financial statements and the notes thereto.

 

(e) The Purchaser shall, promptly upon written request by the Seller,
reimburse the Seller for all reasonable costs to the extent such costs are
incurred by the Seller in connection with the cooperation provided by the
Seller pursuant to the terms of this _Section 6.13_ and the Purchaser shall
indemnify and hold harmless the Seller and its Affiliates, directors,
managers, officers, employees, shareholders, members and agents from and
against any and all Losses suffered or incurred by any of them in connection
with any financing or Sellers actions under this _Section 6.13_.

 

6.14 _Delivery of Financial Information_. During the Pre-Closing Period, the
Seller shall, and shall cause the Company to, furnish to the Purchaser, (a)
when available, but in no event later than ten (10) Business Days after the
end of each calendar month, (i) consolidated balance sheets and statements of
income for the FiberNet Business for the month then-ended, prepared in
accordance with GAAP (other than the omission of footnotes) and presenting
fairly, in all material respects, the financial condition and the results of
operations of the FiberNet Business as of such month-end, and for the one-
month period referred to in such financial statements (which shall also
include a Capital Expenditures roll-forward schedule for the FiberNet Business
for the month then-ended) and (ii) a comparison between (x) the actual amounts
as of and for such month and (y) the comparable amounts for the same month of
the prior year and as set forth in the budget of the Company; and (b) when
available, but in no event later than fifteen (15) Business Days after the end
of each calendar quarter, (i) consolidated balance sheets and statements of
income, for the FiberNet Business for the quarter then-ended,

 



 

45  prepared in accordance with GAAP (other than the omission of footnotes) and
presenting fairly, in all material respects, the financial condition and the
results of operations, of the FiberNet Business as of such quarter-end, and
for the three-month period referred to in such financial statements and (ii) a
comparison between (x) the actual amounts as of and for such quarter and (y)
the comparable amounts for the same quarter of the prior year and as set
forth in the budget of the Company.

6.15 _Non-Competition; Non-Solicitation; Non-Disparagement; Confidentiality_.
Conditioned and effective solely upon consummation of the Closing, the Parent
Company agrees as follows:

 

(a) _Non-Competition_. The Parent Company covenants and agrees that, for a
period of five (5) years after the Closing Date, it will not, and will cause
each of its Subsidiaries (which shall not, for the avoidance of doubt, include
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries) (collectively, the " _Parent
Subsidiaries_ ") to, without the prior written consent of the Purchaser,
directly or indirectly, perform services for, own, manage, operate, finance,
control, or engage or participate in the ownership, management, operation,
financing or control of, or be connected as a shareholder, director, officer,
agent, partner, joint venturer, employee, consultant or advisor with, any
Person which engages in the business of providing digital personal
communications services, local and long distance telephone services, high
capacity transport, data services for Internet access and wide area
networking or IPTV-based video services (the " _Restricted Business_ "),
located or doing business in: (i) the State of West Virginia; (ii) the City of
Winchester, Virginia; or (iii) any of the areas within the State of Kentucky
or the State of Ohio set forth on _Exhibit 6.15(a)_ hereto (collectively, the
" _Restricted Area_ ").

 

(b) _Non-Solicitation of Employees_. For a period of five (5) years from the
Effective Date, the Parent Company agrees that it shall not, and shall not
permit any of the Parent Subsidiaries to, without the prior written consent of
the Purchaser, directly or indirectly: (i) solicit, recruit, or encourage any
Person who is (as of the Closing) or was (during the six (6) month period
prior to Closing) an officer, director, executive, employee, agent or
independent contractor of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries to
leave his or her employment with the Company or such Company Subsidiary;
or (ii) hire, employ or otherwise engage any Person who is (as of the
Closing) or was (during the six (6) month period prior to Closing) an officer,
director, executive, employee, agent or independent contractor of the Company
or any of the Company Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this _Section 6.15(b)_, any general solicitation for employees, not
targeted specifically at officers, directors, executives, employees, agents or
independent contractors of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries,
including general advertisements such as newspaper or Internet advertisements,
and the subsequent hiring of any such employee, agent or independent
contractor shall not constitute a violation of this  _Section 6.15(b)_.

(c) _Confidentiality_. The Parent Company acknowledges and recognizes that the
Company Confidential Information is a valuable and unique asset of the
businesses of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, and that the Company
Confidential Information was acquired at considerable effort to the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries and is a valuable trade and business secret
which shall continue to belong to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
from and after the Closing. Therefore, the Parent Company covenants and
agrees 



 

46  that neither the Parent Company nor any of the Parent Subsidiaries will
disclose any Company Confidential Information to any other Person. At any
time, upon the Purchasers request, the Parent Company agrees to either
destroy or deliver to the Purchaser all Company Confidential Information
remaining in its possession that is reasonably capable of being destroyed or
delivered; _provided_ , that, any Company Confidential Information not so
destroyed or delivered shall remain subject to the confidentiality
restrictions in the prior sentence of this _Section 6.15(c)_. For purposes of
this _Section 6.15(c)_, the term " _Company Confidential Information_ "
means information of a confidential nature and includes confidential
information about the Company and the Company Subsidiaries that the Parent
Company and the Parent Subsidiaries acquired during the Parent
Companys ownership of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, including:
(i) customer information, (ii) employment or personnel data, (iii) sales
information specific to a customer, (iv) supplier and vendor agreements and
information, (v) research findings produced by the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries or purchased by the Company or the Company Subsidiaries, (vi)
historical financial information and (vii) all other information, lists,
records and data of a confidential nature relating to or dealing with the

public domain without any breach by the Parent Company or any of the Parent
Subsidiaries of any obligation owed to the Company or any of the Company

Information. The term " _Company Confidential Information_ " is intended to
include all such information in any and all forms, whether written or oral, on
paper or stored electronically or in any other medium, and includes all
originals, summaries, portions and copies of any and all such information.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 6.15(c)_, the
Parent Company and the Parent Subsidiaries may disclose Company Confidential
Information to the extent required by a court of law, by any
governmental agency having supervisory authority over it or by any
administrative or legislative body (including a committee thereof) with
jurisdiction to order the Parent Company or such Parent Subsidiary to divulge,
disclose or make accessible such information, provided the Parent Company
shall promptly provide notice of a request for same to the Purchaser so that
the Purchaser may, at its expense, seek an appropriate protective order with
respect to such Company Confidential Information. 

(d) _Vendor Non-Interference; Non-Solicitation of Customers_. Except with the
prior written approval of the Purchaser, the Parent Company shall not, and
shall not permit any of the Parent Subsidiaries to, in: (i) the Restricted

influence any of the FiberNet Vendors to discontinue, adversely modify or
reduce their business relationships with the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries in the Restricted Area or any of the Relevant
Pennsylvania/Maryland Areas; or (ii) solicit any of the Restricted Business
from any of the FiberNet Customers in the Restricted Area or any of the

_Section 6.15(d)_, any general solicitation by the Parent Company or any
Parent Subsidiary for customers in the Relevant Pennsylvania/Maryland Areas,
not targeted specifically at FiberNet Customers in the Relevant
Pennsylvania/Maryland Areas, including general advertisements such as
newspaper or Internet advertisements, and any FiberNet Customer in the
Relevant Pennsylvania/Maryland Areas becoming a customer of the Parent Company
or any Parent Subsidiary (other than as a result of any solicitation of such
FiberNet Customer by the Parent Company or any Parent Subsidiary) shall not
constitute a violation of this _Section 6.15(d)_.

 

(e) _Non-Disparagement_. For a period of five (5) years from the Effective
Date, the Parent Company agrees that it will not, and that it will cause the
Parent Subsidiaries not to, and that it will instruct its and the Parent
Subsidiaries respective directors and officers not to, make any disparaging
or defamatory public comments about the Purchaser, the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries, or their respective directors and officers, or to
encourage or participate with anyone to make such statements. The Parent
Company and the Purchaser agree and acknowledge and agree that the terms of
this  _Section 6.15(e)_ do not prohibit the Parent Company or any Parent
Subsidiary, or any of their respective directors and officers, from making
truthful statements, if required to do so by law or legal process (including
in connection with a Proceeding relating to this Agreement and the
Transactions); _provided, however_ , that if the Parent Company or any Parent
Subsidiary, or any of their respective directors or officers, is requested by
subpoena, court order, investigative demand or other legal process to provide
testimony which would otherwise violate the provisions of this _Section
6.15(e)_, the Parent Company shall, and shall cause the Parent Subsidiaries
and their respective directors and officers to, promptly notify the Purchaser
of such request.

(f) _Exception for Enterprise Agreement Business_. The Parent Company and
the Purchaser agree to, as soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing,
enter into a wholesale master service contract on commercially reasonable
terms and conditions covering multi-location, enterprise, government and
wholesale customers (the " _Enterprise Agreement_ "). The Parent Company and
the Purchaser agree and acknowledge that, notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this _Section 6.15_, any business conducted by the Parent
Company, any Parent Subsidiary, the Purchaser, the Company or any Company
Subsidiary pursuant to the Enterprise Agreement shall not constitute a
violation of _Section 6.15(a)_ or _Section 6.15(d)_.

 

(g) _Reasonableness; Independent Covenants; Disputes_. The parties each
acknowledge that the restrictions set out in this  _Section 6.15_ are
necessary to prevent the use and disclosure of the Company Confidential
Information and to protect the goodwill and customer relationships of the
parties and to otherwise protect the legitimate business interests of
the parties from and after the Closing. Each party further acknowledges that
all of the restrictions in this _Section 6.15 _are reasonable in all
respects, including duration, territory and scope of activity restricted. Each
party agrees that the covenants and provisions of this _Section 6.15_ shall
be construed as separate agreements independent of any other provision of this
_Section 6.15_ or of any other agreement between the parties. The time period
of any covenant contained in this _Section 6.15 _shall be extended on a day-
for-day basis for each day during which the Parent Company is in violation of
such covenant, so that the Parent Company is restricted from 



 

48  engaging in activities prohibited by such covenant for the full time period
set forth herein. To the extent any disputes arise under this _Section 6.15_,
members of senior management of the Parent Company and the Purchaser will
attempt to reconcile their differences in good faith during the thirty (30)
day period following either party providing notice to the other party of such
dispute.

 

6.16 _Release_. As of the Closing, Seller, in its individual capacity and on
behalf of all of its Affiliates and all members, stockholders, officers and
directors of any of the foregoing and all other persons claiming by, through,
for or under Seller or on behalf of Seller (such other persons hereinafter
referred to collectively as the " _Seller Related Parties_ ") hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally releases, settles, cancels, discharges and
acknowledges to be fully and finally satisfied any and all claims, demands,
rights, actions, causes of action, debts, accounts, covenants, contracts,

Losses_ "), which Seller or any of the Seller Related Parties may have had or
may now have or assert against the Company or any Company Subsidiaries
(collectively, the " _Purchaser Released Parties_ "), which are on account of
any matter whatsoever attributable to the period, or arising during the
period, from the beginning of time through and including the Closing (all
Seller Claims and Losses released in this _Section 6.17_ being referred to
as the " _Seller Released Claims_ "). Seller agrees that neither Seller nor
the Seller Related Parties, or any of them, nor anyone claiming under, through
or for them or on their behalf will bring, file, institute, prosecute,
maintain, participate in, or recover upon, either directly or indirectly, or
encourage or benefit from the institution of, any suit, charge, administrative
proceeding, investigation, or action at law or in equity against the
Purchaser Released Parties, or any of them, in or before any court, agency or
forum, state or federal, or otherwise, for or relating to any of the Seller
Released Claims. Seller agrees that this release may be pleaded by the
Purchaser Released Parties as a counterclaim or cross-claim to or as a defense
in bar or abatement of any Seller Released Claim. Following the Closing, the
Seller Related Parties shall have no right of contribution against the Company
or any Company Subsidiaries for any indemnification payment made by any
Seller Related Parties hereunder, and the Seller Related Parties hereby waive
any and all rights of contribution that they may have against the Company or
any Company Subsidiaries;  _provided, however_ , that the foregoing shall not
affect the rights of former officers and directors of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries to receive indemnification from the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries as contemplated by  _Section 6.10_. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this _Section 6.16_, this _Section 6.16_ shall
not apply to any Intercompany Transactions that are reflected as a Current
Liability in the calculation of NWC. 

6.17 _Integration Planning Committee_. As soon as practicable after the date
hereof, the Seller and the Purchaser shall create a joint integration
planning committee (the " _Integration Planning Committee_ ") consisting of
not less than two representatives from each of the parties hereto. The Seller
and the Purchaser shall mutually agree on the persons who will be the members
of the Integration Planning Committee; provided, that, the parties agree that
Dave Keller shall be one of the Purchasers initial representatives and Russ
Oliver shall be one of the Sellers initial representatives. The
responsibilities of the Integration Planning Committee shall include
organizing and developing a transition plan for the prompt and efficient
integration of the

 



 

49  FiberNet Business with the Purchaser following the Closing. Seller shall
reasonably cooperate with and promptly respond to all reasonable requests for
information of the Integration Planning Committee arising out of or related
to the Integration Planning Committees responsibilities. Unless otherwise
agreed by the members of the Integration Planning Committee, the Integration
Planning Committee shall meet at least weekly and such meetings may occur
telephonically or in person. The Integration Planning Committee shall report
all of its findings and make non-binding recommendations to each of the Seller
and the Purchaser with respect to those matters which the
Integration Planning Committee deems appropriate to consider. The Integration
Planning Committee shall dissolve sixty (60) days following the Closing or
such later date as the parties may agree.

 

6.18 _FiberNet of Michigan, LLC_. Prior to Closing, the Seller shall cause
FiberNet of Michigan, LLC to be dissolved and shall cause all Contracts to

similar state, local, or non-U.S. Law, and (c) any and all Taxes of any Person
(other than the Company and the Company Subsidiaries) imposed on the Company
or any of the Company Subsidiaries as a transferee or successor, by contract
or pursuant to any Law, rule, or regulation, which Taxes relate to an event or
transaction occurring before the Closing (collectively, " _Indemnified Taxes_
"). The following provisions of Article X shall apply to any claims by the

(a) The Purchaser and the Seller shall, and shall cause their respective
Subsidiaries and Affiliates to, cooperate with respect to Tax matters and the
Seller shall timely provide to the Purchaser, at the Purchasers request, all
information necessary to the Purchaser in filing any Tax Returns of the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries with respect to Post-Closing
Taxes or in defending any claim by a Tax Authority for any Taxes for any
taxable period. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the
other partys request) the provision of records and information that are
reasonably relevant to any such audit, litigation or other Proceeding and
making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide
additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder. The
Company, the Company Subsidiaries, the Purchaser and the Seller agree: (i) to
retain all books and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries relating to any taxable period beginning
before the Closing Date until the expiration of the statute of limitations
(and, to the extent notified by the Seller or the Purchaser, any extensions
thereof) of the respective taxable periods, and to abide by all record
retention agreements entered into with any Taxing Authority, and (ii) to give
the other party reasonable written notice prior to transferring, destroying
or discarding any such books and records and, if the other party so requests,
the Company, the Company Subsidiaries, the Purchaser or the Seller, as the
case may be, shall allow the other party to take possession of such books and
records.

(b) The Purchaser and the Seller shall, upon the reasonable request of either
of them, use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any
certificate or other document from any Tax Authority or any other Person as
may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that would
reasonably be expected to be imposed, including with respect to the
Transactions.

7.4 _Allocation to Pre-Closing and Post-Closing Tax Periods_. Taxes (other
than Income Taxes) of, or related to the assets, operations and activities of,
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries for any Taxable period that includes
but does not end on the Closing Date (a " _Straddle Period_ ") shall be
allocated to the Pre-Closing Tax Period by multiplying the total amount of any
such Tax for the full Straddle Period by a fraction, the numerator of which is
the number of days from the beginning of such Straddle Period to and
including the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the total number of
days in such full Straddle Period. Income Taxes of each of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries for the portion of any Straddle Period ending on the
Closing Date will be computed as if such taxable period ended as of the close
of business on the Closing Date. Except as provided in _Section 7.1_,
liabilities for transactional based Taxes, including sales and use Taxes,
shall be allocated to the Seller if incurred prior to the Closing and shall
be allocated to the Purchaser if incurred following the Closing.

7.5  _Tax Proceedings_.

(a) The Seller shall, at its own expense, have the right (but not the
obligation) to control, defend, settle, compromise, or prosecute in any
manner any Proceedings with respect to any Tax Return of, or that includes,
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries (" _Tax Proceedings_ ") involving
only Pre-Closing Tax Periods (" _Pre-Closing Tax Proceedings_ ");



 

51  provided, however, the Seller, without the consent of the Purchaser (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) shall not
settle, compromise or abandon any Pre-Closing Tax Proceeding to the extent
that such action would adversely affect the Purchaser, its Affiliates, or,
following the Closing Date, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries. In
addition, the Seller shall keep the Purchaser duly informed of any Pre-
Closing Tax Proceeding that would adversely affect the Purchaser, its
Affiliates, or, following the Closing Date, the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries (an " _Adverse Effect Pre-Closing Tax Proceeding_ "), and the
Purchaser shall be entitled to receive copies of all correspondence and
documents related to any Adverse Effect Pre-Closing Tax Proceeding.

 

(b) The Purchaser shall, at its own expense, have the right (but not the
obligation) to control, defend, settle, compromise, or prosecute in any
manner any Tax Proceedings for all Straddle Periods and Post-Closing Tax
Periods (" _Straddle or Post-Closing Tax Proceedings_ "); provided, however,
the Purchaser, without the consent of the Seller (such consent not to
be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) shall not settle,
compromise or abandon any Straddle or Post-Closing Tax Proceeding to the
extent that such action would adversely affect the Seller or its Affiliates.
In addition, the Purchaser shall keep the Seller duly informed of any
Straddle or Post-Closing Tax Proceedings that would adversely affect the
Seller or its Affiliates (an " _Adverse Effect Straddle_ or _Post-Closing Tax
Proceeding_ "), and the Seller shall be entitled to receive copies of all
correspondence and documents related to any Straddle or Post-Closing Tax
Proceeding.

(c) The parties agree and acknowledge that, for the avoidance of doubt and
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in _Section 7.5(b)_, the Tax
Proceedings covered by _Section 7.5(b)_ shall not include any Tax Proceeding
with respect to any federal, state or local income Taxes of the Parent
Company or the Seller (a " _Parent Company Tax Proceeding_ "). The Parent
Company and the Seller shall, at its own expense, have the right (but not the
obligation) to control, defend, settle, compromise, or prosecute in any
manner any Parent Company Tax Proceeding; provided, however, neither the
Parent Company nor the Seller, without the consent of the Purchaser (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) shall
settle, compromise or abandon any Parent Company Tax Proceeding to the extent
that such action would adversely affect the Purchaser, its Affiliates, or,
following the Closing Date, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries. In
addition, the Seller shall keep the Purchaser duly informed of any Parent
Company Tax Proceeding that would adversely affect the Purchaser, its
Affiliates, or, following the Closing Date, the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries (an " _Adverse Effect Parent Company Tax Proceeding_ "), and the
Purchaser shall be entitled to receive copies of all correspondence and
documents related to any Adverse Effect Parent Company Tax Proceeding.

 

7.6 _Tax Sharing Agreements_. All Tax Sharing Agreements or similar
arrangements with respect to or involving the Company and each of the Company
Subsidiaries shall be terminated as of the Closing Date, and after the Closing
Date, the Company and each of the Company Subsidiaries shall not be bound
thereby or have any liability thereunder.

 



 

52 7.7 _Allocation of Purchase Price_.

 

(a) The Purchase Price and other items included in "consideration" for
purposes of Code section 1060 (the " _Section 1060 Consideration_ ") shall be
allocated based on the fair market value of the underlying assets of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date in compliance with
Code section 1060 and the Treasury Regulations thereunder, in accordance with
this _Section 7.7_ (such allocation, the " _Allocation_ ").

(b) For purposes of calculating the Section 1060 Consideration the amounts,
as of the Closing Date, of the accounts payable, accrued expenses and other
Current Liabilities shall equal the respective amounts thereof shown on the
Final Post-Closing NWC Statement. 

(c) As soon as reasonably practicable after determination of the Final Post-
Closing NWC Statement pursuant to  _Section 2.5(b)_, the Purchaser shall
prepare and deliver to Seller a proposed Allocation (the " _Draft Allocation_
"). Included with the delivery of such Draft Allocation, the Purchaser shall
provide a draft of the purchase accounting valuation report (the " _Valuation
Report_ "), the final version of which (determined as set forth below in this
_Section 7.7(c)_) shall be used in determining the asset class reportable
values in accordance with Code section 1060 and the Treasury Regulations
thereunder. The Seller may notify the Purchaser in writing of any objections
to the Draft Allocation (including the draft Valuation Report) within fifteen
(15) days after the receipt thereof, which notice shall include reasonable
detail of the nature of each disputed item provided, that any and all of
Sellers objections to the value determinations included in the Valuation
Report will be supported by analysis prepared in accordance with guidelines
established by the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice or
identification of mathematical errors or errors in fact used for the basis of
conclusion. If the Seller does not provide such notice within such
fifteen (15) day period, the Draft Allocation (including the draft Valuation
Report) shall be conclusively deemed the " _Final Allocation_ ", which shall
be final and binding upon all parties hereto and shall not be subject to
dispute or review. If the Seller provides such notice within such fifteen
(15) day period to the Draft Allocation (including the draft Valuation
Report), then for a period of up to fifteen (15) days after the Purchasers
receipt of the objection notice, the Purchaser and the Seller shall use good
faith commercially reasonable efforts to resolve any dispute, and if all
disputed items are so resolved, the Draft Allocation (including the draft
Valuation Report) shall be revised to reflect such resolution and shall
become the Final Allocation (and the corresponding Valuation Report shall
become the final Valuation Report). If the parties are unable to resolve all
disputed items within such fifteen (15) day period, they shall submit only
those disputed items that have not been resolved by the parties to the
Independent Accountants for resolution. The Independent Accountants
determination as to each disputed item shall be final and binding upon all
parties hereto, and the Draft Allocation (including the draft Valuation
Report) shall be revised in accordance with the Independent Accountants
determination and shall become the Final Allocation (and the corresponding
Valuation Report shall become the final Valuation Report). The fees and
expenses of the Independent Accountants incurred in connection with the
resolution of disputes pursuant to this _Section 7.7(c)_ shall be borne by
the Purchaser or the Seller in proportion to the amounts of the disputed
items on the Draft Allocation, as compared to such items as determined by the
Independent Accountants and set forth on its Final Allocation, with such fees
and expenses to be paid by the Purchaser or the Seller (as applicable) to
the Independent Accountants within thirty (30) days after the Independent
Accountants determination of the Final Allocation.



 

53 (d) Within fifteen (15) days after the Draft Allocation becomes the Final
Allocation, the Purchaser and the Seller shall each prepare and deliver to
the other party their respective IRS Forms 8594 and any required exhibits
thereto, and any similar forms required under applicable state, local or
foreign Tax Law, each of which shall conform with the Final Allocation. The
Purchaser and the Seller shall each, promptly thereafter, make any necessary
corrections thereto in response to the other partys reasonable comments and,
after making any such corrections, the Purchaser and the Seller shall each
timely file: (i) their respective Forms 8594 with the IRS in accordance with
the requirements of Code section 1060 and the Treasury Regulations thereunder;
and (ii) such other forms with the applicable Governmental Entity in
accordance with the requirements of the applicable Tax Law.

(e) Any subsequent adjustment to the consideration paid for the Equity
Interests, including any adjustment to the Purchase Price described in
_Section 2.5(c)_ or _Article X_ , shall be reflected in an amended Final
Allocation and amended Form 8594 (and amended applicable state, local or
foreign forms) that the Purchaser shall prepare and deliver to the Seller. The
Seller and the Purchaser shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates
to, report, act and file all Tax Returns in all respects and for all
purposes consistent with the Final Allocation. The Seller and the Purchaser
shall not, and shall cause their respective Affiliates not to, take any
position, whether on audit, in Tax Returns or otherwise, that is inconsistent
with the Final Allocation unless required to do so by applicable Law.

that the Purchaser shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this _Section 9.1(d)_ if the Purchaser is then in material
breach of any of its representations and warranties, covenants or agreements
contained in this Agreement;



 

56 (e) by the Seller, either: (i) immediately after the occurrence of a non-
curable material breach of any representation and warranty, covenant or
agreement of the Purchaser set forth in this Agreement; or (ii) thirty (30)
days after receipt by the Purchaser of notice from the Seller of the
occurrence of a curable material breach of any representation and warranty,
covenant or agreement of the Purchaser set forth in this Agreement that has
not been cured in its entirety within such time period, in either case such
that the conditions set forth in  _Sections 8.1(a)_ and _(b)_ ,
respectively, would not be satisfied; _provided, however,_ that the Seller
shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section
9.1(e)_ if the Seller or Parent Company is then in material breach of any of
its representations and warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement; or

 

(f) by either the Seller or the Purchaser if any condition to such partys
obligation to consummate the Closing set forth in  _Section 8.1_ or _8.2_ ,
respectively, shall have become incapable of satisfaction (other than as
provided in _Sections 9.1(c)_, _(d)_ or _(e)_ ); _provided, however,_ that
the right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section 9.1(f)_ shall not
be available to any party whose breach of any provision of this Agreement
shall have caused such Closing condition to have become incapable of
satisfaction.

 

Any termination made in accordance with _Section 9.1(b)_, _(c)_ , _(d)_ ,
_(e)_ or _(f)_ shall be effective upon delivery of a notice of termination
by the terminating party to each other party, which notice shall refer to the
subsection of this _Section 9.1_ pursuant to which such termination is being
made.

 

9.2 _Effect of Termination_. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
_Section 9.1_, all obligations of the parties hereunder shall terminate
without any Liability of either party to the other party, except (a) for any
partys right to seek remedies for breach of contract (including equitable
relief contemplated by _Section 11.2_ hereof), (b) that any such termination
of this Agreement shall not relieve the Purchaser of its obligations under
_Section 6.5_ (Confidentiality) and (c) as otherwise specifically set forth
herein.

with respect thereto) set forth in _Section 3.8_ (Taxes), _Section 3.9_
(Employee Benefit Plans) and _Section 3.13_ (Environmental Matters)
(collectively, the " _Statute of Limitations Representations_ ") shall

10.2 _Indemnification Obligations_.

 

(a) Subject to the other provisions of this _Article X_ , from and after the
Closing, the Seller shall indemnify the Purchaser and each of its Affiliates
(which, following the Closing, shall include the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries) and its and their respective directors, officers, employees,
stockholders, partners, members, managers, agents and representatives (each,
a " _Purchaser Indemnified Party_ ") for any Losses by such Purchaser
Indemnified Party as a result of (i) any breach of any representation and
warranty by Seller or Parent Company contained in this Agreement (or
inaccuracy of the Seller Closing Certificate with respect to any such
representation and warranty); (ii) any breach of any covenant or agreement of
the Seller or Parent Company contained in this Agreement (or inaccuracy of the

or (iii) any Excluded Liabilities; _provided, however,_ that the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to indemnification under this

(b) Subject to the other provisions of this _Article X_ , from and after the
Closing, the Purchaser shall indemnify the Seller and each of its Affiliates
and its and their respective directors, officers, employees, stockholders,

warranty of the



 

58  Purchaser contained in this Agreement (or inaccuracy of the Purchaser

10.3 _Limitations on Indemnification Amounts_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this _Article X_ , in no event shall an Indemnified Party be
required to provide indemnification under _Section 10.2(a)(i)_ or _Section
10.2(b)(i)_, as applicable, unless and until the Purchaser Indemnified Parties
or Seller Indemnified Parties, as the case may be, shall have incurred
aggregate Losses under this Agreement of at least one million dollars
($1,000,000), but then shall be responsible for all such Losses back to the
first dollar (the " _Indemnity Threshold_ ") and then only for Losses arising
under _Section 10.2(a)(i)_ or _Section 10.2(b)(i)_, as applicable, up to a
maximum aggregate amount of seven and one-half percent (7.5%) of the Purchase
Price (the " _Indemnity Cap_ "), except that: (a) neither the Indemnity
Threshold nor the Indemnity Cap shall apply to Losses resulting from any
willful breach of this Agreement or fraud related to the transactions
contemplated hereby; and (b) the Indemnity Cap shall not apply to: (i) Losses
resulting from a breach of the Seller Fundamental Representations or
inaccuracy of the Seller Closing Certificate with respect to the Seller
Fundamental Representations; or (ii) the Purchaser

10.4 _Indemnification Claim Procedure_.

 

(a) Promptly after obtaining actual knowledge of any matter that a Purchaser
Indemnified Party or Seller Indemnified Party, as applicable (the "
_Indemnified Party_ "), acting in good faith, reasonably believes will entitle
the Indemnified Party to indemnification from the other party (the "
_Indemnifying Party_ ") under this _Article X_ or  _Section 7.2_, the
Indemnified Party shall promptly provide to the Indemnifying Party notice
describing the matter in reasonable detail, including the nature of the claim,
the basis for the indemnification obligation and the estimated amount of
Losses resulting therefrom to the extent then feasible (which estimate shall
not be conclusive of the final amount of such claim) (a " _Notice of Claim_
"). To the extent that any such matter relates to a Claim or Proceeding by a
third party, such Claim or Proceeding is referred to herein as a " _Third
Party Claim_ ", which is governed by _Section 10.5_.

 

(b) For claims for indemnification under this _Article X_ or _Article VII_
other than those relating to Third Party Claims, the Indemnifying Party shall
have twenty (20) Business Days after its receipt of the Notice of Claim to
respond to the claim(s) described therein. Such response shall set forth, in
reasonable detail, the Indemnifying Partys objection(s) to the claim(s) and
its bases for such objection(s). If the Indemnifying Party fails to provide
such a response with such time period, the Indemnifying Party will be deemed
to have conceded the claim(s) set forth in the Notice of Claim. If
the Indemnifying Party provides its response within such time period, the
Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall negotiate the resolution of
the claim(s) for a period of not less than twenty (20) Business Days after
such response is provided. If the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified
Party are unable to resolve any such claim(s) within such time period, the
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to pursue any legal remedies available to
the Indemnified Party against the Indemnifying Party with respect solely to
the unresolved claim(s), subject to the other provisions of this _Article X_
and _Section 7.2_, as applicable.

  

 

59 10.5 _Third Party Claims_.

 

(a) The Indemnifying Party shall not be required to provide indemnification
under this _Article X_ with respect to a Third Party Claim to the extent that
the Indemnified Partys failure to provide or delay in providing a Notice of
Claim materially prejudices the Indemnifying Partys ability to contest or
resolve the matters underlying such Third Party Claim. 

(b) The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to assume and pursue the
defense of any Third Party Claim, at its sole cost and expense and with
counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party, upon notification
thereof to the Indemnified Party within ten (10) Business Days after the
Notice of Claim has been delivered to the Indemnifying Party, unless
the Indemnifying Partys assumption of the defense of any Third Party Claim
would result in a conflict of interest arising out of the joint representation
by legal counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party of the interests of both
the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party
does not engage separate legal counsel to represent the Indemnified Party (at
the Indemnifying Partys sole cost and expense) within the ten (10) Business
Day period referred to above. It is agreed and understood that the
Indemnifying Partys election to assume the defense of any Third Party Claim
shall not constitute an admission that any Losses resulting therefrom are
indemnifiable Losses under this _Article X_  or in any way prejudice or limit
the Indemnifying Partys ability to dispute any determination of whether or
not any such Losses are indemnifiable Losses under this _Article X_. If the
Indemnified Party does not receive such notification from the Indemnifying
Party within such time period or, at any time after the Indemnifying Party has
assumed the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party fails to
perform or unreasonably delays in performing its obligations to assume or
pursue the defense of any such Thirty Party Claim, the Indemnified Party may
assume, commence and pursue its defense of such Third Party Claim in such
manner as it may deem reasonably appropriate and thereafter promptly inform
the Indemnifying Party of all material developments related thereto.

(c) If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a Third Party Claim, it
shall thereafter promptly inform the Indemnified Party of all material
developments related thereto. With respect to any Third Party Claim for which
the Indemnifying Party has assumed the defense, the Indemnified Party shall
have the right, but not the obligation, to participate in the defense of such
Third Party Claim through legal counsel reasonably selected by it, at its
expense. As long as the Indemnifying Party is performing its obligations under
this _Section 10.5_, the Indemnified Party shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates to, during normal business hours, upon reasonable notice, at the
cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party, cooperate in all reasonable ways
with, make its and their relevant files and records reasonably available for
inspection and copying by, make its and their employees reasonably available
to, and otherwise render reasonable assistance to, the Indemnifying Party.

 

(d) If the Indemnifying Party (having assumed the defense of a Third Party
Claim) or the Indemnified Party (having proceeded with its own defense of a
Third Party Claim in accordance with this _Section 10.5_) proposes to settle
or compromise such Thirty Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party or the
Indemnified Party (as applicable) shall provide notice to that effect 



 

60  (together with a statement in reasonable detail of the terms and conditions
of such settlement or compromise) to the Indemnified Party or the Indemnifying
Party (as applicable), which shall be provided a reasonable time prior to the
proposed time for effecting such settlement or compromise, and may not effect
any such settlement or compromise without the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Party or the Indemnifying Party (as applicable); _provided,
however,_ that no such consent of the Indemnified Party will be required if:
(A) the Indemnifying Party provides any such notice; (B) the related
settlement or compromise offer provides for the full release of the
Indemnified Party and its Affiliates from any and all Liability (including
equitable relief) in respect of such Third Party Claim; and (C) the
Indemnified Party fails to provide, in a reasonably timely manner, its consent
to such settlement or compromise.

10.6 _Payment of Amounts Due for Indemnification_. Within five (5) Business
Days after it is determined pursuant to this _Article X_ or _Article VII_
that any amount is due to any Purchaser Indemnified Party under this _Article
X_ or _Article VII_ , such amount shall be paid first from any amounts
remaining in the Escrow Account and to the extent the amounts in the Escrow
Account are not sufficient to pay such claim, the amount shall be paid by the
Seller, in each such case, in cash by wire transfer of immediately available
funds, to the Purchasers account within five (5) Business Days after such
determination. Within five (5) Business Days after it is determined pursuant
to this _Article X_ that any amount is due to any Seller Indemnified Party
under this _Article X_ , such amount shall be paid by the Purchaser, in cash
by wire transfer of immediately available funds, to the Sellers account. If
any payment required under this _Section 10.6_ is not made in full within
five (5) Business Days after it is determined under this _Article X_ or
_Article VII_ that such payment is due, the unpaid part of such payment will
thereafter bear simple interest at a rate equal to the prime rate in effect
from time to time (as published in The Wall Street Journal) plus two (2)
percentage points, until paid in full.

10.7 _Losses Net of Insurance Proceeds; Mitigation of Damages_. If any event
shall occur or circumstance shall exist which would otherwise entitle an
Indemnified Party to indemnification under this _Article X_ with respect to a
breach of a representation and warranty, no Loss shall be deemed to have been
incurred or sustained by such Indemnified Party to the extent of any proceeds
received by Indemnifying Party or any of its Affiliates (including with
respect to the Purchaser, the Company, following the Closing) from
any insurance company with respect to the matters underlying such breach.
Each Indemnified Party shall be required to use commercially reasonable
efforts to mitigate, to the fullest extent practicable, the amount of any
Losses for which a claim for indemnification is made under this _Article X._

10.8 _Materiality and Material Adverse Effect Qualifiers_. All materiality
qualifications contained in the representations and warranties of the parties
set forth in this Agreement (however they may be phrased and including the
term "Material Adverse Effect") shall be taken into account for purposes of
this _Article X_ solely for purposes of determining whether a breach of such
representation and warranty has occurred and, if such breach has occurred, all
such materiality qualifications shall be ignored and not given any effect for
purposes of determining the amount of Losses arising out of or relating to
such breach of such representation and warranty under this _Article X_.

 

10.9 _Subrogation_. Upon making any payment for Losses of an Indemnified Party
under this _Article X_ , the Indemnifying Party will, to the extent of such
payment, be subrogated to



 

61  all rights (if any) of the Indemnified Party against any third party with
respect to the Loss for which the payment relates. In addition to any other
obligation under this Agreement, the Indemnified Party agrees to duly execute
and deliver, upon request of the Indemnifying Party, all instruments
reasonably necessary to evidence and perfect the subrogation and subordination
rights granted pursuant to this _Section 10.8_. 

10.10 _Tax Treatment of Seller Indemnification Payments_. Any indemnification
payments made by the Seller pursuant to this _Article X_ or _Section 7.2_
shall be treated for all Tax purposes as adjustments to the amount paid by the
Purchaser for the Equity Interests, unless otherwise required by applicable
Law.

 

10.11 _Indemnification Sole Remedy_. Except for: (a) Claims arising out of
willful misconduct or fraud by a party (for which the other party may seek
any remedy available to it in law or in equity); or (b) the ability of the
parties to obtain equitable remedies in accordance with _Section 11.12_
(Remedies) in connection with any breach or threatened breach of any of the
covenants and agreements of the parties set forth herein including with
respect to any Excluded Liabilities: (i) from and after the Closing, the
indemnification rights provided pursuant to this _Article X_ and pursuant to
_Section 7.2_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedies of the parties and
their respective officers, directors, employees, Affiliates, agents,
representatives, successors and assigns for any breach of any representations
and warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement and with
respect to Excluded Liabilities; and (ii) from and after the Closing, each
party hereby irrevocably waives any right to any remedy relating to any such
breach or with respect to any Excluded Liabilities, other than the
indemnification rights provided pursuant to this _Article X_ and pursuant to
_Section 7.2_ (whether by contract, common law, statute, regulation or
otherwise).

 

10.12 _Tax Matters_. Except as specifically provided in _Section 7.2 _or this
_Article X_ , the rights and obligations of the parties with respect to
indemnification for any and all Tax matters shall be solely governed by
_Section 7.2_ and shall not be subject to the provisions of this _Article X_.

and from time to time thereafter. No waiver of any right, power or remedy of a

(whether oral or written) by or between the parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof and thereof, including any letter of intent or
memorandum of terms entered into by the parties.

11.7 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement shall hereafter be
held to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, in whole or in part, in any
jurisdiction under any circumstances for any reason: (a) such provision shall
be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to cause such provision to be
valid, enforceable and legal while preserving the intent of the parties as
expressed in, and the benefits to such parties provided by, such provision or
(b) if such provision cannot be so reformed, such provision shall be severed
from this Agreement and an equitable adjustment shall be made to this

64 11.9 _Consent to Jurisdiction_. EACH PARTY AGREES THAT ANY AND ALL
PROCEEDINGS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE COMMENCED
AND PROSECUTED IN A FEDERAL OR STATE COURT IN THE STATE OF NEW YORK OR, IN THE
CASE OF A PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO A THIRD PARTY CLAIM WHICH
IS OR MAY BE SUBJECT TO INDEMNIFICATION HEREUNDER, IN THE COURT WHERE SUCH
THIRD PARTY CLAIM IS BROUGHT AND EACH PARTY IRREVOCABLE WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO
OBJECT TO SUCH VENUE. EACH PARTY CONSENTS AND SUBMITS TO THE NON-EXCLUSIVE
PERSONAL JURISDICTION OF ANY FEDERAL OR STATE COURT IN THE STATE OF NEW YORK
IN RESPECT OF ANY SUCH PROCEEDING OR, WITH RESPECT TO A THIRD PARTY CLAIM, IN
THE FORUM IN WHICH SUCH THIRD PARTY CLAIM WAS BROUGHT. EACH PARTY CONSENTS TO

MAIL, RETURN RECEIPT REQUESTED, AND BY ANY OTHER MEANS PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE

PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, LOST PROFITS, CONSEQUENTIAL OR SIMILAR DAMAGES IN ANY
PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RESULTING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

(b) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY PROCEEDING ARISING UNDER OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY IS LIKELY
TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL

AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

(c) EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT: (i) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT

65 11.11 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of any partys rights
or obligations hereunder may be assigned or delegated, in whole or in part,
by either party without the prior written consent of the other party (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed); _provided, however_ ,
that either party may, without the prior written consent of the other party
(but with reasonable advance written notice to the other party): collaterally
assign its rights under this Agreement to any bank or other financing
institution in connection with such partys financing arrangements. Any
purported assignment or delegation in violation of the preceding sentence will
be null and void. Subject to the preceding sentences of this _Section 11.11_,
this Agreement will be binding upon the parties and their respective
successors and permitted assigns and shall inure to the benefit of and be
enforceable by the parties and their respective successors and permitted
assigns.

 

11.12 _Remedies_. Except as otherwise expressly provided in _Article X_ , each
of the parties shall have and retain all rights and remedies, at law or in
equity, including rights to specific performance and injunctive or other
equitable relief, arising out of or relating to a breach or threatened breach
of this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of
the parties acknowledges that money damages would not be a sufficient remedy
for any breach or threatened breach of this Agreement and that irreparable
harm would result if this Agreement were not specifically enforced.
Therefore, the rights and obligations of the parties shall be enforceable by
a decree of specific performance issued by any court of competent
jurisdiction, and appropriate injunctive relief may be applied for and granted
in connection therewith, without the necessity of posting a bond or other
security or proving actual damages and without regard to the adequacy of any
remedy at law. A partys right to specific performance shall be in addition to
all other legal or equitable remedies available to such party.

11.13 _Third Party Beneficiaries_. No Person other than the Purchaser, the
Seller and the Parent Company is or is intended to be a beneficiary of this
Agreement, other than the Purchaser Indemnified Parties, the Seller

revocation or repudiation hereof by the Parent Company or the revocation or
repudiation of this Agreement by the Seller, (C) the failure of the Parent

67  or any other Person, or (D) the invalidity or unenforceability in whole or
in part of this Agreement, and (vi) the right to assert a counterclaim in any
action or proceeding brought by the Purchaser.

(b) The parties agree and acknowledge that, notwithstanding anything to the

constitute an amendment, modification or waiver under, or otherwise affect,
any of the other provisions of this Agreement or any of the other Transaction
Documents or the respective rights or obligations of the parties thereunder.

(c) In connection with such guarantee, Parent Company represents and warrants
to Purchaser:

hereunder and thereunder, and the consummation of the transactions

authorization or proceedings on the part of the Parent Company are required
therefor. This Agreement and each other Transaction Document to which the
Parent Company is a party has been duly executed and delivered by the Parent

of this Agreement or any of the other Transaction Documents to which it is a
party, nor the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby, will: (i) violate, conflict with, breach or constitute a default
under (in each case, with or without the giving of notice, the lapse of time
or both) any of the provisions of: (A) any of the Organizational Documents of
the Parent Company; (B) any material Contract to which the Parent Company is a
party; or (C) any Law applicable to the Parent Company or any of its
properties or assets, or (ii) give any Governmental Entity or Judicial
Authority the right to challenge any of the Transactions under any applicable
Law. Except as listed in _Section 11.17(c)_ of the Company Disclosure
