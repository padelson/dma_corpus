liability company (" _Buyer_ "), OEP Pioneer (Canada) Holdings Corp., a
British Columbia corporation (" _Canadian Buyer_ "), Mueller Co. LLC, a
Delaware limited liability company (" _Seller_ "), and Anvil International,
LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the " _Company_ "). Mueller Water

Seller (" _MWP_ "), is a party to this Agreement for purposes of the MWP
Obligations only. Buyer, Canadian Buyer, MWP, Seller and the Company are
sometimes individually referred to in this Agreement as a " _Party_ "
and collectively as the " _Parties_ ".

Capitalized terms used in this Agreement shall have the meanings ascribed to
them in  _Exhibit A_.

WHEREAS, Seller owns all of the issued and outstanding limited liability
company interests in the Company (the " _Company Interests_ ");

WHEREAS, those certain Affiliates of Seller listed on _Exhibit B_ (the "
_Asset Sellers_ ") own certain assets and properties set forth next to their
names on _Exhibit B_ (the " _Transferred Assets_ ");

 

WHEREAS, the Parties desire to enter into this Agreement, pursuant to which
(a) Seller hereby sells to Buyer, and Buyer hereby purchases from Seller, all
of the Company Interests, and (b) Seller shall cause the Asset Sellers to sell
to Canadian Buyer, and Canadian Buyer shall purchase from the Asset Sellers,
the Transferred Assets (which for the avoidance of doubt shall include the
Bank Accounts), in each case on the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth herein and pursuant to the instruments of assignment and transfer
attached hereto as _Exhibit F_ (the " _Assignment Instruments_ "), which
have been executed simultaneously herewith;

WHEREAS, simultaneously with the execution of this Agreement, the applicable
Parties have entered into the Ontario Substitute Lease and the Transition
Services Agreement, both of which shall be effective upon the Closing; and

WHEREAS, on November 17, 2016, each of Buyer and MWP and their respective
Affiliates filed a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement with the United
States Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ ") and the Antitrust Division of
the United States Department of Justice (the " _Antitrust Division_ "), and
neither Buyer nor MWP has received from either the FTC or the Antitrust
Division any request for more information about such transactions, and the
applicable waiting period under the HSR Act has expired prior to the date
hereof. NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants, agreements and conditions set forth
in this Agreement, and intending to be legally bound hereby, each Party hereby
agrees:

 

ARTICLE I

PURCHASE AND SALE

Section 1.1. _The Purchase and Sale_. Subject to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement, (a) (i) Seller hereby sells, transfers and delivers to
Buyer, and Buyer hereby purchases and acquires from Seller, all of the Company
Interests, free and clear of all Liens, and (ii) Seller shall cause the Asset
Sellers, pursuant to the Assignment Instruments, to sell, transfer and
deliver to Canadian Buyer, and Canadian Buyer shall purchase and acquire from
the Asset Sellers, pursuant to the Assignment Instruments and effective as of
the moment immediately following clause (a)(i), all right, title and interest
in and to the Transferred Assets (which for the avoidance of doubt shall
include the Bank Accounts), free and clear of all Liens other than Permitted
Liens, (b) Seller and its Affiliates (excluding for the avoidance of doubt
the Company Group Members) hereby retain all of the Liabilities related to the
Transferred Assets other than the Assumed Liabilities (the " _Excluded
Liabilities_ "), and (c) Canadian Buyer shall assume pursuant to the
Assignment Instruments all liabilities listed on _Exhibit B_ , which for the
avoidance of doubt shall exclude Income Taxes and Sales Taxes of the Asset
Sellers (other than Sales Taxes which are taken into account in calculating
the Net Working Capital, if any, or otherwise as set forth in _Section
5.5(h)_ ) and Pre-Closing Environmental Liabilities (the " _Assumed
Liabilities_ ").

 

Section 1.2. _Purchase Price_. Subject to a Purchase Price Adjustment, the
aggregate purchase price for all of the Company Interests and the Transferred
Assets (subject to the Assumed Liabilities) (the " _Purchase Price_ ") shall
be an amount equal to the sum of:

 

(a) Three Hundred Fifteen Million Dollars ($315,000,000) (the " _Base
Purchase Price_ ");

 

(b) _plus_ the Estimated Net Working Capital Surplus, if any;

 

(c) _plus_ the Estimated Closing Date Cash;

 

(d) _minus_ Estimated Closing Indebtedness;

 

(e) _minus_ the Estimated Net Working Capital Deficit, if any; and

 

(f) _minus_ the Estimated Company Transaction Expenses.

 

Section 1.3. _Closing Date Statement_. Simultaneously with or prior to the
execution of this Agreement by the Parties, Seller has delivered to Buyer a
certificate (the " _Closing Date Financial Certificate_ "), signed by the
Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of MWP (on behalf and in the
name of the Company), which attaches (a) Sellers good faith reasonably
estimated combined balance sheet of the Business as of the Closing Date, and
sets forth (b) based on such balance sheet (w) Sellers good faith reasonable
estimate of the Net Working Capital (the " _Estimated Net Working Capital_
"), and the Estimated Net Working Capital Surplus or the Estimated Net Working
Capital Deficit, as the case may be, (x) Sellers good faith reasonable
estimate of the Closing Date Cash (the " _Estimated Closing Date Cash_ "),
(y) Sellers good faith reasonable estimate of Closing Indebtedness (the "
_Estimated Closing Indebtedness_ ") listed by

 



-2-  each lender or other counterparty, together with, to the extent related to
the Payoff Indebtedness Amount, payoff letters, releases and lien discharges
from each such lender or other counterparty, and (z) Sellers good faith
reasonable estimate of Company Transaction Expenses as of the Closing (the "
_Estimated Company Transaction Expenses_ ").

 

Section 1.4. _Payment of Purchase Price_. At the Closing, Buyer (on behalf
and for the benefit of Canadian Buyer, where applicable) shall pay or cause
to be paid to Seller and the Asset Sellers, by wire transfer in immediately
available funds to the account or accounts previously designated to Buyer in
writing by Seller, an amount equal to the Purchase Price (for the avoidance
of doubt, not giving effect to any Purchase Price Adjustment).

 

Section 1.5. _Payment of Other Amounts at Closing_. At the Closing, Buyer
shall:

 

(a) on behalf of the applicable Company Group Member, pay to such account
or accounts as the Company specified to Buyer pursuant to the Closing Date
Financial Certificate, the Payoff Indebtedness Amount; and

(b) on behalf of the applicable Company Group Member, pay to such account
or accounts as the Company specified to Buyer pursuant to the Closing Date
Financial Certificate, those Company Transaction Expenses to be paid to third-
parties for which invoices have been delivered to Buyer to be discharged at
Closing.

Section 1.6. _Adjustment to Purchase Price_.

 

(a) Following the Closing Date, the Purchase Price shall be increased or
reduced as set forth in _Section 1.6(f)_. Any increase or decrease in the
Purchase Price pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 1.6_ shall be referred to as a
" _Purchase Price Adjustment_ ".

 

(b) Within sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall prepare and
deliver to Seller a statement (the " _Preliminary Closing Statement_ "),
which sets forth in reasonable detail the Preliminary Net Working Capital
Schedule, including Buyers calculation of (i) Closing Date Cash, (ii) Closing
Indebtedness, and (iii) Company Transaction Expenses as of the Closing.
Purchase accounting or other adjustments arising out of the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall not be considered for
purposes of determining the Preliminary Closing Statement. The Preliminary
Closing Statement shall exclude the effect of any act, decision, change in
circumstance, development or event arising or occurring on or after the
Closing.

 

(c) Seller shall have a period of up to ninety (90) days after the Closing
Date to deliver to Buyer a written notice of Sellers disagreement with any
item contained in the Preliminary Closing Statement, which notice shall set
forth in reasonable detail the basis for such disagreement and the adjustments
to the Net Working Capital, Closing Date Cash, Closing Indebtedness and/or
Company Transaction Expenses that Seller believes should be made to the extent
the amount of any such adjustments are reasonably ascertainable at that time,
as reasonably determined by Seller in good faith (a " _Notice of
Disagreement_ "). During the period following Sellers receipt of the
Preliminary Closing Statement, Buyer shall provide to Seller and its
Representatives reasonable access during reasonable hours and under
reasonable circumstances to all relevant books and records and any work
papers (including those of Buyers

 



-3-  Representatives, subject to the execution of appropriate access agreements
with Representatives with respect to their work papers) relating to the
preparation of the Preliminary Closing Statement, in each case as reasonably
requested by Seller in connection with Sellers review of the Preliminary
Closing Statement. If a Notice of Disagreement is delivered by Seller within
such ninety (90) day period, then the Preliminary Closing Statement (as
revised in accordance with clause (i) or (ii) below) shall become the Final
Closing Statement and become final and binding upon the Parties on the earlier
of the date on which (i) Seller and Buyer resolve in writing any differences
they have with respect to the matters specified in the Notice of Disagreement
and (ii) all remaining matters in dispute are finally resolved in writing by
the Accounting Firm. During the first thirty (30) days following Buyers
receipt of a Notice of Disagreement, Buyer and Seller shall seek in good faith
to resolve in writing any differences they have with respect to the matters
specified in the Notice of Disagreement, and upon resolution of all such
matters, the Final Closing Statement shall be prepared in accordance with the
agreement of Buyer and Seller.

(d) If Buyer and Seller are unable to resolve the disputed items set forth
in the Notice of Disagreement within thirty (30) days following Buyers
receipt of such Notice of Disagreement (or such longer period as Buyer and
Seller may mutually agree in writing), such dispute shall be submitted to,
and all issues having a bearing on such dispute shall be resolved by a
mutually agreed office of Deloitte and Touche LLP (the " _Accounting Firm_ ").
Buyer and Seller shall submit to the Accounting Firm for review and
resolution all matters (but only such matters) that are set forth in the
Notice of Disagreement that remain in dispute. Buyer and Seller shall instruct
the Accounting Firm to select one (1) of its partners experienced in purchase
price adjustment disputes to make a final determination of the Net Working
Capital, the Closing Date Cash, the amount of Closing Indebtedness and the
amount of Company Transaction Expenses calculated with reference to the items
that are in dispute as set forth in the Notice of Disagreement. Buyer and
Seller shall instruct the Accounting Firm that, in resolving the items in the
Notice of Disagreement that are still in dispute and in determining the Net
Working Capital, the Closing Date Cash, the amount of Closing Indebtedness
and the amount of Company Transaction Expenses, the Accounting Firm shall (i)
not assign to any item in dispute a value that is (A) greater than the
greatest value for such item assigned by Buyer, on the one hand, or Seller,
on the other hand, or (B) less than the smallest value for such item assigned
by Buyer, on the one hand, or Seller, on the other hand, (ii) make its
determination based on an independent review (which will be in accordance
with the guidelines and procedures set forth in this Agreement) and, at the
Accounting Firms discretion, a one (1)-day conference concerning the dispute,
at which conference each of Buyer and Seller shall have the right to present
their respective positions with respect to the dispute and have present their
respective Representatives, (iii) render a final resolution in writing to
Buyer and Seller (which final resolution shall be requested by Buyer and
Seller to be delivered not more than thirty (30) days following submission of
such disputed matters to the Accounting Firm), which, absent manifest error,
shall be final, conclusive and binding on the Parties with respect to the Net
Working Capital, the Closing Date Cash, the amount of Closing Indebtedness and
the amount of Company Transaction Expenses, and (iv) provide a written report
to Buyer and Seller, if requested by either of them, which sets forth in
reasonable detail the basis for the Accounting Firms final determination. The
fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be allocated between Buyer and
Seller based upon the percentage which the portion of the disputes not
awarded to each Party bears to the amount actually contested by the Party
(i.e., if Seller claims that the appropriate adjustments are $1,000 greater

 



-4-  than the amount determined by Buyer and if the Accounting Firm ultimately
resolves the dispute by awarding to Seller $300 of the $1,000 contested, then
the fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be allocated 30% to Buyer
and 70% to Seller). If the Accounting Firm requires payment of fees and
expenses in advance of issuing its final determination, then such fees and
expenses shall be borne equally by the Parties; provided the applicable Party
shall be promptly reimbursed by the other Party in accordance with the
immediately preceding sentence.

 

(e) The Preliminary Closing Statement shall be deemed final and binding
upon the Parties for the purposes of this  _Section_ __ _ 1.6_ upon the
earliest of (i) ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, if and only if Seller
does not deliver a Notice of Disagreement within such period, (ii) the
resolution of all disputes, if any, by Buyer and Seller pursuant to _Section
1.6(c)_ , and (iii) the resolution of all disputes, if any, by the Accounting
Firm pursuant to _Section 1.6(d)_ , and shall, in each case, thereafter
constitute the Final Closing Statement, but only after, in the event of
clauses (ii) and (iii), giving effect to the resolution referenced therein.

(f) Within five (5) Business Days following the determination of the Final
Closing Statement, the Final Cash Balance, the Final Net Working Capital
Schedule, the Closing Indebtedness and the amount of Closing Company
Transaction Expenses in accordance with _Section 1.6(c)_ , _Section 1.6(d)_
or _Section 1.6(e)(_ _i_ _)_ , as applicable:

 

(i) if there is a Final Deficit, then Seller shall pay or cause to be paid
to Buyer an amount equal to such Final Deficit; and

(ii) if there is a Final Surplus, then Buyer shall pay to Seller an amount
equal to such Final Surplus.

(g) All payments required under this _Section_ __ _ 1.6_ shall be made in
cash by wire transfer of immediately available funds to such bank account(s)
as shall be designated in writing by the recipient(s) at least three (3)
Business Days prior to the applicable payment date.

 

Section 1.7. _Agreed Tax Consequences; Purchase Price Allocation_. The
Purchase Price will be allocated among Seller and the Asset Sellers and
between the Company Interests and the Transferred Assets as provided in
_Schedule 1.7_ (the " _Master Allocation Schedule_ "). The Parties acknowledge
that the sale of the Company Interests shall be treated for U.S. federal
income Tax purposes as a sale of all of the assets of the Company. The
Purchase Price, as adjusted pursuant to _Section 1.6(f)_ plus the agreed value
of the Assumed Liabilities, the liabilities of the Company, and any other
amounts treated as consideration under Treasury Regulations Section
1.1060-1(c) (the " _Tax Purchase Price_ ") shall be allocated among Seller and
the Asset Sellers and among the assets of the Company and the Transferred
Assets as provided in _Schedule 1.7_. All allocations under this Agreement
shall be made consistent with the Master Allocation Schedule and in accordance
with the requirements of Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury
Regulations thereunder, except to the extent required by applicable Law. For
the avoidance of doubt, to the extent allowable by Law, the Parties agree to
value all inventory consistently with the comparative sales method permitted
under Internal Revenue Procedure 2003-51). No later than ninety (90) days
following the determination of the Final Closing Statement, the Final Cash
Balance, the Final Net Working Capital Schedule, the amount of Closing
Indebtedness and the amount of the Company Transaction Expenses in accordance
with

 



-5-   _Section 1.6(c)_ , _Section 1.6(d)_ or _Section 1.6(e)(i)_ , as applicable,
Seller shall prepare and deliver to Buyer its determination of the allocation
(the " _Proposed Allocation_ ") of the Tax Purchase Price among Seller and
the Asset Sellers and among the assets of the Company and the Transferred
Assets. Seller shall (i) permit Buyer and its Representatives reasonable
access to the books, records, properties, premises, work papers, personnel
and other information of Seller to permit Buyer and its Representatives to
review the Proposed Allocation or to address any dispute described in this
_Section_ __ _ 1.7_ and (ii) cooperate fully with Buyer and its
Representatives in connection with such review or any dispute, including
providing all other information necessary or useful in connection with the
review of the Proposed Allocation as is reasonably requested by Buyer or its
Representatives. Buyer shall, within thirty (30) days following its receipt of
the Proposed Allocation, accept or reject the Proposed Allocation. If Buyer
disagrees with the Proposed Allocation, then it shall give written notice to
Seller of such dispute and any reason therefor within such thirty (30)-day
period. Should Buyer fail to notify Seller of a dispute within such
thirty (30)-day period, Buyer shall be deemed to agree with the Proposed
Allocation. In the event there is a dispute, Seller and Buyer shall attempt to
reconcile their differences, and any resolution by them as to any disputed
amounts shall be final, binding and conclusive on the Parties. If Seller and
Buyer are unable to reach a resolution with such effect within thirty (30)
days after the receipt by Seller of Buyers written notice of dispute, then
Seller and Buyer shall submit the items remaining in dispute for resolution to
the Accounting Firm. Seller and Buyer shall instruct the Accounting Firm that,
in resolving the items in the Proposed Allocation that are still in dispute,
the Accounting Firm shall (i) not assign to any item in dispute a value that
is (A) greater than the greatest value for such item assigned by Seller, on
the one hand, or Buyer, on the other hand, or (B) less than the smallest value
for such item assigned by Seller, on the one hand, or Buyer, on the other
hand, (ii) make its determination based on an independent review (which will
be in accordance with the guidelines and procedures set forth in this
Agreement) and, at the Accounting Firms discretion, a one (1)-day conference
concerning the dispute, at which conference each of Seller and Buyer shall
have the right to present their respective positions with respect to
the dispute and have present their respective Representatives, (iii) render a
final resolution in writing to Seller and Buyer (which final resolution shall
be requested by Seller and Buyer to be delivered not more than thirty (30)
days following submission of such disputed matters to the Accounting Firm),
which, absent manifest error, shall be final, conclusive and binding on the
Parties with respect to such items in the Proposed Allocation, and (iv)
provide a written report to Seller and Buyer, if requested by either of them,
which sets forth in reasonable detail the basis for the Accounting Firms
final determination. Seller and Buyer covenant and agree that the allocations
made pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 1.7_ shall be conclusive and final for
all purposes of this Agreement and shall be used by them in reporting the Tax
consequences of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the
preparation of any required IRS Form 8594) in all applicable jurisdictions.
Neither Seller nor Buyer shall take any position (whether in connection with
audits, Tax Returns or otherwise) that is inconsistent with such allocations,
except as may be required pursuant to a "determination" within the meaning of
Section 1313(a) of the Code (or a similar determination under state, local or
foreign Tax Law). The fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm under this
_Section_ __ _ 1.7_ shall be paid by the Party whose aggregate estimate of
the disputed matters that are submitted to the Accounting Firm differs most
greatly from the final determination of the Accounting Firm. If the Parties
aggregate estimates of the disputed matters differ equally from the
determination of the Accounting Firm, then the fees and expenses of the
Accounting Firm shall be borne equally by

 



-6-  the Parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for purposes of calculating any
Transfer Taxes payable by Buyer and Canadian Buyer on Closing under _Section
5.5(h)_ if any, the Parties have, prior to the Closing Date, mutually agreed
on a preliminary allocation of the Purchase Price payable in respect of the
relevant categories of the Transferred Assets, including between Transferred
Assets sold by the Asset Sellers, and in the case of Transferred Assets
situated in Canada, (i) the provinces in which such Transferred Assets are
situated; and (ii) the further allocation of the Purchase Price between lands
and buildings in respect of each Owned Real Property situated in Canada.

Section 1.8. _Withholding_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, Buyer shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
consideration payable hereunder, or other payment otherwise payable pursuant
to this Agreement, the amounts required to be deducted and withheld under the
Code, or any provision of any United States federal, state, local or foreign
Tax Law. Any amounts so withheld shall be paid over to the appropriate
Governmental Entity, and shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement
as having been paid to the applicable Person in respect to which such
deduction and withholding was made. If Buyer becomes aware of any Tax
withholding requirements that may be applicable to any payments to be made
pursuant to this Agreement, Buyer shall inform Seller as soon as reasonably
practicable of the amount to be withheld and the basis for such withholding
and shall reasonably cooperate with Seller to obtain any available exemptions
from, or reductions of, any withholding.

 

Section 1.9. _Bulk Sales Waiver_. The Parties agree to waive compliance
with the provisions of the bulk sales legislation in the jurisdictions in
which any of the Transferred Assets are located.

have against Buyer, Canadian Buyer or any Company Group Member, whether under
this Agreement or otherwise, shall not constitute a defense to enforcement of
any of the restrictions set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 5.3_.

 

(f) The Parties agree and intend that Sellers and MWPs obligations under
this  _Section_ __ _ 5.3_ be tolled during any period that Seller or MWP is
in breach of any of the obligations under this _Section_ __ _ 5.3_ so that
Buyer, Canadian Buyer and the Company Group Members are provided with the
full benefit of the restrictive periods set forth herein.

(g) Seller and MWP each acknowledge that the restrictions contained in
this _Section_ __ _ 5.3_ are reasonable and necessary to protect the
legitimate interests of Buyer, Canadian Buyer and the Company Group Members
and constitute a material inducement to Buyer to enter into this Agreement
and consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. In the event that any
covenant contained in this _Section_ __ _ 5.3_ should ever be adjudicated to
exceed the time, geographic, product or service, or other limitations
permitted by applicable Law in any jurisdiction, then any court is expressly
empowered to reform such covenant, and such covenant shall be deemed reformed,
in such jurisdiction to the maximum time, geographic, product or service,
or other limitations permitted by applicable Law. The covenants contained in
_Section_ __ _ 5.3_ and each provision hereof are severable and distinct
covenants and provisions. The invalidity or unenforceability of any such
covenant or provision as written shall not invalidate or render unenforceable
the remaining covenants or provisions hereof, and any such invalidity or
unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render
unenforceable such covenant or provision in any other jurisdiction.

Section 5.4. _Public Announcements_. Except as otherwise required by
Law, Buyer shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, make or issue
any public announcement or press release to the general public with respect to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement without the
prior written consent of Seller (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed); _provided_ that Buyer and its Affiliates
shall not be prohibited by this _Section_ __ _ 5.4_ from (i) placing
customary tombstone announcements and advertisements regarding the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement on their website, in newspapers,
journals or other print media or in other customary marketing materials, (ii)
disclosing the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or their
investment in, or information with respect to the performance of or
realization on, their investment in the Company Group, in each case, to their
investors or any prospective investors and/or (iii) issuing any
public announcement or press release to the general public with respect to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to the
extent disclosing information already publicly disclosed by MWP or its
Affiliates. MWP, Seller and their respective Affiliates will consult with
Buyer, and use good faith efforts to incorporate comments provided by Buyer,
prior to issuing or making any public announcement or press release to the
general public with respect to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 



-35- Section 5.5. _Tax Matters_.

 

(a) Buyer shall, at its own expense, prepare or cause to be prepared, and
timely file or cause to be timely filed, all Tax Returns of the Company Group
(other than Tax Returns related to federal and state Income Taxes) for all
taxable periods that end on or prior to the Closing Date (" _Pre-Closing Tax
Periods_") and that have not yet been filed and are required to be filed
after the Closing Date, in each case, except as otherwise provided herein,
consistent with past practices of each of the applicable Company Group
Members. Such Tax Returns shall be subject to the review, comment, dispute
resolution and filing procedures set forth in _Section 5.5(b)_. Seller shall,
to the extent not included in the calculation of Net Working Capital or
Indebtedness, fund (or, if previously paid from a Company (or Affiliate)
account, promptly reimburse) Buyer for all Tax payments made after the Closing
that relate to the Companys Pre-Closing Tax Periods or Sellers Pre-Closing
Tax Periods related to the Business. Buyer shall cause any amounts shown to be
due on such Tax Returns to be timely remitted to the applicable Governmental
Entity no later than the date on which such Taxes are due. Seller and its
Affiliates shall, at their own expense, prepare or cause to be prepared, and
timely file or cause to be timely filed, all Tax Returns related to federal
and state Income Taxes that report income of the Business, the Transferred
Assets or the Company Group for the Pre-Closing Tax Periods and that have not
yet been filed and are required to be filed after the Closing Date, in each
case, except as otherwise provided herein, consistent with past practices of
each of the applicable Company Group Members. Seller and its Affiliates shall
cause any amounts shown to be due on such Tax Returns and not taken into
account in the determination of Net Working Capital to be timely remitted to
the applicable Governmental Entity no later than the date on which such Taxes
are due. The Company shall be responsible for funding (including, if
applicable, through prompt reimbursement of Seller, in connection with
payments made from accounts of Seller) all tax payments allocable to Taxable
periods (or portions thereof) ending after the Closing Date.

 

(b) To the extent permitted by Law, the Transaction Deductions shall be
reported as deductions attributable to the period ending on the Closing Date
that are reportable on the Tax Returns of Seller. Buyer shall provide Seller
with a copy of any income Tax Return for a taxable period that includes (but
does not end on) the Closing Date (a " _Straddle Period_ ") for review and
comment not later than forty-five (45) days prior to its due date. If it so
desires, Seller shall review and comment on such Tax Returns within fifteen
(15) days of receipt thereof. If Seller does not submit comments within such
period, then Seller shall be deemed to have approved such Tax Returns as
prepared by Buyer, and Buyer shall file such Tax Returns promptly. If Seller
delivers comments to Buyer within such period, Seller and Buyer shall use
good faith efforts to resolve any dispute in connection with such comments. In
the event Buyer and Seller are unable to agree on any such revisions within
fifteen (15) days after Seller provides its comments, Buyer and Seller shall
engage a mutually acceptable independent accounting firm to resolve any
disputed items, the costs of which shall be borne equally by Seller, on the
one hand, and Buyer on the other hand. Upon the final determination of such
dispute, Buyer shall file or cause to be filed such Tax Returns promptly but
no later than five (5) Business Days after such final determination.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 5.5(b)_ , Buyer
shall be entitled to file, or cause to be filed, the applicable Tax Return
without having incorporated any changes based on any such dispute to the
extent necessary to avoid a late filing of such Tax Return. In the event that
the independent accounting firms resolution of any dispute necessitates that
a Tax Return filed in accordance with the preceding sentence be amended, Buyer
shall cause an amended Tax Return to be filed that reflects such resolution.

 



-36- (c) With respect to Straddle Periods, all items of income, gain,
loss, deduction or credit and any related Taxes attributable to the taxable
period of each Company Group Member in which the Closing occurs shall be
allocated between the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the portion of the Straddle
Period beginning on the day after the Closing Date based on (i) in the case of
any such items calculated or imposed on a periodic basis, the amount of such
item for the entire relevant Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction,
the numerator of which is the number of calendar days in the Straddle Period
ending on and including the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the
number of calendar days in the entire relevant Straddle Period, and (ii) in
the case of all other items, the amount of any such item determined as if the
relevant Straddle Period ended as of the close of business on the Closing
Date.

 

(d) Buyer shall pay to Seller any refunds (including any refunds
effectively received through a credit, offset or other mechanism) of Taxes of
any Company Group Member, net of any out-of-pocket expenses incurred in
relation to such refund, that are received by any Company Group Member after
the Closing and to the extent such Company Group Member is a Subsidiary or an
Affiliate of Buyer, that relate to Pre-Closing Tax Periods and that were not
taken into account in the determination of Net Working Capital or
Indebtedness. Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to pursue any
claims for refund of the Company Group pending as of the Closing Date. Buyer
agrees to always apply for refunds to be sent to the Company rather
than electing to apply such amounts as a credit against future Taxes. Buyer
shall make payment of any such refund described in this _Section 5.5(d)_ to
Seller within five (5) Business Days of receipt of such refund.

 

(e) Mueller Canada shall pay to Canadian Buyer any Sales Taxes refund it
receives after the Closing and that was taken into account as a Transferred
Asset in the determination of the Net Working Capital. Any Sales Taxes payable
by Mueller Canada to a Tax Authority after the Closing that was taken into
account in the determination of the Net Working Capital and included in the
Assumed Liabilities (if any) shall be paid by Canadian Buyer to Mueller Canada
ten Business Days prior to the day on which Muller Canada is required by the
applicable Laws to remit such amount and Mueller Canada shall timely
remit such amount to the appropriate Tax authorities. Canadian Buyer shall
not be liable for any penalties or interest resulting from a failure by
Mueller Canada to remit such amount as required under the applicable Laws
provided that Canadian Buyer has fulfilled its obligations in the prior
sentence.

(f) Neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates shall amend, refile, revoke or
otherwise modify any Tax Return or Tax election of any Company Group Member
with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period without the prior written consent of
Seller (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed).

(g) For the portion of the Closing Date after the time of Closing, other
than transactions expressly contemplated hereby, Buyer shall cause each
Company Group Member to carry on its respective business only in the Ordinary
Course.

 



-37- (h) All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration, goods
and services, harmonized sales, value added and other such Taxes and fees
(including any penalties and interest) (" _Transfer Taxes_ ") incurred in
connection with this Agreement shall be paid fifty percent (50%) by Buyer and
fifty percent (50%) by Seller when due (other than Transfer Taxes that are
recoverable by Canadian Buyer or an Affiliate by way of input tax credit or
refunds, which shall be borne one hundred percent (100%) by Canadian Buyer),
and Buyer shall, with the expense to be shared fifty percent (50%) by Buyer
and fifty percent (50%) by Seller, file all necessary Tax Returns and other
documentation with respect to all such transfer, documentary, sales, use,
stamp, registration and other Taxes and fees, and, if required by applicable
Law, Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, join in the execution of
any such Tax Returns and other documentation.

 

(i) On Closing, Canadian Buyer and Mueller Canada shall execute jointly an
election under section 167 of the Excise Tax Act (Canada) and section 75 of
an Act respecting the Quebec sales tax to relieve the sale of the Transferred
Assets being transferred by Mueller Canada from goods and services tax,
harmonized sales tax and Quebec sales tax. Canadian Buyer shall file such
elections no later than the filing date for its goods and services tax,
harmonized sales tax and Quebec sales tax returns for the reporting period in
which the sale of the Transferred Assets being transferred by Mueller Canada
takes place. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
Canadian Buyer shall indemnify Mueller Canada in respect of any goods and
services tax, harmonized sales tax and Quebec sales tax, penalties, interest
and other amounts which may be assessed against Mueller Canada as a result of
the transactions under this Agreement not being eligible for such elections or
as a result of Canadian Buyers failure to file the elections within the
prescribed time.

 

(j) On Closing or when required by applicable Law, Canadian Buyer may
provide any purchase exemption certificates or equivalent documents to Seller
to exempt the sale of the Transferred Assets being transferred by Mueller
Canada from provincial sales taxes, on the basis that such Transferred Assets
are purchased for resale or any other applicable exemption.

 

(k) If any payment made by Seller or Canadian Buyer as the result of a
breach, modification or termination of this Agreement, or of any other
agreement delivered pursuant to this Agreement, is deemed by the _Excise Tax
Act_ (Canada) to include goods and services tax or harmonized sales tax, or is
deemed by any applicable provincial or territorial legislation to include a
similar value added or multi-staged tax, the amount of such payment shall be
increased accordingly.

 

(l) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, Buyer agrees that it
shall, and it shall cause the Canadian Buyer and each applicable Company
Group Member to, (i) preserve and keep the records (including all Tax and
accounting records) of such Company Group Member for a period of seven (7)
years from the Closing, or for any longer periods as may be required by any
Governmental Entity or ongoing litigation, and (ii) make such records
available to Seller as may be reasonably requested by Seller. If Buyer,
Canadian Buyer or any Company Group Member wishes to destroy any such records
after the time specified above, Buyer shall first give sixty (60) days prior
written notice to Seller and Seller shall have the right, at its option and
expense, upon prior written notice given to Buyer within such sixty (60)-day
period, to take possession of the records within ninety (90) days after the
date of Sellers notice to Buyer.

 



-38- (m) Canadian Buyer shall jointly elect with Mueller Canada in
the prescribed form under section 22 of the _Income Tax Act_ (Canada) and the
corresponding provisions of any applicable provincial or territorial statute
as to the sale of accounts receivable by Mueller Canada to Canadian Buyer
hereunder and designate in such election an amount equal to the portion of
the Tax Purchase Price allocated to such accounts receivable pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 1.7_. Such elections shall be made within the time prescribed
therefor under applicable Law.

(n) Canadian Buyer shall jointly with Mueller Canada execute and file an
election under subsection 20(24) of the _Income Tax Act_ (Canada) in the
manner required by subsection 20(25) of the _Income Tax Act_ (Canada) and
under the equivalent or corresponding provisions of any other applicable
provincial or territorial statute, in the prescribed forms and within the
time period permitted under the _Income Tax Act_ (Canada) and under any other
applicable provincial or territorial statute, as to such amount paid by
Mueller Canada to Canadian Buyer for assuming future obligations. In this
regard, Buyer and Seller acknowledge that a portion of the Transferred Assets
being sold by Mueller Canada hereunder and having a value equal to the elected
amount under any such elections is being transferred by Mueller Canada as a
payment for the assumption of such future obligations by Canadian Buyer.

(o) Buyer and Canadian Buyer shall duly and timely make and file any
elections (including any amended elections) under Section 56.4 of the Income
Tax Act (Canada), or under analogous principles of any income tax legislation,
that Seller may reasonably request, in such form as Seller may request in
respect of the restrictive covenants contained in this Agreement.

(p) Except as set forth in  _Section 5.5(h)_ , Seller and MWP shall
indemnify Buyer, Canadian Buyer and the Company Group Members and their
respective Affiliates from and against any Losses attributable to: (i) any
Taxes of the Company Group Members or relating to the ownership of the
Transferred Assets by Seller or its Affiliates for any Pre-Closing Tax Period;
(ii) any Taxes of any Person (other than a Company Group Member) for which a
Company Group Member is liable under Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-6
(or any corresponding or similar provision of state, local or non-U.S. Tax
Law) by reason of such entity being included in any consolidated, affiliated,
combined or unitary group in any Pre-Closing Tax Period; or (iii) any Taxes of
any Person (other than a Company Group Member) for which any Company Group
Member is liable as a result of being a successor or transferee of such
Person prior to the Closing Date or as a result of any express or implied
obligation existing on or prior to the Closing Date to indemnify any such
Person by contract. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement (including this _Section 5.5(p)_ or _ARTICLE VII_ ), Seller shall
have no liability under this Agreement with respect to (and Buyer shall pay or
cause to be paid) (w) any Taxes that were taken into account in the
calculation of Net Working Capital or Indebtedness, (x) except to the extent
required by Law or attributable to a breach of the representations in
_Section_ __ _ 2.13_, Taxes incurred by any Company Group Member as a result
of actions outside the ordinary course taken after Closing (including the
incurrence of Indebtedness by the Company or Buyer or their respective
Affiliates in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement), or (y) any breach by Buyer of any provision in this _Section_ __
_ 5.5_ but only to the extent such breach caused such Loss.

 



-39- Section 5.6. _Directors_ __ _and Officers_ __ _Indemnification_.

(a) Buyer agrees that (i) the governing documents of each Company Group
Member as in effect immediately after the Closing shall contain provisions
with respect to indemnification, exculpation from liability and advancement of
expenses that are at least as favorable to the beneficiaries of such
provisions as the corresponding provisions that are set forth in the
governing documents of such Company Group Member on the date of this
Agreement, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise
modified for a period of six (6) years following the Closing in any manner
that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any Person who, at or
prior to the Closing, was a director or officer of any Company Group Member,
with respect to matters occurring at or prior to the Closing, in each case
unless such modification is required by Law, and (ii) all rights to
indemnification as provided in any indemnification agreements with any current
or former directors, officers, managers, employees and agents of any Company
Group Member (collectively, the " _Indemnified D andO Parties_"), as in effect
immediately prior to the signing and set forth on _Schedule 5.6_ with respect
to matters occurring at or prior to the Closing, shall survive the Closing in
accordance with its terms but in any event for no more than six (6) years.

(b) In the event that Buyer, the Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries, successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of
its properties and assets to any other Person, Buyer shall ensure that proper
provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Buyer, the
Company or their respective Subsidiaries, successors or assigns, as
applicable, assume the obligations set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 5.6_.

 

(c) This _Section_ __ _ 5.6_ shall survive the Closing and shall continue
for the periods specified herein and is intended to benefit any Person or
entity (and their respective heirs, successors and assigns) referenced in this
_Section_ __ _ 5.6_ or indemnified hereunder, each of whom may enforce the
provisions of this  _Section_ __ _ 5.6_ (whether or not parties to this
Agreement).

Section 5.7. _Employees; Employee Benefits_.

(a) On the first Business Day after the Closing Date, Buyer shall, or shall

Employee who is located in Canada and listed on _Schedule 5.7(a)(ii)_
(collectively, the " _Canadian Business Employees_ "), in a similar job or
position, with similar hours of work and in the same location as in effect
immediately prior to the Closing Date and, other than Canadian Business
Employees who are covered by a Collective Bargaining Agreement, (i) at a
salary or wage level and target bonus opportunity amount that
is substantially similar in the aggregate to the salary or wage level and
target bonus opportunity amount to which such Canadian Business Employees were
entitled immediately prior to the Closing Date, (ii) with 

 



-40-  benefits, perquisites and other terms and conditions of employment that are
substantially similar in the aggregate to the benefits, perquisites and other
terms and conditions offered to Canadian Buyers similarly situated employees
(including any benefits pursuant to defined contribution retirement and
savings plans, medical and dental and pharmaceutical plans and programs, but
excluding any benefits provided under any defined benefit pension plans,
post-retirement health and welfare plans and equity or equity-based plans and
arrangements) and (iii) with full recognition of their accrued years of
service for all employment purposes, including for any required notice
of termination, termination or severance pay (contractual, statutory, common
law or otherwise), but not for the purposes of benefits accrual. Seller shall

Business Employee listed on _Schedule 5.7(a)_ who does not accept such offer
of employment or whose employment does not continue with Buyer or an Affiliate
of Buyer as of the Closing Date by effect of applicable Law to be terminated

Employees_ ". Buyer acknowledges that the Canadian Business Employees listed
on _Schedule 5.7(a)_ are currently employed by Mueller Canada.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Buyer shall
be responsible for all liabilities (i) directly arising from the termination
of employment of any Transferred Business Employee subsequent to the Closing

resulting from such failure by Buyer or Canadian Buyer. Seller and MWP shall
retain and be responsible for all liabilities relating to each Canadian
Business Employee who receives but does not accept an offer of employment from
Buyer or Canadian Buyer that is made on terms in accordance with _Section
5.7(a)_, including all liabilities for wages, vacation pay, bonus, termination
pay and severance pay, whether arising from statute, contract or at common
law.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, after the
Closing, the terms and conditions of employment for any Transferred Business
Employee whose employment is subject to a Collective Bargaining Agreement (i)
to which a Company Group Member or Mueller Canada is party or (ii) which
transfers by operation of applicable Law to Buyer or one of its Affiliates,
shall be governed by such Collective Bargaining Agreement (with any
modifications permitted under applicable Law or such agreement to account for
terms and conditions of employment, including provision of benefits, being
provided by Buyer, Canadian Buyer or one of their Affiliates) until its
expiration, modification or termination in accordance with its terms and
applicable Law.

 

(d) Buyer hereby agrees that, after the Closing, the Company Group shall
(i) honor, pay, and satisfy any and all obligations to, or in respect of,
each Continued Employee arising under the terms of any employment, retention,
severance or similar agreement that is set forth on _Schedule 5.7(d)_ , in
accordance with the terms thereof in effect on the Closing Date;

 



-41-   _provided_ that Seller shall remain solely (economically) responsible for
any and all Company Transaction Expenses; and (ii) assume, honor and be solely
responsible for paying or providing when due all vacation, sick pay and other
paid time off for Continued Employees accrued but unused as of the Closing
Date to the extent reflected as a current liability on the Final Net Working
Capital Schedule. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this _Section
5.7(d)_ shall alter, limit or impair the right of any Buyer Indemnified Party
to indemnification for a breach of any of the terms or conditions of this
Agreement in accordance with _ARTICLE VII_.

 

(e) From and after the Closing, except as expressly provided in the
Transition Services Agreement, none of Buyer, Canadian Buyer or any Company
Group Member shall have any liability with respect to, and Seller and MWP
shall fully indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Parties for any liability incurred
by any of them under or with respect to, any Employee Benefit Plan that is
not also a Company Benefit Plan. Upon and after the Closing, none of Buyer,
Canadian Buyer or any Company Group Member shall make any payments in
connection with, or have any liability whatsoever with respect to, any stock-
based compensation award granted on or before the Closing to, or held at any
time at or before the Closing by, any current or former employee, director,
officer, or consultant of any Company Group Member or any other current or
former employee, officer, director or independent contractor of Seller or any
of its Affiliates who is or has been employed in the Business (including any
Transferred Business Employee).

 

(f) For all workers compensation claims of all employees of the Company
Group (other than the Canadian Business Employees) for losses that occurred
before the Closing Date (the " _Pre-Closing Workers_ __ _Compensation Claims_
"), Seller shall administer or cause to be administered each such Pre-Closing
Workers Compensation Claim (including through the use of third-party service
providers) in the Ordinary Course, and including by maintaining any necessary
letters of credit, surety bonds and guarantees. Such letters of credit,
surety bonds and guarantees that are in place as of the date hereof are listed
on _Schedule 5.7(f)_. Upon receipt of written notice from Seller, Buyer shall
promptly reimburse Seller for (i) the reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of
its or any of its Affiliates outstanding letters of credit, surety and
performance bonds, guarantees and other financial support arrangements
relating to the Company Group with respect to the Pre-Closing Workers
Compensation Claims and (ii) the cost (which shall include reasonable third-
party processing costs consistent with Sellers past practices) of such Pre-
Closing Workers Compensation Claims. Seller shall invoice Buyer for the
amount of the Pre-Closing Workers Compensation Claims paid by Seller
promptly after payment and the other amounts to be reimbursed by Buyer
pursuant to clause (i) in the immediately preceding sentence promptly after
payment by Seller, and Buyer shall reimburse Seller for such payments within
thirty (30) days after receipt of each invoice.

(g) Seller shall be responsible for the amount of the fiscal year 2016
bonuses payable to Current Business Employees (plus the employer portion of
all employment, unemployment, payroll and similar Taxes payable thereon);
provided that Buyer will facilitate the payment of such bonuses, if
necessary. Buyer, Canadian Buyer or the Company shall be responsible for the
amount of the bonuses payable to Continued Employees for any period following
September 30, 2016, including the portion of such bonuses attributable to
pre-Closing periods (plus the employer portion of all employment,
unemployment, payroll and similar Taxes payable thereon). Such bonuses shall
not be included in the calculation of Net Working Capital or Indebtedness.

 



-42- (h) With respect to any Continued Employee who made contributions to
the Mueller Water Products, Inc. 2006 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (" _ESPP_
") for the purchase period in which the Closing occurs (the " _Purchase
Period_ " and each such Continued Employee, a " _Company ESPP Participant_
"), (i) Buyer shall refund to each Company ESPP Participant the amount of
contributions contributed by each such Company ESPP Participant during the
Purchase Period and (ii) Seller shall reimburse Buyer for the amount
of contributions refunded by Buyer to such Company ESPP Participant within
fifteen (15) days following the date that Buyer provides payroll records
evidencing the amount of contributions refunded to such Company ESPP
Participant. Such contributions shall not be included in the calculation of
Net Working Capital or Indebtedness.

(i) From and after the Closing, none of the Buyer, Canadian Buyer or any
Company Group Member shall have any liability with respect to (i) the Mueller
Group, LLC Pension Plan for Selected Employees, as amended from time to time,
the assets of which shall be retained by MWP and its Affiliates (excluding
the Company Group); or (ii) the Pension Plan for Employees of Mueller Canada,
Ltd. and its Canadian Affiliates, as amended from time to time, the assets of
which shall be dealt with in accordance with _Section 5.7(k)_.

(j) Following the establishment of a 401(k) plan by the Buyer or one of its
Affiliates covering the Company Group Members (the " _Buyer 401(k) Plan_ "),
Buyer and Seller agree to engage in a trustee-to-trustee transfer under
Section 414(l) of the Code with respect to the account balances (including,
without limitation, promissory notes) under the Mueller Group, LLC Retirement
Savings Plan No. 1 and the Mueller Group, LLC Retirement Savings Plan No. 2
(collectively, the " _Mueller Group Retirement Plans_ "), as applicable,
relating to Continued Employees promptly after the establishment of the Buyer
401(k) Plan. Seller has adopted or, if not yet adopted, will adopt promptly
following the Closing, amendments to each of the Mueller Group Retirement
Plans to expressly permit Continued Employees who have one or more outstanding
loans under one or both of the Mueller Group Retirement Plans on the Closing
Date to make non-payroll loan payments thereunder so their loans under the
Mueller Group Retirement Plans do not default as the result of the fact that
they will not be employed by a participating employer in the Mueller
Group Retirement Plans following the Closing.

(k) (i) No Transferred Business Employee shall accrue any benefit
under the Pension Plan for Employees of Mueller Canada, Ltd. and its Canadian
Affiliates (the " _Seller Canadian DC Plan_ _"_ ) after the Closing Date.

 

(ii) As soon as practicable following the Closing, Canadian Buyer shall, or
shall cause one of its Affiliates to, make available or establish a defined
contribution pension plan and related funding arrangement which shall be a
registered pension plan under Canadian Pension Law (a " _Buyer Canadian DC
Plan_ ") to accept the transfer of the assets from the defined contribution
accounts in the Seller Canadian DC Plan attributable to each Transferred
Business Employee (the " _DC Assets_ ") who participated in the Seller
Canadian DC Plan and who has such an account as of the Closing (the "
_Canadian DC Pension Transfer Employees_ ").

(iii) As soon as practicable following the Closing, but no later than nine
(9) months following the Closing (in accordance with the requirements of
Canadian Pension Law), the Seller (or an Affiliate) shall prepare and file
with the Governmental Entity any 

 



-43-  documents required to be filed under Canadian Pension Law or by the
Governmental Entity in connection with an asset transfer application
applicable to the Canadian DC Pension Transfer Employees (the " _Asset
Transfer Application_ "). The Parties shall cooperate and work together in
good faith to meet all regulatory timelines related to the Asset Transfer
Application, including the provision of member notices to Canadian DC Pension
Transfer Employees. The Seller shall be responsible for costs associated with
preparing and filing the Asset Transfer Application including, for greater
certainty, any required member notices to Canadian DC Pension Transfer
Employees, other than the costs associated with the Buyer reviewing and
approving the Asset Transfer Application including, for greater certainty, any
required notices to Canadian DC Pension Transfer Employees.

 

(iv) Subject to Canadian Pension Law, as soon as practicable after the
receipt of all necessary approvals from the Governmental Entity, the Seller
shall cause the funding agent of the Seller Canadian DC Plan to transfer the
DC Assets accumulated as of the date of such transfer to the funding agent of
the Buyer Canadian DC Plan. The DC Assets transferred pursuant to this
_Section 5.7(k)_ shall be in the form of cash, unless the Parties otherwise
agree prior to the time the DC Assets are transferred. Upon completion of the
transfer of the DC Assets, Seller, Sellers Affiliates and the
Seller Canadian DC Plan shall have no further responsibility for the
transferred DC Assets.

(v) For any Buyer Canadian DC Plan that is newly created, Buyer shall
provide to Seller such commercially reasonably evidence of the existence of
such plan and its registration with the applicable Governmental Entities.
Buyer and Sellers shall cooperate in good faith in the timely filing of any
documents required to be filed by the Governmental Entity or under Canadian
Pension Law with respect to the Asset Transfer Application and the transfer of
DC Assets described in this _Section 5.7(k)_. In addition, Buyer and Sellers
shall cooperate in (A) making all other filings required or appropriate under
Canadian Pension Law, (B) implementing all communications with participants
required or appropriate under Canadian Pension Law, (C) transferring
required or appropriate records and (D) taking all such other actions as may
be necessary and appropriate to implement the provisions of this _Section
5.7(k)_ in a timely manner.

 

(l) Seller (or an Affiliate, as applicable, but excluding any Company Group
Member) shall be solely responsible and liable for all claims incurred on or
prior to the Closing by any current or former employee of a Company Group
Member (and their dependents and beneficiaries) under the Mueller Water
Products, Inc. Medical Plan Benefit Program (medical, dental and pharmacy),
the Canadian health and dental welfare plans, and the Short-Term Disability
Plan. For purposes of the foregoing, a medical, dental or pharmacy claim shall
be deemed incurred on the date services are rendered or a prescription is
filled, and a short-term disability claim shall be deemed incurred on the
date of the first incidence of disability, illness, injury, or disease that
first qualifies an individual for short term disability benefits, as the case
may be. Seller and its Affiliates (excluding all Company Group Members) shall
be solely responsible and liable for providing all coverage required by the
Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended (" _COBRA_
") to all current and former employees of any Company Group Member (and their
dependents and beneficiaries) with respect to any "qualifying event" (as
defined in Treasury Regulation Section 54.4980B-4) that occurred prior to the
Closing.

 



-44- (m) Each Party hereto agrees to provide, to the extent permitted
by applicable law, such information and data as the other Party may
reasonably request from time to time for such Party to comply with the
provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 5.7_ (including the information that such
Party reasonably deems necessary for the administration of any of its
employee benefit plans).

(n) Neither Buyer nor Canadian Buyer shall assume any of the Employee
Benefit Plans that provided benefits to Canadian Business Employees
immediately prior to the Closing Date or liability for accrued benefits or any
other liability under or in respect of any of such Employee Benefit Plans.
Except as otherwise provided in the Transition Services Agreement, the
Transferred Business Employees shall cease to participate in any Employee
Benefit Plans as of the Closing Date. For greater certainty, Seller shall be
responsible for all liabilities for claims for injury, disability or death
under any Employee Benefit Plan relating to any Transferred Business Employees
incurred prior to the Closing. For such purposes, the date on which a claim is
incurred will be: (i) in the case of a death claim, the date of death; (ii)
in the case of a short term disability claim, long term disability claim or a
life insurance premium waiver claim, the date of the first incidence of
disability, illness, injury or disease that first qualifies an individual for
benefits or to commence a qualifying period for benefits; (iii) in the case of
extended health care benefits, including dental and medical treatments, the
date of treatment or the date of purchase of eligible medical or dental
supplies; and (iv) in the case of a claim for drug or vision benefits, the
date the prescription was filled.

 

(o) Without limiting the generality of _Section_ __ _ 8.5_, the provisions
of this  _Section_ __ _ 5.7_ are solely for the benefit of the Parties to
this Agreement and no current or former employee, director or independent
contractor or any other individual associated therewith shall be regarded for
any purpose as a third-party beneficiary of this _Section_ __ _ 5.7_, and
nothing herein shall be construed as (i) the adoption of or an amendment to
any Employee Benefit Plan or other employee benefit plan for any purpose
or (ii) limiting in any manner the right of Buyer or any of its Affiliates to
terminate or amend any employee benefit plan at any time and for any reason.

 

(p) On or before the Closing, Seller, each Company Group Member and their
respective Affiliates shall have removed each Company Group Member from
participation in the Employee Benefit Plans that are not Company Benefit Plans
effective as of the Closing (or such later date as provided in the Transition
Services Agreement) and Seller shall deliver resolutions or other evidence
reasonably acceptable to the Buyer to establish the same (the " _Benefit Plan
Removal Evidence_ "). MWP and Seller hereby release and waive, and agree to
cause their respective Affiliates (other than any Company Group Member) to
release and waive, the right to enforce any covenants regarding non-
competition and non-solicitation of customers for Sellers or its Affiliates
benefit that would prohibit, limit or restrict any Current Business Employee
from becoming employed by, or any independent contractor currently engaged by
the Business from being engaged by (or from otherwise performing, in each
case, any of their duties for), Buyer, Canadian Buyer, any Company Group
Member or any of their respective Affiliates on or after the Closing. MWP and
Seller acknowledge and agree that they shall not require any Current Business
Employee to take any action to cause any Intellectual Property developed or
invented by such Current Business Employee to vest in Seller or its
Affiliates. In addition, MWP and Seller acknowledge and agree that (i) any
restriction in an agreement between any Current Business Employee and Seller
or any of its Affiliates (other than a Company Group member) relating to the
use or disclosure of confidential, proprietary or trade secret information
shall

 



-45-  apply only to the confidential, proprietary or trade secret information of
Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than a Company Group Member or with
respect to the Business) and (ii) any covenant relating to the solicitation
of employees and independent contractors in an agreement between any Current
Business Employee and Seller of any of its Affiliates (other than a Company
Group Member) shall not apply to current and former employees and independent
contractors of any Company Group Member (excluding any former employee or
independent contractor of the Company and its subsidiaries who is providing
services to MWP or its Affiliates other than a Company Group Member). 

(q) Prior to the Closing, Seller will transfer the employment of the
employee listed on _Schedule 5.7(q)_ to the Company.

(r) From and after the Closing, none of the Buyer, Canadian Buyer or any
Company Group Member shall have any liability with respect to any Sellers
Canadian employee savings plan including, for greater certainty, the Mueller
Canada Ltd. Retirement Savings Plan (Group RRSP/DPSP/EPSP/TFSA) as set forth
in Schedule 2.16(a) (each, a " _Seller s Canadian Employee Savings Plan_",
collectively, the " _Seller s Canadian Employee Savings Plans_"). No
Transferred Business Employee shall accrue any benefit under any Sellers
Canadian Employee Savings Plan after the Closing. Sellers shall treat
Transferred Business Employees as terminated for purposes of the Sellers
Canadian Employee Savings Plans. As soon as practicable following the Closing,
Canadian Buyer shall, or shall cause one of its affiliates to, make available
or establish an employee saving plan for the Transferred Business Employees
which shall be similar to the Sellers Canadian Employee Savings Plans (the "
_Buyer s Canadian Employee Savings Plan_"). The Parties shall cooperate to
permit Transferred Business Employees who so elect to transfer their funds
from the Sellers Canadian Employee Savings Plan to the Buyers Canadian
Employee Savings Plan.

 

Section 5.8. _Intercompany Accounts; Intercompany Arrangements_.

 

(a) Effective as of the Closing, the Parties agree that the accounts of the
Business shall not include any intercompany accounts between Seller and any
of its Affiliates (excluding the Company Group), on the one hand, and the
Company Group, on the other hand, except as expressly set forth in _Schedule
5.8(a)_. Seller acknowledges and agrees that any such intercompany accounts
have been fully discharged prior to the Closing Date. For the avoidance of
doubt, intercompany accounts solely between or among the Company and Anvil
International Holdings shall not be affected by this _Section 5.8(a)_. 

(b) Effective as of the Closing, other than (i) pursuant to this Agreement,
(ii) expressly provided in the Transition Services Agreement or (iii) as
otherwise set forth in _Schedule 5.8(b)_ , (A) Seller acknowledges and agrees
that it has caused any contract or other arrangement with the Company Group,
including any guarantees and other financial support arrangements with the
Company Group and any contract with the Company Group for any loans to or
from, furnishing of services by, license or rental of any assets from or to,
or otherwise requiring payments to or from, Seller or any Affiliate of Seller
(excluding the Company Group), on the one hand, and the Company Group, on the
other hand, in each case, other than (x) this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby and (y) any Employee Benefit Plans (the " _Affiliate
Transactions_ "), to be terminated, without any party having any continuing
obligations

 



-46-  thereunder, and (B) except to the extent expressly provided for in the
Transition Services Agreement, the Company Group no longer receives any
benefits under any Affiliate Transactions. For the avoidance of doubt, Buyer
shall bear the responsibility for replacing any such Contract, other
arrangement with the Company Group and Employee Benefit Plans that are
terminated by Seller effective as of the Closing.

 

Section 5.9. _Intellectual Property_.

 

(a) Except as otherwise expressly provided in this _Section 5.9(a)_ , no
right to use the Excluded Names is being provided to Buyer or any of its
Affiliates (including the Company Group) pursuant to this Agreement. As
promptly as practicable following the Closing, but in no event later than
ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall cause the Company Group
to stop using the Excluded Names in any form including by removing,
permanently obliterating or covering all Excluded Names that appear on any
asset of the Company Group, including all signs, promotional or advertising
literature, labels, stationery, business cards, office forms and packaging
materials. Without limiting the foregoing, in no event shall the Company Group
use or display any Excluded Name in any way (i) other than in the same manner
used by such Company Group immediately prior to the Closing Date, (ii) in
connection with products or services not conforming to the same standard of
quality that existed prior to the Closing Date, or (iii) that could detract
from or impair the goodwill associated with such Excluded Names.
Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, Buyer shall not be in violation of the
immediately preceding sentence by reason of its or any of its Affiliates
(including the Company Groups) use after the Closing of any inventory of the
Company Group existing as of the Closing or distribution or re-sale after the
Closing of any products of MWP or any of its Affiliates pursuant to any
distributor or re-sale arrangement, and Buyer shall not be in violation of
this _Section_ __ _ 5.9_ by reason of (A) the appearance of the Excluded
Names in or on any tools, equipment, engineering/manufacturing drawings,
manuals, work sheets, operating procedures, other written materials or other
assets of the Company Group that are used for internal purposes only in
connection with their business; _provided_ that Buyer endeavors to remove
such appearances of the Excluded Names in the ordinary course of the operation
of the Company Groups business, (B) the appearance of the Excluded Names in
or on any third partys publications, marketing materials, brochures,
instruction sheets, equipment or products that were distributed in the
ordinary course of business or pursuant to a contract prior to the Closing
Date, and that generally are in the public domain, or any other similar uses
by any such third party over which Buyer has no control, or (C) the use by
Buyer and its Affiliates of the Excluded Names in a non-trademark manner for
purposes of conveying to customers or the general public that control of the
Company Group has changed or other fair use purposes.

(b) Except as otherwise expressly provided in this _Section 5.9(b)_ , no
right to use the Purchased Names is being provided to Seller or any of its
Affiliates (excluding the Company Group) pursuant to this Agreement. As
promptly as practicable following the Closing, but in no event later than
ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, Seller shall and shall cause its
Affiliates to stop using the Purchased Names in any form including by
removing, permanently obliterating or covering all Purchased Names that appear
on any asset of Seller or any of its Affiliates (excluding the Company
Group), including all signs, promotional or advertising literature, labels,
stationery, business cards, office forms and packaging materials. Without
limiting the foregoing, in no event shall Seller or any of its Affiliates
(excluding the Company

 



-47-  Group) use or display any Purchased Name in any way (i) other than in the
same manner used by such Company Group immediately prior to the Closing Date,
(ii) in connection with products or services not conforming to the same
standard of quality that existed prior to the Closing Date, or (iii) that
could detract from or impair the goodwill associated with such Purchased
Names. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, Seller shall not be in violation
of the immediately preceding sentence by reason of (A) the appearance of the
Purchased Names in or on any tools, equipment, engineering/manufacturing
drawings, manuals, work sheets, operating procedures, other written materials
or other assets of Seller or its Affiliates (excluding the Company Group) that
are used for internal purposes only in connection with their business;
_provided_ that Seller endeavors to remove such appearances of the Purchased
Names in the ordinary course of the operation of Sellers business, (B) the
appearance of the Purchased Names in or on any third partys publications,
marketing materials, brochures, instruction sheets, equipment or products that

prior to the Closing Date, and that generally are in the public domain, or any
other similar uses by any such third party over which Seller and its
Affiliates has no control, or (C) the use by Seller and its Affiliates of the
Purchased Names in a non-trademark manner for purposes of conveying to
customers or the general public that control of the Company Group has changed
or other fair use purposes.

Section 5.10. _Company Confidential Information_. Seller and MWP
acknowledge that they and their respective Subsidiaries have Company
Confidential Information. In connection therewith, as of the Closing Date and
thereafter, Seller and MWP hereby covenant and agree that Seller, MWP and
their respective Subsidiaries shall keep and hold the Company Confidential
Information in strict confidence and, except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement (including in connection with the enforcement of Sellers rights
hereunder), shall not use for any purpose, nor directly or indirectly
disclose, distribute, publish, disseminate or otherwise make available to any
third party, any of the Company Confidential Information without Buyers prior
written consent; provided, however, that if Seller, MWP or any of
their respective Subsidiaries (and/or any of their Representatives) is
requested or required to disclose any Company Confidential Information by
judicial or administrative process or by other requirements of applicable Law,
then Seller, MWP or the applicable Subsidiary shall promptly notify Buyer and
shall cooperate with Buyer to obtain a protective order or other appropriate
remedy in respect of the Company Confidential Information at issue. In the
event such order or remedy cannot be obtained or Buyer waives compliance with
the terms of this _Section_ __ _ 5.10_, then Seller, MWP or their applicable
Subsidiary may disclose only that portion of such Company Confidential
Information which Seller, MWP or such Subsidiary is advised by its outside
counsel is legally required to be disclosed. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth herein, nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 5.10_ shall limit
the right of Seller, MWP or any of their respective Subsidiaries to use or
disclose any Company Confidential Information in connection with but only to
the extent necessary for Seller, MWP and their respective Subsidiaries to
comply with any lawful requirement of a Governmental Entity or with any
applicable Law, including any applicable securities Laws or securities
exchange or listing regulations or requirements, or prepare their financial
statements or prepare and file their Tax Returns and other Tax filings.

 

Section 5.11. _Insurance_. The Parties acknowledge and agree that
effective upon the Closing, all insurance policies carried by or for the
benefit of Seller or any of its Affiliates with respect to the Business (the "
_Mueller Insurance Policies_ ") may be modified by Seller to exclude

 



-48-  coverage of the Business for insurable events or conditions first arising or
occurring after the Closing so long as any such modification does not prevent,
limit or alter the ability to make claims under such policies with respect to
pre-Closing events, conditions or occurrences. Buyer acknowledges and agrees
that, as of Closing, it has adequate replacement insurance coverage for the
Business, including insurance required by any Contract to be so maintained.
Seller shall promptly submit claims on behalf of Buyer under any Mueller
Insurance Policies arising out of pre-Closing events, conditions
or occurrences, and Buyer and the Company Group shall have the right to
receive (and MWP and Seller shall provide to Buyer) the proceeds of any such
claim; _provided_ that (i) Buyer will, or will cause the Company Group, to pay
all deductibles required to be paid in connection with any such claim and
(ii) the Company Group will be responsible for any reasonable out-of-pocket
costs or expenses in connection with filing and prosecution of any such
claim, which shall be promptly reimbursed by the Company Group after receipt
of a written invoice from Seller. Buyer and Seller shall reasonably cooperate
in connection with the covenants in this  _Section_ __ _ 5.11_. Buyer
acknowledges that Seller shall have no responsibility for obtaining any
insurance with respect to the Business relating to or arising out of
occurrences subsequent to the Closing. For the avoidance of doubt, Buyer
shall have no right to make any claim directly against Seller except as
otherwise permitted under this Agreement or against any insurance carrier
under any of the Mueller Insurance Policies for any claim, loss, liability,
lien, damage or expense applicable to the Business.

Section 5.12. _Release_. Effective at the Closing, each of Seller and
MWP, on behalf of itself, its respective Subsidiaries and successors and
assigns (collectively, the " _Releasing Parties_ ") hereby absolutely,
unconditionally and irrevocably releases and discharges, fully, finally and
forever, Buyer, Canadian Buyer and the Company Group and their respective
Affiliates, agents, representatives, directors, managers, officers and
employees (together, the " _Released Parties_ ") from any and all claims,
demands, rights, causes of action, proceedings, orders, remedies,
obligations, damages and liabilities of whatsoever kind or character arising
as a result of any event or condition, or action or inaction of the Released
Parties, from the beginning of time until the Closing, whether known or
unknown, absolute or contingent, both at Law and in equity, which such
Releasing Party ever had, now has, or ever may have, against any Released
Party, in each case, relating to or in connection with the Company Group or
the Business, including in any Releasing Partys capacity as a direct or
indirect equityholder of any Company Group Member and pursuant to any contract
between any Releasing Party and a Released Party (as to each Releasing Party,
such Releasing Partys " _Released Claims_ ") _provided_ , _however_ , that
Released Claims shall not include (i) any claims pursuant to this Agreement or
any of the Ancillary Agreements and (ii) any claims against any
Released Parties arising out of or resulting from fraud by such Released
Party. Effective as of the Closing, each of Seller and MWP agrees not to file
or permit to be filed, any Litigation against any Released Party with any
Governmental Entity or otherwise, based on events occurring on or prior to
the Closing Date in relation to any matter released or purported to be
released hereunder. Neither Seller nor MWP has assigned, and each hereby
covenants not to assign, any Released Claim. Seller and MWP are aware that
statutes exist that render null and void or otherwise affect or may affect
releases and discharges of any claims, rights, demands, liabilities, actions
and causes of action that are unknown to the releasing or discharging party at
the time of execution of the release and discharge. Each of Seller and MWP,
for itself and its other Releasing Parties, hereby expressly waives,
surrenders and agrees to forego any and all protections, rights or benefits to
which Seller or MWP, as applicable, otherwise would be entitled by virtue of
the existence of any such statute or the

 



-49-  common law of any state, province or jurisdiction with the same or similar
effect. Further, it is understood and agreed that the facts in respect of
which this release is given may turn out to be other than or different from
the facts in that respect now known or believed by Seller or MWP to be true;
and with such understanding and agreement, each of Seller and MWP expressly
accepts and assumes the risk of facts being other than or different from the
assumptions and perceptions as of any date prior to and including the Closing
Date, and agrees that this release shall be in all respects effective and
shall not be subject to termination or rescission by reason of any such
difference in facts.

Buyer Indemnified Parties with respect thereto that Seller may reasonably
request. The failure to so notify Seller shall relieve Seller or MWP from
liability under this Agreement with respect to such claim only if, and only to
the extent that, such failure to notify Seller results in (i) the forfeiture

it with respect to such claim or (ii) material prejudice to Seller or MWP, as
applicable, with respect to such claim.

any claim, or the commencement of any suit, action or proceeding asserted by
a third party (a " _Third Party Claim_ ") with respect to which such
Indemnified Party may be entitled to indemnification hereunder, such
Indemnified Party shall provide prompt written notice to Buyer or Seller
and/or MWP, whichever is the appropriate indemnifying Party hereunder (the "
_Indemnifying Party_ "); _provided_ that the failure to so notify the
Indemnifying Party shall relieve the Indemnifying Party from liability under
this Agreement with respect to such claim only if, and only to the extent
that, such failure to notify the Indemnifying Party results in (i) the
forfeiture by the Indemnifying Party of rights and defenses otherwise
available to the Indemnifying Party with respect to such claim or (ii)
material prejudice to the Indemnifying Party with respect to such claim.
Except as otherwise set forth herein, the Indemnifying Party shall have the
right, upon written notice delivered to the Indemnified Party within thirty
(30) days thereafter, to assume the defense of such Third Party Claim,
including the employment of counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified
Party (and Buyer hereby acknowledges that King and Spalding LLP shall be
satisfactory to the Indemnified Party if any Buyer Indemnified Party is an
Indemnified Party) and the payment of the fees and disbursements of such
counsel, _provided_ that the Indemnifying Party shall not have a right to
assume the defense of a Third Party Claim if (A) a material component of such
Third Party Claim includes any injunctive or equitable relief, (B) the amount
of Losses in respect of such Third Party Claim (and all other pending claims)
would be reasonably expected to exceed the applicable liability limits set
forth in _Section_ __ _ 7.7_, (C) such Third Party Claim relates to or arises
in connection with any criminal proceeding or involves claims by any
Governmental Entity or (D) such claim involves any customer, supplier or
distributor of the Business. In any Third Party Claim with respect to which
indemnification is being sought hereunder, the Indemnified Party or the
Indemnifying Party, whichever is not assuming the

 



-54-  defense of such action, shall have the right to participate in such matter
and to retain its own counsel at such Partys own expense; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if there is a conflict of interest between the Indemnified
Party and the Indemnifying Party with respect to such Third Party Claim, such
Party may retain its counsel at the expense of the other party; and _provided_
, _further_ , that with respect to Third Party Claims regarding Taxes,
including Third Party Claims regarding Taxes of Seller related to the Business
or the Transferred Assets, the Indemnifying Party shall: (a) timely keep the
Indemnified Party reasonably informed regarding the status and progress of
such Third Party Claim, (b) promptly provide to the Indemnified Party drafts
of all material correspondence relating to such Third Party Claim and consider
in good faith any comments of the Indemnified Party on such correspondence,
(c) promptly provide notice to the Indemnified Party of any material scheduled
meetings (including meetings by teleconference) with any Governmental Entity
or other relevant third party relating to such Third Party Claim and
use commercially reasonable efforts to allow the Indemnified Party to
participate in such meetings and (d) not settle (or agree to settle) any such
Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).
The Indemnifying Party or the Indemnified Party, as the case may be, shall at
all times use reasonable efforts to keep the Indemnifying Party or the
Indemnified Party, as the case may be, reasonably apprised of the status of
any matter the defense of which they are maintaining and to cooperate in good
faith with each other with respect to the defense of any such matter. An
Indemnifying Party may not, without the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Party, settle or compromise any Third Party Claim or consent to
the entry of any judgment with respect to a Third Party Claim unless such
Third Party Claim is not regarding Taxes and such settlement, compromise or
consent (x) includes an unconditional release of the Indemnified Party and
its officers, directors, managers, employees and Affiliates from all liability
arising out of such claim, (y) does not contain any admission or statement
suggesting any wrongdoing or liability on behalf of or violation of Law by
the Indemnified Party and (z) does not contain any equitable order, judgment
or term that in any manner affects, restrains or interferes with the business
of the Indemnified Party or any of the Indemnified Partys Affiliates and the
sole relief provided in such settlement is monetary damages that are paid in
full by the Indemnifying Party.

 

(b) If the Indemnifying Party does not assume control of the Third Party
Claim, the Indemnified Party may not settle or compromise such claim without
the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 

(c) If an Indemnified Party claims a right to payment pursuant to this
Agreement not involving a Third Party Claim, then such Indemnified Party
shall send written notice of such claim to the appropriate Indemnifying Party.
Such notice shall specify in reasonable detail the basis for such claim. As
promptly as possible after the Indemnified Party has given such notice, such
Indemnified Party and the appropriate Indemnifying Party shall establish the
merits and amount of such claim (by mutual agreement, arbitration, litigation
or otherwise) and, within five (5) Business Days of the final
determination of the merits and amount of such claim, (i) if the Indemnifying
Party is MWP and/or Seller, then MWP and/or Seller shall pay to Buyer an
amount equal to such claim as determined hereunder and (ii) if the
Indemnifying Party is Buyer, then Buyer shall pay to Seller, an amount equal
to such claim as determined hereunder.

 



-55- Section 7.6. _Claims Period_.

 

(a) The Claims Period hereunder shall begin on the Closing Date and
terminate on the date that is the later of (x) the 10th Business Day after
delivery by the independent auditor of their final executed audit report for
the financial statements of the Business for the year ending September 30,
2017 but in any event not later than January 15, 2018, and (y) twelve (12)
months following the Closing Date; _provided_ that (i) with respect to Buyer
Losses arising under any Company Fundamental Representation or Buyer Losses
arising under any Seller Fundamental Representation, the Claims Period shall
survive until thirty (30) days following the expiration of the applicable
statute of limitation, (ii) with respect to Buyer Losses arising under
_Sections 7.1(b)_ , _7.1(c)_ , _7.1(d)_ , _7.1(e)_ or  _7.1(f)_ , the Claims
Period shall survive indefinitely, (iii) with respect to Pre-Carve Out Losses
arising under _Section_ __ _ 7.2_, the Claims Period shall survive
indefinitely, (iv) with respect to Pre-Closing Environmental Liabilities
arising under _Section_ __ _ 7.3_, the Claims Period shall survive for
fifteen (15) years following the Closing Date, (v) with respect to Seller
Losses arising under _Section 7.4(a)_ , the Claims Period shall survive for
twelve (12) months following the Closing Date; _provided_ that with respect to
Seller Losses arising under any Buyer Fundamental Representation, the Claims
Period shall survive until thirty (30) days following the expiration of the
applicable statute of limitation, and (vi) with respect to Seller Losses
arising under _Section 7.4(b)_ or _Section 7.4(c)_ , the Claims Period shall
survive indefinitely.

(b) No claim for indemnification can be made after the expiration of the
applicable Claims Period with respect to such claim; _provided_ if prior to
the close of business on the last day of the applicable Claims Period, an
Indemnifying Party shall have been properly notified of a claim for indemnity
hereunder and such claim shall not have been finally resolved or disposed of
at such date, such claim shall continue to survive and shall remain a basis
for indemnity hereunder until such claim is finally resolved or disposed of
in accordance with the terms hereof.

Section 7.7. _Liability Limits_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
set forth in this Agreement, any Indemnifying Partys obligations to indemnify
and hold any Indemnified Party harmless shall be limited as follows:

 

(a) No amounts of indemnity shall be payable pursuant to _Section 7.1(a)_
or _Section 7.4(a)_ , as the case may be, unless and until the applicable
Indemnified Party shall have incurred Buyer Losses, in the case of the Buyer
Indemnified Parties, or Seller Losses, in the case of the Seller Indemnified
Parties, in excess of 1% of the Base Purchase Price (the " _Deductible
Amount_ ") in the aggregate, in which case the applicable Indemnified Party
shall be entitled to recover only such Buyer Losses, in the case of the Buyer
Indemnified Parties, or such Seller Losses, in the case of the Seller
Indemnified Parties, pursuant to _Section 7.1(a)_ or _Section 7.4(a)_ , as the
case may be, in excess of the Deductible Amount; _provided_ that amounts of
indemnity for Buyer Losses pursuant to _Section 7.1(a)_ with respect to any
breach of any Company Fundamental Representation or any Seller Fundamental
Representation or Seller Losses pursuant to _Section 7.4(a)_ with respect to
any breach of any Buyer Fundamental Representation, as the case may be, shall
not be subject to the Deductible Amount; _provided_ _further_ that, in
respect of _Section 7.1(a)_ , no claim for Buyer Losses may be made, and no
Buyer Losses shall be applied against the Deductible Amount for any claim that
does not cause Buyer Losses in an amount in

 



-56-  excess of $50,000 (it being understood that any series of claims arising out
of common facts or circumstances may be aggregated for this provision);
_provided_ _further_ that, in respect of _Section 7.4(a)_ , no claim for
Seller Losses may be made, and no Seller Losses shall be applied against the
Deductible Amount for any claim that does not cause Seller Losses in an amount
in excess of $50,000 (it being understood that any series of claims arising
out of common facts or circumstances may be aggregated for this provision);

(b) In no event shall the aggregate amount of indemnity required to be
paid by (i) Seller or any of its Affiliates pursuant to _Section 7.1(a)_
exceed 5% of the Base Purchase Price (the " _Indemnification Cap_ "), and if
the Indemnification Cap is insufficient to satisfy any amount of such Buyer
Loss pursuant to _Section 7.1(a)_ , then such amount of such Buyer Loss shall
remain unsatisfied and no Buyer Indemnified Party shall be entitled to recover
such shortfall from Seller or any of its Affiliates through an indemnity
claim pursuant to _Section 7.1(a)_ ; _provided_ that amounts of indemnity for
Buyer Losses pursuant to _Section 7.1(a)_ with respect to any breach of any
Company Fundamental Representation or Seller Fundamental Representation shall
not, in each case, be subject to the Indemnification Cap nor included for
purposes of calculating the Indemnification Cap or (ii) Buyer or any of its
Affiliates (including any Company Group Member) pursuant to _Section 7.4(a)_
exceed the Indemnification Cap, and if the Indemnification Cap is insufficient
to satisfy any amount of such Seller Loss pursuant to _Section 7.4(a)_ , then
such amount of such Seller Loss shall remain unsatisfied and no Seller
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to recover such shortfall from Buyer or
any of its Affiliates (including any Company Group Member) through an
indemnity claim pursuant to _Section 7.4(a)_ ; _provided_  that amounts of
indemnity for Seller Losses pursuant to _Section 7.4(a)_ with respect to any
breach of any Buyer Fundamental Representation shall not, in each case, be
subject to the Indemnification Cap nor included for purposes of
calculating the Indemnification Cap;

(c) Except with respect to the indemnity payable pursuant to  _Section_ __
_ 7.2_, in no event shall the aggregate amount of indemnity required to be
paid by Seller, Buyer or any of their respective Affiliates pursuant to this
Agreement exceed the Purchase Price.

 

(d) The amount of each claim for Losses by an Indemnified Party shall be
deemed to be an amount equal to, and any payments by an Indemnifying Party
shall be limited to, the amount of such Losses that remain after deducting
therefrom any third party insurance proceeds actually received; _provided_ ,
that the amount of third party insurance proceeds deemed to be actually
received shall be net of (i) any deductible and any increase in premiums
arising from such Losses and (ii) any other costs, expenses, Taxes or fees
incurred in connection with receipt of such amounts.

 

(e) The amount of indemnity payable pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.1_ with
respect to any Buyer Loss shall be reduced to the extent such Buyer Loss is
reflected on the Final Net Working Capital Schedule;

(f) Any Indemnified Party that becomes aware of a Loss for which it seeks
indemnification under this _Article VII_ shall be required to use commercially
reasonable efforts to mitigate such Loss in accordance with applicable Law,
and an Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any Loss to the extent that
it is attributable to the Indemnified Partys failure to so mitigate;
_provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing, no Indemnified
Party shall be 

 



-57-  required to (i) take any action that could reasonably be expected to be
detrimental to its reputation or its business or (ii) commence or initiate
Litigation or otherwise make any claim against any customer of such
Indemnified Party or one of its Affiliates. The reasonable costs and expenses
of such mitigation efforts shall be included in the Losses for which an
indemnified person is entitled to indemnification hereunder;

 

(g) No Party shall have any liability for any Buyer Loss or Seller Loss, as
the case may be, that would not have arisen but for any change in the
accounting policies, practices or procedures adopted by Seller, Buyer and/or
any of their respective Affiliates after the Closing;

 

(h) In any case where a Buyer Indemnified Party or a Seller Indemnified
Party, as the case may be, recovers from any third party any amount in
respect of a matter with respect to which such Buyer Indemnified Party or
Seller Indemnified Party has already been indemnified pursuant to this
Agreement, such Buyer Indemnified Party or Seller Indemnified Party, as
the case may be, shall promptly pay over to the Indemnifying Party an amount
equal to the lesser of the amount recovered from such third party, and the
amount so paid by such Indemnifying Party in respect of such matter; and

 

(i) For purposes of determining whether there has been a breach of any
representation or warranty contained in this Agreement and the amount of any
Loss arising from such a breach, in each case, for purposes of determining
indemnification pursuant to this _Article_ __ _ VII_, the determination shall
be made disregarding any materiality, Material Adverse Effect or similar
qualifications that may be contained therein.

Section 7.8. _Indemnification Procedures for Pre-Closing Environmental
Liabilities_.

(a) With respect to Pre-Closing Environmental Liabilities for which MWP or
Seller has acknowledged an obligation to indemnify Buyer or its Affiliates
under _Section_ __ _ 7.3_ hereof and that are subject to the requirements of
Section 12.04 of the 1999 Agreement, Seller shall have the option to control
the resolution of any Remedial Action, including the performance of any tests,
reports, investigations or any other activities related to such Remedial
Action and contacting Governmental Entities, making any reports to such
entities, submitting any Remedial Action plans to such entities and
negotiating with such entities; provided that Seller complies with the
applicable provisions of this  _Section_ __ _ 7.8_. With respect to all
other Pre-Closing Environmental Liabilities, the Buyer Indemnified Parties
shall have the option to control the resolution of any Remedial Action,
including the performance of any tests, reports, investigations or any other
activities related to such Remedial Action and contacting Governmental
Entities, making any reports to such entities, submitting any Remedial Action
plans to such entities and negotiating with such entities;  _provided_ that
the Buyer Indemnified Parties comply with the applicable provisions of this
_Section_ __ _ 7.8_. Neither party shall settle or compromise a Third Party
Claim related to Pre-Closing Environmental Liabilities without the prior
written consent of the other party, such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 

(b) Where MWP or Seller controls the resolution of any Remedial Action, MWP
and Seller each agrees (i) to provide the Buyer Indemnified Party, in
advance, with a reasonably detailed description of any such proposed Remedial
Action and a reasonable period

 



-58-  of time, given the specific circumstances, to permit the Buyer Indemnified
Party to comment on such proposed activity and Seller agrees to consider in
good faith any such comments, (ii) to perform any such Remedial Action in a
reasonably prudent manner to avoid any harm to the environment or to human
health and safety, to comply with all laws, including Environmental Laws, to
obtain and maintain all necessary permits, financial assurances and insurance
and to obtain its own EPA Identification Number (if practicable), arrange for
disposal, and be identified on manifests as the "generator" (if practicable),
of all Hazardous Substances generated from or otherwise arising out of any
such Remedial Action, (iii) to perform all actions reasonably necessary to
remove or remediate the Hazardous Substances, contamination or environmental
degradation arising out of or relating to the indemnification claim and to
bring the facility or property into compliance with all Environmental Laws
with respect to such Hazardous Substances, contamination or degradation, and
agree to obtain written approval from the Governmental Entity with
jurisdiction confirming that no further actions are required with respect to
such Hazardous Substances, contamination or environmental degradation and (iv)
not to perform any Remedial Action in a manner which is reasonably likely to
reduce the value of or materially alter the use of the subject real property.
Buyer and Seller agree that the use of the Owned Real Property as of the
Closing Date shall be the appropriate property classification to be used in
determining which actions are reasonably necessary pursuant to clause (iii)
above with respect to such Owned Real Property, and that the appropriate
property use classification for the Leased Real Property shall depend on the
requirements of the relevant lease and landlord.

 

(c) Buyer agrees that, without Sellers prior consent (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), it shall not, and it
shall not permit any of its directors, officers, employees and agents to,
voluntarily perform any environmental testing of the soil or groundwater at
any Owned Real Property or Leased Real Property that may reasonably be
expected to lead to the identification of any contamination thereof, unless
and to the extent (i) required by any law (including any Environmental Law),
any applicable Governmental Entity or in connection with any Third
Party Claim (ii) the performance of such testing would reasonably be expected
to decrease the risk or scope of injury to human health or the environment in
the event of an emergency or (iii) subject to providing Seller with ten (10)
calendar days advance written notice and a reasonably detailed description of
the planned environmental testing, as reasonably required as determined by
Buyer in good faith to permit or facilitate a financing of $20,000,000 or
more, sale, closure, expansion, modification, redevelopment, lease, sublease,
lease or sublease termination or assignment or other disposal of a facility or
Owned Real Property or Leased Real Property or a business including any
facility or Owned Real Property or Leased Real Property. Buyer shall agree
(which agreement shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) to impose
reasonable institutional controls and/or restrictions in a deed limiting
activities to industrial uses only on any Owned Real Property subject to
clean-up requirements, provided such controls and restrictions do not
materially and negatively impact the value or use of the subject real estate
or any planned expansion, modification or redevelopment thereof.

(d) Seller agrees to maintain in strict confidence all information
concerning any environmental matters of any Company Group Member or related
to the Business. If any Environmental Law requires Seller to disclose any such
information, Seller agrees to promptly notify Buyer of such requirement, and
to give Buyer the opportunity to review and comment in advance upon the
content and timing of any disclosures that Seller proposes to make.

 



-59- (e) Buyer and MWP/Seller agree that each shall, in connection with
any activities they each undertake in connection with this _Section_ __ _
7.8_, (i) provide or be provided with reasonable access to employees with
relevant facts about such activities, (ii) provide copies of any
material documents to the other party and a reasonable opportunity to comment
on such documents, (iii) keep the other party reasonably informed relating to
the progress of such activities, (iv) where applicable, select counsel,
contractors, and consultants of recognized standing and competence after
consultation with the other party, (v) take all steps necessary in the defense
of any claims which are the subject of such activities, (vi) at all times
diligently and promptly pursue the resolution of any claims which are the
subject of such activities, (vii) allow the other party to participate in any
communications or proceedings involving a Governmental Entity or any other
person and consult with the other party hereto as to the manner of managing
or resolving such communication or proceedings, in each case, except to the
extent necessary to protect attorney-client privilege or attorney work product
and (viii) use reasonable efforts to avoid unreasonable interference with the
other partys normal business operations.

(f) If a Buyer Indemnified Party claims a right to payment pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 7.3_ of this Agreement not involving a Third Party Claim, then
such Buyer Indemnified Party shall send written notice of such claim to
Seller. Such notice shall specify in reasonable detail the basis for such
claim. As promptly as possible after the Buyer Indemnified Party has given
such notice, such Buyer Indemnified Party and Seller shall establish the
merits and amount of such claim (by mutual agreement, arbitration, litigation
or otherwise) and, within five (5) Business Days of the final determination of
the merits and amount of such claim, MWP and/or Seller shall pay to Buyer an
amount equal to such claim as determined hereunder.

 

(g) With respect to MWPs/Sellers indemnification obligations under this
_Article VII_ with respect to any Remedial Action controlled by Buyer: (i)
Buyer shall keep Seller reasonably informed, on a timely basis, of all non-
privileged substantive contacts between any Governmental Entity or third party
and Buyer with respect to such Remedial Action; (ii) Buyer shall give Seller
the opportunity to participate in all discussions and proceedings with
Governmental Entities concerning the need for, timing, method, extent and cost
of such Remedial Action; (iii) Buyer shall give Seller the option to
challenge, at its sole expense (including initiating legal proceedings), such
Remedial Action that Seller considers to be unlawful, provided such challenge
would not reasonably be expected to result in any material negative impact on
Buyer, any Company Group Member or the Business (including its reputation) or
any unindemnified liability of Buyer or any Company Group Member and provided
Seller keeps Buyer and each Company Group Member reasonably informed, on a
timely basis, of all material developments in such challenge; and (iv) Buyer
shall exercise all commercially reasonable efforts to keep the number and cost
of any Remedial Action as low as reasonably possible.

 

(h) Seller and MWP shall have no liability pursuant to this Agreement for
any Losses incurred by any Buyer Indemnified Parties for Pre-Closing
Environmental Liabilities to the extent such Losses arise from a change in use
of an Owned Real Property or a Leased Real Property after the Closing Date to
a use that is neither commercial nor industrial and would not have arisen if
such use had not been changed.

 



-60- Section 7.9. _Liability Limits and Determination of Losses_. Except as
otherwise set forth herein, the liability of Seller for Buyer Losses and Buyer
for Seller Losses shall be considered in the aggregate and shall be determined
on a cumulative basis for purposes of determining limitations on
liability, including the maximum liability amounts described in this _ARTICLE
VII_.

Section 7.10. _Exclusive Remedies_. From and after the Closing, except
for any payment, reimbursement or refund obligations expressly set forth in

, _Section_ __ _ 5.8_, this _ARTICLE VII_ and  _Section_ __ _ 8.10_ set
forth the exclusive rights and remedies of the Parties to seek or obtain
damages or any other remedy or relief whatsoever from any party with respect
to matters arising under or in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby. Without in any way limiting the provisions
of _Section_ __ _ 7.7_, the Parties agree that, excluding any claim for
injunctive or other equitable relief, the indemnification provisions of this
_ARTICLE VII_ are intended to provide the sole and exclusive remedy as to all
claims against Seller, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand, arising
from or relating to this Agreement and the agreements and
documents contemplated hereby and the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this _Section_ __ _ 7.10_ shall not
operate to (a) interfere with or impede the operation of the provisions of
_ARTICLE I_ providing for the resolution of certain disputes relating to the
Purchase Price between the Parties and/or by the Accounting Firm, (b) limit
the rights of the Parties to seek equitable remedies (including specific
performance or injunctive relief) or (c) limit the rights of the Indemnified
DandO Parties pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 5.6_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, including this ___ARTICLE VII_ _,_  any claim for
fraud may be brought within the applicable statute of limitations and nothing
herein shall limit or reduce the amounts recoverable for any such claim.

 

Section 7.11. _Adjustment to the Purchase Price_. The Parties agree that
any payment made by an Indemnifying Party to an Indemnified Party under this
_ARTICLE VII_ shall constitute a dollar-for-dollar increase or decrease, as
applicable, in the Purchase Price, to the extent permitted by applicable Law.

Section 8.3. _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this
Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of
Law or public policy, all other terms, conditions and provisions of this
Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the

(a) Each Party hereby irrevocably agrees that any Legal Dispute shall be
brought only to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the State of
Delaware or the federal courts located in the State of Delaware, and each
Party hereby consents to the jurisdiction of such courts (and of the
appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any such suit, action or

 



-63-  proceeding and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law,
any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of
any such suit, action or proceeding in any such court or that any such suit,
action or proceeding that is brought in any such court has been brought in an
inconvenient forum. During the period a Legal Dispute that is filed in
accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 8.7_ is pending before a court, all

represent it in such matter even though the interests of Seller may be
directly adverse to Buyer and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates, and their

rely upon such privileged communications that may remain in the records of
the Company Group, and the Parties agree that no attorney-client privilege,
attorney work product or other privilege or protection is waived or intended
to be waived by allowing such material to remain in the files of the
Company Group.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section_ __ _ 8.15_,
in the event a Litigation or other dispute arises between Buyer, Canadian
Buyer, any Company Group Member or any of their respective Affiliates, on the
one hand, and any Person other than Seller or any of its Affiliates, on the
other hand, Buyer, Canadian Buyer and each Company Group Member may, and, if
requested in writing by Buyer, Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates
to, assert the privileges described in _Section 8.15(b)_ to prevent the
disclosure of privileged materials to such third party.

Section 8.16. _No Recourse_. All claims, obligations, liabilities, or
causes of action (whether in contract or in tort, in law or in equity, or

by reason of, be connected with, or relate in any manner to this Agreement, or

representation or warranty made in, in connection with, or as an inducement
to, this Agreement), may be made only against (and such representations and
warranties are those solely of) the Parties. No Person who is not a Party,
including any current, former or future director, officer, employee,
incorporator, member, partner, manager, shareholder, Affiliate, agent,
attorney, Representative or assignee of, and any financial advisor or lender
to, any Party, or any current, former or future director, officer, employee,
incorporator, member, partner, manager, shareholder, Affiliate, agent,
attorney, Representative or assignee of, and any financial advisor or lender
to, any of the foregoing (collectively, the " _Nonparty Affiliates_ "), shall
have any liability (whether in contract or in tort, in law or in equity, or
granted by statute) for any claims, causes of action, obligations, or
liabilities arising under, out of, in connection with, or related in any
manner to this Agreement or based on, in respect of, or by reason of this
Agreement or its negotiation, execution, performance or breach, and, to the
maximum extent permitted by Laws, each Party hereby waives and releases
all such liabilities, claims, causes of action, and obligations against any
such Nonparty Affiliates. Without limiting the foregoing, to the maximum
extent permitted by Laws, each Party hereby: (a) waives and releases any and
all rights, claims, demands, or causes of action that may otherwise be
available at law or in equity, or granted by statute, to avoid or disregard
the entity form of a Party or otherwise impose liability of a Party on any
Nonparty Affiliate, whether granted by statute or based on theories of
equity, agency, control, instrumentality, alter ego, domination, sham, single
business enterprise,

 



-66-  piercing the veil, unfairness, undercapitalization or otherwise; and (b)
disclaims any reliance upon any Nonparty Affiliates with respect to the
performance of this Agreement or any representation or warranty made in, in
connection with, or as an inducement to this Agreement.
