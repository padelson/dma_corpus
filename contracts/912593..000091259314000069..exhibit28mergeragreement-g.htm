2. MERGER CONSIDERATION AND EFFECT OF THE MERGER.

2.1 Merger Consideration.

The Parties agree that the aggregate consideration to be paid by SUI and
Merger Sub pursuant to this Agreement shall be the sum of Five Hundred Ninety
Six Million Eight Hundred Seventy Thousand Three Hundred Eight Dollars
($596,870,308.00), adjusted for pro-rated items and other adjustments as
provided in this Agreement (the "Merger Consideration"). The Merger
Consideration shall be allocated among the Projects in accordance with the
Omnibus Agreement. The Merger Consideration shall be paid as follows:

(a) The Projects are currently encumbered by certain mortgage debts, as
identified on Exhibit F attached hereto (the "Existing Debt"). By acquiring
the Company and indirectly owning the Property Owners, SUI shall effectively
assume (the "Loan Assumption") the aggregate outstanding principal balances of
the Existing Debt (which as of June 30, 2014 are in the approximate amounts
shown on Exhibit F), to the extent that the Existing Debt is not paid off at
or prior to Closing (the "Assumed Debt"). The outstanding principal balance
and accrued and unpaid interest under the Assumed Debt as of the Closing, net
of any escrows or reserves held by any Lender of the Assumed Debt as of the
Closing, shall be credited against the Merger Consideration, provided that any
Assumption Costs (as defined in Section 2.8) associated with the Loan
Assumption shall be the responsibility of the Green Entities in accordance
with Section 19.1 below;

(b) Pursuant to the Omnibus Agreement, the Company may elect that a portion of
the Merger Consideration will be paid in a combination of (i) Common OP Units
in SCOLP (the "Common OP Units"), (ii) shares of common stock (the "Common
Stock") in SUI, (iii) Series A-4 Preferred Units in SCOLP (the "Preferred OP
Units"), and/or (iv) Series A-4 Preferred Stock in SUI (the "Preferred
Stock"), as selected by the Company, subject to the aggregate limitations set
forth in the Omnibus Agreement and the transactions consummated under the
other Transaction Agreements prior to the Effective Time. SUI is a REIT and is
the general partner of SCOLP. To the extent that the Company elects Common OP
Units or Preferred OP Units, SUI shall cause SCOLP to issue such equity in
accordance with this Agreement. The Common Stock and the Common OP Units are
sometimes referred to herein collectively as the "Common Equity." The
Preferred OP Units and the Preferred Stock are sometimes referred to herein
collectively as the



"Preferred Equity." The issuance price of the Common Equity shall be $50.00
per share/unit and the issuance price of the Preferred Equity shall be its
Issue Price (as defined in the Organizational Documents establishing such
Preferred Equity). In electing a portion of the Merger Consideration in Common
Equity or Preferred Equity, the Company shall elect such portion that is
capable of being divided equally on a per share basis by the number of the
Company's Class A Common Shares issued and outstanding as of immediately prior
to the Effective Time to avoid the issuance of any fractional shares.

(c) An amount of cash equal to $1,000.00 for each Class B Preferred Share plus
an amount equal to any accrued and unpaid dividends on such shares up to the
Effective Time shall be payable to the holders of Class B Preferred Shares.
The balance of the Merger Consideration (i.e, the Merger Consideration, net of
credits and prorations provided in this Agreement, less the amount of the
Assumed Debt and the aggregate issuance price of Common Equity and Preferred
Equity selected by the Company, less the amount of cash payable to holders of
the Class B Preferred Shares pursuant to this Agreement) shall be paid in cash
(the "Cash Payment").

(d) For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Class A Common Per Share Merger
Consideration" means the number of Common OP Units, shares of Common Stock of
SUI, Preferred OP Units and shares of Preferred Stock of SUI as designated by
the Company pursuant to Section 2.1(b) above and the Cash Payment specified in
Section 2.1(c) above, in each case calculated separately and divided by the
number of the Company's Class A Common Shares issued and outstanding as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time.



2.2 The Merger.

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, as soon as
practicable after the Closing, the Company and Merger Sub shall cause to be
filed with the Department articles of merger (the "Articles of Merger") in
connection with the Merger in such form as is required by, and executed in
accordance with, the Maryland Law. To the extent determined by SUI to be
necessary, the Articles of Merger shall address the matters described in
Section 2.5.

(b) The Merger shall become effective on such date and at such time (the
"Effective Time") as the Articles of Merger have been accepted by the
Department for record (or at such later time as may be agreed by the parties
that is specified in the Articles of Merger in accordance with the Maryland
Law).

(c) At the Effective Time, the Company shall be merged with and into Merger
Sub in accordance with the Maryland Law, whereupon the separate existence of
the Company shall cease, and the Merger Sub shall be the surviving corporation
(the "Surviving Corporation"). From and after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall possess all the assets, rights, powers, privileges
and franchises and be subject to all of the debts and obligations of the
Company and Merger Sub, all as provided under Maryland Law.

2.3. Conversion of Company Shares.



At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of the holders thereof:

(a) except as otherwise provided in Section 2.3(b), (i) each of the Company's
Class A Common Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be converted into the right to receive the Class A Common Per Share
Merger Consideration, and (ii) each of the Company's Class B Preferred Shares
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
the right to receive $1,000.00 per share plus an amount equal to any accrued
and unpaid dividends on such shares to the Effective Time, in each case
without interest and subject to any required Tax withholding made pursuant to
Section 2.4 (as to each, the "Applicable Per Share Merger Consideration" and
in the aggregate, the "Aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration");

(b) each Company Share held by the Company as treasury stock immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be canceled, and no payment shall be made with
respect thereto; and

(c) each share of the capital stock of Merger Sub issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain as the only issued and
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation

2.4. Surrender and Payment.

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, SUI shall appoint an exchange agent (the
"Exchange Agent") for the purpose of exchanging the Aggregate Per Share Merger
Consideration for (i) certificates representing Company Shares (the
"Certificates") and (ii) uncertificated Company Shares (the "Uncertificated
Shares"). As of the Effective Time, SUI shall deposit, or cause to be
deposited, with the Exchange Agent the Aggregate Per Share Merger
Consideration to be paid in respect of the Certificates and Uncertificated
Shares (the "Exchange Fund"). Promptly after the Effective Time, SUI shall
send, or shall cause the Exchange Agent to send, to each record holder of
Company Shares at the Effective Time a letter of transmittal and instructions
(which shall specify that the delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates or transfer of
the Uncertificated Shares to the Exchange Agent) for use in such exchange.

(b) Each holder of Company Shares that have been converted into the right to
receive the Aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration shall be entitled to
receive the Applicable Per Share Merger Consideration in respect of the
Company Shares represented by a Certificate or Uncertificated Share, upon (i)
surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together with a duly
completed and validly executed letter of transmittal and such other documents
as may reasonably be requested by the Exchange Agent, or (ii) receipt of an
"agent's message" by the Exchange Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of
transfer as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a book-
entry transfer of Uncertificated Shares. Until so surrendered or transferred,
as the case may be, each such Certificate or Uncertificated Share shall
represent after the



Effective Time for all purposes only the right to receive such Applicable Per
Share Merger Consideration. No interest shall be paid or accrued on the cash
payable upon the surrender or transfer of such Certificate or Uncertificated
Share.

(c) If any portion of the Aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration is to be
paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered
Certificate or the transferred Uncertificated Share is registered, it shall be
a condition to such payment that (i) either such Certificate shall be properly
endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer or such
Uncertificated Share shall be properly transferred and (ii) the Person
requesting such payment shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other
Tax required as a result of such payment to a Person other than the registered
holder of such Certificate or Uncertificated Share or establish to the
satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not
payable.

(d) All Aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender of
Certificates or transfer of Uncertificated Shares in accordance with the terms
hereof shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to the Company Shares formerly represented by such Certificate or
Uncertificated Shares and from and after the Effective Time, there shall be no
further registration of transfers of Company Shares on the stock transfer
books of the Surviving Corporation. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates
or Uncertificated Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation, they
shall be canceled and exchanged for the Applicable Per Share Merger
Consideration provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set forth,
in this Section 2.

(e) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the holders of
Company Shares one year after the Effective Time shall be returned to SUI,
upon demand, and any such holder who has not exchanged Company Shares for the
Applicable Per Share Merger Consideration in accordance with this Section 2
prior to that time shall thereafter look only to SUI for payment of the
Applicable Per Share Merger Consideration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, SUI
shall not be liable to any holder of Company Shares for any amounts paid to a
public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
laws. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of Company Shares two (2)
years after the Effective Time (or such earlier date, immediately prior to
such time when the amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of
any Governmental Authority) shall become, to the extent permitted by
Applicable Law, the property of SUI free and clear of any claims or interest
of any Person previously entitled thereto.

(f) If, during the period between the date of this Agreement and the Effective
Time, any change in the outstanding shares of beneficial interests of the
Company shall occur, including by reason of any reclassification,
recapitalization, stock split (including reverse stock split) or combination,
exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend, or any record date
for any such purpose shall be established, the Applicable Per Share Merger
Consideration and any other amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement shall
be appropriately adjusted if required to account for such change; provided
that the Aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration shall remain the same. If,
during the period



between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the
outstanding shares of stock of SUI or partnership interests of SCOLP shall
occur as a result of the reclassification, recapitalization, stock split
(including reverse stock split) or combination, exchange or readjustment of
shares, or any stock dividend, or any record date for any such purpose shall
be established, the Merger Consideration, the Class A Common Per Share Merger
Consideration and any other amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement shall
be appropriately adjusted if required; provided that the Aggregate Per Share
Merger Consideration shall remain the same.

(g) Each of the Surviving Corporation and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled
to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any Person
pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it is required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment under any provision of any
applicable Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld by
the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, and are
paid to the relevant Governmental Entity, such amounts shall be treated for
all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect
of which the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be,
made such deduction and withholding.

(h) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to
be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by SUI, the posting by such
Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as SUI may direct, as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate, the Applicable Per Share Merger Consideration to be
paid in respect of the Company Shares formerly represented by such
Certificate, as contemplated under this Section 2.

2.5 Effects of the Merger.

(a) At the Effective Time, the charter of Merger Sub shall be the charter of
the Surviving Corporation until further amended in accordance with the
provisions thereof and applicable Law and the bylaws of Merger Sub shall be
the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until further amended in accordance
with the provisions thereof and applicable Law.

(b) From and after the Effective Time, until successors are duly elected or
appointed and qualified in accordance with applicable Law, (i) the directors
of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors
of the Surviving Corporation and (ii) the officers of Merger Sub immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving
Corporation.

2.6 Dissenters' Rights.

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any Company
Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time eligible under the
Maryland



Law to exercise appraisal or dissenters' rights and held by a holder, if any,
who has not voted in favor of the Merger or consented thereto in writing and
who has exercised and perfected appraisal or dissenters' rights for such
shares in accordance with Title 3, Subtitle 2 of the Maryland Law and has not
effectively withdrawn or lost such appraisal or dissenters' rights
(collectively, the "Dissenting Shares") will not be converted into or
represent the right to receive a portion of the Aggregate Per Share Merger
Consideration, and the holder or holders of such shares will be entitled only
to such rights as may be granted to such holder or holders in Title 3,
Subtitle 2 of the Maryland Law.

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 2.6(a), if any holder of
Dissenting Shares effectively withdraws or loses (through failure to perfect
or otherwise) such holder's appraisal rights and dissenters' rights under
Title 3, Subtitle 2 of the Maryland Law, then, as of the later of the
Effective Time and the occurrence of such event, such holder's Company Shares
will automatically be converted into and represent the right to receive a
portion of the Aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration, payable in cash to
the holder thereof without interest, following surrender of the certificate
representing such shares.

(c) The Company agrees to comply with the requirements of Sections 3-201
through 3-213 of the Maryland Law.

(d) The Company shall give SUI (i) prompt notice of any written objection to

Maryland Law and received by the Company and (ii) the opportunity to direct
all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under
the Maryland Law. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent
of SUI, make any payment with respect to any such demands for appraisal or
offer to settle or settle any such demands.

2.7 Tax Consequences.

It is intended that, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Merger shall
qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a)(1)(A) and
(2)(D) of the Code, and that this Agreement be, and is hereby adopted as, a
plan of reorganization for purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of the Code.

2.8 SUI and the Company shall coordinate their contact and discussions with
any lenders regarding any of the Assumed Debt or the associated Projects, but
SUI shall not initiate any such contact or discussions without the Company's
prior approval. Promptly after the execution of this Agreement, the Company,
the Holding Companies, the Property Owners and SUI shall jointly notify each
holder of the Assumed Debt (each a "Lender") for whom either (i) written

of the Loan Assumption is required (as determined by the parties) of the
pending Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and

following its receipt of the Loan Assumption application, SUI shall promptly
submit written application for the Loan Assumption to the Lenders, together
with all information required by the Lenders to obtain their consent. SUI
agrees to prosecute the Loan Assumption with due diligence in order to obtain
the Lenders' approval of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by

respects with SUI and Lender in obtaining the Loan Assumption Approval. The

in accordance with the applicable Mortgage Documents (the "Assumption Costs"),
including, without limitation, any non-refundable application fee, attorney
fees, transfer and assumption fees, administration fees, and charges and
premiums for all endorsements to the Lenders' policies of title insurance, but
not any such fees or other charges related to modifications requested by SUI
(which shall be at SUI's sole cost and expense), provided that the Company
shall not be required to pay transfer and assumption fees for any Assumed Loan
in excess of one percent (1%) of the outstanding principal balance of such
Assumed Loan. SUI, on behalf of itself and SCOLP, and the Company agree to
promptly execute such documents and to provide such information as may be
reasonably required by Lenders to complete the Loan Assumption application and
to confirm the Loan Assumption. Further, the Lenders' Loan Assumption Approval
must provide for (a) the release of the principals and affiliates of the
Company, if applicable, from all personal liability for the "recourse carve
outs" (including, without limitation, environmental indemnities) under the
Mortgage Documents with respect to all events, occurrences and activities
arising from and after the Closing Date (or if any Lender will not accept a
release of such principals and affiliates, if applicable, SUI shall cause
SCOLP to indemnify such principals and affiliates with respect to any
liability for "recourse carve outs" (including, without limitation,
environmental indemnities) under the Mortgage Documents with respect to any
events, occurrences and activities arising from and after the Closing Date),
and for SUI to cause SCOLP to assume such personal liability under the
recourse carve outs with respect to all events, occurrences and activities
arising from and after the Closing Date in substantially the same form as
signed by the Company when it closed the Assumed Debt or with such changes
thereto to comply with Lenders' current underwriting policies as may be
reasonably acceptable to SUI, provided, however, if any Lender requires SUI or
SCOLP to assume such personal liability under the recourse carve outs with
respect to any event, occurrence or activity arising prior to the Closing
Date, SUI may elect for such Existing Debt to not be an Assumed Debt but,
instead, such Existing Debt shall be prepaid at Closing in accordance with the
Omnibus Agreement, with a corresponding increase in the Cash Payment portion
of the Merger Consideration, and (b) such modifications to the Loan Documents
as are reasonably necessary to reflect and account for the fact that SUI is a
publicly traded real estate investment trust and SUI, either directly or
through its subsidiaries, owns, operates and manages multiple manufactured
home communities under the Sun Communities name, if and to the extent that,
but for such modifications, SUI or SCOLP may not be in compliance with any
covenants, representations, warranties set forth in the applicable Mortgage
Documents, whether at the time of Closing or thereafter. If the Loan
Assumption Approval is not obtained by the date which is ten (10) business
days prior to the Closing Date (the "Loan Assumption Approval Period") (or if
SUI otherwise elects to prepay any Existing Debt at Closing), then such
Existing Debt shall not be



Assumed Debt but, instead, such Existing Debt shall be prepaid at Closing in
accordance with the Omnibus Agreement, with a corresponding increase in the
Cash Payment portion of the Merger Consideration. Except as expressly provided
to the contrary in the Omnibus Agreement, the Loan Assumption Approval shall
not be a condition precedent to the obligations of the parties under this
Agreement. SUI may elect to prepay all or any portion of the Existing Debt by
the delivery of written notice thereof to the Company pursuant to the Omnibus
Agreement. If the required Loan Assumption Approval is not obtained for any
Existing Debt or if SUI elects to prepay any Existing Debt, all associated
Prepayment Costs shall be paid by the Parties as provided in the Omnibus
Agreement.

2.9 The Common OP Units and Preferred OP Units to be issued pursuant to the
terms hereof shall be governed by that certain Third Amended and Restated
Limited Partnership Agreement of SCOLP, dated as of June 19, 2014, as amended
or restated from time to time (the "Partnership Agreement"), including the
Preferred Amendment ,a copy of which is attached as Exhibit L to the Omnibus
Agreement. On the Closing Date, any Shareholders receiving Common Equity or
Preferred Equity shall execute and deliver such customary investment and
subscription documents as SCOLP or SUI shall reasonably require in connection
with the issuance of the Common Equity and/or the Preferred Equity.



3. CONDITION OF TITLE TO THE PROJECTS.



3.1 The Company hereby represents and warrants to SUI that the relevant
Property Owner is, and as of the Closing Date, the relevant Property Owner
shall be, the lawful owner of its Project and it holds, and as of the Closing
Date, the relevant Property Owner shall hold, fee simple title to such
Project. Subject to the terms and condition of the Omnibus Agreement
concerning Material Title/Survey Defects, and further subject to the condition
that SUI receives the Required Title Policies described below at Closing, SUI
acknowledges that the Property Owners hold title to their respective Projects
subject to the following matters (hereinafter referred to as the "Permitted
Exceptions"):



(a) Those liens, encumbrances, easements and other matters set forth as
exceptions to title in the Commitment applicable to its Project to be
delivered pursuant to Section 4.1 hereof and such state of facts (including,
without limitation, non-material discrepancies in legal descriptions, and
shortages of area) as would be disclosed in an accurate survey of such
Project;



(b) The rights of parties in occupancy of all or any portion of the Land and
Improvements that are part of such Project under leases, subleases, occupancy
agreements and commitments to lease (the "Tenant Leases"), to the extent set
forth and described in the Rent Rolls (as defined below), as the same shall be
updated to date that is five days prior to the Closing Date, including,
without limitation, the rights of parties in occupancy of all or any portion
of the Land and Improvements that are part of such Project under those certain
leases providing for a specified fixed base rental amount for the life of the
tenant(s), to the extent set forth and described in the Rent Rolls as
"Lifetime/fixed" in the column entitled "Lease type";







(c) All presently existing and future liens for unpaid real estate taxes,
subject to adjustment thereof as hereinafter provided, which are not
delinquent;



(d) Any exceptions to title caused by SUI, its agents, representatives or
employees;



(e) Any easements, licenses and similar agreements entered into in accordance
with this Agreement; and



(f) The Mortgage Documents securing any Assumed Debt which SUI does not elect
to pay off at Closing.



From the date hereof through the Closing Date, neither the Company, the
Holding Companies, nor the Property Owners will cause title to any Project to
be further encumbered by any lien, easement, restriction or any other matter,
which cannot be terminated on thirty (30) days prior written notice without
payment of a termination fee, other than (i) easements and other encumbrances
granted in the ordinary course of the operation of the Projects, subject to
the prior written approval of SUI, which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned and which will be governed by the Deemed Approval
process under the Omnibus Agreement, (ii) liens and encumbrances securing new
mortgage debt which is obtained to refinance Existing Debt, subject to the
prior written approval of SUI, in SUI's discretion, and (iii) liens and rights
to liens arising out of work performed at the Projects, subject to proration
and adjustment in accordance with this Agreement; and in the event any such
encumbrance prohibited by this Section 3 is created after the date hereof, the
Company shall provide prompt notice thereof to SUI and which, at SUI's
election, shall be discharged by the Company at Closing.



4. EVIDENCE OF TITLE; SURVEYS; UCC SEARCHES.



4.1 The Company has ordered and, to the extent not made available to SUI
already, upon receipt will deliver to SUI commitments (collectively, the
"Commitments" and, individually, a "Commitment") for ALTA Form Owner\'s
Policies of Title Insurance for each of the Projects, from the Title Company,
along with copies of all instruments described in Schedule B of each
Commitment (collectively, the "Exception Documents"), in the amount of the
Merger Consideration allocated to each Project. It shall be a condition to
Closing that the Title Company is prepared and committed (subject only to the
consummation of the Closing and the payment of the applicable premiums) to
issue for each Project the Title Company's ALTA Form (or other form applicable
to the state in which the applicable Project is located) Owner's Policy of
Title Insurance (or an endorsement to the applicable Property Owner's existing
owner's title insurance policies, as elected by SUI in its sole discretion),
dated as of the Closing Date and providing coverage in the amount of the
Merger Consideration allocated to such Project on, which insures the
applicable Property Owner as the owner of fee simple title to such Project,
subject only to the Permitted Exceptions approved by SUI pursuant to Omnibus
Agreement, and such exceptions and other matters that do not render title to
the Project unmarketable (the "Required Title Policies"). The parties will
cooperate reasonably and in good faith to satisfy the requirements and
conditions of the Title Company for the issuance of the Required Title
Policies, including (without limitation), the execution and delivery at



Closing of customary affidavits and undertakings as may be required by the
Title Company. The cost of the Required Title Policies shall be allocated
between the Company and SUI in accordance with the customary allocation of
premiums for owners' title insurance policies in commercial real estate
purchase and sale transactions in the state where each Project is located,
with the Company bearing the premiums customarily borne by sellers and SUI
bearing the premiums customarily borne by purchasers. SUI shall be responsible
for the costs of any endorsements to the Required Title Policies that are
requested by SUI.



4.2 Prior to the date hereof, the Company has ordered current ALTA "as built"
surveys for certain of the Projects, and as soon as reasonably possible after
the date hereof, SUI shall obtain (and upon receipt provide to Contributors)
current ALTA "as built" surveys of the remainder of the Projects prepared by a
licensed surveyor or engineer approved by SUI, certified to SUI, the Company,
the Property Owner, the Title Company, and any other parties designated by SUI
(collectively the "Surveys"). The cost of the Surveys shall be borne by SUI,
and SUI shall reimburse the Company for the Surveys it paid for at Closing.



4.3 SUI may obtain Uniform Commercial Code financing statement searches and
tax lien searches both from the State of Delaware, Illinois, and the county
where each Project is located with respect to the Company and each Holding
Company and Property Owner, which must show no security interests, pledges,
liens, claims or encumbrances in or affecting the interest of the Property
Owner in the Projects, including the Personal Property, or the interest of
Shareholders in the Company Shares, except for encumbrances granted under the
Assumed Debt or otherwise constituting Permitted Exceptions and except for
security interests of a definite or ascertainable amount which may be removed
by the payment of money at Closing and which the Company shall remove at
Closing. SUI shall provide the searches to the Company not later than sixty
(60) days prior to the Closing Date, in order to allow time for the
investigation and resolution of any claimed adverse interests. The cost of the
UCC searches shall be borne by SUI.





5. TITLE OBJECTIONS.



5.1 If a Commitment or Survey discloses exceptions which are not acceptable to
SUI, and if any such exception constitutes a Material Title/Survey Defect,
then the terms and condition of Section 5.3 of the Omnibus Agreement shall
apply.



6. ADJUSTMENTS AND PRORATIONS.



6.1 The following adjustments and prorations shall be made at the Closing
between SUI and the Company, and shall be computed to, but not including, the
Closing Date.



(a) Real estate taxes and personal property taxes which are a lien upon or
levied against any portion of each Project on or prior to the Closing Date,
and all special assessments levied prior to the Closing Date (to the extent of
installments thereof due on or prior to the Closing Date) shall be paid by the
Company on or prior to the Closing Date.



Further, all taxes in the nature of rollback or similar taxes charged,
assessed or levied based on the prior use or any change in use of the Land or
Improvements prior to Closing shall be the obligation of the Company. All real
estate taxes and personal property taxes (the "Current Taxes") levied against
any portion of each Project with respect to the applicable tax year in which
the Closing occurs shall be prorated and adjusted between the parties such
that the Company is responsible for that portion of the Current Taxes
allocable to the period from the beginning of such tax year to the Closing
Date, and SUI is responsible for that portion of the Current Taxes allocable
to the period commencing on the Closing Date through the end of the tax year.
In addition, if the Company or any Property Owner has paid any taxes or
assessments for or in respect of tax years commencing after the Closing Date,
then SUI shall be responsible for same and the amount thereof shall be
credited to the Company at Closing. If the tax bills for the Current Taxes
have not been issued by the Closing Date, the Company and SUI agree to prorate
such Current Taxes on the basis of the taxes for the tax year immediately
preceding the Closing for the purpose of computing the prorations under this
Section 6.1(a), and to reprorate such Current Taxes at the request of either
party promptly after the final bills for such Current Taxes are issued after
Closing. The obligation to reprorate such Current Taxes will survive the
Closing. Any refund or rebate of Current Taxes which is received by or payable
to any Property Owner after the Closing shall be prorated between the Green
Entities, on behalf of the Company, and SUI in the manner provided above
promptly upon receipt. If there are any open appeals of real estate taxes or
assessments for tax years prior to the tax year in which the Closing occurs,
then the Green Entities, on behalf of the Company, shall be permitted to
continue to prosecute and control such appeals at the Green Entities' sole
expense (and SUI covenants that it shall cause the applicable Property Owner,
after Closing, to provide reasonable cooperation to the Green Entities to so
prosecute and control such appeals); provided however, SUI have the right, at
its expense, to participate in any proceeding which could reasonably be
expected to affect any taxes required to be paid by any Property Owner on or
after the date hereof and to consent to the settlement of any such proceeding
and if the proceedings affect taxes and assessments for periods both before
and after the Closing, then the parties will cooperate reasonably and the
fees, costs and expenses of such proceeding shall be equitably allocated
between the Green Parties and SUI. Further, if, after the Closing, any
Property Owner receives or is entitled to receive any refund or rebate of
taxes or assessments for periods prior to the tax year in which the Closing
occurs, then upon receipt SUI shall pay the amount thereof directly to the
Green Entities. The obligations of SUI under the preceding three sentences
shall survive the Closing.



(b) The amount of all unpaid water and other utility bills for each Project
which are not directly billed to the tenants of each Project, and all other
operating and other expenses incurred with respect to each Projects relating
to the period prior to the Closing Date, shall be paid by the Company on or
prior to the Closing Date or, if not paid, by the Green Entities as soon as
possible after Closing following receipt of an invoice therefor.



(c) Charges under Assumed Project Contracts (as defined in Section 7.1(f)
below) attributable to the period prior to the Closing Date shall be paid by
the Company prior to the Closing Date, or, if not paid, the amount due shall
be credited to SUI as of the Closing Date. All charges under the Non-Assumed
Project Contracts (as defined in





Section 7.1(f) below) shall be paid by the Company or the Green Entities (if
after Closing), whether such charges are attributable to the period prior to
the Closing Date or the period after the Closing Date.



(d) All prepaid rental, pass-through charges, assessments and other revenues
with respect to the operation of the Property collected by the Company, the
Holding Companies, or the Property Owners up to the Closing Date which are
allocable to the period from and after the Closing Date shall be paid by the
Company to SUI. Current resident rents, pass-through charges and assessments
shall be prorated and adjusted as of the date of Closing based upon the actual
number of days in the month of Closing with SUI being credited for rents,
pass-through charges and assessments on the date of Closing. In the event any
pass-through charges (such as real estate taxes) are passed through to
residents in the current year are based on a prior year's amount without
reconciliation with the residents, the amount actually used for the pass-
through charge in the current year is the amount which shall be prorated by
the Company and SUI under this paragraph (d) without any subsequent
reconciliation between the Company and SUI. All rental, pass-through charges,
assessments and other revenues actually collected by SUI attributable to rent
due for such month of Closing and received by SUI within sixty (60) days
following the Closing Date, shall be prorated between the Green Entities and
SUI based on the number of days in such month each owned each Project. Except
as provided in the preceding paragraph, to the extent SUI collects, within one
hundred eighty (180) after the Closing, any rental, pass-through charges,
assessments or revenues allocable to the period prior to the Closing Date, SUI
shall pay the same to the Green Entities and SUI shall use its good faith
efforts to collect all such rent, pass-through charges, assessments or
revenues allocable to the period prior to the Closing Date, but SUI shall not
be required to commence litigation or institute evictions with respect to such
tenants; provided, however, and except as otherwise set forth above, SUI is
assuming no obligation whatsoever for the collection of such rentals, pass-
through charges, assessments or revenues and all rentals, pass-through
charges, assessments and revenues collected subsequent to the Closing Date
shall always, in the first instance, be applied first to the most current
rentals, pass-through charges, assessments and revenues, if any, then due
under the Tenant Leases or otherwise. Further, the Company and/or the Green
Entities shall not have the right to seek collection, through litigation or
otherwise, of unpaid rent, pass-through charges or assessments from any person
while they remain a tenant of a Project, nor shall the Company and/or the
Green Entities institute any eviction or lockout proceedings against any
residents to recover delinquent rents, pass-through charges or assessments.
The Company, or the Green Entities following the Closing, shall retain one
hundred (100%) percent of the right to receive any past due rents with respect
to residents who are no longer residents of the Projects. Following Closing,
SUI shall assume any eviction actions which are on-going as of the date of
Closing and shall assume responsibility for payment of any legal fees
associated with such eviction actions incurred on and after the Closing Date,
and sums received by SUI as a result of such eviction actions shall first be
applied to reimburse SUI and Green Entities for legal fees incurred in
connection with such actions and the balance of such amounts prorated between
the Green Entities and SUI as provided above. Any pass-through charges or
assessments that are paid by tenants at the Projects on an annual basis or
other non-monthly basis shall be prorated based upon the actual number of days
in the period in which the Closing occurs



with SUI being credited for rents, pass-through charges and assessments on the
date of Closing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to Closing, in order to
avoid the ongoing reconciliation described in this Section 6.1(d), SUI and the
Company shall use good faith efforts to mutually agree upon terms by which SUI
will have the right to retain all delinquent rents and receivables at the
Projects collected after Closing in exchange for an agreed upon credit to the
Company at Closing.



(e) Any Tenant Lease executed after the Effective Date and prior to the
Closing Date shall be executed in compliance with any applicable provisions of
Exhibit I of the Omnibus Agreement.

(f) An amount equal to all expenses of the Projects which were paid prior to
the Closing Date and for which SUI will benefit after the Closing Date
including, without limitation, pre-paid taxes and assessments (if applicable),
annual license and permit fees and pre-paid amounts (if any) under the Assumed
Project Contracts, shall be disbursed or credited to the Company at the
Closing, and an amount equal to all expenses of the Projects which were
incurred prior to the Closing Date and are due or paid after the Closing Date
shall be credited to SUI at the Closing and SUI shall cause all such expenses
to be paid.



(g) The credit to SUI, if any, payable in accordance with the pre-closing
operating covenants (attached to the Omnibus Agreement) in connection with
Capital Projects.



(h) All costs and expenses incurred by the Company or any Holding Company or
Property Owner prior to the Closing Date in connection with the transactions
contemplated herein and the performance of its obligations under this
Agreement, including, without limitation, attorney and other professional fees
and the costs and expenses payable by the Company or any Holding Company or
Property Owner hereunder, shall be paid by the Company or the Green Entities
(if after the Closing) and shall not be charged to, or the responsibility of
any Holding Company or Property Owner or SUI.



(i) All interest accrued for the Assumed Debt up to the Closing Date shall be
paid by the Property Owners who are the borrowers under the Assumed Debt on or
before the Closing Date, or, if not paid, an amount equal to the entire amount
of such accrued interest shall be credited to SUI as of the Closing Date.



(j) All escrows and reserve accounts under the Assumed Debt and the Mortgage
Documents which will remain in place after the Closing for the benefit of SUI,
the Holding Companies, and the Property Owners and shall be credited by SUI to
the Green Entities, on behalf of the Company, at the Closing.



(k) The Green Entities, on behalf of the Company, will be entitled to a credit
at Closing for any utility deposit, public improvement bond or similar
refundable security posted for the benefit of any Project for which SUI
receives the benefit after Closing.







(l) The Company shall be entitled to cause ALL, AIOP, each Property Owner and
each Holding Company to directly or indirectly distribute to the Company prior
to the Closing, and the Company shall distribute to the Green Entities, all
cash on hand, cash equivalents and other investments and assets, other than
the Projects and related Improvements, the Personal Property or other Acquired
Assets described in the Omnibus Agreement.



6.2 If, within one hundred eighty (180) days after the Closing, either SUI or
the Green Entities discover any inaccuracies or errors in the prorations or
adjustments done at Closing pursuant to Sections 6.1, such party shall notify
the other party of such inaccuracy or error by written notice including
reasonable detail of the appropriate calculation. In such event, the parties
shall attempt, in good faith, to resolve any issues with respect to the
prorations and adjustments done at Closing pursuant to Section 6.1. After the
parties resolve any such issues or, in the event the parties are unable to
resolve such issues, a final judgment has been rendered with respect to such
matter without timely appeal or after all appeals timely made are fully
resolved, SUI and the Green Entities shall promptly take all action and pay
all sums necessary so that such prorations and adjustments completed pursuant
to Section 6.1 hereof shall be in accordance with the terms of this Agreement,
and the obligations of either party to pay any such amount shall survive the
Closing Date. The Company, the Green Entities and SUI further acknowledge and
agree that if neither party has identified an inaccuracy or error in the
prorations or adjustments completed pursuant to Section 6.1 within such one
hundred eighty (180) days, the obligation to complete a post-closing
adjustment shall be deemed null and void and of no further force and effect;
provided, however, that the 180-day period in this Section 6.2 shall not apply
to the reproration of Current Taxes under Section 6.1(a), which will be
effected promptly after the issuance of the final tax bills for the Current
Taxes.

With the exception of the Reserve at Fox Creek 35-Year Leases and Section
723.059(4) Leases, once the landlord has knowledge of a Lease Termination
Event with respect to a Restricted Lease, it has been Property Owner's
practice during the Ownership Period for each applicable Project when re-
letting a lot that had been subject to a Terminated Restricted Lease to a new
tenant to require the new tenant to pay a Market Rental Rate upon commencement
of the term of such new tenant's lease (or upon the first month after any rent
concession shall have terminated), and, except for the Continuing Restricted
Leases and leases issued to new tenants for which the landlord also issues a
Certificate, modify base rent to the then applicable Market Rental Rate or
such other rate as the Property Owner deemed appropriate for the applicable
site under then-current economic and business conditions upon the commencement
of each annual renewal term.

Once the landlord has knowledge of a Lease Termination Event with respect to a
Section 723.059(4) Lease, it has been Property Owner's practice during the
Ownership Period for each applicable Project when re-letting a lot that had
been subject to a Section 723.059(4) Lease to permit the new tenant to pay the
base rental rate that was in effect for such Section 723.059(4) Lease for the
remainder of the term 

 

of such Section 723.059(4) Lease then in effect, and, upon expiration of such
term (or upon the first month after any rent concession shall have
terminated), to require the tenant to pay a Market Rental Rate, and,
thereafter, except for the Continuing Restricted Leases and leases issued to
new tenants for which the landlord also issues a Certificate, annually modify
base rent to the then applicable Market Rental Rate or such other rate as the
Property Owner deemed appropriate for the applicable site under then-current
economic and business conditions upon the commencement of each annual renewal
term.

As of the date hereof: (i) to the Company's knowledge, Property Owner's
historical practice described in Paragraphs (1) and (2) above materially
complied with all applicable legal requirements (including under Section 723)
in effect as of the date of each such action described therein, and (ii) there
is no pending litigation against the applicable Property Owner for which the
applicable Property Owner has received written service of process (or, to the
Company's knowledge, has any such litigation been threatened in writing during
the relevant Ownership Period), and no litigation was filed during the
relevant Ownership Period, claiming that Property Owner was (or is) prohibited
under applicable law or the documents governing the tenancy of the tenant
under the Restricted Lease from engaging in the historical practice described
in Paragraphs (1) and (2) above.

There are not a material number of Restricted Leases at any of the Projects
other than those leases on the Rent Rolls that are not marked as a "market"
lease in the column entitled "Type" or as "Vacant" in the column entitled
"Tenant Name". Except for an immaterial number of Restricted Leases that may
not do so, each Restricted Lease that is marked on the Rent Rolls as
"lifetime/fixed" in the column entitled "Type" provides that the right to pay
a fixed base rental amount for the life of the tenant(s) named therein, is not
assignable, and terminates upon a Lease Termination Event.

The electronic copies of the applicable prospectuses and rules and
regulations, and any amendments thereto, for each Project located in Florida
(other than the Savanna Project) that the Company delivered to or made
available to SUI were provided to the Company's affiliate, Green Courte
Partners, LLC, by the law firm of Lutz, Bobo, Telfair, Eastman, Gabel and Lee
and, to the Company's knowledge, such copies were obtained by such law firm
from the Florida Department of Business and Professional Regulation (the
"DBPR") after the law firm made a request for such documents within the last
60 days. Except as disclosed on Schedule 7.1(b)(5), all rules and regulations
currently in effect for each Project have been provided or made available to
SUI. To the knowledge of the Company, the prospectus for each Project located
in Florida (other than the Savanna Club Project, which does not have a
prospectus because it is not subject to Section 723), and any amendments
thereto, have been approved, as required, by the DBPR, and except as disclosed
on Schedule 7.1(b)(5), 

 

neither the Company nor any Property Owner has received written notice from
the DBPR of any material violations of any prospectus or any rules and
regulations related thereto that have not been cured. With respect to all
Projects located in Florida other than the Savanna Club Project, to the
Company's knowledge and except as disclosed on Schedule 7.1(b)(5), each
Property Owner has operated the applicable Project during the applicable
Ownership Period in material compliance with the community rules and
regulations and prospectuses in effect for such Project from time to time.

Leases) contain provisions that prohibit the Company's past practice as
described in Paragraph (1) and in Paragraph (2) above, other than an
immaterial number of Restricted Leases that may contain such prohibition.

Except as set forth on Schedule 7.1(b)(7), as of the date hereof: (i) to the
Company's knowledge, Property Owner's historical practice described in
Paragraphs (1) and (2) above with respect to the Illinois Projects materially
complied with all applicable legal requirements in effect as of the date of
each such action described therein, and (ii) there is no pending litigation
against the applicable Property Owner for which the applicable Property Owner
has received written service of process (or, to the Company's knowledge, has
any such litigation been threatened in writing during the relevant Ownership
Period for which the Company reasonably believes a lawsuit will be filed),
and, to the Company's knowledge, no litigation was filed during the relevant
Ownership Period, claiming that Property Owner was (or is) prohibited under
applicable law or the documents governing the tenancy of the tenant under the
Restricted Lease from engaging in the historical practice described in
Paragraphs (1) and (2) above.

For any Projects that are 723 Communities that have a prospectus that provides
for issuance of a Restricted Lease (such prospectus, a "Restricted
Prospectus") and a prospectus that provides for issuance of a non-Restricted
Lease (such lease, a "Market Lease", and such prospectus, a "Market
Prospectus"), when re-letting a lot a new tenant in such Project, the
landlord, at present, provides the new tenant with two choices - a Market
Prospectus and corresponding Market Lease, and a Restricted Prospectus and
corresponding Restricted Lease, with the amount of the initial Market Rent
payable by the new tenant under the Restricted Lease generally being
approximately at least 8% higher than the amount of the initial Market Rent
that the new tenant is required to pay under the Market Lease. 

 

(c) At Closing, the Company shall have the right to request and direct (or
shall cause its affiliate or managing agent to request and direct) that SUI be
provided with all of the electronic data pertaining to the tenancies of the
then-current tenants under the Tenant Leases to permit SUI to transition the
billing of the tenants and administer the Tenant Leases as described in
Exhibit I of the Omnibus Agreement.



(d) Except as set forth on Schedule 7.1(d) attached hereto, as of July 24,
2014, neither the Company nor any Property Owner has received written notice

violation or alleged violation of any building, zoning, safety, fire,
environmental, health



or other codes, laws, ordinances or regulations, or (ii) any violation of any

Owner or any Project and, to the Company's knowledge, neither the Company nor
any Property Owner has received a written notice of threatened litigation for
which the Company reasonably believes a lawsuit will be filed.

of charges under such Project Contract, together with all other Project
Contracts which SUI shall elect to continue by the delivery of written notice
to the Company at least thirty (30) days prior to the Closing Date, shall be
collectively referred to herein as the "Assumed Project Contracts". Except as
set forth on Schedule 7.1(f) attached hereto, to the Company's knowledge, each
Project Contract is in full force and effect, the Company, the Holding
Companies and Property Owners have complied in all material respects with the
provisions of each Project Contract to which it is a party and is not in
material default under any such Project Contract and, to the knowledge of the
Company, no other party to any Project Contract has failed to comply in any
material respect with, or is in material default under, the provisions of any
Project Contract. Except as set forth on Schedule 7.1(f), none of the Project
Contracts are with related parties or affiliated entities of the Company or
any Property Owner and all of the Projects Contracts were entered into in the
ordinary course of business. Prior to or at the Closing, the Company shall
terminate, or cause the Holding Companies and Property Owners to terminate,
the Project Contracts which do not constitute Assumed Project Contracts (the
"Non-Assumed Project Contracts"). Prior to and after the Closing, the Company,
or the Green Entities (if after the Closing) shall be responsible for all
liabilities and obligations of the Company or the Property Owners under the
Non-Assumed Project Contracts, and shall indemnify and hold harmless SUI and
the Property Owners from all such liabilities and obligations.



(g) The Company has, and will have on the Closing Date with the Shareholder
Approval, the power and authority to enter into this Agreement and perform its
respective obligations in accordance with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, and each person who executes this Agreement and all other

Agreement or in connection herewith will be, when executed and delivered, duly
authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and constitutes, or upon

Company, except as enforcement thereof may be limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other laws relating to or affecting
enforcement of creditors' rights generally or by general equity principles.



(h) (A) The Company is a Maryland real estate investment trust, duly formed,
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Maryland
and has the power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and
to conduct its business and to enter into and perform its obligations under
this Agreement. Each Holding Company and Property Owner has been duly formed
and is validly existing as a limited liability company or limited partnership
in good standing under the laws of the States set forth on Exhibit A.



(B) Neither this Agreement, the Articles of Merger nor the performance by the
Company, the Holding Companies or Property Owners of its obligations
hereunder, including, without limitation, the Merger, violates or will violate
(i) any constituent documents of the Company or any Holding Company or
Property Owner, (ii) except for any consent required from a lender with
respect to any of the Existing Debt, any material contract, agreement or
instrument to which the Company or any Holding Company or Property Owner is a
party or bound or which affects any Project, the Company Shares or any
Property Owner or Holding Company, or (iii) to the knowledge of Company,
except as set forth on Schedule 7.1(h) attached hereto, any law, regulation,
ordinance, order or decree applicable to the Company or any Holding Company,
Property Owner or Project. Except as set forth on Schedule 7.1(h) attached
hereto, except for the approval of the lenders with respect to the Existing
Debt and except for the approval of the FPSC (as defined below), no consent,
approval or authorization of, or designation, declaration or filing with, or
notice to, any governmental authority, or any lenders, lessors, creditors,
shareholders or other party, is required on the part of the Company or any
Holding Company or Property Owner in connection with this Agreement, the
Merger or the performance by the Company or any Holding Company or Property
Owner of its obligations hereunder.



(C) In connection with the consummation of the contribution transactions
involving the indirect change of control of Projects located in the State of
Florida for which the Florida Public Service Commission ("FPSC") has issued
certificates ("FPSC Certificates") to the Property Owners for the water and/or
wastewater facilities located at the applicable Projects (the "Facilities"),
pursuant to Section 367.071(1), Florida Statutes (2011), the indirect change
of control of the Facilities and the FPSC Certificates is contingent upon
approval of the FPSC. Notwithstanding anything in the preceding sentence to
the contrary, pursuant to and as permitted by Section 367.071(1), Florida
Statutes (2011), the Company and SUI shall close on the contribution
transactions involving the indirect change of control of indirect ownership of
the Projects for which the FPSC Certificates were issued, including but not
limited to the Facilities and the FPSC Certificates, as contemplated by the
Agreement, prior to obtaining FPSC approval with regard to the indirect change
of control of the Facilities and FPSC Certificates. After the Closing Date,
SUI shall be responsible for petitioning



the FPSC for the approval of the indirect change of control of all FPSC
Certificates with respect to the Facilities, and filing any reports and
documentation required by the FPSC for the indirect change of control of the
Property Owner and the FPSC Certificates, as well as all permits associated
with the Facilities, including, without limitation, the wastewater permit, any
consumptive use permit and any environmental permit, to reflect that the

Projects and routine purchases of supplies and materials used in the ordinary
course of ownership and operation of the Projects, and except for budgeted
capital projects and other projects set forth on Schedule 7.1(i) attached
hereto (the "Capital Projects"), neither the Company nor any Holding Company
or Property Owner has contracted, or between the Effective Date and Closing
Date will contract for, the furnishing of labor or materials to any Project
which will not be paid for in full prior to the Closing Date or adjusted
between the parties pursuant to Section 6.1 hereof. If applicable law requires
that particular work that comprises a portion of a Capital Project be
performed by a licensed contractor, then the Company or the applicable
Property Owner shall be obligated to engage a contractor that has the required
license and appropriate insurance for such work. If any claim is made by any
party for the payment of any amount due for the furnishing of labor and/or
materials to any Holding Company, any Property Owner or any Project prior to
the Closing Date and which claim is not adjusted between the parties pursuant
to Section 6.1 hereof, the Company will immediately pay such claim and
discharge the lien, or if a lien has been filed and the Company intends, in
good faith, to contest such claim, the Company may cause the lien to be
discharged by posting a bond pursuant to applicable law or obtaining title
insurance coverage reasonably satisfactory to SUI. Schedule 7.1(i) attached
hereto lists, as of the date set forth thereon, the total budgeted costs, the
budgeted remaining costs to complete and the expected substantial completion
date (if not anticipated to be substantially complete by December 15, 2014)

business, an application to renew same), and (ii) there are no other material
licenses which are required in order to own or operate the Project in the

of each Project and which will be owned by each Property Owner at Closing.
Neither the Company nor any of its affiliates will remove any material item of
Personal Property from any Project on or prior to the Closing Date, unless

(hh) Taxes.



(i) Each of Company and the Company Subsidiaries has timely filed all material
Tax Returns required to be filed by it (after giving effect to any valid
extension to file). Each such Tax Return is true, correct and complete in all
material respects. Company and each Company Subsidiary has paid (or Company
has paid on its behalf), all material Taxes required to be paid. True, correct
and complete copies of all material federal, state and local Tax returns and
reports for Company and AIOP for 2010, 2011 and 2012, and all written
communications



relating thereto with any Governmental Entity, have been delivered or made
available to representatives of SUI. All material Taxes which Company or the
Company Subsidiaries are required by Law to withhold or collect, including
Taxes required to have been withheld in connection with amounts paid or owing
to any employee, independent contractor, creditor, shareholder or other third
party and sales, gross receipts and use Taxes, have been duly withheld or
collected and, to the extent required, have been paid over to the proper
Governmental Entities within the time period prescribed by Law. The most
recent audited financial statements of the Company prior to the date of this
Agreement reflect an adequate reserve in accordance with GAAP for all material
Taxes payable by Company and the Company Subsidiaries for all taxable periods
and portions thereof through the date of such financial statements. Company
and each Company Subsidiary has established (and until the Closing Date shall
continue to establish and maintain) on its books and records reserves that are
adequate for the payment of all material Taxes not yet due and payable. Since
December 31, 2013, neither Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries has
incurred any material liability for Taxes other than in the ordinary course of
business and other than transfer or similar Taxes arising in connection with
the sales of property. No event has occurred, and no condition or circumstance
exists, which presents a material risk that any material Tax described in the
preceding sentences will be imposed upon Company or any Company Subsidiary.
Except as disclosed in Schedule 7.1(h)(h), neither Company nor any Company
Subsidiary is the subject of any material audit, examination, or other
proceeding in respect of federal, state, local or foreign Taxes; to the
Knowledge of Company, no material audit, examination or other proceeding in
respect of federal, state, local or foreign Taxes involving Company or any
Company Subsidiary is being considered by any Tax authority; and no material
audit, examination or proceeding in respect of federal, state, local or
foreign Taxes involving Company or any Company Subsidiary has occurred since
December 31, 2013. No deficiencies for any Taxes have been asserted or
assessed in writing (or to the Knowledge of Company or any Company Subsidiary,
proposed) against Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, including claims
by any taxing authority in a jurisdiction where Company or any Company
Subsidiary does not file Tax Returns but in which any of them is or may be
subject to taxation, which individually or in the aggregate would be material,
and no requests for waivers of the time to assess any such Taxes have been
granted and remain in effect or are pending. There are no liens, claims and
encumbrances for Taxes upon the assets of Company or the Company Subsidiaries
except for statutory Liens for Taxes not yet due or payable and for which
appropriate reserves have been established on their respective financial
statements in accordance with GAAP.

(ii) Company (A) has been subject to taxation as a REIT within the meaning of
the Code and has satisfied the requirements for qualification as a REIT
beginning with its taxable year ended December 31, 2007, (B) has operated, and
intends to continue to operate, in a manner consistent with the requirements
for qualification and taxation as a REIT through the Effective Time and (C)
has not taken or omitted to take any action which could reasonably be expected
to



result in the failure to qualify or continue to qualify as a REIT. Each
Subsidiary of Company which is a partnership, joint venture or limited
liability company (that has not joined with Company in making an election to
be a taxable REIT subsidiary in accordance with Section 856(l) of the Code)
since its formation has (A) been and continues to be classified for federal
income Tax purposes as a partnership or treated as a disregarded entity and
not as an association taxable as a corporation, or a "publicly traded
partnership" within the meaning of Section 7704(b) of the Code, and (B) not
owned any assets (including, without limitation, securities) that would cause
Company to violate Section 856(c)(4) of the Code. No Company Subsidiary since
its formation has been or is now a corporation for United States federal
income tax purposes other than a corporation that qualifies as a Qualified
REIT Subsidiary or a Taxable REIT Subsidiary. Neither Company nor any Company
Subsidiary holds any asset (x) the disposition of which would be subject to
rules similar to Section 1374 of the Code as announced in IRS Notice 88‑19 or
Treasury Regulation Section 1.337(d)‑5, Treasury Regulation Section 1.337(d)‑6
or Treasury Regulation Section 1.337(d)‑7 or (y) that is subject to a consent
filed pursuant to Section 341(f) of the Code and the regulations thereunder.
Since its inception, Company and the Company Subsidiaries have not incurred
(i) any material liability for Taxes under Sections 857(b)(1), 857(b)(4),
857(b)(6)(A), 857(b)(7), 860(c) or 4981 of the Code which have not been
previously paid; and (ii) any liability for Taxes under Sections 857(b)(5)
(for income test violations), 856(c)(7)(C) (for asset test violations), or
856(g)(5)(C) (for violations of other qualification requirements applicable to
REITs). Each corporation, trust or other entity taxable as an association
which has merged with and into Company had been subject to taxation as a REIT
at all times since its initial election of REIT status and had satisfied all
requirements to qualify as a REIT for such years, except to the extent that a
failure to satisfy such requirements would not have an Company Material
Adverse Effect. Company's dividends paid deduction, within the meaning of
Section 561 of the Code, for each taxable year, taking into account any
dividends subject to Sections 857(b)(9) or 858 of the Code, has not been less
than the sum of (x) Company's REIT taxable income, as defined in Section
857(b)(2) of the Code, determined without regard to any dividends paid
deduction for such year and (y) Company's net capital gain for such year.

(iii) ALL (A) has been subject to taxation as a REIT within the meaning of the
Code and has satisfied the requirements for qualification as a REIT beginning
with its taxable year ended December 31, 2009, (B) has operated, and shall
operate, in a manner consistent with the requirements for qualification and
taxation as a REIT through the effective time of the ALL Merger and (C) has
not taken or omitted to take any action which could reasonably be expected to
result in the failure to qualify or continue to qualify as a REIT.

(iv) For each taxable year beginning with its taxable year ended December 31,
2010 through the taxable year beginning January 1, 2013, AIOP was properly
classified and qualified to be taxed as a partnership for U.S. federal income
tax purposes.

Governmental Entity relating to Taxes, (y) has engaged in any transaction of
which it has made (or was required to make) disclosure to any Governmental
Entity to avoid the imposition of any penalties related to Taxes, or (z) has
participated in any transaction that could give rise to a disclosure
obligation as a "listed transaction" under Section 6011 of the Code and the
Treasury Regulations thereunder or any similar provision under applicable Law.

(viii) Neither Company nor any Company Subsidiary has waived any statute of
limitations with respect to the assessment of material Taxes or agreed to any

Laws) and have duly and timely withheld and, in each case, have paid over to
the appropriate taxing authorities all material amounts required to be so
withheld and paid over on or prior to the due date thereof under all
applicable laws.

(xii) None of Company nor any Company Subsidiary has constituted either a
"distributing corporation" or a "controlled corporation" (within the meaning

prior to the date of this Agreement or (ii) in a distribution which could
otherwise constitute part of a "plan" or series of related transactions
(within the meaning of Section 355(e) of the Code) in conjunction with
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

listed in the Annex to, or otherwise subject to the provisions of the
Executive Order; (2) is named as a "Specially Designated National and Blocked

described.

(x) Taxes.





(i) Each of SUI and the SUI Subsidiaries has timely filed all material Tax
Returns required to be filed by it (after giving effect to any valid extension
to file). Each such Tax Return is true, correct and complete in all material
respects. SUI and each SUI Subsidiary has paid (or SUI has paid on its
behalf), all material Taxes required to be paid. True, correct and complete
copies of all material federal, state and local Tax returns and reports for
SUI, SCOLP and SHS for 2010, 2011 and 2012, and all written communications
relating thereto with any Governmental Entity, have been delivered or made
available to representatives of Company. All material Taxes which SUI or the
SUI Subsidiaries are required by Law to withhold or collect, including Taxes
required to have been withheld in connection with amounts paid or owing to any
employee, independent contractor, creditor, shareholder or other third party
and sales, gross receipts and use Taxes, have been duly withheld or collected
and, to the extent required, have been paid over to the proper Governmental
Entities within the time period prescribed by Law. The most recent audited
financial statements contained in the SUI SEC Documents filed with the SEC
prior to the date of this Agreement reflect an adequate reserve in accordance
with GAAP for all material Taxes payable by SUI and the SUI Subsidiaries for
all taxable periods and portions thereof through the date of such financial
statements. SUI and each SUI Subsidiary has established (and until the Closing
Date shall continue to establish and maintain) on its books and records
reserves that are adequate for the payment of all material Taxes not yet due
and payable. Since December 31, 2013, neither SUI nor any of the SUI
Subsidiaries has incurred any material liability for Taxes other than in the
ordinary course of business and other than transfer or similar Taxes arising
in connection with the sales of property. No event has occurred, and no
condition or circumstance exists, which presents a material risk that any
material Tax described in the preceding sentences will be imposed upon SUI or
any SUI Subsidiary. Except as disclosed in Schedule 8.1(x), neither SUI nor
any SUI Subsidiary is the subject of any material audit, examination, or other
proceeding in respect of federal, state, local or foreign Taxes; to the
Knowledge of SUI, no material audit, examination or other proceeding in
respect of federal, state, local or foreign Taxes involving SUI or any SUI
Subsidiary is being considered by any Tax authority; and no material audit,
examination or proceeding in respect of federal, state, local or foreign Taxes
involving SUI or any SUI Subsidiary has occurred since December 31, 2013. No
deficiencies for any Taxes have been asserted or assessed in writing (or to
the Knowledge of SUI or any SUI Subsidiary, proposed) against SUI or any of
the SUI Subsidiaries, including claims by any taxing authority in a
jurisdiction where SUI or any SUI Subsidiary does not file Tax Returns but in
which any of them is or may be subject to taxation, which individually or in
the aggregate would be material, and no requests for waivers of the time to
assess any such Taxes have been granted and remain in effect or are pending.
There are no liens, claims and encumbrances for Taxes upon the assets of SUI
or the SUI Subsidiaries except for statutory liens, claims or encumbrances for
Taxes not yet due or payable and for which appropriate reserves have been
established on their respective financial statements in accordance with GAAP.





(ii) SUI (A) has been subject to taxation as a REIT within the meaning of the
Code and has satisfied the requirements for qualification as a REIT beginning
with its taxable year ended December 31, 1994, (B) has operated, and intends
to continue to operate, in a manner consistent with the requirements for
qualification and taxation as a REIT through the Effective Time and (C) has
not taken or omitted to take any action which could reasonably be expected to
result in the failure to qualify or continue to qualify as a REIT. Each
Subsidiary of SUI which is a partnership, joint venture or limited liability
company (that has not joined with SUI in making an election to be a taxable
REIT subsidiary in accordance with Section 856(l) of the Code) since its
formation has (A) been and continues to be classified for federal income Tax
purposes as a partnership or treated as a disregarded entity and not as an
association taxable as a corporation, or a "publicly traded partnership"
within the meaning of Section 7704(b) of the Code, and (B) not owned any
assets (including, without limitation, securities) that would cause SUI to
violate Section 856(c)(4) of the Code. No SUI Subsidiary since its formation
has been or is now a corporation for United States federal income tax purposes
other than a corporation that qualifies as a Qualified REIT Subsidiary or a
Taxable REIT Subsidiary. Neither SUI nor any SUI Subsidiary holds any asset
(x) the disposition of which would be subject to rules similar to Section 1374
of the Code as announced in IRS Notice 88‑19 or Treasury Regulation Section
1.337(d)‑5, Treasury Regulation Section 1.337(d)‑6 or Treasury Regulation
Section 1.337(d)‑7 or (y) that is subject to a consent filed pursuant to
Section 341(f) of the Code and the regulations thereunder. Since its
inception, SUI and the SUI Subsidiaries have not incurred (i) any material
liability for Taxes under Sections 857(b)(1), 857(b)(4), 857(b)(6)(A),
857(b)(7), 860(c) or 4981 of the Code which have not been previously paid; and
(ii) any liability for Taxes under Sections 857(b)(5) (for income test
violations), 856(c)(7)(C) (for asset test violations), or 856(g)(5)(C) (for
violations of other qualification requirements applicable to REITs). Each
corporation, trust or other entity taxable as an association which has merged
with and into SUI had been subject to taxation as a REIT at all times since
its initial election of REIT status and had satisfied all requirements to
qualify as a REIT for such years, except to the extent that a failure to
satisfy such requirements would not have an SUI Material Adverse Effect. SUI's
dividends paid deduction, within the meaning of Section 561 of the Code, for
each taxable year, taking into account any dividends subject to Sections
857(b)(9) or 858 of the Code, has not been less than the sum of (x) SUI's REIT
taxable income, as defined in Section 857(b)(2) of the Code, determined
without regard to any dividends paid deduction for such year and (y) SUI's net
capital gain for such year.

(iii) For each taxable year beginning with its taxable year ended December 31,
1994 through the taxable year beginning January 1, 2013, SCOLP was properly
classified and qualified to be taxed as a partnership for U.S. federal income
tax purposes.

made (or was required to make) disclosure to any Governmental Entity to avoid
the imposition of any penalties related to Taxes, or (z) has participated in
any transaction that could give rise to a disclosure obligation as a "listed
transaction" under Section 6011 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations
thereunder or any similar provision under applicable Law.

with respect to the assessment of material Taxes or agreed to any extension of
time with respect to any material Tax assessment or deficiency for any open
tax year.

(viii) Except as disclosed in Schedule 8.1(x), neither SUI nor any of the SUI
Subsidiaries has entered into any "closing agreement" as described in Section

foreign income Tax Law).

(ix) Neither SUI nor any SUI Subsidiary currently is the beneficiary of any
extension of time within which to file any material Tax Return.

(x) SUI and the SUI Subsidiaries have complied, in all material respects, with
all applicable Laws relating to the payment and withholding of Taxes

appropriate taxing authorities all material amounts required to be so withheld
and paid over on or prior to the due date thereof under all applicable laws.

(xi) None of SUI nor any SUI Subsidiary has constituted either a "distributing
corporation" or a "controlled corporation" (within the meaning of Section
355(a)(1)(A) of the Code) in a distribution of stock qualifying for tax-free
treatment under Section 355 of the Code (i) in the two (2) years prior to the

constitute part of a "plan" or series of related transactions (within the
meaning of Section 355(e) of the Code) in conjunction with transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

Subsidiaries) has or has had any earnings and profits attributable to such
entity or any other corporation in any non-REIT year within the meaning of
Section 857 of the Code.

(xiv) SUI is not aware of any fact or circumstance that could reasonably be

12. DESTRUCTION OF PROJECTS

12.1 In the event any part of any Project shall be damaged by fire or other
casualty (a "Casualty Event") prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall
notify SUI thereof, which notice shall include a description of the damage and
all pertinent insurance information, and the Company shall cause the
applicable Property Owner to promptly undertake and diligently prosecute the
repair and restoration of the affected Project to substantially the same
condition that existed immediately prior to the Casualty Event. In the event
of any such damage to a Project, this Agreement shall not be terminated, nor
shall the Closing be delayed, but, if the repair and restoration of the
Project is not completed on or before the Closing Date, then the following
terms and conditions shall apply:



(a) At least five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company and
SUI, acting reasonably and in good faith, shall review the status of the
repairs and restoration with the general contractor or project manager
retained by the Property Owner to perform or supervise the repairs and
restoration, and shall mutually determine the reasonably anticipated costs and
expenses required to complete the repairs and restoration of the Project to
substantially the same condition that existed immediately prior to the
Casualty Event (the "Estimated Repair Costs").



(b) At the Closing, the Company and SUI shall establish a joint order escrow
with the Title Company, into which the Company shall deposit an amount of Cash
equal to the Estimated Repair Costs. The escrow funds shall be disbursed as
follows (i) to SUI, to reimburse SUI for actual out-of-pocket costs and
expenses incurred by SUI or the Property Owner to complete the repairs or
restoration (but not any Enhancements), from time to time upon not less than
five (5) days prior written request from SUI to the Green Entities accompanied
by reasonable and customary evidence of payment, which shall be subject to the
Green Entities' approval in accordance with the Deemed Approval Process, and
(ii) upon completion of the required repairs and restoration (but not any
Enhancements except as expressly required under applicable legal requirements
to proceed with the other repairs and restoration), the remaining balance of
the escrow funds, if any, shall be disbursed to or at the direction of the
Green Entities. SUI shall proceed with due diligence to complete the work
under this Section 12.1(b).

(c) The Green Entities' obligations with respect to the repairs and
restoration (including the Estimated Repair Costs) shall not include any
obligation to make or pay for the cost or expenses of any enhancements or
other improvements to the Project beyond the repair and restoration of the
Project to substantially the same condition that existed immediately prior to
the Casualty Event, including any enhancements or improvements that may be
required to comply with applicable laws, building codes or other legal
requirements (such as, without limitation, elevation of any home pads)
("Enhancements"); provided however that if and only to the extent that the
insurance



proceeds recovered from the Casualty Event includes funds payable for or in
respect of such Enhancements (including proceeds of any "laws and ordinances"
coverage) (an "Insured Enhancement"), then such proceeds (net of the costs of
recovery) shall be retained by the Property Owner or paid to SUI.



(d) Except as expressly provided in subparagraph (c), the Company shall be
entitled to receive and retain all insurance proceeds that may be payable as a
consequence of the Casualty Event, and if any such insurance proceeds are
received by the Property Owner or SUI after the Closing, then the same shall
be paid over to the Green Entities, without demand, deduction or set off of
any kind or nature, not later than two (2) business days after receipt. From
and after the Closing, if the insurance claims arising from the Casualty Event
(other than with respect to an Insured Enhancement) have not been settled to
the Green Entities' reasonable satisfaction, the Green Entities shall control
the insurance settlement and adjustment process and, at the direction of the
Green Entities, SUI will cooperate and cause the Property Owner to cooperate
with the Green Entities in good faith to maximize the recovery of insurance
proceeds. Without limitation, if requested by the Green Entities, SUI and the
Property Owner shall assign to the Green Entities the right to settle and
receive the insurance proceeds and will execute such proofs of claims and
other forms and instruments (including, if requested, a limited power of
attorney in favor of the Green Entities) as the Green Entities deem to be
necessary or appropriate for this purpose. With respect to an insurance claim
for an Insured Enhancement, SUI shall control the insurance settlement and
adjustment process and, at the direction of SUI, the Green Entities will
cooperate with SUI in good faith to maximize the recovery of insurance
proceeds. Without limitation, if requested by SUI, the Green Entities and the
Property Owner shall assign to SUI the right to settle and receive the
insurance proceeds and will execute such proofs of claims and other forms and
instruments (including, if requested, a limited power of attorney in favor of
SUI) as SUI deems to be necessary or appropriate for this purpose.



(e) If and to the extent that any Revenue Producing Sites at the affected
Project immediately prior to the Casualty Event become untenantable or are
vacated by reason of the Casualty Event or the tenants thereof are excused
from or stop paying rent by reason of the Casualty Event (the "Rent Loss
Sites"), then at the Closing, the Company and SUI shall establish a joint
order escrow with the Title Company, into which the Company shall deposit an
amount of Cash (the "Rent Loss Funds") equal to the difference between (x)
sixty (60) months' rent and pass-through charges (as reasonably determined by
the Company and SUI) for each of the Rent Loss Sites, at the base rental rate
(without taking into account concessions) in effect for each Rent Loss Site
immediately prior to the Casualty Event, exceeds (y) the amount of savings in
Project operating expenses that would be expected to be realized by the
vacancy of the Rent Loss Sites over a 60-month period, as reasonably estimated
and mutually determined by the Company and SUI acting reasonably and in good
faith. As used herein, the "Monthly Rent Loss Payment" for each affected home
site shall be equal to one-sixtieth (1/60th) of the quotient obtained by
dividing the total amount of Rent Loss Funds by the number of Rent Loss Sites.
From and after the Closing, the Rent Loss Funds shall be disbursed from escrow
as follows (i) SUI shall be entitled to receive on a



monthly basis, in advance, an amount equal to the product of the Monthly Rent
Loss Payment multiplied by the number of the Rent Loss Sites that have not
become Revenue Producing Sites, and (ii) upon any Rent Loss Site becoming a
Revenue Producing Site, the Green Entities shall be entitled to receive from
the escrow and amount equal to the product of the Monthly Rent Loss Payment
multiplied by the number of months between the date that such Rent Loss Site
becomes a Revenue Producing Site and the fifth (5th) anniversary of the
Closing Date less the amount of actual rent concessions granted to such
tenant, not to exceed two times the monthly pro forma rent for such site,
which shall be disbursed to SUI. SUI and the Property Owner shall use good
faith efforts from and after the Closing to turn Rent Loss Sites into Revenue
Producing Sites so as to minimize the impact of the vacancy and loss of rents.



13. CONDEMNATION

13.1 If, prior to the Closing Date, the Company or SUI receives or obtains
notice that any governmental authority having jurisdiction intends to commence
or has commenced proceedings for the taking of any portion of any Project by
the exercise of any power of condemnation or eminent domain, or notice of any
such taking is recorded among the public records of the state or the county
where the Project is located, then this Agreement shall not be terminated, nor
shall the Closing be delayed, and the parties shall close the transaction as
if no such notice had been received, obtained or recorded or proceedings
commenced. In such event SUI, acting reasonably, shall control the claim,
litigation, and settlement a process and, at the direction of SUI, the Company
will cooperate and cause the Property Owner to cooperate with SUI in good
faith to maximize the recovery of condemnation proceeds. Without limitation,
if requested by SUI, the Company and the Property Owner shall assign to SUI
the right to settle and receive the condemnation proceeds and will execute
such proofs of claims and other forms and instruments (including, if
requested, a limited power of attorney in favor of SUI) as SUI reasonably
deems to be necessary or appropriate for this purpose. Any proceeds or awards
made in connection with such taking shall be the sole property of SUI and the
applicable Property Owner, and not the Company, less any out-of-pocket costs
and expenses incurred by the Company with respect to restoration resulting
from such condemnation or out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred in
connection with the collection of any such condemnation proceeds. In the event
a Lender does not release the condemnation proceeds, SUI may pay off the
applicable loan at Closing in accordance with the Omnibus Agreement.





14. DEFAULT

14.1 Any default by the Company prior to Closing or any of the other Green
Entities under the Omnibus Agreement shall constitute a default by the Company
hereunder. In the event the Company shall fail to perform any of its material
obligations hereunder, and if such default is not cured within ten (10)
business days after notice thereof from SUI, then SUI shall be entitled to
pursue the remedies available to SUI under 7.2 of the Omnibus Agreement.



14.2 Any default by SUI or any of the other Sun Parties under the Omnibus
Agreement shall constitute a default by SUI hereunder. In the event SUI shall
fail to perform any of its material



obligations hereunder, and if such default is not cured within ten (10)
business days after notice thereof from the Company (or the Green Entities
after the Closing), then the Company or the Green Entities, on behalf of the
Company, shall be entitled to pursue the remedies available to the Green
Entities under 7.2 of the Omnibus Agreement.



14.3 SUI and the Company acknowledge and agree that their respective remedies
for any breach or default hereunder shall be solely as provided in, and
subject to the terms and conditions of, the Omnibus Agreement.



15. LIABILITY; INDEMNIFICATION

15.1 Except as otherwise specified in this Agreement, SUI does not and shall
not assume any liability for any claims arising out of the occurrence of any
event or the existence of any condition prior to the Closing Date with respect

Closing Date, all accounts payable, obligations and liabilities of the
Company, the Holding Companies, and the Property Owners, accrued or unaccrued,

Date or arising out of events or occurrences prior to the Closing Date,
including under the Non-Assumed Project Contracts (collectively, the
"Pre‑Closing Liabilities") shall be the responsibility of, and paid by, the
Company, and not by SUI, the Holding Companies or the Property Owners.

accordance with Section 5.3 of the Omnibus Agreement.

date of this Agreement, provided that such provisions are not more than as
permitted for a corporation under Maryland Law, which provisions shall not be
amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six years from the
Effective Time in any manner that would affect adversely the rights of
individuals who were directors, officers, employees or agents of the Company
and its Subsidiaries at or prior to the Effective Time, unless such
modification shall be required by Law. From and after the Effective Time, SUI
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay and perform in a timely manner
such indemnification obligations.



23.2 In the event that the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all its properties and
assets to any Person, or if SUI dissolves the Surviving Corporation, then, and
in each such case, SUI shall cause proper provision to be made so that the
successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation assume the obligations set
forth in this Section 23.



23.3 Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any claim, action,
suit,



proceeding or investigation (whether arising before, at or after the Effective
Time) is made against any individual who is now, or who has been at any time
prior to the date hereof, or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a
director, officer, employee or agent of the Company, on or prior to the sixth
anniversary of the Effective Time, the provisions of this Section 23 shall
continue in effect until the final disposition of such claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation.



23.4 The provisions of this Section 23 are (i) intended to be for the benefit
of, and will be enforceable by, each indemnified party, his or her heirs and
his or her representatives and (ii) in addition to, and not in substitution
for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such Person
may have by contract or otherwise. SUI shall pay all expenses, including
reasonable attorneys' fees, that may be incurred by the persons referred to in
this Section 23 in connection with their successful enforcement of their
rights provided in this Section 23.



24. ASSIGNMENT.



24.1 No Party shall have the right to assign its rights or obligations under
this Agreement without the prior written consent of each other Party;
provided, however, that SUI may assign its rights and obligations hereunder to
a wholly-owned subsidiary of SUI upon notice to the Company but without the
prior written consent of the Company. No assignment or attempted assignment by
SUI shall release or otherwise impair the obligations and liabilities of SUI
or the rights and remedies of the Company hereunder.



25. CONTROLLING LAW.



25.1 This Agreement shall be controlled, construed and enforced in accordance
with the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to conflicts-of-laws
principles that would require the application of any other law; provided that
the Maryland Law shall apply with respect to matters, issues and questions
relating to the Merger.



26. ENTIRE AGREEMENT.



26.1 This Agreement (together with the Exhibits and Schedules hereto), the
Confidentiality Agreement dated May 20, 2014 between Green Courte Partners,
LLC, SUI, and certain other parties identified therein, as amended (which

the Agreement), and the Omnibus Agreement constitute the entire agreement of
the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes
all prior agreements and undertakings, both written and oral, among the
Company and SUI with respect to the subject matter hereof, including, without
limitation, that certain letter of intent dated June 13, 2014. In the event of
any conflict or inconsistency between the terms and provisions hereof, on the
one hand, and the terms and provisions of the Omnibus Agreement, on the other
hand, the terms and provisions of the Omnibus Agreement shall govern and
control. Except as noted above in this Section, there is no statement,
promise, agreement or obligation in existence which may conflict with the
terms of this Agreement or which may modify, enlarge or invalidate this
Agreement or any provision hereof. None of the prior and/or contemporaneous
negotiations, preliminary drafts, or prior versions of this Agreement leading
up to its execution



and not set forth herein shall be used by any of the parties to construe or
affect the validity of this Agreement.



27. AMENDMENTS.

be (a) any amendment of this Agreement that changes the amount or the form of
the consideration to be delivered under this Agreement to the holders of
Company Shares, or which by applicable Law requires the further approval of
the stockholders of the Company or SUI without such further approval of such
stockholders, or (b) any amendment or change not permitted under applicable
Law.



28. NOTICES.

28.1 All notices, requests, claims, demands and other communications hereunder

been duly given or made upon receipt) in accordance with the notice terms and
conditions set forth in the Omnibus Agreement.

31.1 Except as otherwise expressly provided herein or in the Omnibus
Agreement, each agreement, representation or warranty made in this Agreement

hereto or in connection herewith, shall not survive the Closing Date or the
consummation of the transactions provided for herein.



31.2 The covenants, agreements and undertakings of each of the parties hereto
are made solely for the benefit of, and may be relied on only by, the other
parties hereto, their transferees and assigns, and are not made for the
benefit of, nor may they be relied upon, by any other person whatsoever,
except (a) for the third-party beneficiaries contemplated by Section 23, and
(b) from and after the Effective Time, holders of Company Shares shall have
the right to receive the Applicable Per Share Merger Consideration pursuant to
the terms and conditions of Section 2.



31.3 This Agreement shall not be construed more strictly against one party
than against the other, merely by virtue of the fact that it may have been
prepared by counsel for one of the



parties, it being recognized that the Company and SUI have contributed
substantially and materially to the preparation of this Agreement.



32. COUNTERPARTS.



32.1 This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which

further reasonable and customary acts and things as may reasonably be
requested by another party hereto for the purpose of consummating the Merger
or otherwise accomplishing the transactions contemplated herein which, in all
events, shall not increase such party\'s liability hereunder or decrease such
party\'s rights hereunder, and all at no out-of-pocket costs to the other
party.
