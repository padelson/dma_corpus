of the Company except in the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant
to _Section_ __ _ 8_.

(d) _Termination of Offer_. In the event that this Agreement is

not acquire any Shares pursuant to the Offer. If the Offer is terminated or
withdrawn by Purchaser, Purchaser shall promptly return, and shall cause any
depository acting on behalf of Purchaser to return, in accordance
with applicable Legal Requirements, all tendered Shares to the registered
holders thereof.

(e) _Offer Documents_. As promptly as practicable on the date of
commencement of the Offer (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange
Act), Parent and Purchaser shall (i) file with the SEC a tender offer
statement on Schedule TO with respect to the Offer (together with all
amendments and supplements thereto and including exhibits thereto, the "
_Schedule TO_ ") that will contain or incorporate by reference the Offer to
Purchase and form of the related letter of transmittal and (ii) cause the
Offer to Purchase and related documents to be disseminated to holders of
Shares. Parent and Purchaser agree that they shall cause the Schedule TO and

comply in all material respects with the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder and other applicable Legal Requirements. Each of
Parent, Purchaser and the Company agrees to promptly correct any information
provided by it for use in the Offer Documents if and to the extent that such

take all steps necessary to cause the Offer Documents as so corrected to be
filed with the SEC and to be disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case
as and to the extent required by applicable federal securities laws. The
Company shall promptly furnish or otherwise make available to Parent and
Purchaser or Parents legal counsel all information concerning the Company and
the Companys stockholders that may be required in connection with any action
contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 1.1(e)_. Except from and after a Company
Adverse Change Recommendation, the Company and its counsel shall be given

irrevocably accept for payment at the Offer Acceptance Time and pay for, all
of the Shares validly tendered (and not validly withdrawn) pursuant to the
Offer as promptly as practicable after the Offer Acceptance Time (and in any
event within three business days). Without limiting the generality of
_Section_ __ _ 9.10_, Parent shall cause to be provided to Purchaser all of
the funds necessary to purchase any Shares that Purchaser becomes obligated to
purchase pursuant to the Offer, and shall cause Purchaser to perform, on a
timely basis, all of Purchasers obligations under this Agreement. Parent and
Purchaser shall, and each of Parent and Purchaser shall ensure that all of
their respective controlled Affiliates shall, tender any Shares held by them
into the Offer.

 

(g) _Adjustments_. If, between the date of this Agreement and the Offer
Acceptance Time, the outstanding Shares are changed into a different number
or class of shares by reason of any stock split, division or subdivision of
shares, stock dividend, reverse stock split, consolidation of shares,
reclassification, recapitalization or other similar transaction, then the
Offer Price shall be appropriately adjusted; _it being understood_ that
nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 1.1(g)_ shall be construed to permit the
Company to take any action that is expressly prohibited by the terms of this
Agreement.

and to the extent required by applicable federal securities laws, a Tender
Offer Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 (together with
any exhibits, amendments or supplements thereto, the " _Schedule
14D-9_") that, subject to _Section_ __ _ 6.1(b)_, shall reflect the Company
Board Recommendation. The Company agrees that it shall cause the Schedule
14D-9 to comply in all material respects with the Exchange Act and other
applicable Legal Requirements. Unless requested otherwise by the Company,
Parent shall cause the Schedule 14D-9 to be mailed or otherwise disseminated
to the holders of Shares together with the Offer Documents. Each of Parent,
Purchaser and the Company agrees to respond promptly to any comments of the
SEC or its staff and to promptly correct any information provided by it for
use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that such information shall
have become false or misleading in any material respect, and to correct any
material omissions therefrom, and the Company further agrees to take all
steps necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9 as so corrected to be filed with
the SEC and to be disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case as and to
the extent required by applicable federal securities laws.

confidence the information contained in any such labels, listings and files,

(b) Promptly after the Effective Time (but in no event later than three
business days thereafter), the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be mailed
to each Person who was, at the Effective Time, a holder of record of the
Shares entitled to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to  _Section_ __
_ 2.5_ a form of letter of transmittal (which shall be in reasonable and
customary form and shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the certificates evidencing such shares (the "
_Certificates_ ") shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates
(or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to the Paying Agent) and
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares pursuant to such letter of transmittal. Upon surrender to the
Paying Agent of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof)
or Book-Entry Shares, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed
and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such
other documents as may be reasonably required pursuant to such instructions,

evidenced by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, and such Certificates and
Book-Entry Shares shall then be canceled. No interest shall accrue or be paid

Book-Entry Shares for the benefit of the holder thereof. If the payment of any
Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose
name the surrendered Certificates formerly evidencing the Shares is
registered on the stock transfer books of the Company, it shall be a condition
of payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be endorsed properly or
otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting
such payment shall have paid all transfer and other similar Taxes required by
reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the
registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or shall have established to
the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Taxes either have
been paid or are not applicable. Payment of the applicable Merger
Consideration with respect to Book-Entry Shares shall only be made to the
Person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares are registered. Until surrendered
as contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 2.6(b)_, each Certificate and Book-
Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent
only the right to receive upon such surrender the amount of cash, without
interest, into which the Shares theretofore represented by such Certificate or
Book-Entry have been converted pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.5_.

 

(c) At any time following 12 months after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it
any funds which had been made available to the Paying Agent and not disbursed
to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares (including all interest and
other income received by the Paying Agent in respect of all funds made
available to it), and, thereafter, such holders shall be entitled to look to
the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat and other
similar Legal Requirements) only as general creditors thereof with respect to
the Merger Consideration that may be payable upon due surrender of the
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares held by them. Neither the Surviving
Corporation nor the Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder of Certificates
or Book-Entry Shares for the Merger Consideration delivered in respect of
such share to a public official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or
other similar Legal Requirements. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by such
holders at such time at which such amounts would otherwise escheat to or
become property of any Governmental Body shall become, to the extent permitted
by applicable Legal Requirements, the property of the Surviving Corporation or
its designee, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto.

transfer books of the Company with respect to the Shares shall be closed and
thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares on

the Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to
have any rights with respect to such shares except as otherwise provided
herein or by applicable Legal Requirements.

 

(e) Each of the Paying Agent, Parent, Purchaser, and the Surviving
Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any cash amounts
payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Shares or Company Options
such amounts as it is required to deduct or withhold therefrom under
applicable Legal Requirements. Any such amounts deducted or withheld
and remitted to the appropriate Governmental Body in accordance with
applicable Legal Requirements shall be treated for all purposes under this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would
otherwise have been paid.

 

(f) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate
to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation,
the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent may
direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with
respect to such Certificate (which shall not exceed the Merger Consideration
payable with respect to such Certificate), the Paying Agent will pay (less any
amounts entitled to be deducted or withheld pursuant to  _Section_ __ _
2.6(e)_), in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the
applicable Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the Shares formerly
represented by such Certificate, as contemplated by this  _Section_ __ _ 2_.

 

Section 2.7 _Dissenters_ __ _Rights_. Shares outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time, and held by holders who are entitled to demand
appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL and have properly exercised and
perfected their respective demands for appraisal of such shares in the
time and manner provided in Section 262 of the DGCL and, as of the Effective
Time, have neither effectively withdrawn nor lost their rights to such
appraisal and payment under the DGCL (the " _Dissenting Shares_ "), shall not
be converted into the right to receive Merger Consideration, but shall, by
virtue of the Merger, be entitled to only such consideration as shall be
determined pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL; _provided_ that if any such
holder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or
lost such holders right to appraisal and payment under the DGCL, such
holders Shares shall be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective
Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration (less any amounts
entitled to be deducted or withheld pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.6(e)_), and
such shares shall not be deemed to be Dissenting Shares. Within ten days after
the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall provide each of the
holders of Shares with the notice contemplated by Section 262 of the DGCL. The
Company shall give prompt written notice to Parent of any demands received by
the Company for appraisal of any Shares, and Parent shall have the right to
participate in, and direct all negotiations and Legal Proceedings with respect
to such demands. The Company shall not, without the prior written consent of
Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any
such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing. Prior

to any demands for appraisal or offer to settle or settle any such demands.

Section 2.8 _Treatment of Company Options_. 

(a) Each Company Option that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall accelerate and become fully vested and exercisable
effective immediately prior to, and contingent upon, the Effective Time. As of
the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further action on
the part of the holders thereof, Parent, Purchaser or the Company, each
Company Option that is then outstanding and unexercised as of immediately
before the Effective Time shall be cancelled and converted into the right to
receive cash in an amount equal to the product of (i) the total number
of Shares subject to such fully vested Company Option immediately prior to
the Effective Time, multiplied by (ii) the excess of (x) the Merger
Consideration over (y) the exercise price payable per Share under such Company
Option, which amount shall be paid in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.8(b)_
(the " _Option Consideration_ "). Any Company Option that has an exercise
price that equals or exceeds the Merger Consideration shall be canceled for
no consideration.

(b) On the Surviving Corporations next regularly scheduled payroll date
following the Effective Time (but no later than ten (10) business days after
the Effective Time), Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or
a Subsidiary of the Surviving Corporation to, pay through the Surviving
Corporations or the applicable Subsidiarys payroll the aggregate Option
Consideration payable with respect to Company Options held by current or
former employees of the Company (net of any withholding Taxes required to be
deducted and withheld by applicable Legal Requirements in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 2.6(e)_); _provided, however_ , that to the extent the holder
of a Company Option is not, and was not at any time during the vesting period
of the Company Option, an employee of the Company for employment tax
purposes, the Option Consideration payable pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
2.8_ with respect to such Company Option shall be deposited in the Payment
Fund and paid by the Paying Agent in the manner described in _Section_ __ _
2.6_.

Section 2.9 _Treatment of Company Warrants_. At the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any further action on the part of Parent, the
Company, the holder of any Company Warrant or any other Person, the Company
Warrants will be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
less the applicable exercise price in respect of the shares of Company Common
Stock underlying such Company Warrants, and the holders of such Company
Warrants, in lieu of Shares immediately theretofore purchasable and
receivable upon the exercise of the rights represented by the Company Warrant,
will be entitled only to receive the Merger Consideration less the applicable
exercise price in respect of each share of Company Common Stock underlying
such Company Warrants and will have no other rights pursuant to each such
holders ownership of such Company Warrants.

 Section 2.10 _Further Action_. If, at any time after the Effective Time,
any further action is reasonably determined by Parent to be necessary or
desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest the
Surviving Corporation with full right, title and possession of and to all
rights and property of Purchaser and the Company, the officers and directors
of the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall be fully authorized (in the name
of Purchaser, in the name of the Company and otherwise) to take such action.

and correct list, as of the date of this Agreement, of all Company Registered
IP, except for those Patents that are licensed by Company to Purchaser under
that certain License Agreement by and between the Company and Genzyme
Corporation, dated as of November 8, 2017 (" _Purchaser Licensed Patents_ ").
Except for the Purchaser Licensed Patents, Part 3.8(a) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule identifies (i) the name of the applicant/registrant, (ii)
the jurisdiction of application/registration, (iii) the application, Patent
or registration number and (iv) any other co-owners, for each item of Company
Registered IP. Each of the Patents and Patent applications, which are owned
or purported to be owned by the Company or one of its Subsidiaries and
included in the Company Registered IP, properly identifies by name each and
every inventor of the inventions claimed therein as determined in accordance
with applicable Legal Requirements of the United States of America and, to
the knowledge of the Company, the applicable foreign jurisdiction. All Company
Registered IP owned or purported to be owned, in whole or in part, by the
Company (the " _Owned Company Registered IP_ "), and to the knowledge of the
Company, all Company Registered IP exclusively licensed to the Company is
subsisting and, to the knowledge of the Company, valid, enforceable, and in
full force and effect. With respect to the Owned Company Registered IP other
than Purchaser Licensed Patents, all other Company Registered IP for which the
Company has responsibility for prosecution and maintenance activities, and, to
the knowledge of the Company, all other Company Registered IP, all necessary
registration, maintenance, renewal and other relevant filing fees due through
the Closing Date have been timely paid and all necessary documents and
certificates in connection therewith have been timely filed with the relevant
Patent, Trademark, Copyright, Internet domain name or other authorities in the
United States of America or to Companys knowledge, the applicable foreign
jurisdiction, as the case may be, for the purpose of maintaining such Company
Registered IP in full force and effect. As of the date of this Agreement, no
interference, opposition, reissue, reexamination or other proceeding of any
nature (other than pre-issuance patent prosecution activities being conducted
before a Governmental Body in the ordinary course of business) is pending or,
to the knowledge of the Company, threatened, in which the use, scope,
validity, enforceability or ownership of any Company Registered IP is being
or has been contested or challenged. The Company and its Subsidiaries have
complied with all Legal Requirements regarding the duty of disclosure, candor
and good faith in connection with each Patent included in the
Company Registered IP.

(b) The Company or one of its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, is the sole
and exclusive owner of all right, title and interest in and to all Company
Registered IP owned or purported to be owned by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries and all other Company IP, and possesses legally enforceable
rights, pursuant to valid written agreements, to use all other

 material Intellectual Property Rights used by or necessary for the conduct
of the business as presently conducted by the Company and its Subsidiaries, in
each case, free and clear of all Encumbrances other than Permitted
Encumbrances. The Company or one of its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, has
executed valid and enforceable written agreements with each of its former and
current directors, officers, employees, consultants and independent
contractors who were or are, as applicable, engaged in creating or developing
any material Company IP, pursuant to which each such Person has: (i) agreed to
hold all Know-How and confidential information of the Company and its
Subsidiaries in confidence both during and after such Persons employment or
retention, as applicable; and (ii) presently assigned to the Company or one of
its Subsidiaries, as applicable, all of such Persons rights, title and
interest in and to all material Intellectual Property Rights created or
developed for the Company or its Subsidiaries in the course of such Persons
employment or retention thereby. To the knowledge of the Company, no party
thereto is in default or breach of any such agreements.

(c) No funding, facilities or personnel of any Governmental Body or any
university, college, research institute or other educational institution has
been or is being used to create, in whole or in part, any material Company IP
(other than as disclosed on Part 3.8(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule),
except for any such funding or use of facilities or personnel that does not
result in such Governmental Body or institution obtaining ownership rights to
such Company IP and does not require or otherwise obligate the Company or its
Subsidiaries to grant or offer to any such Governmental Body or educational
institution any license or other right to such Company IP (except for use
rights during the term of the applicable agreement between the Company or one
of its Subsidiaries and such Governmental Body or educational institution),
including the right to receive royalties for the practice of such Company IP
(other than pursuant to any In-bound License disclosed on Part 3.8(d) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule). No current or former employee, consultant or
independent contractor of the Company who contributed to the creation or
development of any material Company IP has, to the knowledge of the Company,
performed services for a Governmental Body or any university, college,
research institute or other educational institution related to the Companys
or its Subsidiaries business as presently conducted during a period of time
during which such employee, consultant or independent contractor was also
performing services for the Company or its Subsidiaries.

 

(d) Part 3.8(d) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth each
agreement pursuant to which the Company or one of its Subsidiaries (i) is
granted a license or is assigned, granted, or provided or otherwise receives
or is conveyed any right (including a right to receive a license or be free
from suit), under any Intellectual Property Right owned by any third party
that is used by and material to the Company or its Subsidiaries in its or
their business as currently conducted, other than (A) any material transfer
agreements, clinical trial agreements, nondisclosure agreements,
services agreements, commercially available Software-as-a-Service offerings
or off-the-shelf software licenses, in each case, with an annual cost of no

respect to any Intellectual Property Rights material to and either owned by
or exclusively licensed to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and (B) any
such agreements where the only Intellectual Property Rights granted to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries are non-exclusive rights granted solely
for the purpose of enabling Companys use or exploitation of the services or
deliverables provided to Company pursuant to such agreements, (each
such agreement covered

 by subclause (i), an " _In-bound License_"), or (ii) grants to any third
party a license or assigns, grants, or otherwise provides or conveys any
right (including a right to receive a license or be free from a suit) under
any material Company IP or material Intellectual Property Right licensed to
the Company under an In-bound License, other than (A) any material transfer
agreements, clinical trial agreements, nondisclosure agreements or services
agreements or non-exclusive outbound licenses entered into in the ordinary
course of business, in each case, which do not transfer ownership of
Intellectual Property Rights from the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
grant rights or impose restrictions or non-asserts with respect to
any Intellectual Property Rights owned by or exclusively licensed to the
Company or any of Subsidiaries (except for non-exclusive rights granted solely
for the purpose of providing services or conducting activities within the
scope of such agreements), in each case, with an annual cost of no more than
$250,000 and which do not transfer ownership of Intellectual Property Rights
from the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or grant rights or
impose restrictions or non-asserts with respect to any Intellectual Property
Rights owned by or exclusively licensed to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, or (B) any such agreement granting non-exclusive rights granted
solely for the purpose of providing services or conducting activities within
the scope of such agreements (each such agreement covered by subclause (ii),
an " _Out-bound License_").

(e) To the knowledge of the Company: (i) the operation of the business of
the Company and its Subsidiaries as currently conducted has not infringed any
valid and enforceable Intellectual Property Rights of any Person, or
misappropriated or otherwise violated any Intellectual Property Rights owned
by any Person, and is not infringing any valid and enforceable Intellectual
Property Rights of any Person, or misappropriating or otherwise violating any
Intellectual Property Rights owned by any other Person; and (ii) no Person
has infringed, misappropriated, or otherwise violated, or is infringing,
misappropriating or otherwise violating any Company IP or any Intellectual
Property Rights exclusively licensed to the Company or its Subsidiaries. As of
the date of this Agreement, no Legal Proceeding is pending (or, to the
knowledge of the Company, is threatened) (A) against the Company or its
Subsidiaries alleging that the operation of the businesses of the Company and
its Subsidiaries infringes or constitutes the misappropriation or other
violation of any Intellectual Property Rights of another Person (B) by the
Company or its Subsidiaries that another Person has infringed, misappropriated
or otherwise violated or is infringing, misappropriating or otherwise
violating any Company IP or any Intellectual Property Rights exclusively
licensed to the Company or its Subsidiaries. Since January 1, 2014 and, to the
knowledge of the Company, prior to such date, neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries has received any written notice or other written
communication alleging that the operation of the business of the Company and
its Subsidiaries has infringed, misappropriated or otherwise violated or is
infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating any Intellectual Property
Right of another Person.

(f) The Company and its Subsidiaries have taken reasonable security and
other measures, including measures against unauthorized disclosure, to protect
and maintain the secrecy, confidentiality, and value of the Know-How and
other confidential information included in the Company IP. No trade secret,
Know-How, or proprietary information material to the business of the Company
and its Subsidiaries as presently conducted has been authorized to be
disclosed or, to the knowledge of the Company, has been actually disclosed by
the Company to any Person other than pursuant to a non-disclosure agreement or
other agreement adequately restricting the disclosure and use of such
Intellectual Property Rights or information, and excluding any know-how or
proprietary information disclosed by the Company in publications or public
filings, including as required under applicable securities laws.

License, (ii) result in or require the grant, assignment or transfer to any
other Person of any license or other right or interest under, to or in any of
the Company IP or Intellectual Property Rights exclusively licensed to the

impairment of any Company IP or Intellectual Property Rights exclusively
licensed to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

service with the Company (and its predecessors) prior to the Closing Date,
_provided_ that the foregoing shall not result in the duplication of
benefits under any such employee benefit plans and arrangements.

applicable to the Continuing Employees, to the extent that such conditions,
exclusions and waiting periods would not apply under a similar employee

welfare benefit plan shall, for purposes of eligibility, vesting,
deductibles, co-payments and out-of-pocket maximums and allowances, credit
Continuing Employees for service and amounts paid prior to the Effective Time

request for such advance, subject to the execution by such Indemnified
Persons of appropriate undertakings in favor of the Indemnifying Parties to

contract or otherwise. Unless required by applicable Legal Requirement, this

_Section_ __ _ 8.2_, _Section_ __ _ 8.3_ and _Section_ __ _ 9_ shall
survive the termination of this Agreement and shall remain in full force and
effect, (b) the Confidentiality Agreement shall survive the termination of

Agreement shall not relieve any Party from any liability for common law fraud
or Willful Breach (including, in the case by Parent or Purchaser, damages
based on the consideration payable to the equityholders of the Company

(a) Except as set forth in this  _Section_ __ _ 8.3_, all fees and

be paid by the Party incurring such expenses, whether or not the Offer and
Merger are consummated.

 

(b) In the event that:

 

(i) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to _Section_ __ _
8.1(e)_; 

(ii) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section_ __ _
8.1(c)_; or

(iii) (A) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.1(d)_
(but in the case of a termination by the Company, only if at such time Parent
would not be prohibited from terminating this Agreement pursuant to the
proviso to _Section_ __ _ 8.1(d)_) or _Section_ __ _ 8.1(f)_, (B) any
Person shall have publicly disclosed a _bona fide_ Acquisition Proposal after
the date hereof and shall not have publicly withdrawn such Acquisition
Proposal prior to (1) in the case of this Agreement being subsequently
terminated pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.1(d)_, the date that is four
business days prior to the Expiration Date or (2) in the case of this
Agreement being subsequently terminated pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.1(f)_,
the time of the breach or failure to perform giving rise to such termination
and (C) within twelve (12) months of such termination the Company shall have
consummated an Acquisition Proposal or entered into a definitive agreement
with respect to an Acquisition Proposal ( _provided_ that for purposes of
this _clause_ _(C)_ the references to "20% or more" in the definition of "
_Acquisition Proposal_ " shall be deemed to be references to "more than
50%");

then, in any such event under _clause_ " _(i)_ ", " _(ii)_ " or " _(iii)_ "
of this Section 8.3(b), the Company shall pay to Parent or its designee the
Termination Fee by wire transfer of same day funds (x) in the case of
_Section_ __ _ 8.3(b)(i)_, on the date that the Specified Agreement

case of _Section_ __ _ 8.3(b)(iii)_, within two business days after the
entering into the definitive agreement with respect to the Acquisition
Proposal referred to in _subclause_ _(iii)_ _(C)_ above; _it being
understood _ that in no event shall the Company be required to pay the
Termination Fee on more than one occasion. As used herein, " _Termination Fee_
" shall mean a cash amount equal to $128,828,000. Except in the case of common
law fraud or Willful Breach, in the event that Parent or its designee shall
receive full payment pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 8.3(b)_, the receipt of
the Termination Fee shall be deemed to be liquidated damages for any and all
losses or damages suffered or incurred by Parent, Purchaser, any of their
respective Affiliates or any other Person in connection with this Agreement
(and the termination hereof), the Transactions (and the abandonment thereof)
or any matter forming the basis for such termination, and none of Parent,
Purchaser, any of their respective Affiliates (collectively, " _Parent Related
Parties_ ") or any other Person shall be entitled to bring or maintain any
claim, action or proceeding against the Company or any of its Affiliates
arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, any of the Transactions
or any matters forming the basis for such termination (other than in the case
of

 common law fraud or Willful Breach); _provided, however,_ that Parent may
seek specific performance to cause the Company to consummate the Transactions
in accordance with Section 9.5(b), but in no event shall Parent be entitled
to both specific performance and the payment of the Termination Fee. Any
Termination Fee paid to Parent pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 8.3(b)_ will
be offset against any award for damages given in any final and non-appealable
judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction to Parent pursuant to any claim
based upon common law fraud or Willful Breach.

 

(c) Parents right to receive payment from the Company of the Termination
Fee pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 8.3(b)_ and any payments pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 8.3(d)_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Parent
Related Parties against the Company and any of their respective former,
current or future officers, directors, partners, stockholders, optionholders,
managers, members or Affiliates (collectively, " _Company Related Parties_ ")
for any loss suffered as a result of the failure of the Offer or the Merger to
be consummated or for a breach or failure to perform hereunder or otherwise,
and upon payment of such amount(s), none of the Company Related Parties shall
have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this
Agreement or the Transactions.

(d) The Parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this 
_Section_ __ _ 8.3_ are an integral part of the Transactions and that,
without these agreements, the Parties would not enter into this Agreement;
accordingly, if the Company fails to timely pay any amount due pursuant to
this  _Section_ __ _ 8.3_, and, in order to obtain the payment, Parent
commences a Legal Proceeding which results in a judgment against the Company,
the Company shall pay Parent its reasonable and documented costs and expenses
(including reasonable and documented attorneys fees) in connection with such
suit, together with interest on such amount at the prime rate as published in
the Wall Street Journal in effect on the date such payment was required to be
made through the date such payment was actually received.

Section 9.3 _No Survival of Representations and Warranties_. None of the
representations and warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement, the
Company Disclosure Schedule or in any certificate or schedule or other
document delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall survive the Merger,
except for those covenants that by their terms survive the Effective Time,
this _Section_ __ _ 9_ and the any applicable defined terms in _Exhibit A_
shall survive the Effective Time.

 

Section 9.4 _Entire Agreement; Counterparts_. This Agreement and the
other agreements, exhibits, annexes and schedules referred to herein
constitute the entire agreement and supersede all prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, among or between any of the Parties,
with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof; _provided, however,_
that the Confidentiality Agreement shall not be superseded and shall remain in
full force and effect; _provided, further, that,_ if the Effective Time
occurs, the Confidentiality Agreement shall automatically terminate and be of
no further force and effect. This Agreement may be executed in several
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original and all of which shall
constitute one and the same instrument. The exchange of a fully executed
Agreement (in counterparts or otherwise) by PDF shall be sufficient to bind
the Parties to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

 

Section 9.5 _Applicable Legal Requirements; Jurisdiction; Specific
Performance; Remedies_.

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with,
the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to any laws, rules
or provisions that would cause the application of the laws of any jurisdiction
other than the State of Delaware. Subject to _Section_ __ _ 9.5(c)_, in any
action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any of
the Transactions: (i) each of the Parties irrevocably and unconditionally
consents and submits to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the Chancery
Court of the State of Delaware and any state appellate court therefrom or, if
such court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, the United States District Court
sitting in New Castle County in the State of Delaware ( _it being agreed_ that
the consents to jurisdiction and venue set forth in this _Section_ __ _
9.5(a)_ shall not constitute general consents to service of process in the
State of Delaware and shall have no effect for any purpose except as provided
in this paragraph and shall not be deemed to confer rights on any Person
other than the Parties hereto); and (ii) each of the Parties irrevocably
consents to service of process by first class certified mail, return receipt
requested, postage prepaid, to the address at which such Party is to receive
notice in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 9.8_. The Parties hereto agree that
a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may
be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other
manner provided by applicable Legal Requirements; _provided, however,_ that
nothing in the foregoing shall restrict any Partys rights to seek any post-
judgment relief regarding, or any appeal from, such final trial court
judgment. 

(b) The Parties agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages,
even if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event
that the Parties hereto do not perform their obligations under the provisions
of this Agreement in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach
such provisions. Subject to the following sentence, the Parties acknowledge
and agree that (i) the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or

 



58

   ##### Table of Contents

   

 

 injunctions, specific performance, or other non-monetary equitable relief,
to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms
and provisions hereof in the courts described in _Section_ __ _ 9.5(a)_
without proof of damages or otherwise, this being in addition to any other
remedy to which they are entitled under this Agreement, (ii) the provisions
set forth in _Section_ __ _ 8.3_: (x) are not intended to and do not
adequately compensate for the harm that would result from a breach of this
Agreement; and (y) shall not be construed to diminish or otherwise impair in
any respect any Partys right to specific performance except if Parent has
been paid the Termination Fee, and (iii) the right of specific performance is
an integral part of the Transactions and without that right, neither the
Company nor Parent would have entered into this Agreement. Except if the
Termination Fee has been paid pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.3_, each of the
Parties hereto agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction,
specific performance and other equitable relief on the basis that the other
Parties hereto have an adequate remedy at law or an award of specific
performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity. The
Parties hereto acknowledge and agree that any Party seeking an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement in accordance with this _Section_
__ _ 9.5(b)_ shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in
connection with any such order or injunction.

(c) EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO
TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING BETWEEN THE PARTIES HERETO ARISING OUT
OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

 

Section 9.6 _Assignability_. This Agreement shall be binding upon, and
shall be enforceable by and inure solely to the benefit of, the Parties
hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns; _provided,
however,_ that neither this Agreement nor any of the rights hereunder may be
assigned without the prior written consent of the other Parties hereto, and
any attempted assignment of this Agreement or any of such rights without such
consent shall be void and of no effect; _provided, further, however,_ that
Parent or Purchaser may assign this Agreement to any of their Affiliates (
_provided_ that such assignment shall not impede or delay the consummation of
the Transactions or otherwise impede the rights of the stockholders of the
Company under this Agreement); _provided_ that no such assignment or pledge
permitted pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 9.6_ __ shall relieve Parent of its
obligations hereunder.

 

Section 9.7 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Nothing in this Agreement,
express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any Person (other
than the Parties hereto) any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever
under or by reason of this Agreement; except for: (i) if the Offer Acceptance
Time occurs (A) the right of the Companys stockholders to receive the Offer
Price or Merger Consideration, as applicable and (B) the right of the holders

Section 9.9 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement that
is invalid or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions of
this Agreement or the validity or enforceability of the offending term or
provision in any other situation or in any other jurisdiction. If a final
judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction declares that any term or
provision of this Agreement is

 invalid or unenforceable, the Parties hereto agree that the court making
such determination shall have the power to limit such term or provision, to
delete specific words or phrases or to replace such term or provision with a
term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to
expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision,
and this Agreement shall be valid and enforceable as so modified. In the
event such court does not exercise the power granted to it in the prior
sentence, the Parties hereto agree to replace such invalid or unenforceable
term or provision with a valid and enforceable term or provision that will
achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of
such invalid or unenforceable term or provision.

 

Section 9.10 _Obligation of Parent_. Parent shall ensure that each of
its Subsidiaries duly performs, satisfies and discharges on a timely basis
each of the covenants, obligations and liabilities applicable to its
Subsidiaries under this Agreement, and Parent, as applicable, shall be jointly
and severally liable with its Subsidiaries for the due and timely performance

 Section 9.11 _Transfer Taxes_. Except as expressly provided in _Section_
__ _ 2.6(b)_, all transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration,
value-added and other similar Taxes and fees incurred in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by Parent and
Purchaser when due.

 Section 9.12 _Company Disclosure Schedule_. The disclosures set forth in
any particular part or subpart of the Company Disclosure Schedule will be
deemed to be an exception to (or, as applicable, a disclosure for purposes
of) (a) the representations and warranties or covenants of the Company that
are set forth in the corresponding section or subsection of this Agreement;
and (b) any other representations and warranties or covenants of the
Company that are set forth in this Agreement, but in the case of this clause
(b) only if the relevance of that disclosure as an exception to (or a
disclosure for purposes of) such other representations and warranties or
covenants is readily apparent on the face of such disclosure. The mere
inclusion of an item in the Company Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a
representation or warranty or covenant shall not be deemed an admission that
such item represents a material exception or material fact, event or
circumstance or that such item is material or constitutes a Material Adverse
Effect, and no reference to, or disclosure of, any item or other matter in the
Company Disclosure Schedule shall necessarily imply that any other
undisclosed matter or item having a greater value or significance is
material.

 

Section 9.13 _Construction_.

 

(a) For purposes of this Agreement, whenever the context requires: the
singular number shall include the plural, and vice versa; the masculine
gender shall include the feminine and neuter genders; the feminine gender
shall include the masculine and neuter genders; and the neuter gender shall
include masculine and feminine genders.
