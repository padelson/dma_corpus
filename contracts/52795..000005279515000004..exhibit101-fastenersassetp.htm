 ARTICLE 3

PURCHASE PRICE AND CLOSING OF PURCHASE

3.1 Purchase Price. The aggregate purchase price for the sale and purchase of
the Acquired Assets shall be the following, plus the assumption of the Assumed
Liabilities:

(a) $370,000,000 (the "Preliminary Purchase Price"), as such may be adjusted
pursuant to Section 3.2; and

(b) $10,000,000 (the "IT Payment").

The Preliminary Purchase Price, as adjusted pursuant to Section 3.2, shall be
payable in immediately available funds on the Closing Date to the account or
accounts designated by the Seller not later than three Business Days prior to
the Closing Date. The IT Payment shall be payable in immediately available
funds on the Data Center Acceptance Date to the account or accounts designated
by the Seller not less than three Business Days prior to the Data Center
Acceptance Date. The Preliminary Purchase Price, as adjusted pursuant to
Section 3.2 and Section 3.3, plus the IT Payment are collectively referred to
herein as the "Final Purchase Price." Notwithstanding the foregoing, any
payments to be made hereunder to a Selling Affiliate organized in the United
Kingdom, any member state of the European Union or Mexico will be denominated
in the local currency of such Selling Affiliate, based on the most favorable
exchange rates reasonably commercially available to the Buyer on the fourth
(4th) Business Day before the Closing Date or the Data Center Acceptance Date,
as applicable. Upon six (6) Business Days' prior notice, the Seller may
request that all or a portion of the payments to be made hereunder to a
Selling Affiliate organized in any other jurisdiction (other than the United
States) on the Closing Date or the Data Center Acceptance Date be denominated
in the local currency of such Selling Affiliate, based on the most favorable
exchange rates reasonably commercially available to the Buyer on the fourth
(4th) Business Day before the Closing Date or the Data Center Acceptance Date,
as applicable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the maximum amount of the
Preliminary Purchase Price and the IT Payment required to be denominated in
currency other than Dollars shall not exceed the Commitment Amount, as such
term is defined in the Equity Commitment Letter. The Seller shall reimburse
the Buyer for reasonably documented costs incurred by the Buyer in obtaining
such local currency.

3.2 Closing Adjustment.

(a) No later than three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the
Seller shall prepare and deliver to the Buyer a statement (the "Estimated
Closing Statement") calculating and setting forth the Seller's good faith
estimate of the Adjustment Value (the "Estimated Adjustment Value") determined
as of the Accounting Month End of the month immediately preceding the Closing
Date (the "Prior Month"), or, if the Closing Date is less than ten (10) days
after the Accounting Month End of the Prior Month, the Accounting Month End of
the month immediately preceding the Prior Month, which statement shall include
a worksheet setting forth in reasonable detail how such value was calculated.
The Estimated Closing Statement shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP and
consistent with Schedule 1.1(a) and the Agreed Valuation Principles.

 (b) The "Closing Adjustment" shall be an amount equal to (i) the Estimated
Adjustment Value minus (ii) $290,000,000. If the Closing Adjustment is a
positive amount, then the Preliminary Purchase Price will be increased, on a
dollar-for-dollar basis, by an amount equal to the Closing Adjustment. If the
Closing Adjustment is a negative amount, then the Preliminary Purchase Price
will be decreased, on a dollar-for-dollar basis, by an amount equal to the
Closing Adjustment. If the Closing Adjustment is zero, there will be no
adjustment to the Preliminary Purchase Price with respect to the Closing
Adjustment.

3.3 Post-Closing Adjustment.

(a) Within ninety (90) days following the Closing Date or, if later, 30 days
after the Deferred French Closing Date, the Buyer shall prepare and deliver to
the Seller a statement (the "Initial Statement") calculating and setting forth
the actual Adjustment Value on the Closing Date (the "Closing Adjustment
Value"), which statement shall include a worksheet setting forth in reasonable
detail how such value and payment were calculated. The Initial Statement shall
be prepared in accordance with GAAP and consistent with Schedule 1.1(a) and
the Agreed Valuation Principles.

(b) The Closing Adjustment Value shall become final and binding upon the
Parties thirty (30) days after the receipt by the Seller of the Initial
Statement unless (i) the Seller concludes that the Closing Adjustment Value or
any component thereof has not been prepared on the basis required by this
Agreement, and (ii) the Seller has promptly, but in no event later than thirty
(30) days after its receipt of the Initial Statement (the "Review Period"),
delivered to the Buyer written notice describing in reasonable detail the
basis of the Seller's disagreement, the amount or amounts involved and the
proposed determination of the disputed amount or amounts (a "Dispute Notice").
If the Seller delivers a Dispute Notice to the Buyer within the Review Period,
the Buyer and the Seller will use reasonable good faith efforts to resolve the
dispute during the 30-day period commencing on the date the Seller delivers
the Dispute Notice to the Buyer. If the Seller and the Buyer are not able to
resolve all disputed items within such 30-day period, then the items remaining
in dispute shall be submitted immediately to Grant Thornton LLP or, if Grant
Thornton LLP is unwilling or unable to serve, an independent nationally
recognized firm with no existing business relationship with any Party mutually
agreeable to the Seller and the Buyer (the "Accounting Firm"). The Accounting
Firm shall be given reasonable access to all relevant records of the Buyer and
the Selling Group to resolve any items that are disputed and to calculate the
Adjustment Value in connection with the resolution of such disputed items. If
any remaining issues in dispute are submitted to the Accounting Firm for
resolution, each of the Seller and the Buyer will be afforded an opportunity
to present to the Accounting Firm any material relating to the determination
of the matters in dispute and to discuss such matters with the Accounting
Firm. The Accounting Firm shall act as an expert and not as an arbitrator to
determine, based solely on the written submissions of the Seller, on the one
hand, and the Buyer, on the other, and not by independent investigation, the
amount or amounts in dispute, and shall be instructed that its determination
(x) must be made in accordance with the Agreed Valuation Principles and (y)
with respect to the total amount in dispute, must accept the amount proposed
by

 either the Seller in the Dispute Notice or the Buyer in the Initial Statement.
The Accounting Firm shall submit such calculation to the Buyer and the Seller
as soon as practicable, but in any event within thirty (30) days after the
remaining issues in dispute are submitted to the Accounting Firm. The
determination by the Accounting Firm of the Final Adjustment Value, as set
forth in a written notice delivered to the Seller and the Buyer by the
Accounting Firm in accordance with this Agreement absent manifest error will
be binding and conclusive on the Seller and the Buyer. The Adjustment Value on
the Closing Date that is final and binding on the Seller and the Buyer, as
determined either through agreement of the Seller and the Buyer (deemed or
otherwise) or pursuant to this Section 3.3, are referred to herein as the
"Final Adjustment Value."

(c) The fees, costs and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be borne by (i)
the Buyer if the Accounting Firm selects the Seller's position as to the
amount in dispute or (ii) the Seller if the Accounting Firm selects the
Buyer's position as to the amount in dispute. To the extent that payment of
the Accounting Firm's fees, costs and expenses in advance of the resolution of
the applicable dispute is required by the Accounting Firm, the Buyer and the
Seller shall bear such fees, costs and expenses equally; provided, however,
that following the resolution the Parties shall make any payments between them
that are necessary to ensure that the fees, costs and expenses are borne in
accordance with the first sentence of this Section 3.3(c).

(d) The Buyer shall, and shall cause each of its Buying Affiliates to, make
its financial records available to the Seller and its accountants and other
representatives, and the Seller shall, and shall cause each of its Selling
Affiliates to, make its financial records available to the Buyer and its
accountants and other representatives, in each case, as reasonably necessary
for the Buyer and the Seller, as applicable, to perform their respective
obligations under this Section 3.3 and at reasonable times during the period
beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the date of the final
determination of the Final Adjustment Value pursuant to Section 3.3(b),
subject to customary indemnification and other agreements that may be
requested by representatives of the Parties.

(e) The "Post-Closing Adjustment" shall be an amount equal to the Final
Adjustment Value minus the Closing Adjustment Value. If the Post-Closing
Adjustment is a positive amount, then the Buyer shall pay in cash to the
Seller the amount of the Post-Closing Adjustment to an account or accounts
designated by the Seller in writing by wire transfer of immediately available
funds within three Business Days after the Final Adjustment Value becomes
such. If the Post-Closing Adjustment is a negative amount, then the Seller
shall pay in cash to the Buyer the amount of the Post-Closing Adjustment to an
account or accounts designated by the Buyer in writing by wire transfer of
immediately available funds within three Business Days after the Final
Adjustment Value becomes such. Any such payment shall be treated as an
adjustment to the purchase price paid for the Acquired Assets for all Tax
purposes, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable Law. If the Post-
Closing Adjustment is zero, no amount shall be paid by either Party to the
other Party pursuant to this Section 3.3(e).

 3.4 Withholding. The Buyer shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
amount payable under this Agreement or any other Transaction Document any such
amount as the Buyer determines in good faith that it is required to deduct and
withhold with respect to such payment under the Code or any provision of
applicable Law; provided, however that the Buyer shall give the Seller written
notice at least seven Business Days prior to any such withholding. The Buyer
and the Seller agree to cooperate and use commercially reasonable efforts to
minimize any anticipated withholding Tax imposed in connection with the
Transactions. To the extent that any amounts are so withheld, such withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid pursuant to this Agreement, and the Buyer shall timely remit such amounts
to the appropriate Governmental Authority. Any such withheld amounts that
would have otherwise been payable to the Seller or another Person under this
Agreement, shall be treated as having been paid to the Seller or such other
Person for all purposes of this Agreement.

3.5 Date of Closing.

(a) The closing (the "Closing") of the transactions described in Article 2
(other than the transaction in respect of which the IT Payment shall be paid)
shall take place as soon as practicable on the first Friday that is at least
three (3) Business Days after the date on which all conditions to Closing
(other than those conditions that, by their nature, are intended to be
satisfied at Closing, which conditions are capable of being satisfied at the
Closing) as set forth in Article 8 and Article 9 are satisfied (or waived, as
permitted by applicable Law, by the applicable Party or Parties entitled to
such satisfaction), or on such other date as the Buyer and the Seller may
agree in writing (the "Closing Date") ; provided, however, that if the
Marketing Period has not ended at the time of satisfaction or waiver of all
the conditions to Closing (other than those conditions that, by their nature,
are intended to be satisfied at Closing) as set forth in Article 8 and Article
9, the Closing shall occur on the first Friday that is at least three (3)
Business Days following the final day of the Marketing Period (so long as all
conditions to Closing (other than those conditions that, by their nature, are
intended to be satisfied at Closing, which conditions are capable of being
satisfied at the Closing) as set forth in Article 8 and Article 9 are
satisfied (or waived, as permitted by applicable Law, by the applicable Party
or Parties entitled to such satisfaction) as of the date determined pursuant
to this proviso). The Closing shall be effective as of 11:59 p.m. local time
in Chicago, Illinois on the Closing Date. For purposes of this Agreement, the
"Marketing Period" means the first period of fifteen (15) consecutive Business
Days after the date of this Agreement and following the receipt by the Buyer
of the information described in clauses (i), (ii) (for the fiscal quarter
ended March 31, 2015), (iii) and (iv) of Section 6.8(c); provided that July
3rd and July 6th shall not be considered Business Days.

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if
any notification, consultation or negotiation with the works council, union,
labor board or similar Government Authority concerning the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement that is required in France has not been
completed at the time of the Closing, then the Parties shall defer the Closing
solely with respect to the French Assets to be sold, delivered or conveyed by
the French Selling Affiliate

 (the "Deferred French Closing"). In such event, (a) the legal interest in and
to the French Assets shall not be assigned, transferred or conveyed to the
Buyer or the applicable Buying Affiliate unless and until the Deferred French
Closing occurs, (b) subject to Section 6.4, the Parties shall use their
commercially reasonable efforts to complete such notification, consultation or
negotiation as soon as practicable and (c) subject to Section 6.4, the Parties
shall cooperate in a mutually agreeable arrangement under which the Buyer (or
one or more Buying Affiliates) would, to the extent permitted by and in
compliance with applicable Law, obtain the benefits and assume the obligations
and bear the economic burdens associated with the French Assets in accordance
with this Agreement. The Deferred French Closing shall occur no later than
three Business Days following completion of such notification, consultation or
negotiation, or at such other time as the Parties may mutually agree upon in
writing (the "Deferred French Closing Date").

(ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if
the Parties determine to enter into a Local Market Agreement at the Closing
with respect to a Subject Jurisdiction, then the Parties shall defer the
Closing solely with respect to the Acquired Assets to be sold, delivered or
conveyed, and the Business Employees to be transferred, by the applicable
Subject Selling Affiliate (the "Deferred Local Market Closing"); provided,
however, that if the Buyer elects to terminate the Business conducted in a
Probationary Jurisdiction in accordance with the applicable Local Market
Agreement, there will be no Deferred Local Market Closing and the Business in
such Probationary Jurisdiction will be liquidated and wound up in accordance
with, and subject to the terms and conditions of, such Local Market Agreement
(including that the Buyer shall pay all costs in connection with such
liquidation and wind-up). If the Parties enter into a Local Market Agreement
with respect to a Subject Jurisdiction, the legal interest in and to the
Acquired Assets subject to such Local Market Agreement shall not be assigned,
transferred or conveyed to the Buyer or the applicable Buying Affiliate unless
and until the Deferred Local Market Closing occurs. If occurring, the Deferred
Local Market Closing with respect to any Subject Jurisdiction shall occur as
contemplated in the applicable Local Market Agreement in accordance with its
terms (the "Deferred Local Market Closing Date").

(b) The closing of the transactions in respect of which the IT Payment shall
be paid shall take place on the Data Center Acceptance Date (which shall be a
Business Day).

3.6 Place of Closing. The Closing, the Deferred French Closing, if applicable,
and each Deferred Local Market Closing, if applicable, shall take place at the
Chicago office of Sidley Austin LLP, or such other location (and via any such
medium) as the Parties otherwise agree.

3.7 Closing Deliveries. At the Closing, (a) the Seller shall make the
deliveries referred to in Article 8 and (b) the Buyer shall make the
deliveries referred to in Article 9.

3.8 Treatment of VAT.

 (a) The Preliminary Purchase Price and the Final Purchase Price and any other
consideration payable for any supply made (or deemed to be made) under (or in
connection with) this Agreement shall be exclusive of any VAT. The Seller and
the Buyer shall procure that any of their respective Affiliates receiving the
supply (or deemed supply) in question (the "Recipient") shall pay to the
Person making (or deemed to make) that supply (the "Supplier"), in addition to
the consideration or deemed consideration (if any) therefor, all VAT for which
the Supplier is liable, or is otherwise required by any Taxing Authority to
charge, in relation to that supply (or deemed supply). All VAT payable under
this Agreement, if any, shall be paid to the relevant Supplier at least two
Business Days before such Supplier has to account for such VAT to the relevant
Taxing Authority, provided that the relevant Supplier shall have previously
provided a valid VAT invoice to the relevant Recipient in respect of such
supply (or deemed supply).

(b) The Parties agree to use all reasonable efforts to enter into any
appropriate VAT elections (or take such other steps as may be reasonably
required) to minimize or prevent the application of VAT to the sale of the
Acquired Assets.

(c) As soon as reasonably practicable after the date hereof, the Seller and/or
the relevant Supplier shall write to the relevant Taxing Authority providing
full disclosure of the sale of the Acquired Assets and seeking confirmation
that such sale will be treated as not being subject to VAT.

(d) With respect to Sections 3.8(b) and 3.8(c), neither the Seller nor any
Supplier shall be required to make any appeal to any Governmental Authority

of value added Tax (EC Directive 2006/112); (ii) any Goods and Services Tax
and Harmonized Sales Tax imposed in compliance with the Excise Tax Act

 ARTICLE 4

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE SELLER

Except for the exceptions and disclosures set forth on the Disclosure
Schedules attached hereto (the "Disclosure Schedules"), which exceptions and
disclosures shall be deemed to be part of the representations and warranties
made hereunder (provided, however, that, any information provided in any
Schedule of the Disclosure Schedules is considered disclosed in each and every
other Schedule in the Disclosure Schedules, but only to the extent that the
applicability of such information to such other Schedule(s) in the Disclosure
Schedules is reasonably apparent based on the plain text of such disclosure),
the Seller, with respect to itself and the Selling Affiliates, represents and
warrants to the Buyer as follows:

4.1 Right; Power; Authority; Action. Each member of the Selling Group has the
requisite right, power and authority, and has taken all action necessary, to
execute, deliver and exercise its rights and perform its obligations under
this Agreement and each Transaction Document to which it is a party and to
consummate the Transactions. The governing bodies of each member of the
Selling Group have, as required, approved this Agreement and the Transactions,
and no consent is required to be obtained by the Selling Group in connection
with the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the Transaction Documents
or the performance of their obligations hereunder and thereunder. Each member
of the Selling Group is duly organized and validly existing and in good
standing as an entity under the laws of the jurisdiction in which it was
organized (to the extent good standing or an analogous concept is applicable
in such jurisdiction) and has the requisite power and authority to own, lease
or otherwise hold the Acquired Assets owned, leased or otherwise held by it,
except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.
Each member of the Selling Group is duly qualified or licensed to do business
as a foreign entity in each jurisdiction in which its ownership of assets or
conduct of business makes such qualification necessary, except in any such
jurisdictions where the failure to be duly qualified or licensed would not,
individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect.

4.2 Binding Agreements; Due Execution. This Agreement and each Transaction
Document has been duly executed and delivered by each member of the Selling
Group party thereto, and assuming that this Agreement and each Transaction
Document has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by each other party
hereto and thereto, is a legal, valid and binding obligation of such member of
the Selling Group to the extent a party thereto and enforceable against such
member of the Selling Group in accordance with its terms, except to the extent
that enforcement may be affected by Laws relating to bankruptcy,
reorganization, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, moratorium and other Laws
affecting creditors' rights generally and by general principles of equity
(regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in
equity or at law). The other instruments, documents and agreements
contemplated hereby and the Exhibits hereto to which a member of the Selling
Group is a signatory have been duly authorized, executed and delivered by such
member of the Selling Group and constitute legal, valid and binding
obligations of such member of the Selling Group enforceable in accordance with
their respective terms, in each case assuming the due authorization, execution
and delivery by the counterparties thereto, except to the extent that
enforcement may be affected by Laws relating to bankruptcy, reorganization,
insolvency,

 fraudulent conveyance, moratorium and other Laws affecting creditors' rights
generally and by general principles of equity (regardless of whether such
enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).

4.3 No Conflict. The execution and delivery of, and the performance by each
member of the Selling Group of its obligations under, this Agreement and the
Transaction Documents to which such member of the Selling Group is a party do
not, and the performance by such member of the Selling Group of the
Transactions to be performed by it does not:

(a) conflict with the charter or other equivalent organizational documents of
such member of the Selling Group;

(b) conflict with, or result in any violation of, or constitute a default
(with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) under any Material Contract
or Acquired Lease to which such member of the Selling Group is a party or by
which any of the Acquired Assets is bound;

(c) result in a breach of any Order to which such member of the Selling Group
is a party or by which such member of the Selling Group (or such member of the
Selling Group's property) is bound or submits;

(d) result in the creation of an Encumbrance upon any of the Acquired Assets;
or

(e) other than those consents, approvals or notices contemplated by the HSR
Act or any other applicable competition, merger control, antitrust or similar
Law or regulation or such approvals or registrations required in connection
with the Transactions under the relevant Laws of any jurisdiction, require
such member of the Selling Group to obtain any consent or approval of, or give
any notice to or make any registration with, any third Person under a Material
Contract, Acquired Lease or Governmental Authority that has not been obtained
or made as of the date hereof;

except in the cases of clauses (b) through (e) any conflict, violation,
default, breach, Encumbrance or failure to obtain or make a consent, approval
or notice, as applicable, as would not reasonably be expected to be material
to the Business or the Acquired Assets, taken as a whole.

4.4 Financial Statements. Attached hereto as Schedule 4.4 are the audited,
combined balance sheets of the Selling Group with respect to the Business and

would result in an Encumbrance (other than for Taxes not yet due and payable)

the Business in substantially the same manner in which it is presently being
conducted or would result in the Buyer becoming liable or responsible
therefor.

Selling Group of any "United States real property interest" within the meaning

Seller has not received any written notice of any Tax claims concerning such
Taxes, to the extent that such items referred to in this representation could
materially impact Taxes in a Post-Closing Tax Period with respect to the
Acquired Assets or the Business, or otherwise would result in a Tax Liability
for the Buyer.

(e) Neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates is negotiating any final or draft
assessment or reassessment in respect of Taxes with any Governmental
Authority, nor has it received written notice from any Governmental Authority

Business, or otherwise would result in a Tax Liability for the Buyer.

January 2, 2015 in the ordinary course of business or that have been incurred

Seller, any other party thereto, and to the Knowledge of the Seller, no event
has occurred which with notice or passage of time or both other than on
account of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement would constitute a

ARTICLE 5 
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE BUYER

The Buyer, with respect to itself and its Buying Affiliates, represents and
warrants to the Seller as follows:

5.1 Right; Power; Authority; Action. The Buyer has the requisite right, power
and authority, and has taken all action necessary, to execute, deliver and
exercise its rights and perform its obligations under this Agreement and each
Transaction Document to which it is a party and to consummate the
Transactions. Each of the Buyer's Buying Affiliates has the requisite right,
power and authority, and has taken all action necessary, to execute, deliver
and exercise its rights and perform its obligations under each Transaction
Document to which it is a party and to

 consummate the Transactions. The governing bodies of the Buyer and each of its
Buying Affiliates have, as required, approved this Agreement and the
Transactions, and no consent is required to be obtained by the Buyer or its
Buying Affiliates in connection with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement or the Transaction Documents or the performance of their obligations
hereunder and thereunder. Each of the Buyer and its Buying Affiliates is duly
organized and validly existing and in good standing as an entity under the
laws of the jurisdiction in which it was organized (to the extent good
standing or an analogous concept is applicable in such jurisdiction).

5.2 Binding Agreements; Due Execution. This Agreement and each Transaction
Document to which the Buyer and its Buying Affiliates is a party has been duly
executed and delivered by the Buyer and its Buying Affiliates party thereto,
and assuming that this Agreement and each Transaction Document has been duly
authorized, executed and delivered by each other party hereto and thereto, is
a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Buyer and its Buying Affiliates
party thereto and enforceable against the Buyer and its Buying Affiliates
party thereto in accordance with their respective terms, except to the extent
that enforcement may be affected by Laws relating to bankruptcy,
reorganization, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, moratorium and other Laws
affecting creditors' rights generally and by general principles of equity
(regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in
equity or at law). The other instruments, documents and agreements
contemplated hereby and the Exhibits hereto to which the Buyer or any of its
Buying Affiliates is a signatory have been duly authorized, executed and
delivered by such Buyer or Buying Affiliate and constitute legal, valid and
binding obligations of such Buyer or Buying Affiliate enforceable in
accordance with their respective terms, in each case assuming the due
authorization, execution and delivery by the counterparties thereto, except to
the extent that enforcement may be affected by Laws relating to bankruptcy,
reorganization, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, moratorium and other Laws
affecting creditors' rights generally and by general principles of equity
(regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in
equity or at law).

5.3 No Conflict. The execution and delivery of, and performance by each of the
Buyer and its Buying Affiliates of its obligations under, this Agreement and
the Transaction Documents to which it is party does not:

(a) conflict with any provision of the charter or other equivalent
organizational documents of the Buyer or such Buying Affiliate;

(b) conflict with, or result in any violation of, or constitute a default
(with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) under any written Contract
to which the Buyer or such Buying Affiliate is a party or by which any of its
properties is bound;

(c) result in a breach of any Order to which the Buyer or such Buying
Affiliate is a party or by which the Buyer or such Buying Affiliate (or the
Buyer's or such Buying Affiliate's property) is bound or submits;

(d) result in the creation of an Encumbrance upon any of the assets of the
Buyer or such Buying Affiliate; or

 (e) other than those consents, approvals or notices contemplated by the HSR
Act or any other applicable competition, merger control, antitrust or similar
Law or regulation or such approvals or registrations required in connection
with the Transactions under the relevant Laws of any jurisdiction, require the
Buyer or such Buying Affiliate to obtain any consent or approval of, or give
any notice to or make any registration with, any third party or Governmental
Authority, which has not been obtained or made as of the date hereof, except
in the cases of clauses (b) through (e) any conflict, violation, default,
breach, Encumbrance or failure to obtain or make a consent, approval or
notice, as applicable, as would not reasonably be expected to materially and
adversely impair the Buyer's or such Buying Affiliates' ability to consummate
the Transactions.

5.4 Litigation; Compliance with Law. There are no Proceedings pending or, to
the Buyer's Knowledge, threatened and there is no basis therefor against or
affecting the Buyer or any of its Buying Affiliates before or by any
Governmental Authority, except as would not reasonably be expected to
materially and adversely impair the Buyer's or its Buying Affiliates' ability
to consummate the Transactions or materially and adversely affect the validity
or enforceability of this Agreement, the Transaction Documents or any other
agreement, document or instrument to which the Buyer or any Buying Affiliate
is or is to be a party relating to the Transactions.

5.5 Brokerage or Commissions. No Person is entitled to receive a success fee,
finder's fee, brokerage fee, financial advisory fee or commission from or
through the Buyer or any Buying Affiliate in connection with this Agreement,
the Transaction Documents or the consummation of the Transactions for which
any member of the Selling Group has or would have any Liability.

5.6 Debt Financing.

(a) The Buyer has delivered to the Seller a true and complete copy of a fully
executed commitment letter (as amended, amended and restated, supplemented or
otherwise modified with the prior written consent of the Seller or as
permitted or required by Section 6.8, including with respect to any Alternate
Financing, the "Debt Commitment Letter") from the Lenders to provide the Buyer
with the debt financing set forth therein (the "Debt Financing") and the fee
letter between the Buyer and the Lenders (the "Fee Letter"), which Fee Letter
may be redacted in a manner reasonably satisfactory to the Lenders. The
proceeds of the Debt Financing will be used to pay the Final Purchase Price
and the fees and expenses of the Buyer relating to the transactions
contemplated by the Transaction Documents. The Debt Commitment Letter in the
form so provided is in full force and effect as of the date hereof and is a
valid, legal, binding and enforceable obligation of the Buyer, except as
enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium or similar Laws affecting creditors' rights generally and by
general principles of equity (whether enforcement is sought at law or in
equity), and to the Knowledge of the Buyer, the other parties thereto. In
addition, (i) the Debt Commitment Letter has not been amended, restated or
otherwise modified or waived except, in each case, with the prior written
consent of the Seller or as permitted or required by Section 6.8, (ii) the
financing commitments in the Debt Commitment Letter have not been withdrawn

 or terminated and no such withdrawal or termination is contemplated by the
Buyer or any of its Affiliates or, to the Knowledge of the Buyer as of the
date hereof, any other party thereto, (iii) as of the date hereof, there are
no side letters or written understandings to which Buyer or any of its
Affiliates is party that interpret the Debt Commitment Letter or contain or
impose additional obligations or conditions upon the Buyer or any of its
Affiliates, that would affect the availability of the Debt Financing in
accordance with the terms of the Debt Commitment Letter and (iv) as of the
date hereof, none of the Buyer or its Affiliates is in breach of any of the
terms or conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter and, subject to
the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Seller set forth in
Article 4, no event has occurred that, with or without notice, lapse of time
or both, could reasonably be expected to constitute a breach or default on the
part of the Buyer or any of its Affiliates or, to the Knowledge of the Buyer,
any other party thereto under any term or condition of the Debt Commitment
Letter. The Buyer has fully paid any and all commitment fees and other fees in
connection with the Debt Commitment Letter that are payable in accordance with
the terms of the Debt Commitment Letter.

(b) Subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Articles 8 and
9, the Buyer has no reason to believe that any of the conditions to the Debt
Financing will not be satisfied on the Closing Date or that the Debt Financing
or any portion thereof will otherwise not be available to the Buyer on the
Closing Date. The net proceeds from the Debt Financing, when funded in
accordance with the Debt Commitment Letter, will, together with the proceeds
of the equity committed to be contributed to the Buyer pursuant to the terms
of the Equity Commitment Letter, in the aggregate, constitute all of the
financing required for the consummation of the Transactions pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement and be sufficient for the satisfaction of all of the
Buyer's obligations under the Transaction Documents, including the payment of
the Final Purchase Price and any other amounts required to be paid in
connection with the consummation of the Transactions. There are no conditions
precedent or other contingencies (including in the Fee Letter), other than as
expressly set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter, to the Lenders' obligations
to fund the Debt Financing on the Closing Date.

5.7 Equity Commitment Letter. Concurrently with the execution of this
Agreement, the Buyer has delivered to the Seller the duly executed Equity
Commitment Letter in the form attached hereto as Exhibit C (the "Equity
Commitment Letter") of American Industrial Partners Capital Fund V, L.P., a
Delaware limited partnership (the "Sponsor"). The Equity Commitment Letter is
in full force and effect and is a valid, binding and enforceable obligation of
Sponsor and no event has occurred that, with or without notice, lapse of time
or both, would constitute a default on the part of Sponsor under such Equity
Commitment Letter.

5.8 Ownership. The Buyer is controlled by Sponsor and its affiliated
investment funds and immediately prior to the Closing, the Buyer shall be an
indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Sponsor and its affiliated investment
funds.

5.9 Solvency. The Buyer is not entering into the Transactions with intent to
hinder, delay or defraud either present or future creditors. As of the date
hereof, and after giving

 effect to the Transactions, including the incurrence of debt to finance such
Transactions, none of the Buyer, its Buying Affiliates or their respective
Subsidiaries will (a) be insolvent (either because its financial condition is
such that the sum of its debts is less than the amount required to pay its
probable liability on its existing debts as they mature), (b) have
unreasonably small capital with which to engage in its business or (c) have
incurred debts (and do not immediately plan to incur debt) beyond its ability
to pay as they become due.

5.10 No Other Representations or Warranties. EXCEPT AS SET FORTH IN THIS
AGREEMENT AND THE TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS, NONE OF THE BUYER, THE BUYING
AFFILIATES OR ANY OTHER PERSON IS MAKING ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY,
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AS TO THE BUYER, THE BUYING AFFILIATES OR ANY OF THEIR
ASSETS, LIABILITIES OR OPERATIONS.

all such information exclusively relating to the Business as the Buyer may

and will cause its employees, representatives and agents to keep all

Confidentiality Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, the Seller is not required to provide, or cause to be
provided (x) any information or access that the Seller believes could violate
applicable Law or the terms of any confidentiality agreement or
confidentiality provision in any contract, impact any privilege, including the
attorney/client privilege, or otherwise be competitively sensitive or (y) any
information relating to bids or offers received from other Persons in

(b) The Buyer hereby agrees to defend, indemnify and hold harmless each of the

attributable to personal injury, death or physical or other property damage,
or violation of any member of the Selling Group's or its Affiliate's or any
third Person operator's rules, regulations or operating policies of which the
Buyer or its representatives associated with the Indemnifiable Losses had been
informed in writing, arising out of, resulting from or relating to any field
visit, environmental property assessment, sampling, boring, drilling

 or other invasive investigation activities or other due diligence activity
conducted by the Buyer or any of its representatives with respect to the
Acquired Assets and the Business, EVEN IF SUCH INDEMNIFIABLE LOSSES ARISE OUT
OF OR RESULT FROM, SOLELY OR IN PART, THE SOLE, ACTIVE, PASSIVE, CONCURRENT OR
COMPARATIVE NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER FAULT OR VIOLATION OF LAW OF
OR BY ANY OF THE SELLER INDEMNITEES, EXCEPTING ONLY INDEMNIFIABLE LOSSES
ACTUALLY RESULTING ON THE ACCOUNT OF THE WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OF ANY OF THE
SELLER INDEMNITEES.

to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and shall promptly provide
any supplemental information requested in connection with the filing with
respect to the Transactions pursuant to the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust
Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, (the "HSR Act"). The Seller and the
Buyer shall promptly make and, as applicable, supplement any other filings
with Governmental Authorities that must also be made with respect to the
Transactions. Any such notification and supplemental information will be in
substantial compliance with the requirements of the HSR Act or other
applicable Law. The Seller and the Buyer shall furnish to the other such
necessary information and reasonable assistance as the other may reasonably
request in connection with its preparation of any filing or submission that is
necessary under the HSR Act or other applicable Law. The Seller and the Buyer
shall promptly inform the other Party of any material communication received
by such Party from any Governmental Authority in respect of the HSR Filing or
other applicable Law. The Seller and the Buyer shall (a) use their respective
commercially reasonable efforts to comply as expeditiously as possible with
all requests of any Governmental Authority for additional information and
documents, including information or documents requested under the HSR Act or
other applicable Law, (b) not (i) extend any waiting period under the HSR Act
or other applicable regulation or (ii) enter into any agreement with any
Governmental Authority not to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, except, in each case, with the prior consent of the other Parties
and (c) cooperate with the other Parties and use commercially reasonable
efforts to contest and resist any action, including legislative,
administrative or judicial action, and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or
overturned any order (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) that
restricts, prevents or prohibits the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

6.4 Required Consents.

(a) In addition to the governmental filing requirements addressed by Section
6.3, subject to Section 6.14, each of the Parties will cooperate and use
commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate
actions and to make, or cause to be made, all filings necessary, proper or
advisable under all other applicable Laws, to consummate and make effective
the Transactions. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Buyer
will use commercially reasonable efforts (a) to obtain all Licenses, permits
(including Environmental Permits), consents, approvals, authorizations,
qualifications and Orders of Governmental Authorities as are necessary in

 connection with the consummation of the Transactions and to fulfill the
conditions to the Transactions, and (b) to the extent required by Law to be
obtained prior to the Closing in order to consummate the Transactions, to
obtain them prior to the Closing. In no event, however, will any member of the
Selling Group be obligated to pay any money to any Person or to offer or grant
other financial or other accommodations to any Person in connection with
obtaining any License, consent, waiver, confirmation, novation or approval
with respect to any Assumed Contract.

(b) Except as contemplated by the Irrevocable Offer Letter, the Transition
Services Agreement and any Local Market Agreement, with respect to any Assumed
Contract or any other Acquired Asset that is not transferred or assigned to
the Buyer at the Closing (a "Nonassigned Asset"), for a period beginning on
the Closing Date and ending as of the time such requisite consent is obtained
and the foregoing is transferred and assigned to the Buyer, the Seller shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to provide, or cause to be provided, to
the Buyer or any of its Buying Affiliates substantially comparable benefits
thereof and shall enforce, at the request of and for the account of the Buyer
or any of its Buying Affiliates, any rights of the Selling Group arising
thereunder against any Person, including the right to elect to terminate or
renew in accordance with the terms thereof upon the advice of the Buyer. As a
condition to the Seller providing, or causing to be provided, to the Buyer or
any of its Buying Affiliates the benefits of any Nonassigned Asset, the Buyer
shall perform, at the direction of the Seller, all of the obligations of the
Selling Group thereunder and indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Selling
Group and its Affiliates from and against any Indemnifiable Losses arising out
of or resulting from the Seller providing, or causing to be provided, to the
Buyer or any of its Buying Affiliates the benefits of any Nonassigned Asset.

6.5 Further Actions. Subject to Section 6.4, prior to the Closing, each of the
Parties will use commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all appropriate action, do or cause to be done all things necessary
under applicable Laws in an expeditious manner, including obtaining any
necessary consents or approvals from, or making any necessary filings with any
domestic or foreign regulatory agencies.

6.6 Employee Matters.

(a) Non-ARD Employees. With respect to each Non-ARD Employee:

(i) the Buyer or its Affiliates must, at least thirty (30) days prior to the
Closing, offer each Non-ARD Employee employment to be effective upon Closing,
on terms substantially comparable in the aggregate to those upon which the
Non-ARD Employee was previously employed by the Selling Group or its
Affiliates immediately prior to the Closing including offering the Non-ARD
Employee participation in employee benefit plans that are substantially
comparable in the aggregate to the employee benefit plans that they
participated in immediately prior to the Closing Date and where the Buyer or
its Affiliates waives any waiting periods and recognizes the Non-ARD
Employee\'s service with the Selling Group or its Affiliates as being service
with the Buyer or its Affiliates for the purpose of all

 service-related entitlements other than defined benefit accruals or to the
extent such recognition would result in the duplication of benefits;

(ii) at the Closing, the Seller will, and will cause its Selling Affiliates
to, to the extent legally permissible, immediately release (or procure the
release of) such Non-ARD Employees from employment with the Selling Group or
its Affiliates without further notice;

(iii) subject to Section 6.6(a)(iv) below, the Seller will fully indemnify and
hold harmless the Buyer and its Affiliates against any Employment Losses
arising out of the Non-ARD Employee's employment by the Selling Group or its
Affiliates and/or any termination of the Non-ARD Employee's employment by the
Selling Group or its Affiliates at or prior to the Closing; and

(iv) in the event an offer of employment is not made in accordance with
Section 6.6(a)(i), the Buyer will fully indemnify and hold harmless the
Selling Group and its Affiliates against any Employment Losses arising out of
the Non-ARD Employee's continued employment and/or any termination of the Non-
ARD Employee's employment.

(b) Except as otherwise provided in Section 6.6(a):

(i) The Seller shall be responsible for all Liabilities relating to or arising
out of the employment, engagement, remuneration, or cessation of employment
with the Selling Group or any of its Affiliates of any Transferred Employee
with respect to all periods prior to and ending with the Closing; and

(ii) the Buyer shall be responsible for all Liabilities relating to or arising
out of the employment, engagement, remuneration, refusal to hire or cessation
of employment with the Buyer or any Buying Affiliate of any Transferred
Employee with respect to all periods from and after the Closing. The Seller
shall pay each Transferred Employee all earned or accrued wages, salary,
commission, bonus, vacation pay, severance, paid time off and other employee
compensation and benefits related to employment with the Selling Group or any
of its Affiliates for all periods through the Closing in a timely fashion and
not later than the date such payment is required by Law or the provisions of
any Plan under which such compensation is or becomes duly payable. The Seller
shall cause any outstanding and unvested awards of long-term cash incentives
and awards of equity in the Seller or an Affiliate of the Seller held by a
Transferred Employee to fully vest as of the Closing, to the extent permitted
by local Law and the rules of the incentive arrangement, and shall be
responsible for the payment and cost of such cash and equity awards. The
Seller shall cause any Plan that is a defined contribution plan to allow
Business Employees to make direct rollovers of account balances in such plan
to a defined contribution plan maintained by the Buyer on or after the Closing
Date to the extent permitted by local Law and the rules of such Plan.

 (c) Without limiting the generality of Section 12.3, the provisions of this
Section 6.6 are solely for the benefit of the Parties and their Affiliates,
and no current or former employee of the Selling Group or its Affiliates shall
be regarded for any purpose as a third-party beneficiary of this Agreement.
Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as an amendment to any Plan or
other employee benefit plan for any purpose, or to obligate the Buyer or any
of its Affiliates to employ any Business Employee for any period of time after
the Closing.

(d) ARD Employees. The parties acknowledge that the Transfer Regulations will
apply to the Transactions and pursuant to the Transfer Regulations the
Contracts of employment or employment (as applicable) of the ARD Employees
will have effect from the Closing as if originally made between the Buyer or
an Affiliate of the Buyer and the ARD Employees, except with respect to the
ARD Employees' rights to old age invalidity or survivors' benefits under any
occupational pension scheme as far as provided for by mandatory national Law
and subject to any individual objecting to the transfer, and all the Selling
Group's and its Affiliates' rights, powers, duties and liabilities in
connection with such employment Contracts or employment (as applicable) shall
transfer automatically to the Buyer or its Affiliates.

(e) Non-Transferring ARD Employees. If an ARD Employee exercises his or her
right under the Transfer Regulations or applicable local Law not to transfer
to the Buyer or its applicable Buying Affiliate as a result of any act or
omission of the Buyer, the Buyer shall be responsible for and shall indemnify
the Selling Group and its Affiliates against any Employment Losses arising out
of or in connection with the employment of that ARD Employee after the Closing
Date and/or termination of the contract of employment of that ARD Employee
incurred by the Selling Group or any of its Affiliates.

(f) Collective Agreements. The Buyer or its Affiliates (as applicable) shall
continue to observe the terms of any collective agreements or other similar
agreements that applied to the ARD Employees' employment before the Closing.
The Buyer or its Affiliates (as applicable) shall put in place employee
benefit plans for the ARD Employees providing benefits that are consistent
with such collective or similar agreements or are required under the Transfer
Regulations or applicable local Law. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing
contained in this clause (f) shall limit the indemnification obligation of the
Buyer contained in Section 6.6(j)(ii).

(g) Remaining Employees. If, following the Closing Date, it is established to
the reasonable satisfaction of the Seller that the Contract of employment or
employment (as applicable) of an ARD Employee identified by the Seller or its
Affiliates as such prior to the Closing Date and set forth on Schedule 1.1(c)
did not transfer in accordance with the Transfer Regulations other than as a
result of the ARD Employee exercising his or her right not to transfer or as a
result of any additional statutory timeframe for the transfer of Protected ARD
Employees due to local legal requirements ("Remaining ARD Employee"), then:

shall as soon as reasonably possible but in any event within fourteen (14)
Business Days of being so requested by the Seller or its Affiliates, make to
each such Remaining ARD Employee an offer in writing to employ him/her on
their existing terms and conditions and such Remaining ARD Employee shall be
treated as an ARD Employee for the purposes of this Agreement;

(ii) upon acceptance of the offer made pursuant to Section 6.6(g)(i) above, or
in the event an offer of employment was: (A) not made in accordance with

by the Buyer made in accordance with Section 6.6(g)(i) or termination arises
as a result of Section 6.6(g)(ii)(B) above, in which case any such Liabilities
will remain with the Seller.

(h) Undisclosed Employees. If, following the Closing Date, any Contract of
employment of a person who is neither an ARD Employee nor a Non-ARD Employee
has effect or is alleged to have effect as if originally made between the
Buyer or its Affiliates and that person pursuant to the Transfer Regulations
("Undisclosed Employee"), then:

(i) the Buyer or its Affiliates will as soon as reasonably practicable but in
any event within five (5) Business Days of becoming aware of this fact, notify
the Seller in writing;

(ii) the Seller or an Affiliate of the Seller may, within seven (7) Business
Days of receipt of the notification pursuant to Section 6.6(h), make an offer

accordance with the contractual terms and conditions of the relevant
Transferring Employee's employment; and

(B) occurs no later than ninety (90) days after the Closing Date;

(v) subject to and conditional on the Buyer and its Affiliates having complied
with Section 6.6(h)(i) and the Undisclosed Employee's employment having been

the Buyer and its Affiliates against all Employment Losses which arise out of
or in connection with the employment and/or the termination of the employment
of such Undisclosed Employee pursuant to Section 6.6(h)(iv) excluding any
Employment Losses attributable to a finding (by a court of tribunal of
competent jurisdiction) of discrimination or discriminatory dismissal on the
part of the Buyer or its Affiliates; and

(vi) if the Buyer does not terminate the Contract of employment of any
Undisclosed Employee in accordance with Section 6.6(h)(iv), any Undisclosed
Employee shall be treated as an ARD Employee for the purposes of this
Agreement.

(i) Information and Consultation. The Seller and the Buyer will comply, or
shall cause their respective Affiliates to comply, with their respective
obligations to inform and consult under the Transfer Regulations or otherwise
in connection with the Transactions, including the obligations under
regulation 13 and 14 of TUPE, and the Seller and the Buyer will provide each
other with such information as the other may reasonably request in order to
allow it to perform its obligations to inform and consult under the Transfer
Regulations or otherwise in connection with the Transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including the obligations under regulation 13 and 14 of TUPE.

(j) Buyer Indemnities. The Buyer shall indemnify the Selling Group and its
Affiliates from and against any and all Employment Losses that the Selling

Affiliates on or after the Closing Date or which are attributable to any act
or omission (or alleged act or omission) of the Buyer or any of its Affiliates
in relation to any of the ARD Employees, Remaining ARD Employees, or any
person who would have been an ARD Employee but for such act or omission (or
alleged act or omission) of the Buyer or any agent, contractor, employee of
the Buyer or any of its Affiliates;

(ii) by reason of any ARD Employee's employment terminating pursuant to the
Transfer Regulations or applicable local Law due to a substantial change in
his or her working conditions or terms and conditions of employment to his or
her detriment pursuant to the Transfer Regulations or applicable local Law;
and

 (iii) as a result of any failure by the Buyer or its Affiliates to comply with
their obligations to inform and consult under the Transfer Regulations.

(k) Seller Indemnities. The Seller shall indemnify the Buyer and its
Affiliates from and against any and all Employment Losses that the Buyer or
its Affiliates may suffer, sustain, incur or pay as a result of any failure by

(l) Cooperation. If any person, whether or not an ARD Employee or a Non-ARD

by that party, the Seller and the Buyer (as may be the case) shall:

(i) give to each other or their respective Affiliates as soon as reasonably
practicable following written request by the designated respondent(s) of the
claim, all information which may be reasonably relevant to such claim and
shall render to each other (at the respondent's cost) such assistance and co-
operation as the other may reasonably require in contesting, settling or
dealing with any such claim; and

(ii) before any agreement is made with respect to the payment of any claims,
demands, actions, proceedings and settlement, the respective respondent shall
have obtained the prior written agreement of the indemnifying party under this
Agreement (which shall not be unreasonably withheld).

(m) Miscellaneous. Notwithstanding anything set forth in this Section 6.6, (i)
with respect to employees in any Subject Jurisdiction, all references to the
Closing or Closing Date in this Section 6.6 shall be deemed to be references
to the applicable Deferred Local Market Closing or Deferred Local Market
Closing Date, respectively and (ii) the provisions of this Section 6.6 will
not be applicable to a Non-ARD Employee who is not actively at work at the
time an offer of employment is otherwise required to be made to the Non-ARD
Employees pursuant to this Section 6.6 until such time that such Non-ARD
Employee returns to work, provided that such Non-ARD Employee would have
otherwise been entitled to return to his or her position with the Business
under applicable Law.

6.7 Supplements to Disclosure Schedules. The Seller shall supplement any
portion of the Disclosure Schedules and deliver such schedules (as so
supplemented, the "Supplemental Schedules") to the Buyer on or prior to the
Closing Date for the purpose of updating disclosures made therein to reflect
any facts or matters occurring after the date hereof and on or prior to the
Closing Date ("Disclosed Additional Matters"); and, to the extent the Closing
occurs, such Disclosed Additional Matters will be treated as if they had been
included in the Disclosure Schedules as of the date hereof for the purpose of
determining whether any Buyer Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification for
breach of a representation and warranty of the Seller pursuant to Section
10.1(a). Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Disclosed Additional Matter will
qualify any representations and warranties of the Seller for the purpose of
determining the satisfaction of the conditions to Closing under Article 8.

 6.8 Debt Financing.

(a) The Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to:

(i) take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate action, to do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law, to
arrange and obtain the Debt Financing on the terms and conditions described in
the Debt Commitment Letter and any Fee Letter, including (A) maintaining in
effect and complying in all material respects with its obligations under the
Debt Commitment Letter (or obtaining the waiver of such obligations) ,
including the negotiation of definitive agreements with respect to the Debt
Financing on terms and conditions contained in the Debt Commitment Letter, (B)
satisfying on a timely basis all conditions in the Debt Commitment Letter, (C)
enforcing its rights under the Debt Commitment Letter and (D) to the extent
the senior secured notes have not been issued in an amount that equals or
exceeds the bridge financing provided for in the Debt Commitment Letter,
drawing upon the bridge financing provided for therein;

(ii) negotiate definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Financing (the
"Definitive Agreements") as promptly as practicable after the date hereof but
in any event no later than the Closing Date on the terms and conditions
contained in the Debt Commitment Letter, which Definitive Agreements shall be
effective no later than the Closing Date; and

(iii) consummate the Debt Financing no later than the Closing Date in
accordance with the terms and conditions contained in the Debt Commitment
Letter; provided, however, that the Buyer may agree to or permit any
amendment, modification or waiver of the Debt Commitment Letter or any Fee
Letter that would not and would not reasonably be expected to (A) reduce the
aggregate amount of the Debt Financing set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter
to an amount less than the aggregate amount necessary to consummate the
Transactions pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and to satisfy all of the
Buyer's obligations under the Transaction Documents, including the payment of
the Final Purchase Price and any other amounts required to be paid in
connection with the consummation of the Transactions, (B) adversely impact the
ability of the Buyer to enforce its rights against the other parties to the
Debt Commitment Letter or the Definitive Agreements, (C) expand the conditions
precedent or other contingencies to the funding of the Debt Financing on or
prior to the Closing Date contained in the Debt Commitment Letter as in effect
as of the date hereof so long as the requirements of this proviso are
satisfied or (D) prevent or materially delay the consummation of the
Transactions (it being understood that nothing herein shall prevent the Buyer
from amending the Commitment Letter to add agents, co-agents or arrangers as
contemplated in the Commitment Letter).

(b) The Buyer shall give the Seller prompt notice upon becoming aware of any
breach of the Debt Commitment Letter by a party to the Debt Commitment Letter
or any termination of the Debt Commitment Letter or any Fee Letter. The Buyer
shall keep the

 Seller informed on a timely basis and in reasonable detail of the status of
its efforts to arrange the Debt Financing and any material developments
relating to the Debt Financing and shall not permit any amendment, supplement
or modification to be made to, or any waiver of any provision or remedy under,
the Debt Commitment Letter or the Fee Letter without Seller's prior written
consent, except as otherwise permitted under Section 6.8(a)(iii) above. In the
event that the Buyer becomes aware of any event or circumstance that makes
procurement of all or any portion of the Debt Financing unlikely to occur in
the manner or from the sources contemplated in, or pursuant to the terms
(including the "market flex" provisions) and conditions of, the Debt
Commitment Letter and any Fee Letter, the Buyer shall immediately notify the
Seller, and the Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain, as
promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event or
circumstance, replacement commitments (other than amounts that are replaced by
the Buyer's cash on hand) from alternate sources (such portion from alternate
sources, the "Alternate Financing") on terms and conditions that are not
materially less favorable in the aggregate to the Buyer than those contained
in the Debt Commitment Letter and the Fee Letter; provided, however, that such
Alternate Financing shall not (i) be subject to any additional or modified
conditions or other contingencies to the funding of the Debt Financing on the
Closing Date other than those contained in the Debt Commitment Letter or (ii)
otherwise be reasonably likely to prevent or materially delay the Closing or
the date on which the Debt Financing would be obtained. The Buyer shall
deliver to the Seller complete and correct copies of all amendments,
supplements, other modifications or agreements pursuant to which any Alternate
Financing shall be made available to the Buyer.

(c) Prior to the Closing, the Seller shall use all reasonable best efforts to
provide, and shall cause its Affiliates to use all reasonable best efforts to
provide, in connection with the arrangement of the Debt Financing or any
offering of senior secured notes, at the Buyer's expense all reasonable
cooperation requested by the Buyer that is customary in connection with the
arrangement of debt financing for transactions that are substantially similar
to the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents, including using
all reasonable best efforts to (i) provide promptly, and in any event no later
than thirty (30) days after the date hereof, an audited, combined balance
sheet of the Selling Group with respect to the Business for the fiscal year
ended on January 1, 2013, which balance sheet shall either be added to the
financial statements provided under Section 4.4 (with any necessary updates to
the footnotes thereto) or attached as supplemental information to the
financial statements provided under Section 4.4, as the Buyer may elect, (ii)
provide unaudited consolidated balance sheets and related unaudited statements
of operations, changes in parent company investment and cash flows, in each
case prepared in accordance with GAAP, of the Selling Group with respect to
the Business for each fiscal quarter (other than the fourth fiscal quarter)
ended after January 2, 2015, and cause the Selling Group's accountants to
conduct a review of such quarterly financial statements and the corresponding
period in the previous fiscal year, in accordance with applicable accounting
standards), in each case no later than 45 days after the end of such fiscal
quarter, (iii) cooperate with the Buyer and provide assistance to the Buyer in
connection with the preparation of a pro forma consolidated balance sheet and
related pro forma consolidated

 statement of operations of Buyer, as of the end of or for the latest four-
fiscal quarter period most recently ended at least 45 days prior to the
Closing Date, prepared after giving effect to the Transactions as if they had
occurred as of the end of such period (in the case of such balance sheet) or
at the beginning of such period (in the case of such statement of operations,
which need not to include adjustments for purchase accounting or be prepared
in compliance with Regulation S-X under the Securities Act of 1933), provided
that the Seller and the Selling Group shall not be responsible in any manner
for information relating to the proposed debt and equity capitalization that
is required for any pro formas or projected financial information identified
therein, (iv) provide such other financial and other pertinent information
regarding the Acquired Assets or the Business as may be reasonably requested
in writing by the Buyer or its Lenders in order to consummate the Debt
Financing necessary to satisfy the conditions to the availability of the Debt
Financing set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter, including but not limited
to the ability of the Lenders to conduct field exams and inventory appraisals,
and including such financial data of the type and form (including pro forma
financial data) customarily included in offering memoranda, private placement
memoranda and similar documents customarily used in Rule 144A "for life"
offerings of non-convertible debt securities as may be reasonably required by
the Buyer or its Lenders to consummate an offering of senior secured notes, in
form and substance necessary to assist in receiving customary "comfort"
(including customary "negative assurances") from independent accountants, (v)
participate in a reasonable number of informational meetings, due diligence
sessions, rating agency or other presentations or road shows in connection
with the Debt Financing or any offering of senior secured notes, (vi) assist
in the preparation of customary material for rating agency presentations, bank
information memoranda, offering documents, private placement memoranda and
similar documents required in connection with the Debt Financing or any
offering of senior secured notes, (vii) request required consents of the
Selling Group's accountants for use of their reports in any materials relating
to the Debt Financing (or any offering of senior secured notes) where the
inclusion of such reports is necessary and cause such accountants to provide
customary comfort letters and customary representation letters in connection
with the Debt Financing (or any offering of senior secured notes) in
accordance with normal practice for transactions of this type and (viii) take
such other actions reasonably requested by the Buyer or its Lenders to
facilitate the satisfaction of all conditions to the Debt Financing that are
within its control, it being understood and agreed that information and
documents provided by the Seller may be delivered to agents and lenders under
the Debt Commitment Letter and their representatives (subject to customary
arrangements for confidentiality that are substantially similar to the
provisions in the Confidentiality Agreement, including the Buyer providing
prior written notice of disclosure to the Seller), provided that (A) such
requested cooperation does not (w) unreasonably interfere with the ongoing
operations of the Selling Group or the Business, (x) cause any representation,
warranty, covenant or other term in this Agreement to be breached, (y) cause
any closing condition set forth in Article 8 or Article 9 to fail to be
satisfied or (z) result in any employee, officer or director of the Seller,
the Selling Group or the Business incurring any personal liability (as opposed
to liability in his or her capacity as an officer of such Person) with respect
to any matters related to the Debt Financing, (B) neither the Seller nor any
Affiliate of the Seller shall be required to pay any commitment

 or other fee or incur any other liability or obligation in connection with the
Debt Financing or to take any action that would be prohibited by any
applicable Law or cause a default of, or breach under, or otherwise violate
any Material Contract and (C) nothing in this Section 6.8(c) shall be
construed as requiring the Seller to provide financial information other than
the financial information described in or specifically set forth in clauses
(i), (ii) (iii) and (iv) above. The Buyer shall promptly, upon request by the
Seller, reimburse the Seller for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and
expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred by the Seller or any of its
Affiliates in connection with the cooperation of the Seller and its Affiliates
contemplated by Section 4.4 and shall indemnify and hold harmless the Seller
and its Affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees and
representatives from and against any and all Indemnifiable Losses suffered or
incurred by any of them in connection with the arrangement of the Debt
Financing and any information used in connection therewith; provided, however,
that the foregoing indemnification shall not include Indemnifiable Losses
resulting from the bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct of the
Seller, its Affiliates, or any of their respective directors, officers,
employees or representatives. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that, except as
otherwise expressly provided in this Section 6.8(c), the Seller and its
Affiliates and representatives have no responsibility for any financing
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Debt Financing and the Alternate
Financing) that Buyer may raise in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby.

(d) For purposes of this Section 6.8, the term "Debt Financing" shall also be
deemed to include any Alternate Financing and the term "Debt Commitment
Letter" shall also be deemed to include any commitment letter (or similar
agreement) with respect to such Alternate Financing.

6.9 Excluded Intellectual Property. Except as expressly set forth in the
Transition Services Agreement, no Excluded Intellectual Property is being
transferred or licensed to the Buyer or any of its Affiliates pursuant to the
Transactions. The Buyer shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, use
the Excluded Intellectual Property in any manner, except as expressly provided
in the Transition Services Agreement.

6.10 Non-Competition and Non-Solicitation.

(a) Neither the Seller nor any of its controlled Affiliates will engage,
directly or indirectly, in the Business for a period of five (5) years
immediately following the Closing Date; provided, however, that nothing herein
shall restrict or prohibit the Seller or any of its Affiliates from (i)
engaging in Permitted Activities or (ii) acquiring, by any means, any interest
in (including through an acquisition of the assets of) a company that is
engaged in the distribution or manufacturing of fastener hardware and
components, so long as such business does not make up 20% or more of such
company's revenues. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Permitted
Activities" means the distribution of fastener hardware and components
provided that such hardware and components (x) are generally commercially
available, (y) do not, in the aggregate, comprise more than the lesser of (1)
30% of the sales to a customer (measured on the basis of cost of goods sold)

 in any fiscal year (which amount shall be pro rated for any portion of a
fiscal year) and (2) $3,000,000; or (z) are sold to any customer listed under
the heading "Wire and Cable Customers" on Schedule 6.10(a); provided, however,
that in no event will sales of fastener hardware and components to the
customers listed under the heading "OEM Supply Customers" on Schedule 6.10(a)
be a Permitted Activity for purposes of this Agreement.

(b) For a period of three (3) years immediately following the Closing Date,
neither Party will, directly or indirectly, solicit, attempt to solicit,
recruit (each, a "Solicitation") or hire as an employee, independent
representative, independent consultant or otherwise, any person who at the
time of such Solicitation or hiring is or was (at any time during the 12-month
period prior to such Solicitation) an employee of the other Party or any of
such Party's Subsidiaries, or in any manner induce or attempt to induce any
such employee to terminate such person\'s employment with such entity;
provided, however, that a general solicitation or advertisement not targeted
at any such persons shall not be a Solicitation and the hireing of any person
as a result thereof shall not be prohibited; and provided further that the
Seller shall not in any event solicit, recruit, hire or retain any of the
Persons listed on the attached Schedule 6.10(b) unless, solely with respect to
such Persons who are beneficiaries of statutorily mandated severance benefits,
the Buyer has declined to bear the expense of such severance benefits.

(c) Each Party acknowledges and agrees that the restrictions on its activities
under this Section 6.10 are required for the reasonable protection of the
Parties. Each Party further acknowledges and agrees that a breach or
threatened breach of any of such obligations will result in irreparable harm
to the non-breaching Party for which money damages may not be an adequate
remedy. If the final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction declares
that any term or provision of this Section 6.10 is invalid or unenforceable
because it extends for too great a period of time, extends over too large a
geographic region or its scope is overly broad, then the Parties agree that
the court making the determination of invalidity or unenforceability shall
have the power to (and is hereby directed to) reduce the scope, duration, or
territory of the applicable term or provision, to delete specific words or
phrases, or to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a
term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to
expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision;
and this Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified so as to extend to the
greatest duration, scope, territory and/or terms for the benefit of the Party
seeking enforcement (as the case may be) as is so enforceable.

(d) Each Party has carefully considered the nature and extent of the
restrictions upon it and its Affiliates and the rights and remedies conferred
upon each Party under this Section 6.10 and hereby acknowledges and agrees
that the same are fair and reasonable in scope, duration and territory in
order to protect and maintain the respective property interests of the Parties
(including goodwill) and are fully required to protect the legitimate
interests of the Parties.

6.11 Data Center.

 (a) For purposes of running the Business after the Closing independently, the
Parties will cooperate to create and establish a standalone IT environment in
compliance with the criteria set forth on Schedule 6.11(a) (the "Data
Center"). The costs of creating and establishing such Data Center shall be
born by the Seller.

(b) The Business Employees who provide IT services to the Business and who
will, in accordance with and subject to the terms and conditions of Section
6.6, transfer employment to the Buyer are set forth on Schedule 6.11(b).

(c) On the date on which the performance criteria set forth on Schedule
6.11(c) are achieved (the "Data Center Acceptance Date"), the Seller shall
assign to the Buyer, and the Buyer shall accept and assume the obligations
with respect to the Data Center.

6.12 Local Market Agreements. Prior to the Closing, each of the Buyer and the
Seller will negotiate in good faith with respect to, and use all commercially
reasonable efforts to enter into, a Local Market Agreement substantially on
the terms set forth on Exhibit D attached hereto with respect to the operation
of the Business for each of the Subject Jurisdictions (each, a "Local Market
Agreement"); provided, however, neither Party will be required to negotiate or
enter into a Local Market Agreement for a Subject Jurisdiction if the Buyer
notifies the Seller at any time prior to the Closing that the Buyer (a) with
respect to a Probationary Jurisdiction, does not intend to acquire the
Acquired Assets with respect to such Probationary Jurisdiction or (b) has
established the appropriate corporate or other entity in such Subject
Jurisdiction to acquire the Acquired Assets from the applicable Subject
Selling Affiliate with respect to such Subject Jurisdiction.

6.13 Software License. Prior to the Closing, each of the Buyer and the Seller

exploit, provide, distribute or dispose of (in each case, directly or
indirectly) products of any kind, and to provide, use, offer to sell, or sell,
(in each case directly or indirectly) services of any kind; provided, however,
that such license will not permit the Buyer to make, have made, use, import,
sell, offer for sale or otherwise exploit, provide, distribute or dispose of
(in each case, directly or indirectly) the Licensed Software.

(b) Sublicense Rights. The Buyer shall have the right to sublicense the

6.14 Designation of Acquired Leases and Sublease Agreements. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, prior to the Closing, the Seller
will, in its sole discretion, determine which Business Leases will be an
Acquired Lease or made subject to a Sublease Agreement, which determination
will also include a determination of whether the Seller will provide security
to the applicable landlord in connection with any such arrangement; provided,
however, that the term of any Sublease Agreement will not be longer than the
remainder of the current term (not taking into account any extensions) of the
subject Business Lease; provided further that the Buyer will be responsible
for any long-term lease restoration Liabilities with respect to the Business
Leases arising from actions (including the operation of the Business in the
ordinary course) taken by the Buyer or by the Seller, on behalf of the Buyer,
from and after the Closing. The Seller will pay or reimburse the Buyer for all
Incremental Lease Costs. Prior to the Closing, each of the Buyer and the
Seller will negotiate in good faith with respect to, and use all commercially
reasonable efforts to enter into, a Sublease Agreement with respect to each
Subleased Real Property (and related Subleased Real Property Improvements) as
designated by the Seller pursuant to this Section 6.14.

payment of any such Apportioned Obligation or Transfer Tax, the Party paying

prepared by the Seller in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code and shall
be based on the allocation percentages set forth on Schedule 7.2(a).

Allocation to notify the Seller in writing of any objections. If the Buyer
does not object in writing during such thirty (30) day period, then the
Proposed Allocation shall be final and binding on all parties. If the Buyer
provides comments on such schedule during the thirty (30) days, then the
Seller shall consider such comments in good faith. Thereafter, the Seller
shall provide the Buyer with the final allocation schedule (the "Final
Allocation Schedule"). Any subsequent allocation necessary as a result of an
adjustment to the consideration to be paid herein shall be determined by the

Schedule.

status of, and any discussion, proposal or submission with respect to, such
challenge.

for so long as such representation and warranty is the subject of an
indemnification claim hereunder (until such claim is finally determined in
accordance with this Agreement).

For purposes of this Agreement, the "Fundamental Representations" shall be
the representations and warranties made in Sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.18, 5.1, 5.2
and 5.5.

10.3 Limitations. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement:

(a) In no event shall an Indemnitee be permitted to make a claim for
indemnification under Section 10.1(a) or Section 10.1(b) (as the case may be)
unless such claim is first made pursuant to this Agreement on or prior to the
expiration of the survival of the subject representation, warranty or covenant

(b) Neither the Seller nor the Buyer (as the case may be) shall have any
obligation to indemnify the applicable Indemnitees from and against any
Indemnifiable Losses arising from any claims under Sections 10.1(a)(i),

amount of Indemnifiable Losses in respect of such claims (excluding Minor
Claims) is greater than $4,000,000, (the "Threshold"), whereupon the

Indemnifiable Losses; provided, however, that the Threshold shall not apply to
(i) any Buyer Losses in respect of: (A) a breach of any Fundamental
Representation, (B) a breach of Section 4.6 or (C) any breach that is the
result of fraud or intentional misrepresentation on the part of the Seller or
(ii) any Seller Losses in respect of: (A) a

 breach of any Fundamental Representation or (B) any breach that is the result
of fraud or intentional misrepresentation on the part of the Buyer or any
Buying Affiliate.

(d) Neither the Seller nor the Buyer (as the case may be) shall have any
obligation to indemnify the applicable Indemnitees from and against any claims
under Sections 10.1(a)(i), Section 10.1(a)(ii) with respect to a breach of
Section 6.7 or 10.1(b)(i) once the aggregate amount of all payments made by or
on behalf of the Seller or the Buyer (as applicable) in respect of such
Party's indemnification obligations pursuant to Section 10.1 (excluding Minor

Cap shall not apply to (i) any Buyer Losses in respect of: (A) a breach of any
Fundamental Representation, (B) a breach of Section 4.6 or (C) any breach that
is the result of fraud or intentional misrepresentation on the part of the
Seller or (ii) any Seller Losses in respect of: (A) a breach of any
Fundamental Representation or (B) any breach that is the result of fraud or
intentional misrepresentation on the part of the Buyer or any Buying
Affiliate.

(e) In no event shall Buyer Losses claimed by a Buyer Indemnitee as
indemnifiable hereunder include any amounts that have already been factored as
a dollar-for-dollar decrease in the calculation of the Final Purchase Price
pursuant to Section 3.3 or have been recovered by the Buyer under the
obligations of the Seller under any other provision of this Agreement or any
other Transaction Document.

(f) Any payment made in respect of Indemnifiable Losses pursuant to this
Article 10 shall be net of any insurance proceeds and third-party
indemnification payments actually realized by and paid to the Indemnitee or
its Affiliates in respect of the subject claim (in each case, net of any
costs, fees or expenses incurred by such Indemnitee or its Affiliate to
procure such proceeds or such payment and the amount of any increased
insurance premiums (and with respect to such premium increase, as demonstrated
by evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnifying Party), retentions or
other costs related to or arising from any related claims or awards). Each
Buyer Indemnitee shall use commercially reasonable efforts to pursue its
insurance coverage(s) and policies in respect of any claim for which it is a
Buyer Indemnitee under this Agreement. The Indemnifying Party shall have the
right to be informed of all efforts to pursue such insurance coverage(s).
Indemnitee shall provide the Indemnifying Parties with prompt written Notice
of any receipt of such insurance proceeds realized in respect of claims for
which payment of indemnity has previously been made, and shall make prompt
delivery to the Indemnifying Party of such portion of the amount by which
payment of indemnification would have been reduced pursuant to this Article 10
if such proceeds had been realized prior to the making of such payment of
indemnification.

(g) Except for remedies that cannot be waived as a matter of law, a claim for
fraud in the inducement, and injunctive and provisional relief (including
specific performance of this Agreement), this Article 10, and Article 6 shall
be the exclusive remedy for breaches of this Agreement (including any
covenant, obligation, representation or warranty contained in this Agreement
or in any agreement, document, instrument,

 certification, Schedule or Exhibit delivered pursuant to this Agreement) from
and after the Closing.

(h) The Indemnitees and Indemnifying Parties shall cooperate with each other
to resolve any claim or liability with respect to which an Indemnifying Party
is obligated to indemnify an Indemnitee, including by making commercially
reasonable efforts to mitigate or resolve any such claim or liability. For the
avoidance of doubt, "commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate or resolve
any such claim or liability" shall not (i) require an Indemnitee or
Indemnifying Party to risk paying a settlement amount due to a "hammer" clause
under such Indemnitee or Indemnifying Party's applicable insurance policy or
(ii) require any Party to take any action (or to forego from taking any action
where such forbearance would result) in violation of the applicable insurance
policy that applies to the subject claims or Liability. In the event an
Indemnitee fails to so mitigate an Indemnifiable Loss, the Indemnifying Party
shall have no Liability for any portion of such Indemnifiable Loss that
reasonably could have been avoided had the Indemnitee made such efforts.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, after an Indemnitee acquires
knowledge of any fact or circumstance that results in or reasonably would be
expected to result in an Indemnifiable Loss or a Third Party Claim for which
the Indemnifying Party may have Liability to such Indemnitee, such Indemnitee
shall notify the Indemnifying Party promptly and implement such reasonable
actions as the Indemnifying Party shall request in writing for the purposes of
mitigating the possible Indemnifiable Losses arising therefrom.

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, no
Party shall be liable (whether an Indemnifiable Loss or otherwise) for any
punitive, special or exemplary damages relating to any breach of
representation, warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement or in any
certificate delivered pursuant to this Agreement; provided, however, that,
solely in respect of Indemnifiable Losses resulting from a Third Party Claim,
if (x) a Buyer Indemnitee or a Seller Indemnitee (as the case may be) suffers
an actual cash loss as a result of an award to a third party in a court,
arbitration or regulatory proceeding with respect to a breach of a
representation, warranty, or covenant under this Agreement and (y) such award
includes such excluded damages, then the Indemnifiable Losses due the
applicable Indemnitee shall include the amount of such award regardless of
whether such award includes such excluded damages.

(j) For purposes of determining the amount of Indemnifiable Losses incurred or
suffered by an Indemnitee for purposes of this Article 10 (except in
connection with any Buyer Loss arising from a breach or inaccuracy of a
representation of the Seller set forth in Section 4.5), the amount of such
Indemnifiable Losses will be determined without regard to any qualifications
therein referencing the terms "materiality," "Material Adverse Effect" or
other terms of similar import or effect.

10.4 Indemnification Procedures.

(a) In the case of any claim asserted by a Person other than a Party or an
Affiliate of a Party (such claim, a "Third Party Claim") after the Closing
against either a

 Seller Indemnitee or Buyer Indemnitee (each, an "Indemnitee") for which
indemnification is available under this Agreement, notice, including
reasonable detail indicating the amount (estimated in good faith as necessary
and to the extent feasible) of the loss that has been or may be suffered and
copies of all documents and notices received by the Indemnitee relating to the
subject claim, shall be given (the "Claim Notice") by the Indemnitee to the
Seller or the Buyer, as applicable, promptly after such Indemnitee has actual
knowledge of any claim as to which indemnity may be sought, and the Indemnitee
shall permit the Seller (when the Indemnitee is a Buyer Indemnitee) or the
Buyer (when a Seller Indemnitee is the Indemnitee) (each, an "Indemnifying
Party") at the expense of the Seller (when the subject indemnification
obligation is pursuant to Section 10.1(a) above) or the Buyer (when the
subject indemnification obligation is pursuant to Section 10.1(b) above) to
assume the defense of any claim or any litigation resulting therefrom;
provided, however, that (i) the Indemnifying Party shall acknowledge that the
Third Party Claim gives rise to an Indemnifiable Loss prior to assuming the
defense of such Third Party Claim, (ii) counsel for the Indemnifying Party who
shall conduct the defense of such claim or litigation shall be reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnitee, and the Indemnitee may participate in such
defense at such Indemnitee's expense with counsel reasonably satisfactory to
the Indemnifying Party; and (iii) the failure of any Indemnitee to give Notice
as provided herein shall not relieve any Party required under this Article 10
to provide indemnification of such Party's indemnification obligations under
this Agreement except to the extent that such failure results in a lack of
actual notice to such Indemnifying Party and such Indemnifying Party is
materially prejudiced as a result of such failure to give Notice. The
Indemnifying Party shall have twenty (20) Business Days from receipt of the
Claim Notice (the "Notice Period") to notify the Indemnitee whether or not it
elects to assume the defense of the Indemnitee against such claim or demand.

(b) In the event that the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnitee within
the Notice Period that the Indemnifying Party elects to defend the Indemnitee
against a claim or litigation, the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to
defend the Indemnitee by appropriate proceedings; provided, however, that, the
Indemnifying Party shall not, without the prior written consent of the
Indemnitee, settle, compromise or offer to settle or compromise any Third
Party Claim on a basis that would result in (i) the imposition of a consent
order, injunction or decree that would restrict the future activity or conduct
of the Indemnitee or any of its Affiliates or (ii) a finding or admission of a
violation of Law or violation of the rights of any Person by the Indemnitee or
any of its Affiliates. In the event that the Indemnifying Party does not
accept the defense of any matter for which indemnification is required, the
Indemnitee shall have the full right to defend against any such claim or
litigation, and shall be entitled to settle or agree to pay in full such claim
or demand at the expense of the Indemnifying Party (but subject to the
Threshold and Base Cap to the extent applicable); provided, however, that, in
no event shall the Indemnitee consent to the entry of any judgment or enter
into settlement without the written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which
shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. In any event, the
Parties shall cooperate in the defense of any claim or litigation subject to
this Article 10 and the Books and Records of each shall be available

 to the Parties with respect to such defense upon reasonable notice during
normal business hours.

(c) In the event that an Indemnitee has a claim against an Indemnifying Party
that does not involve a claim or demand being asserted by a third party, the
Indemnitee shall send a written Notice (including all relevant documents with
respect to the subject claim) with respect to such claim to the applicable
Indemnifying Party promptly following its discovery of the existence of the
facts giving rise to such claim. The Indemnifying Party shall have twenty (20)
Business Days from the date such Notice is received during which to notify the
Indemnitee in writing of any objections it has to the Indemnitee's Notice or
claims for indemnification. If the Indemnifying Party does not deliver such
written Notice of objection within such twenty (20) Business Day period, the
Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to have accepted the claim. If the
Indemnifying Party rejects the claim, then the Indemnitee shall have the right
(but not the obligation) to pursue legal proceedings pursuant and subject to
Sections 12.8 and 12.14.

(d) Any payments due under this Article 10 shall be made by the applicable
Indemnifying Parties by wire transfer of immediately available funds promptly
following receipt of demand by the Indemnitee.

(e) With respect to any Tax Claim, to the extent of any conflict between the
provisions of this Article 10 and the provisions of Article 7, the provisions
of Article 7 shall control.

10.5 Adjustment to the Purchase Price. All indemnification payments made
pursuant to Article 7 and/or this Article 10 will be treated as an adjustment
to the Purchase Price unless otherwise required by applicable Law.

ARTICLE 11

pursuant to this Section 11.1(e) shall not be available to the Buyer if the
Buyer is in breach of any provision of this Agreement, and such breach is not
waived by the Seller or cured in accordance with the terms of this Agreement,
such that a closing condition set forth in Article 9 would not be satisfied.

11.2 Effect of Termination. In the event of termination of this Agreement
pursuant to Section 11.1, (a) this Agreement shall forthwith become void and
have no further force and effect, except for the provisions of Section 11.3
and Article 12, and (b) there shall be no liability under this Agreement on
the part of the Buyer (except as set forth in Section 11.3 or the Seller or
any of their respective officers or directors, and all rights and obligations
of each Party shall cease; provided, however, that nothing herein shall
relieve any party from liability for fraud or any willful breach hereof;
provided further that if this Agreement is terminated prior to the Closing,
then the Seller will not have any liability for any breaches of any
representations, warranties or covenants hereunder; provided further, that the
obligations of the parties under the Confidentiality Agreement shall continue
in full force and effect. The Parties agree not to bring any lawsuit, action
or claim against any other Party inconsistent with the foregoing provisions of
this Section 11.2.

 11.3 Termination Fee.

(a) In the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section
11.1(d), then the Buyer shall pay within five (5) Business Days following such
termination, by wire transfer of same day funds to an account designated by
the Seller, an amount equal to $26,600,000 (the "Termination Fee").

(b) Each Party confirms that each event or circumstance giving rise to the
obligation to pay the Termination Fee would cause significant damage to the
Selling Group and their respective Affiliates that would be inherently
difficult to quantify and prove, and that the Termination Fee provided for
hereunder is intended to provide fair compensation in response to that damage,
is not intended to be punitive, and is reasonable in amount in relation to the
circumstances under which it would become payable.

11.4 Deferred French Closing Termination. To the extent the Irrevocable Offer
is accepted by the French Selling Affiliate, the "Outside Date" for purposes
of Section 11.1(b) as applied to the Deferred French Closing shall be August
11, 2015. If this Agreement is terminated in accordance with this Article 11
with respect to the Deferred French Closing, the Seller shall repay to the
Buyer the portion of the Preliminary Purchase Price allocated to the French
Assets as set forth in Schedule 7.2(a).

12.3 Rights Confined to Parties. Except as provided in Section 6.2(b), Section
6.6(a)(iii), Section 6.6(e), Section 6.6(g)(iii), Section 6.6(h)(v), Section
6.6(j), Article 10 and this

 Article 12 nothing expressed or implied herein is intended or shall be
construed to confer upon or give to any Person, other than the Parties, and
their successors and assigns as permitted hereunder, any right, remedy or
claim (whether legal or equitable) under, with respect to, or by reason of
this Agreement or of any term, covenant or condition hereto, and all the
terms, covenants, conditions, promises and agreements contained in this
Agreement shall be for the sole and exclusive benefit of the Parties and their
successors and assigns as permitted hereunder. The Lenders shall be third
party beneficiaries of, and entitled to enforce, Sections 12.3, 12.8 (last two
sentences), 12.9, 12.11, 12.17 or 12.18 and none of such sections shall be
amended without their prior written consent.

12.4 Entire Agreement. This Agreement, the Transaction Documents, the
Disclosure Schedules, the Confidentiality Agreement and the other documents to
be executed hereunder, constitute the entire understanding between the Parties
with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede any and all prior
agreements between the Parties (including all letters of intent) with respect
to the subject matter hereof.

12.5 Successors and Assigns. This Agreement is binding upon and inures to the
benefit of the Parties and their respective successors and assigns, but is not
assignable by any Party without the prior written consent of the Seller and
the Buyer; provided, however, that the Buyer may assign this Agreement to any
of its sources of Debt Financing as collateral security without the prior
written consent of the Seller; provided, further that no such assignment shall
relieve such assigning party of its obligations hereunder.

12.6 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid or
unenforceable, such invalidity or unenforceability shall not affect in any way
the validity or enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement. In
the event any provision of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable,
the Parties shall attempt to agree on a valid or enforceable provision that
shall be a reasonable substitute for such invalid or unenforceable provision
in light of the tenor of this Agreement and, on so agreeing, shall incorporate
such substitute provision in this Agreement.

12.7 Effect of Headings. The Article, Section and subsection headings
contained herein are for convenience only and shall not affect the
construction hereof.

12.8 Governing Law; Jurisdiction. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with and enforced under the laws of the State of
Delaware applicable to agreements to be made and to be performed entirely in
that State. Each of the Parties to this Agreement hereby expressly waives any
right it may have or acquire, now or in the future, to demand or seek the
application of a governing law other than the laws of the State of Delaware.
Subject to any binding determinations by the Accounting Firm provided for in
this Agreement and Section 12.14 below, each of the Parties to this Agreement
hereby consents to the jurisdiction of any federal court located in the
Northern District of Illinois and any state court located within Cook County,
Illinois and irrevocably agrees that all actions or proceedings arising out of
or relating to this Agreement shall be exclusively litigated in such courts.
Each of the Parties to this Agreement accepts for each of itself and in
connection with its properties, generally and unconditionally, the exclusive
jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts and hereby expressly waives any right
they may have or acquire, now or in the future, to submit disputes hereunder
to any other court or forum by reason of their current or future domiciles,
the location of their assets, their seat of management or otherwise,

 and waives any defense of forum non conveniens, and irrevocably agrees to be
bound by any final, non-appealable judgment rendered thereby in connection
with this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, each party to this Agreement hereby agrees that the Debt Financing
and the performance thereof by the Lenders shall be governed by the laws of
the State of New York without giving effect to any conflict of laws provision
or rule (whether of the State of New York or any other jurisdiction) that
would cause the application of the law of any other jurisdiction other than
the State of New York. In addition each party hereto agrees that it shall
bring any action or proceeding in respect of any claim arising out of or
related to the Debt Financing or the transactions or contemplated thereby,
exclusively in the United States District Court for the Southern District of
New York or any New York State court located in the Borough of Manhattan in
New York City.

12.9 Amendments. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in
writing signed by the Seller and the Buyer. No supplement, alteration or
modification of this Agreement will be binding unless executed in writing by
the Parties. To the extent any amendment, modification or supplement to
Sections 12.3, 12.8 (last two sentences), 12.9, 12.11, 12.17 or 12.18 is
sought which is adverse to the rights of a Lender, the prior consent of the
Lenders shall be required before such amendment, modification or supplement is
rendered effective.

12.10 Time of Essence. With regard to all dates and time periods set forth or
referred to in this Agreement, time is of the essence.

12.11 Waivers. At any time prior to the Closing, any Party hereto may (a)
extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of
any other Party or (b) waive compliance with any of the agreements of any
other Party or with any conditions to its own obligations. Any agreement on
the part of a Party hereto to any such extension or waiver will be valid if
set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of both the Seller and
the Buyer. The consummation of the Transactions will not be deemed a waiver of
the right any Party may have hereunder with respect to any other Party's
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in or related
to this Agreement being incorrect, untrue or breached. To the extent any
waiver to 12.3, 12.8 (last two sentences), 12.9, 12.11, 12.17 or 12.18 is
sought which is adverse to the rights of a Lender, the prior consent of the
Lenders shall be required before such waiver is rendered effective.

12.12 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, each of which when so executed will be deemed an original but
all of which together will constitute one and the same instrument. Delivery of
an executed counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by facsimile
transmission or by electronic transmission of a .pdf or other electronic file
shall be as effective as delivery of a manually signed counterpart of this
Agreement.

12.13 Costs. Except as otherwise provided herein, all costs and expenses
incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions (including the
fees and expenses of financial advisors, accountants and legal counsel): (a)
if incurred by the Buyer or any of its Buying Affiliates, will be paid by the
Buyer, and (b) if incurred by the Seller or any of its Selling Affiliates,
will be paid by the Seller prior to the Closing Date or fully accrued as of
such date; provided, however, that (x) the Buyer and the Seller will each pay
one-half of any and all filing fees payable in connection

 with any required antitrust or competition filings and (y) except as otherwise
expressly provided herein, the Buyer will pay or reimburse the Seller for one-
half of any one-time costs, fees or expenses incurred by the Seller or any of
its Selling Affiliates in connection with the consummation of the Transaction
(excluding (i) the fees and expenses of financial advisors, accountants and
legal counsel, (ii) all costs associated with the return to the Seller or any
of its Selling Affiliates of Accounts Receivable by ARC (as such term is
defined in Schedule 1.1(f), and (iii) payments to Business Employees);
provided further that the Buyer's Liability for such one-time costs, fees or
expenses shall not exceed $1 million.

12.14 Agreement to Negotiate and Mediate. In the event a dispute arises under
this Agreement, any demands, claims or controversies arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or the breach thereof shall be settled by
attempting a voluntary settlement first through negotiations, and then non-
binding mediation before resorting to the filing of a lawsuit. The Parties
shall promptly attempt to resolve any dispute by negotiations between the
Buyer and the Seller. Either of the Buyer and the Seller may give the other
Party written Notice of any dispute not resolved in the normal course of
business. Representatives of the Seller (who shall include the Seller's
General Counsel, Chief Financial Officer, or Vice-President/Treasurer) and the
Buyer shall meet at a mutually acceptable time and place within thirty (30)
days after delivery of such Notice, and thereafter as often as they reasonably
deem necessary, to exchange relevant information and to attempt to resolve the
dispute. If a Party intends to be accompanied at a meeting by legal counsel,
the other Party shall be given at least ten (10) Business Days prior Notice of
such intention and may also be accompanied by legal counsel. If the dispute
has not been resolved by these Persons within sixty (60) days of the disputing
Party's Notice, or if the Parties fail to meet within such thirty (30) day
period, either the Buyer or the Seller may initiate non-binding mediation by
filing a written demand for mediation with the other. The Seller shall select
a mediator to mediate in accordance with the provisions of this Section 12.14
("Mediator") reasonably acceptable to the Buyer. The cost of the Mediator
shall be borne equally by the Buyer (on the one hand) and the Seller (on the
other hand). The Parties covenant that they shall participate in the mediation
in good faith. The Mediator will be disqualified as a witness, consultant or
expert for any Party. The Mediator will treat the offers, promises, conduct
and statements made in the course of the non-binding mediation (including pre-
mediation and post-mediation submissions to the Mediator) as confidential and
will refrain from disclosing such information except to the Parties.

12.15 Specific Performance. The Parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the
Parties would be irreparably damaged if any of the provisions of this
Agreement are not performed in accordance with their specific terms or are
otherwise breached and that any nonperformance or breach of this Agreement by
any Party could not be adequately compensated by monetary damages alone and
that the Parties would not have any adequate remedy at law. Accordingly, in
addition to any other right or remedy to which any Party may be entitled, at
law or in equity (including monetary damages), such Party shall be entitled to
enforce any provision of this Agreement by a decree of specific performance
and to temporary, preliminary and permanent injunctive relief to prevent
breaches or threatened breaches of any of the provisions of this Agreement
without posting any bond or other undertaking. The parties hereto agree that
they will not contest the appropriateness of specific performance as a remedy.

 12.16 Disclosure Schedules. Except with respect to any Disclosed Additional
Matter, which is governed by Section 6.7, the disclosure of any matter in any
section or subsection of the Disclosure Schedules shall be deemed to be a
disclosure under the Disclosure Schedules for all purposes of this Agreement
to which such matter could reasonably be expected to be pertinent. The mere
inclusion of any item in any section or subsection of any of the Disclosure
Schedules, as an exception to any representation or warranty or otherwise
shall not be deemed to constitute an admission by any of the Parties, as
applicable, or to otherwise imply, that any such item has had or is reasonably
likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect or
otherwise represents an exception or material fact, event or circumstance for
the purposes of this Agreement, that such item meets or exceeds a monetary or
other threshold specified for disclosure in this Agreement or that such item
represents a determination that the Transactions require the consent of any
third party. The sections or subsections of each Disclosure Schedule are
arranged in sections corresponding to the numbered and lettered sections and
subsections of this Agreement. Matters disclosed in any section or subsection
of any of the Disclosure Schedules are not necessarily limited to matters that
are required by this Agreement to be disclosed therein. Such additional
matters are set forth for informational purposes only and do not necessarily
include other matters of a similar nature or impose any duty or obligation to
disclose any information beyond what is required by this Agreement, and
disclosure of such additional matters shall not affect, directly or
indirectly, the interpretation of this Agreement or the scope of the
disclosure obligations hereunder. To the extent cross-references are set forth
in any section or subsection of any of the Disclosure Schedules, such cross-
references are intended solely for convenience and are by no means intended as
a statement of limitation as to where disclosure is relevant or appropriate,
and any information set forth in one section or subsection of such disclosure
schedule shall be deemed to apply to each other section or subsection thereof
or hereof to which its relevance could reasonably be expected to be pertinent.
The reference to any Contract or other documents or materials in any section
or subsection of any of the Disclosure Schedules shall be deemed to
incorporate by reference, for all purposes set forth in this Section 12.16 and
the remainder of this Agreement, all terms and conditions of, and schedules
and annexes to, such Contract or other document to the extent made available,
prior to the date of this Agreement, to the Buyer and its representatives or
the Seller and its representatives, as applicable. Headings inserted in the
sections or subsections of any of the Disclosure Schedules are for convenience
of reference only and shall to no extent have the effect of amending or
changing the express terms of the Sections or subsections as set forth in this
Agreement.

12.17 No Recourse; Waiver of Claims. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, the Selling Group and each of its Affiliates hereby waives any
rights or claims against any Lender in connection with this Agreement, the
Debt Financing or the Debt Commitment Letter, whether at law or equity, in
contract, in tort or otherwise, and the Selling Group and each of its
Affiliates agrees not to commence a proceeding against any Lender in
connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereunder
(including any proceeding relating to the Debt Financing or the Debt
Commitment Letters). In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing
waiver, it is agreed that no Lender shall have any liability for any claims,
losses, settlements, liabilities, damages, costs, expenses, fines or penalties
to the Selling Group or any Affiliate of the Selling Group in connection with
this Agreement, the Debt Financing or the Transactions. Nothing in this
Section 12.17 shall in any way (a) expand the circumstances in which the Buyer
may be liable under this Agreement or as a result of the Transactions
(including as a result

 of the Debt Financing) or (b) limit or qualify the obligations and liabilities
of the parties to the Debt Commitment Letter or the definitive financing
agreements to each other thereunder or in connection therewith. The Seller
Group shall not cause or permit any of their Affiliates to take any action or
position inconsistent with the provisions of this Section 12.17.

12.18 Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES TRIAL BY JURY IN
ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM BROUGHT BY ANY OF THEM AGAINST ANY
LENDER ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH THIS AGREEMENT, OR ANY
OTHER AGREEMENT EXECUTED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH (INCLUDING THE DEBT
FINANCING), OR THE ADMINISTRATION THEREOF, OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREIN OR THEREIN (INCLUDING THE DEBT FINANCING). NO PARTY TO
THIS AGREEMENT SHALL SEEK A JURY TRIAL IN ANY LAWSUIT, PROCEEDING,
COUNTERCLAIM, OR ANY OTHER LITIGATION PROCEDURE AGAINST A LENDER BASED UPON,
OR ARISING OUT OF, THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY RELATED INSTRUMENT. NO PARTY WILL
SEEK TO CONSOLIDATE ANY SUCH ACTION, IN WHICH A JURY TRIAL HAS BEEN WAIVED,
WITH ANY OTHER ACTION IN WHICH A JURY TRIAL CANNOT BE OR HAS NOT BEEN WAIVED.
THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION HAVE BEEN FULLY DISCUSSED BY THE PARTIES
HERETO, AND THESE PROVISIONS SHALL BE SUBJECT TO NO EXCEPTIONS. NO PARTY HAS
IN ANY WAY AGREED WITH OR REPRESENTED TO ANY OTHER PARTY THAT THE PROVISIONS
OF THIS SECTION WILL NOT BE FULLY ENFORCED IN ALL INSTANCES. EACH PARTY HAS
BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL
WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 12.18.
