-vii- AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION

 

THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION (this " _Agreement_ ") is made and
entered into as of April 26, 2018 by and among Square, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (" _Parent_ "), Forest Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation
and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ _I_ "), Forest Merger
LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly-owned subsidiary of
Parent (" _Merger Sub II_ " and, together with Merger Sub I, the " _Merger
Subs_ "), Weebly, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "), and
Shareholder Representative Services LLC, a Colorado limited liability
company, solely in its capacity as representative of the Indemnifying Parties
(the " _Stockholder Representative_ "). All capitalized terms that are used
but not defined herein shall have the respective meanings ascribed thereto in
_Annex A_.

WITNESSETH

 

WHEREAS, Parent, Merger Subs and the Company wish to effect a business
combination through the statutory merger of Merger Sub I with and into the
Company, pursuant to which the Company would become a wholly-owned subsidiary
of Parent (the " _First Merger_ "), on the terms and conditions set forth in
this Agreement and in accordance with the Delaware General Corporation
Law, as amended (the " _DGCL_ "), and, as part of the same overall
transaction, the Company would then merge with and into Merger Sub II (the "
_Second Merger_ " and, together with the First Merger, the " _Mergers_ "), on
the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and in accordance with
the DGCL and the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act, as amended (the "
_DLLC_ ");

 

WHEREAS, the board of directors of the Company has approved this Agreement, by
a unanimous vote of those directors participating in such vote, the Mergers
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and determined that
this Agreement, the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement are advisable and in the best interests of its stockholders;

 

WHEREAS, the board of directors of Merger Sub I and the sole member and
manager of Merger Sub II has approved this Agreement, the Mergers and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

WHEREAS, Parent, Merger Subs and the Company desire to make
certain representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection
with the Mergers, and also to prescribe various conditions to the First
Merger;

 

WHEREAS, it is intended that, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, (i) the
Mergers will be treated as integrated steps in a single transaction, and will
qualify as a tax-free reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of
the Code and (ii) this Agreement shall constitute, and is adopted as, a plan
of reorganization within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section
1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3;

 

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and
as a condition to the willingness of, and an inducement to, Parent and Merger
Subs to enter into this Agreement, certain stockholders of the Company have
executed and delivered to Parent Joinder Agreements in the form attached
hereto as _Exhibit A_ (the " _Joinder Agreements_ ") and Investor Suitability
Documentation (as defined below);

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and
as a condition to the willingness of, and an inducement to, Parent and Merger
Subs to enter into this Agreement, each of the employees of the Company set
forth on Schedule I (the " _Key Employees_ ") have executed and delivered to
Parent an employment agreement (the " _Key Employee Employment Agreements_ ")
and Proprietary

 



-1-  Information Agreement (as defined below) and each of the employees of the
Company set forth on Schedule II (the " _Founders_ ") has executed and
delivered a noncompetition agreement substantially in the form attached
hereto as _Exhibit B_ (the " _Non-Competition and Non-Solicitation
Agreements_") in each case, to be effective as of the Closing (as defined
below);

WHEREAS, as a further condition and inducement to Parents and Merger Subs
willingness to enter into this Agreement, each Founder (which term will
include any trusts or other Affiliate entities established by any Founder
which holds Company Capital Stock) shall have agreed to subject a portion of
the aggregate Merger Consideration payable with respect to their Company
Capital Stock in connection with the First Merger to a risk of forfeiture upon
the occurrence of certain events, and, concurrently with the execution and
delivery of this Agreement, each Founder has executed and delivered a Founder
Consideration Holdback Agreement (as defined below), in each case, to be
effective as of the Closing; and

WHEREAS, immediately following the execution and delivery of this Agreement,
it is anticipated that Stockholders holding a sufficient type and number of
shares of Company Capital Stock to adopt this Agreement under the DGCL, the
Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws will execute and deliver to the
Company, and the Company shall thereafter deliver to Parent, a true, correct
and complete copy of the Stockholder Written Consent (as defined below), which
will constitute the Requisite Stockholder Approval (as defined below).

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual agreements, covenants and other
premises set forth herein, the mutual benefits to be gained by the
performance thereof, and for other good and valuable consideration, the
receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties agree as
follows:

-4- (b) _Company Capital Stock._ __

 

(i) _Generally_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the First Merger and
without any action on the part of Parent, the Merger Subs, the Company, the
Stockholders or any other Person, each share of Company Capital Stock
(excluding (A) Cancelled Shares, which shall be treated in the manner set

Preferred Stock), (x) the Per Share Common Cash Consideration and the Per
Share Common Stock Consideration, and (y) at such time as the final Total
Consideration is determined in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 1.4_, any
Adjustment Consideration, if payable, in each case upon the terms set forth in
this  _Section_ __ _ 1.3_ and throughout this Agreement (including the
Escrow Amount set forth in _Section_ __ _ 2.3(b)(ii)_ and the Representative

1.4_, any Adjustment Consideration, if payable, in each case upon the terms
set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 1.3_ and throughout this Agreement
(including the Escrow Amount set forth in _Section_ __ _ 2.3(b)(ii)_ and the
Representative Expense Fund set forth in _Section_ __ _ 2.3(b)(iii)_) and

(D) Until so surrendered, each Company Stock Certificate that is
outstanding after the Effective Time shall be deemed, for all purposes after
the Effective Time, to evidence only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration payable pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 1.3(b)(i)_. For
purposes of calculating the aggregate amount of Merger Consideration payable
to each Stockholder pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 1.3(b)(i)_, (x) all
shares of the Company Capital Stock held by each such Stockholder shall be
aggregated on a certificate-by-certificate basis, (y) the amount of cash (if

a share of Parent Class A Common Stock shall receive, in lieu thereof, an
amount of cash equal to the product obtained by  _multiplying_ (A) such
fraction _by_ (B) the Parent Trading Price, rounded down to the nearest whole
cent.

 



-5- (ii) _Cancelled Shares_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the First Merger
and without any action on the part of Parent, the Merger Subs, the Company or
the respective stockholders or members thereof, each share of Company Capital
Stock that is issued and outstanding and held by the Company or any Subsidiary
as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (" _Cancelled Shares_ ") shall
be cancelled without any consideration paid therefor.

 

(iii) _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this
Agreement to the contrary, any shares of Company Capital Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and with respect to which the holder
thereof has properly demanded appraisal rights in accordance with Section 262
of the DGCL and/or dissenters rights in accordance with Chapter 13 of the
CCC, and who has not effectively withdrawn or lost such holders appraisal
rights under the DGCL (collectively, the " _Dissenting Shares_ "), shall not
be converted into or represent a right to receive the applicable
consideration for Company Capital Stock set forth in _Section_ __ _ 1.3(b)(_
_i_ _)_ , but the holder thereof shall only be entitled to such rights as are
provided by the DGCL and/or the CCC. Notwithstanding the provisions of this
_Section_ __ _ 1.3(b)(iii)_, if any holder of Dissenting Shares shall
effectively withdraw or lose (through failure to perfect or otherwise) such
holders appraisal rights under the DGCL and/or dissenters rights under the
CCC, then, as of the later of the Effective Time and the occurrence of such
event, such holders shares shall automatically be converted into and
represent only the right to receive the consideration for Company Capital
Stock, as applicable, set forth in _Section_ __ _ 1.3(b)(_ _i_ _)_ , without
interest thereon, and subject to the Escrow Amount set forth in _Section_ __ _
2.3(b)(ii)_ and the Representative Expense Fund set forth in _Section_ __ _
2.3(b)(iii)_, upon surrender of the certificate representing such shares. The
Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any written demand for appraisal
received by the Company pursuant to the applicable provisions of the DGCL
and/or the CCC. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent
of Parent, not to be unreasonably withheld, make any payment with respect to
any such demands or offer to settle or settle any such demands. Any
communication to be made by the Company to any Stockholder with respect to
such demands shall be submitted to Parent in advance of responding to such
Stockholder and the Company shall consider in good faith all
reasonable comments made by Parent reasonably promptly.

(c) _Company Options_.

 

(i) _Company Options_. Effective as of the Effective Time, each Company Option
with an exercise price per share less than the Cash Equivalent Consideration
shall be cancelled on the Effective Time and, subject to the holder of such
Company Option executing an Accrued Employee Amount Payment Acknowledgement
(if applicable), converted automatically into the right to receive (x) the
Per Share Common Consideration and (y) at such time as the final Total
Consideration is determined in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 1.4_, any
Adjustment Consideration, if payable, in respect of each Net Option Share
covered by such Company Option; _provided_ that, in lieu of the Per Share
Common Consideration, any fractional Net Option Share (after aggregating all
shares represented by all Company Options held by such individual) shall be
settled solely in cash, based on the Cash Equivalent Consideration (such
consideration being hereinafter referred to as the " _Option Consideration_ ")
upon the terms set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 1.3_ and throughout
this Agreement (including the Escrow Amount set forth in _Section_ __ _
2.3(b)(ii)_ and the Representative Expense Fund set forth in _Section_ __ _
2.3(b)(iii)_), in each case, subject to  _Section_ __ _ 2.4_. If the
exercise price per share of any such Company Option is equal to or greater
than the Cash Equivalent Consideration, such Company Option shall be cancelled
on the Effective Time without any payment being made in respect thereof. The
applicable taxes required to be withheld from the Option Consideration shall
reduce first the Per Share Common Cash Consideration portion of the Option
Consideration with any remaining amount reducing the Per Share Common Stock
Consideration portion of the Option Consideration, with the value of the stock
portion for purposes of such deduction determined based on the closing price
of a share of Parent Class A Common Stock on the date such obligation becomes
due.

 



-6- (ii) _Necessary_ _Actions_. Prior to the Effective Time, and subject to the
prior review and approval of Parent, the Company shall take all actions
necessary to accelerate any unvested portion of Company Options and to effect
the transactions anticipated by this _Section_ __ _ 1.3(c)_ under the Plan
and any Contract applicable to any Company Option (whether written or oral,
formal or informal), including the determination by the administrator of the
Plan that the treatment of Company Options as contemplated by this  _Section_
__ _ 1.3(c)_ is permissible under the terms of the Plan and the applicable
equity award agreements, delivering all required notices, obtaining all
necessary approvals and consents, and delivering evidence satisfactory
to Parent that all necessary determinations by the Companys Board of
Directors or applicable committee of the Companys Board of Directors to cash
out, terminate or provide for the substitution of all Company Options in
accordance with this  _Section_ __ _ 1.3(c)(ii)_ have been made.

(d) _Company Warrants_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the First Merger
and without any action on the part of Parent, the Merger Subs, the Company,
the Stockholders or any other Person, each Company Warrant that is unexpired,
unexercised and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
cancelled and converted automatically into the right to receive (y) the
excess of the Per Share Common Cash Consideration and the Per Share Common
Stock Consideration over the exercise price of such Company Warrant, and (z)
at such time as the final Total Consideration is determined in accordance
with _Section_ __ _ 1.4_, any Adjustment Consideration, if payable, in each
case upon the terms set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 1.3_ and throughout this
Agreement (including the Escrow Amount set forth in _Section_ __ _
2.3(b)(ii)_ and the Representative Expense Fund set forth in _Section_ __ _
2.3(b)(iii)_).

 

(e) _Unaccredited Investors_.

 

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section_ __ _ 1.3_ or
otherwise in this Agreement, in no event shall Parent be required to issue
any shares of Parent Class A Common Stock to any Person (i) that does not
provide duly completed and executed Investor Suitability Documentation, or
(ii) that Parent has determined prior to the Closing, in its sole discretion,
is an Unaccredited Investor. To the extent such Investor Suitability
Documentation is not provided or Parent has made such determination regarding
Unaccredited Investor status, Parent shall inform the Company of
such determination prior to the Closing and the Company shall indicate on the
Payment Spreadsheet that such Person has not provided the Investor Suitability
Documentation or is an Unaccredited Investor.

 

(ii) To the extent any such Person would otherwise have been entitled to be
issued shares of Parent Class A Common Stock as consideration or otherwise
under this Agreement or any Related Agreement in connection with the First
Merger, including without limitation any Per Share Common Stock Consideration,
Adjustment Consideration, Per Share Series B Liquidation Stock Consideration,
or Per Share Series C Liquidation Stock Consideration issuable pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 1.3(b)(_ _i_ _)_ , Parent shall be entitled, in its sole
discretion, to pay such amounts in cash, rather than issuing shares of Parent
Class A Common Stock, with the amount of cash payable equal to the value of
the shares of Parent Class A Common Stock (having a value per share equal to
the Parent Trading Price) that would have otherwise been issuable had such
Person provided the Investor Suitability Documentation and been determined to
be an Accredited Investor (a " _Cash-out Election_"). Parent shall also be
entitled to a Cash-out Election to the extent necessary to reduce the amount
of Parent Class A Common Stock receivable by any particular Person and its
Affiliates to be below 1% of the outstanding number of Parent Class A Common
Stock.

(iii) In the event of a Cash-out Election, the Per Share Common
Cash Consideration, Adjustment Consideration, the Per Share Series B
Liquidation Cash Consideration and the

 



-7-  Per Share Series C Liquidation Cash Consideration shall be equitably
adjusted downwards, and the Per Share Common Stock Consideration, the
Adjustment Consideration, Per Share Series B Liquidation Stock Consideration
and Per Share Series C Liquidation Stock Consideration shall be respectively
and equitably adjusted upwards (at a value per share equal to the Parent
Trading Price), such that in the aggregate, the amount of cash payable
as Merger Consideration and the amount of Parent Class A Common Stock payable
as Merger Consideration (at a value per share equal to the Parent Trading
Price), each equal fifty percent (50%) of the aggregate Merger Consideration.
The allocation of cash and shares of Parent Class A Common Stock to be
withheld and contributed to the Escrow Amount shall also be equitably adjusted
in the same proportion as the adjustments to the foregoing sentence. For
avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the adjustment contemplated by this
_Section_ __ _ 1.3(e_ _)(_ _iii)_ result in either an increase or decrease in
the aggregate Merger Consideration (assuming that each share of Parent Class A
Common Stock is valued at a value per share equal to the Parent Trading
Price).

1.4 _Determination of Consideration; Post-Closing Total
Consideration Adjustment_.

(a) _Determination of Consideration_

 

(i) At least four (4) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company
will deliver to Parent a written statement in a form reasonably acceptable to
Parent (the " _Estimated Closing Statement_ ") setting forth in reasonable
detail the Companys good faith estimate of (A) Closing Net Working Capital,
(B) Closing Cash, (C) Closing Indebtedness, (D) Unpaid Third Party Expenses,
and (E) a calculation of Total Common Consideration based on the foregoing
estimates, accompanied by reasonably detailed back-up documentation for
such calculations in (A) to (E) above. The Company shall give Parent a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Estimated Closing
Statement, and shall take in consideration in good faith any comments of
Parent on the Estimated Closing Statement.

(b) _Post-Closing Purchase Price Adjustment_.

 

(i) As promptly as practicable but in no event later than sixty (60) calendar
days after the Closing Date, Parent shall prepare and deliver to the
Stockholder Representative a statement (the " _Post-Closing Statement_ ")
setting forth in reasonable detail Parents good faith calculation of (A)
Closing Net Working Capital, (B) Closing Cash, (C) Closing Indebtedness, and
(D) Unpaid Third Party Expenses.

(c) _Review of Post-Closing Statement_. The Stockholder Representative shall
have thirty (30) days following its receipt of the Post-Closing Statement (the
" _Review Period_ ") to review the Post-Closing Statement, together with
information provided in accordance with this  _Section_ __ _ 1.4(c)_ (which
shall be promptly provided by the Stockholder Representative). On or before
the expiration of the Review Period, the Stockholder Representative shall
deliver to Parent a written statement accepting or disputing the Post-Closing
Statement. In the event that the Stockholder Representative shall dispute the
Post-Closing Statement, such statement shall include a detailed itemization of
the Stockholder Representatives objections and the reasons therefor (such
statement, a " _Dispute Statement_ "). Any component of the Post-Closing
Statement that is not disputed in a Dispute Statement shall be final and
binding on the parties hereto and not subject to appeal. If the
Stockholder Representative does not deliver a Dispute Statement to Parent
within the Review Period or delivers a statement accepting the Post-Closing
Statement, the Post-Closing Statement shall be final and binding on the
parties hereto and not subject to appeal.

(d) _Dispute Resolution_. If the Stockholder Representative delivers a Dispute
Statement during the Review Period, Parent and the Stockholder Representative
shall promptly meet and attempt in good faith to resolve their differences
with respect to the disputed items set forth in the Dispute Statement during
the thirty (30) calendar days immediately following Parents receipt of the
Dispute

 



-8-  Statement, or such longer period as Parent and the Stockholder
Representative may mutually agree (the " _Resolution Period_ "). Any such
disputed items that are resolved by Parent and the Stockholder Representative
during the Resolution Period shall be final and binding on the parties hereto
and not subject to appeal. If Parent and the Stockholder Representative do not
resolve all such disputed items by the end of the Resolution Period, Parent
and the Stockholder Representative shall submit all items remaining in dispute
with respect to the Dispute Statement to Deloitte or any other nationally
recognized independent accounting firm upon which Parent and the Stockholder
Representative shall reasonably agree (the " _Accounting Firm_ ") for review
and resolution. The Accounting Firm shall act as an expert and not an
arbitrator. The Accounting Firm shall make all calculations in
accordance with the practices used in preparation of the Post-Closing
Statement, shall determine only those items remaining in dispute between
Parent and the Stockholder Representative, and shall only be permitted or
authorized to determine an amount with respect to any such disputed item that
is either the amount of such disputed item as proposed by Parent in the Post-
Closing Statement or the amount of such disputed item as proposed by the
Stockholder Representative in the Dispute Statement. Each of Parent and the
Stockholder Representative shall (i) enter into a customary engagement letter
with the Accounting Firm at the time such dispute is submitted to the
Accounting Firm and otherwise cooperate with the Accounting Firm, (ii)
have the opportunity to submit a written statement in support of their
respective positions with respect to such disputed items, to provide
supporting material to the Accounting Firm in defense of their respective
positions with respect to such disputed items and to submit a written
statement responding to the other partys position with respect to such
disputed items and (iii) subject to customary confidentiality and indemnity
agreements, provide the Accounting Firm with access to their respective
books, records, personnel and representatives and such other information as
the Accounting Firm may require in order to render its determination. The
Accounting Firm shall be instructed to deliver to Parent and the
Stockholder Representative a written determination (such determination to
include a worksheet setting forth all material calculations used in arriving
at such determination and to be based solely on information provided to the
Accounting Firm by Parent and the Stockholder Representative) of the disputed
items within thirty (30) calendar days of receipt of the disputed items, which
determination shall, absent manifest error, be final and binding on the
parties hereto and not subject to appeal. The costs, fees and expenses of the
Accounting Firm relating to a dispute pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 1.4(d)_
shall be borne equally by Parent and the Stockholder Representative (on behalf
of the Indemnifying Parties).

 

(e) _Post-Closing Payments_.

 

(i) If the Total Consideration as finally determined pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 1.4_ is greater than the estimated Total Consideration
contained in the Estimated Closing Statement (the amount of such difference,
the " _Adjustment Amount_ "), no later than four (4) Business Days after the
final Total Consideration has been determined, then Parent shall deposit or
shall cause to be deposited with the Payment Agent, an amount of cash and a
number of shares of Parent Class A Common Stock, for payment to such
Stockholders and holders of Company Options and Company Warrants
in accordance with the additional amounts that each such holder would have
received had the Adjustment Amount been included in the Total Consideration at
the time of Closing (such amounts, the " _Adjustment Consideration_ "). For
the avoidance of doubt, the Adjustment Consideration shall be paid fifty
percent (50%) in cash and fifty percent (50%) in shares of Parent Class A
Common Stock (valued at the Parent Trading Price).

 

(ii) If the Total Consideration as finally determined pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 1.4_ is less than the estimated Total Consideration contained
in the Estimated Closing Statement, then Parent shall deduct from the Escrow
Amount an amount in cash and stock equal to the amount of such deficit, which
shall be deducted from Stockholders and holders of Company Options
and Company Warrants in accordance with the amount that such holders would
have not received had such deficit been reduced from the Total Consideration
at the time of Closing (it being understood that such reduction shall not be
in accordance with such holders Pro Rata Portions). For avoidance of doubt,
(x) any recovery of

 



-9-  any such deficit from the Escrow Amount shall not be subject to any of the
limitations on indemnification set forth in _Section_ __ _ 9.3_ and (y) any
amount deducted from the Escrow Amount shall be deducted fifty percent (50%)
in cash and fifty percent (50%) in shares of Parent Class A Common Stock
(valued at the Parent Trading Price).

 

(f) _Tax Treatment_. Any payment made under this _Section_ __ _ 1.4_, to the
maximum extent permitted by applicable U.S. federal and applicable state and
local income Tax Law, shall be treated as an adjustment to the Total
Consideration, as finally determined pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.4_.

 

1.5 _Further_ _Action_. If at any time after the Effective Time, any further
action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement
and to vest the First-Step Surviving Company with full right, title and
possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises
of the Company, or to vest Parent with full right, title and possession to
all of the Company Capital Stock, then each of the First-Step Surviving
Company, Parent and the officers and directors of each of the First-Step
Surviving Company and Parent are fully authorized in the name of their
respective corporations or otherwise to take, and will take, all such lawful
and necessary action.

2.4 _Withholding Taxes_. The Company, the Payment Agent, Parent and the
Surviving Company (the " _Withholding Agents_ ") shall be entitled to deduct
and withhold from any consideration payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant
to this Agreement such amounts as may be required to be deducted or withheld
therefrom under any provision of federal, local or foreign Tax or other
applicable Law. To the extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld, and
duly paid to the appropriate Governmental Entity in accordance with applicable
Law, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as
having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been
paid. To the extent that such amounts are not so deducted and withheld, such
Person shall indemnify the applicable Withholding Agent for any amounts
(other than interest and penalties) imposed by a Governmental Entity and paid
by such Withholding Agent to the appropriate Governmental Entity on behalf of
such Person.

 

2.5 _Tax Consequences_. The Mergers are intended to be treated as integrated
steps in a single transaction and together to qualify as a "reorganization"
within the meaning of Section 368(a)(1) of the Code, and this Agreement is
intended to constitute a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of
Treasury Regulations Sections 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3. Each party hereto shall
cause all Tax Returns relating to the Mergers to be filed on the basis of
treating the Mergers as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section
368(a)(1) of the Code, including filing the statement required by Treasury
Regulations Section 1.368-3, unless otherwise required by a "determination"
within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code); provided that if a Tax
authority requires that the Mergers not be treated as a "reorganization"
within the meaning of Section 368(a)(1) in an ongoing audit of Parent, that
portion of the audit shall be

 



-19-  treated as a Tax Claim under _Section_ __ _ 7.5(c)_ and Parent shall not be
required to defend the treatment of the Mergers as a "reorganization" within
the meaning of Section 368(a)(1) unless the Stockholders Representative (on
behalf of the Indemnifying Parties) bears the reasonable expenses incurred by
Parent to defend such treatment. Each party hereto will not knowingly take any
action that would reasonably be expected to prevent the Mergers from
qualifying as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Code. Except for the covenants in this _Section_ __ _ 2.5_ and the
representations set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 4.1_, _Section_ __ _ 4.5_ and
_Section_ __ _ 4.6(b)_ of this Agreement, none of Parent, Merger Sub I,
Merger Sub II or any of their Affiliates makes any representations
or warranties to the Company or to any securityholder of the Company
regarding the Tax treatment of the Mergers, or any of the Tax consequences to
the Company or any securityholder of the Company of this Agreement, the
Mergers or any of the other transactions or agreements contemplated hereby.
The Company acknowledges that the Company and the securityholders of the
Company are relying solely on their own Tax advisors in connection with this
Agreement, the Mergers and the other transactions and agreements contemplated
hereby.

2.6 _Outstanding Loans_. In the event that any Person entitled to
consideration hereunder has outstanding loans from the Company or any
Subsidiary as of the Effective Time, the consideration payable to such Person
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.3_ shall be reduced by an amount equal to the
outstanding principal plus accrued interest, if any, of such Persons loans
as of the Effective Time, plus any other amounts owed by such Person to the
Company or any Subsidiary (collectively, such Persons " _Loan Repayment
Amount_ "). Such loans shall be satisfied as to the amount by which the
consideration is reduced pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.6_. To the extent
the consideration payable to such Person is so reduced, such amount shall be
treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to such
Person.

complete copies of all election statements under Section 83(b) of the Code
that the Company has received from any of its employees, non-employee

performance of services if such shares were subject to a substantial risk of
forfeiture.

(n) _Withholding._ Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries: (i) has complied
in all material respects with all applicable Laws relating to the payment,

employment Tax withholding Laws.

(o) _Post-Closing Taxes._ Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary will be
required to include any item of income in, or exclude any item of deduction

(q) _Section_ __ _ 409A Matters_.

 

(i) Each Contract, agreement or arrangement between the Company or any ERISA
Affiliate and any Employee that is a "nonqualified deferred compensation
plan" (as such term is defined in Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code) subject to
Section 409A of the Code (or any state law equivalent) and the regulations and
guidance thereunder (" _Section_ __ _ 409A_") has been since January 1, 2015
maintained and operated in material compliance with Section 409A of the Code
(or any state law equivalent) and the regulations and guidance thereunder.
No compensation shall be includable in the gross income of any Employee as of
any date on or prior to the Effective Time as a result of the operation of
Section 409A of the Code with respect to any arrangements or agreements in
effect prior to the Effective Time. To the extent required, the Company and
each of its Subsidiaries has properly reported and/or withheld and remitted on
amounts deferred under any Company nonqualified deferred compensation plan
subject to Section 409A of the Code. There is no Contract to which the
Company or any Subsidiary is a party, including the provisions of this
Agreement, covering any Employee of the Company, which individually or
collectively could require the Company or any of its Affiliates to pay a Tax
gross up payment to, or otherwise indemnify or reimburse, any Employee for
Tax-related payments under Section 409A. There is no Contract to which the
Company or any Subsidiary is a party, including the provisions of this
Agreement, which, individually or collectively, could reasonably be expected
to give rise to a Parent, Company, Subsidiary Tax under Section 409A of the
Code or that would reasonably be expected to give rise to an employee Tax
and/or Company or Subsidiary reporting obligations under Section 409A of the
Code.

(ii) No Company Option or other stock right (as defined in U.S. Treasury
Department regulation 1.409A-1(l)) (i) has an exercise price that is less than
the fair market value of the underlying equity as of the date such option or
right was granted, (ii) has any feature for the deferral of compensation
other than the deferral of recognition of income until the later of exercise
or disposition of

 



-28-  such option or rights, (iii) has been granted after December 31, 2004, with
respect to any class of stock of the Company that is not "service recipient
stock" (within the meaning of applicable regulations under Section 409A), or
(iv) has ever been accounted for other than fully in accordance with GAAP in
the Companys audited financial statements provided to Parent.

 

(r) _T_ _ax Characterization of the Mergers_. Neither the Company nor any of
the Subsidiaries have taken any action, or have any knowledge of any fact or
circumstance, that would reasonably be expected to prevent the Mergers from
qualifying as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a)(1) of
the Code.

 

(s) Nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 3.10_ or otherwise in this Agreement shall
be construed as a representation or warranty with respect to (i) the amount
or availability of any net operating loss, capital loss, Tax credits, Tax
basis or other Tax asset or attribute of the Company or any Subsidiary in any
taxable period (or portion thereof) beginning after the Closing Date, except
as set forth in _Section_ __ _ 3.10(o)(v)_, or _(ii)_ any Tax position that
Parent or its Affiliates (including the Surviving Company and its
Subsidiaries) may take in respect of any taxable period (or portion thereof)
beginning after the Closing Date.

3.11 _Real Property_. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary owns any real
property or has ever owned any real property, nor is the Company or any
Subsidiary party to any Contract to purchase or sell any real property.
_Section_ __ _ 3.11_ of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth a list of all
real property currently leased, subleased or licensed by or from the Company
or any Subsidiary or otherwise used or occupied by the Company or any
Subsidiary (the " _Leased Real Property_ "). _Section_ __ _ 3.11_ of
the Disclosure Schedule sets forth a list of all leases, lease guaranties,
subleases, or other Contracts for the leasing, use or occupancy of, or
otherwise granting a right in or relating to the Leased Real Property,
including the name of the lessor, licensor, sublessor, master lessor and/or
lessee the date and term of the lease, license, sublease or other occupancy
right, the aggregate annual rental payable thereunder and all amendments,
terminations and modifications thereof (the " _Lease Agreements_ "). The
Company or any Subsidiary currently occupies all of the Leased Real Property
for the operation of its business. There are no other parties occupying, or
with a right to occupy, the Leased Real Property. Neither the Company nor any
Subsidiary owes brokerage commissions or finders fees with respect to any
such Leased Real Property or would owe any such fees if any existing Lease
Agreement were renewed pursuant to any renewal options contained in such
Lease Agreements or is party to any Contract or subject to any claim that may
require the payment of any real estate brokerage commission. The Company and
each of its Subsidiaries has performed all of its obligations under any
termination agreements pursuant to which it has terminated any leases,
subleases, licenses or other occupancy agreements for real property that are
no longer in effect and has no continuing liability with respect to such
terminated agreements. The Leased Real Property is in good operating
condition and repair, free from structural, physical and mechanical defects,
is maintained in a manner consistent with standards generally followed with
respect to similar properties, and is structurally sufficient and otherwise
suitable for the conduct of the Companys business. To the Companys
Knowledge, none of the Leased Real Property, including the improvements
thereon, violate in any material respect any applicable Law relating to such
property or operations thereon, and any such non-violation is not dependent
on so-called non-conforming use exceptions.

 

3.12 _Tangible Property_. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries has good
and valid title to, or, in the case of leased properties and assets, valid
leasehold interests in, all of its tangible properties and assets, real,
personal and mixed, used or held for use in its business, free and clear of
any Liens, except (a) as reflected in the Current Balance Sheet, (b) Liens
for Taxes (x) not yet due and payable or (y) being contested in good faith
through appropriate proceedings for which adequate reserves have been
established in accordance with GAAP, and (c) such imperfections of title and
encumbrances, if any, which do not detract from the value or interfere with
the present use of the property subject thereto or affected thereby. The
material items of equipment owned or leased by the Company or any Subsidiary
(i) are adequate for the conduct of the business of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as currently conducted, and (ii) in good operating condition,
regularly and properly maintained, subject to normal wear and tear.

 



-29- 3.13 _Intellectual Property_.

 

(a) _Company Products_. _Section_ __ _ 3.13(a)_ of the Disclosure Schedule
contains a true, correct and complete list of all Company Products, by name
and version number (if any), that are currently being distributed, offered,
made available, used, or supported, or are currently under development and
which the Company plans to make generally available within the next six (6)
months.

(b) _Section 3.13(b)(_ _i_ _)_ of the Disclosure Schedule contains a complete
and accurate list of all Company Registered IP (including the jurisdiction in
which each such item of Company Registered IP has been registered or filed,
the registered owner or assignee of such item, and the applicable
registration, application or serial number or similar identifier). _Section_
__ _ 3.13(b)(ii)_ of the Disclosure Schedule contains any proceedings or
actions (not including ordinary course prosecution proceedings or related
office actions) before any Governmental Entity (including the USPTO or
equivalent authority anywhere in the world) in which any of the Company IP is
involved, including any proceedings or actions in which claims are raised
relating to the validity, enforceability, scope, ownership, inventorship,
derivation, or infringement of any of the Company IP. All necessary
registration, maintenance and renewal fees in connection with Company
Registered IP that are or will be due for payment on or before the Closing
Date have been or will be timely paid and all necessary documents and
certificates in connection with Company Registered IP that are or will be due
for filing on or before the Closing Date have been or will be timely filed
with the relevant Governmental Entity in the U.S. and other
applicable jurisdictions, as the case may be, for the purposes of prosecuting
and maintaining such Company Registered IP. Except as may be identified on
_Section_ __ _ 3.13(b_ _)(_ _iii)_ there are no actions that must be taken by
the Company or any Subsidiary within 120 days of the Closing Date, including
the payment of any registration, maintenance, or renewal fees or the filing of
any documents, applications or certificates for the purposes of maintaining,
perfecting, or preserving or renewing any Company Registered IP. Neither the
Company nor any Subsidiary has claimed any special status, including "small
business status," in the application for or registration of any Registered IP.

 

(c) _Ownership; Enforceability; Assignments_. All Company IP is owned solely
and exclusively by the Company, free and clear of any Liens. To the Companys
Knowledge, there are no facts or circumstances that would reasonably be
expected to cause any item of Company Registered IP to be invalid or
unenforceable. In each case in which the Company has acquired ownership of
any Registered IP from any Person, the Company has obtained a valid and
enforceable assignment sufficient to irrevocably transfer all rights therein
or thereto (including the right to seek past and future damages with respect
thereto) to the Company and, to the maximum extent provided for by, and in
accordance with, applicable Laws, the Company has recorded each such
assignment with the relevant Governmental Entities, including the PTO, the
U.S. Copyright Office, or their respective equivalents in any relevant
foreign jurisdiction, as applicable, in a timely manner. Other than as set
forth on _Section_ __ _ 3.13(c)_ of the Disclosure Schedule, no third party
that has licensed or otherwise granted rights under any Technology or
Intellectual Property Rights to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has or
has claimed ownership rights or license rights to improvements or derivative
works made by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to such Technology
or Intellectual Property Rights, other than claims to improvements that are
not material to the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries as currently
conducted. No third party that has licensed any Company IP from the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries has ownership rights in or to improvements or
derivative works thereof made by such third party. All rights in, to and under
all Technology and Intellectual Property Rights created by the Companys
founders for or on behalf or in contemplation of the Company (i) prior to the
inception of the Company or (ii) prior to their commencement of employment
with the Company have been duly, validly, and irrevocably assigned to the
Company. Except for the Open Source set forth in _Section_ __ _ 3.13(m_ _)(_
_i_ _)_ of the Disclosure Schedule, all of the software (including all Source
Code thereof) that is incorporated into or comprises any portion of any
Company Product constitutes Company IP.

 



-30- (d) _Transferability_. All Company IP is fully transferable, alienable and
licensable by the Company and, following Closing, will be fully transferable,
alienable and licensable by the Company or Parent without restriction or
payment of any kind and without approval of any third party, including any
Governmental Entity.

 

(e) _Transfer_. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has (i)
transferred full or partial ownership of, or authorized the retention of
joint ownership of, any material Intellectual Property Rights that are or were
Company IP to any other Person, or (ii) permitted the Companys or any of its
Subsidiaries rights in any Intellectual Property Rights that are or were
Company IP to lapse, be abandoned, or pass into the public domain, other than
the abandonment of Company Registered IP made by the Company in its reasonable
business judgment. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has
granted to any other Person any exclusive license of or exclusive right to
use any material Company IP, or authorized retention by any other Person of
any such exclusive license or rights.

 

(f) _No Infringement_. The operation of the business of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as previously conducted and as currently conducted, including
the design, development, use, import, branding, advertising, promotion,
marketing, manufacture, provision, delivery, sale, support, making available,
and licensing out of any past or current Company Product or any
Company Product under development that are required to be disclosed under
this Agreement in _Section_ __ _ 3.13(a)_ of the Disclosure Schedule (i) has
not infringed, misappropriated, or otherwise violated, does not
infringe, misappropriate, or otherwise violate, and will not infringe,
misappropriate, or otherwise violate when conducted by Parent or the Surviving
Company or their Subsidiaries or Affiliates immediately following the Closing
in substantially the same manner as currently conducted, any Intellectual
Property Rights of any Person, or (ii) has not constituted and does not
constitute unfair competition or trade practices under applicable laws of any
jurisdiction. Other than as set out in  _Section_ __ _ 3.13(f)_ of the
Disclosure Schedule, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has
received written or, to the Knowledge of the Company, oral notice from any
Person (A) claiming that any Company Product or Company IP infringes,
misappropriates, or otherwise violates any Intellectual Property Rights of any
Person or constitutes unfair competition or trade practices under the laws of
any jurisdiction (nor does the Company have Knowledge of any basis therefor),
(B) inviting the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to license the
Intellectual Property Right of another Person, or (C) seeking indemnification
from the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the
infringement, misappropriation or violation of any Intellectual Property
Rights.

(g) _Third Party Infringement_. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has ever sent any letter or notice to any other Person claiming
that such Person has or may have infringed, misappropriated or violated any
Intellectual Property Right owned or purported to be owned by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries.

(h) _Transaction_. Neither the execution of this Agreement or the Related
Agreements nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or the Related Agreements (solely pursuant to and as a result of any
Contracts to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party), will
cause or result in any of Parent, the Company, the Surviving Company, or any
of their respective Subsidiaries or affiliates (i) granting to any third party
any right under or with respect to their respective Intellectual Property
Rights; (ii) being bound by, or subject to, any non-compete, exclusivity
provision, or other material restriction on the operation or scope of their
respective businesses (excluding any non-compete or other
material restriction that arises from any agreement to which the Company or
one of its Subsidiaries is not a party); or (iii) being obligated to pay any
royalties or other material amounts, or offer any discounts, to any third
party in excess of those payable by, or required to be offered by, any of
them, respectively, in the absence of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby.

 



-31- (i) _Protection of Trade Secrets_. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries
has taken reasonable measures consistent with industry practices to protect
its Confidential Information and trade secrets and the Confidential
Information and trade secrets of any other Person that was provided or made
available to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. There has been no loss
of, or any unauthorized access to or disclosure of, any material Confidential
Information or trade secrets of the Company or its Subsidiaries.

 

(j) _Proprietary Information Agreements_. The Company and each of its
Subsidiaries has always had and enforced a policy requiring each then-current
Employee or Contractor of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to execute a
proprietary information, confidentiality and invention assignment Contract on
one of the form(s) attached to  _Section_ __ _ 3.14(_ _j_ _)_ of the
Disclosure Schedule, with no material deviations from such forms (each such
executed Contract, a " _Proprietary Information Agreement_ "). All current and
former Employees (including the Companys founders) and Contractors of the
Company and its Subsidiaries who were at any time involved in the creation of
Technology or Intellectual Property Rights for the Company or its
Subsidiaries, or who had access to Confidential Information of or on behalf
of the Company or its Subsidiaries, have executed a Proprietary Information
Agreement. Copies of all such agreements with all current Employees,
Contractors and the Founders have been Made Available to Parent. All such
Persons have, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law,
irrevocably assigned to the Company all their rights in the Company IP and
(with respect to such Persons performing such services outside of the United
States and in which Moral Rights apply) explicitly waived any and all Moral
Rights with respect to the Company IP. To the Knowledge of the Company, no
current or former Employee or Contractor of the Company or any or its
Subsidiaries has developed any Technology or Intellectual Property Rights for
the Company during a period of time during which such Person was also employed
by or performing services for any Governmental Entity, a university, college,
or other educational institution, or a research center. No current or former
Employee or Contractor has excluded any Intellectual Property Right that was
at any time used in or necessary for use in the business of the Company and
its Subsidiaries from any assignment of, or agreement to assign, Intellectual
Property Rights to the Company. No current or former Employee or Contractor
has performed any services for the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in
breach of such Employees or Contractors obligations to or agreements with
any prior employer or other third party, including any breach of any duty of
confidentiality or obligation to transfer Intellectual Property Rights.

 

(k) _No Malicious Software_. None of the Company Products currently being
distributed, offered, made available, used, or supported contain any "back
door," "drop dead device," "time bomb," "Trojan horse," "virus" or "worm" (as
such terms are commonly understood in the software industry) or any other code
designed or intended to have, or capable of performing or without user intent
will cause, any of the following functions: (i) disrupting, disabling, harming
or otherwise impeding in any manner the operation of, or providing
unauthorized access to, a computer system or network or other device on which
such code is stored or installed, (ii) damaging or destroying any data or file
without a customers specific consent, or (iii) sending information to the
Company, a Company Subsidiary or any third party without a customers
specific consent. None of the Company Products currently being distributed,
offered, made available, used, or supported (i) is installed on a customers
computer without their knowledge, (ii) records customers actions without
their knowledge, (iii) employs a customers Internet connection without their
knowledge to gather or transmit information on the customer or their behavior,
or (iv) will load whenever a browser starts or share the browsers memory
context (all of the foregoing, collectively, " _Malware_ "); _provided,
however_ , that no representation or warranty is made in this sentence with
respect to any Malware that may be transmitted by the Companys customers via
Company Products, where any such Malware (i) is not and was not contained in
or transmitted with the Company Products as made available 

 



-32-  by the Company or its Subsidiaries and (ii) could not have been detected and
removed using reasonable efforts of the Company or its Subsidiaries. For the
purposes of this paragraph, "without customers knowledge" includes but is
not limited to (a) without explicitly informing the customer or (b) without
being expected by a reasonable customer, even if the text of a license
agreement, help file, or other user information file does explicitly inform
such customer. For purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 3.13(k)_, "customer"
includes paid and unpaid customers and other users of such Company Products.
The Company and each of its Subsidiaries have taken reasonable steps to
protect the Company Products and the information technology systems used in
connection with the operation of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries from
Malware.

 

(l) _No Order_. No Company IP or Company Product is subject to any proceeding
or outstanding decree, order, judgment, settlement Contract, forbearance to
sue, consent, stipulation or similar obligation that restricts in any manner
the use, transfer, making available, or licensing thereof by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or may affect the validity, use or enforceability of
such Company IP.

(m) _Open Source_. _Section_ __ _ 3.13(m)_ of the Disclosure Schedule
contains a complete and accurate list of all Open Source used in any way by,
linked to, incorporated into, or distributed with any Company IP or any
Company Product currently being distributed, offered, made available, used, or
supported and describes the applicable Open Source licenses and the manner in
which such Open Source is or was used by, linked to, or incorporated into such
Company Products and related Company IP, which description includes whether
(and, if so, how) the Open Source has been modified and/or distributed by the
Company and whether (and, if so, how) such Open Source was incorporated into
and linked in any such Company Product or Company IP. Neither the Company, nor
any of its Subsidiaries, nor any Person acting on any of their behalves, has
used Open Source in a manner that prevents or purports to prevent Company from
commercializing any Company Products or Company IP, or requires or purports to
require any software included in any Company Products or Company IP to: (i)
be made available or distributed in Source Code form; (ii) be licensed for the
purpose of preparing derivative works; or (iii) be distributable or
redistributable for little or no license fee. Each of the Company and
its Subsidiaries has been at all times and is currently in full compliance
with all applicable Open Source Licenses, including any and all Intellectual
Property Rights notice and attribution requirements.

 

(n) _Source Code_. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor any
other Person acting on any of their behalves, has disclosed, delivered or
licensed to any Person, agreed to disclose, deliver or license to any Person,
or agreed to or permitted the disclosure or delivery to any escrow agent or
other Person of, any Source Code that is Company Technology, other than
to Employees and Contractors bound by Proprietary Information Agreements, or
to a third party conducting a scan of the Source Code on behalf of Parent in
connection with the negotiation of this Agreement (the " _Scan_ "). Other than
the Scan, no Person other than an Employee or Contractor bound by a
Proprietary Information Agreement has accessed or obtained any Source Code
that is Company IP. Other than the Scan, no event has occurred, and no
circumstance or condition exists, that (with or without notice or lapse of
time, or both) would reasonably be expected to result in the disclosure or
delivery of any Source Code that is Company IP to any Person (including escrow
agents) other than an Employee or Contractor bound by a Proprietary
Information Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
neither the Company, nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor any Person acting on any
of their behalves, has distributed any Company Technology under any Open
Source License, or contributed any Company Technology to any Open Source
project.

(o) _Government Funding_. No funding from any Governmental Entity, nor any
facilities or resources of a university, college, other educational
institution or research center or funding from governmental third parties was
used in the development of any Company IP, and no Governmental
Entity, university, college, other educational institution or research
center, or other third party has any encumbrance on or any claim or right in
or to any Company IP. There are no pending and outstanding grants, incentives
and subsidies from any Governmental Entity, granted to the Company or any
Company Subsidiary.

 



-33- (p) _Encryption and Other Restricted Technology_. The business of the Company
and its Subsidiaries as currently conducted does not involve the use or
development of, or engagement in, encryption technology, or other technology
whose development, commercialization or export is restricted under applicable
Laws, and to conduct its business as currently conducted, neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries is or has been under any obligation to obtain any
approvals from the U.S. Bureau of Industry and Security or any authorized body
thereof pursuant to legislation regulating the development, commercialization
or export of technology, all other than as set forth on _Section_ __ _
3.13(p)(_ _i_ _)_ of the Disclosure Schedule. Except as set forth on 
_Section_ __ _ 3.13(p)(ii)_ of the Disclosure Schedule, the Company and its

current use, development, commercialization, imports and exports of
products, software and technologies which may involve the use or engagement
in encryption technology, or may involve any other technology whose
development, commercialization, import or export is restricted or otherwise
regulated under applicable U.S. or other applicable jurisdiction laws or
regulations, and the Company and its Subsidiaries have at all times been in
compliance, and are in compliance with, all such approvals and licenses listed
on _Section_ __ _ 3.13(p)(iii)_ of the Disclosure Schedule and all such
approvals and licenses are in full force and effect. There are no pending or,
to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened claims against the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries with respect to such export licenses or other approvals.
The Company and each Company Subsidiary has developed and/or develops, used
and/or uses and commercialized and/or commercializes the current Company

(q) _Standards_. _Section_ __ _ 3.13_ _(q)_ of the Disclosure Schedule lists
all Standards Bodies in which Company or any of its Subsidiaries has
participated or is participating, or is, or has been, a member. Neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has made any submission or suggestion to,
nor is subject to any Contract with, any Standards Body that would obligate
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or Parent or any of its Subsidiaries,
to grant licenses to or otherwise impair or limit control of any of their
respective Intellectual Property Rights.

 

(r) _Privacy_. _Section_ __ _ 3.13(r_ _)(_ _i_ _)_ of the Disclosure Schedule
describes each category of Private Information currently held, or currently
being collected or processed by or for the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
(including by any of their respective vendors or other processors or
subprocessors) on or through the Company Products or otherwise in connection
with the provision or operation of the Company Products. Subject to the fifth
sentence of this _Section_ __ _ 3.13(r)_ with respect to the GDPR (as defined
below), the Company, each Subsidiary, the Company Products, and, to the
Companys Knowledge, all vendors, processors, subprocessors or other third
parties acting on behalf of the Company or any Subsidiary or that otherwise
have had access to Private Information collected or maintained by or for the
Company or any Subsidiary comply, and have always complied, in all material
respects, with all applicable Privacy Laws, including those relating to (i)

users) of Company Products; and (ii) the collection, obtainment,
interception, compilation, creation, retention, storage, security, disclosure,
transfer, disposal, use, or other processing of any Private Information. The
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement, and the transfer of
all Private Information maintained by or for the Company and its Subsidiaries
to Parent or its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Company) is and will be
compliant in all material respects with all Privacy Laws. None of the

representation with regard to Private Information made by the Company or any
Subsidiary, has been materially inaccurate, misleading, or 

 



-34-  deceptive or in violation of any Privacy Laws (including containing any
material omission). The Company and its Subsidiaries have established and are
implementing such policies, programs, procedures, contracts, and systems in a
manner that will bring them into compliance in all material respects with the
European General Data Protection Regulation (" _GDPR_ ") on or prior to May

consummate the Mergers. Parent owns beneficially and of record all outstanding
capital stock of Merger Sub I and all outstanding membership interests of
Merger Sub II, in each case free and clear of any Liens, and no other Person

authorization of, or registration, declaration or filing with, any
Governmental Entity is required by or with respect to Parent or Merger Subs in
connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and any Related
Agreements to which Parent or Merger Subs are a party or the consummation of

SEC Document.

 

(b) Except as set forth in any Parent SEC Document, the financial statements
of Parent, including the notes thereto, included in the Parent SEC Documents
complied as to form in all material respects with the published rules and
regulations of the SEC with respect thereto as of their respective dates, were
prepared in accordance with GAAP (except as may be indicated in the notes
thereto, except in the case of pro forma statements, or, in the case of
unaudited financial statements, except as permitted under Form 10-Q under the

6.3 _Notice of Alternative Transaction Proposals_. In the event that the
Company or any of its Representatives shall receive, prior to the Effective
Time or the termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Section_ __ _
8.1_, any inquiry offer, proposal or indication of interest regarding a
potential Alternative Transaction, the Company or such Affiliate or
Representative shall immediately notify Parent thereof, which notice shall
include the identity of the party making any such inquiry, offer, proposal,
indication of interest or request, and the specific terms of such inquiry,
offer, proposal, indication or request, as the case may be (including a copy
of any written material and electronic communications received from such third
party), and such other information related thereto as Parent may reasonably
request.

6.4 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event that the provisions of this _Article_ __ _ VI_ were
not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached. It is accordingly agreed by the parties hereto that Parent shall be
entitled to seek an immediate injunction or injunctions, without the necessity
of proving the inadequacy of money damages as a remedy and without the
necessity of posting any bond or other security, to prevent breaches of the
provisions of this _Article_ __ _ VI_ subject to and in accordance with the
provisions of _Article XI_. Without limiting the foregoing, it is understood
that any violation of the restrictions set forth above by any Representative
of the Company shall be deemed to be a breach of this Agreement by the
Company.

 _ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS_

7.1  _Stockholder Approval_ _s_.

(a) _Requisite Stockholder Approval_. Immediately following the execution of
this Agreement, the Company shall solicit written consent from all of its
Stockholders in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit E_ (the " _Stockholder
Written Consent_ "). The Company shall promptly deliver to Parent a copy of
each executed Stockholder Written Consent upon receipt thereof from any
Stockholder pursuant to such solicitation. Within six hours after the
execution of this Agreement, the Company will deliver to Parent Stockholder
Written Consents from Stockholders pursuant to the preceding solicitation
that are sufficient to fully and irrevocably deliver the Requisite Stockholder
Approval. Upon receipt of the Requisite Stockholder Approval, the Company
shall promptly deliver notice to each Stockholder whose consent was
not obtained prior to the Companys receipt of the Requisite Stockholder
Approval, which notice shall include the notice to stockholders required by
Section 262 of the DGCL and/or Chapter 13 of the CCC of the approval of the
First Merger and that appraisal rights are available. The Board of Directors
of the Company shall not alter, modify, change or revoke its approval of this
Agreement, the First Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby,
nor its recommendation to the Stockholders to vote in favor of adoption of
this Agreement and approval of the First Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby.

 

(b) _280G Approvals_. The Company promptly following the date hereof shall
submit to the Stockholders for approval (in a form and manner satisfactory to
Parent), by such number of Stockholders as is required by the terms of Section
280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code, any Potential Parachute Payments, such that such
Potential Parachute Payments shall not be deemed to be "parachute payments"
under Section 280G of the Code. Prior to the Effective Time the Company shall
deliver to Parent evidence satisfactory to Parent that (i) a Stockholder vote
was solicited in conformance with Section 280G and the regulations
promulgated thereunder and the requisite Stockholder approval was obtained
with respect to any Potential Parachute Payments that were subject to the
Stockholder vote (the " _280G Approval_ "), or (ii) that the 280G Approval
was not obtained and as a consequence, that such Potential Parachute Payments
shall not be made or provided, pursuant to a 280G waiver, each in the form
attached hereto as _Exhibit_ __ _ F_ (the " _280G Waiver_ "), entered into
by each Person who otherwise might receive any Potential Parachute Payments
that waived any right or entitlement to such Potential Parachute Payments so
that such payment and benefits do not constitute "parachute payments" under
Section 280G of the Code.

7.2 _Governmental Approvals_.

 

(a) In furtherance and not in limitation of the terms of _Section_ __ _ 7.4_,
each of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries and Parent shall promptly
execute and file, or join in the execution and filing of, any application,
notification or other document that may be necessary in order to obtain the
authorization, approval or consent of any Governmental Entity,
whether federal, state, local or foreign, that may be reasonably required, in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. Each
of the Company and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain all
such authorizations, approvals and consents. To the extent permitted by
applicable Laws, each of the Company and Parent shall promptly inform the
other of any material communication between the Company or Parent (as
applicable) and any Governmental Entity regarding the transactions
contemplated hereby. If the Company or Parent or any Affiliate thereof shall
receive any formal or informal request for supplemental information or
documentary material from any Governmental Entity with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby,

 



-53-  then the Company or Parent (as applicable) shall make, or cause to be made,
as soon as reasonably practicable, a response in reasonable compliance with
such request. Each of the Company and Parent shall direct, in its sole
discretion, the making of such response, but shall consider in good faith the
views of the other.

(b) Without limiting the generality or effect of _Section_ __ _ 7.2(a)_,
each of the Company and Parent shall, as soon as practicable but in any event
within ten (10) Business Days of the execution of the Agreement, make
any initial filings required under the HSR Act in connection with the Mergers
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. To the extent
permitted by applicable Laws, the parties hereto shall consult and cooperate
with one another, and consider in good faith the views of one another, in
connection with any analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs,
arguments, opinions and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any
party hereto in connection with proceedings under or relating to the HSR Act,
it being understood that the Company will not, nor will it permit any
Representatives of the Company to make any material communications with, or
proposals relating to, or enter into, any material understanding, undertaking
or agreement with, any Governmental Entity relating to the Mergers without
Parents prior review and approval. Each of the Company and Parent shall use
its reasonable best efforts to take such actions as may be required to cause
the expiration of the notice periods under any HSR Act with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as possible after the
execution of this Agreement.

 

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary set forth in
this Agreement, it is expressly understood and agreed that neither Parent nor
Merger Subs shall have any obligation to litigate any administrative or
judicial action or proceeding that may be brought in connection with obtaining
the authorization, approval or consent of any Governmental Entity in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and neither
Parent nor any Affiliate of Parent shall be required to agree to (and the
Company shall not agree to and shall not offer to agree to) any license, sale
or other disposition or holding separate (through the establishment of a
trust or otherwise), of shares of capital stock or of any business, assets or
property of Parent, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates, or the
imposition of any limitation on the ability of any of them to conduct their
businesses or to own or exercise control of such assets, properties and stock.

(d) Parent shall, in consultation with the Company and subject to _Sections_
___7.2(b_ _)_ and _7.2(c_ _)_ , determine strategy, lead all proceedings and
coordinate all activities with respect to seeking any actions, consents,
approvals or waivers of any Governmental Entity as contemplated hereby, and
the Company and its Subsidiaries will take such actions as reasonably
requested by Parent in connection with obtaining such consents, approvals or
waivers. Notwithstanding Parents rights to lead all proceedings as provided
in the prior sentence, Parent shall not require the Company to, and the
Company shall not be required to, take any action with respect to any
applicable antitrust Law which would bind the Company or its
Subsidiaries irrespective of whether the Mergers occur.

7.3 _Third Party Contracts_.

 

(a) _Notices and Consents_. The Company shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain all necessary consents, waivers and approvals of any third
parties to any Contract (including all of the Contracts set forth in _Section_
__ _ 3.4_ of the Disclosure Schedule) as are required thereunder in
connection with the Mergers in order for such Contract to remain in full
force and effect following the Mergers. Such consents, modifications, waivers
and approvals shall be in a form reasonably acceptable to Parent. In the event
the Mergers do not close for any reason, neither Parent nor Merger Subs shall
have any liability to the Company, the Stockholders or any other Person for
any costs, claims, liabilities or damages resulting from the Company seeking
to obtain such consents, modifications, waivers and approvals.

 



-54- (b) _Terminated Agreements_. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts
to terminate each of the agreements listed on _Schedule_ __ _ 7.3(b)_ (the "
_Terminated Agreements_ ") effective as of and contingent upon the Closing,
including sending all required notices, such that each Terminated
Agreement shall be of no further force or effect immediately following the
Closing. The form and substance of each termination letter and agreement shall
be subject to prior review and approval by Parent. Upon the Closing, the
Company shall have paid all amounts owed under the Terminated Agreements (as
a result of the termination of the Terminated Agreements or otherwise). The
Company shall be responsible for making any payments required to terminate the
Terminated Agreements and shall reflect such payment or other consideration
incurred by the Company as of the Closing Date or anticipated to be incurred
or payable after the Closing in the Statement of Expenses. In the event the
Mergers do not close for any reason, neither Parent nor Merger Subs shall
have any liability to the Company, the Stockholders or any other Person for
any costs, claims, liabilities or damages resulting from the Company seeking
to obtain such terminations or amendments.

 

7.4 _Reasonable Efforts_. Subject to the terms and conditions provided in this
Agreement (including _Sections 7.2_ and  _7.3(a)_ ), each of the parties
hereto shall use commercially reasonable efforts to take promptly, or cause to
be taken promptly, all actions, and to do promptly, or cause to be done
promptly, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws to
consummate and make effective the First Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable, including by using
commercially reasonable efforts to take all action necessary to satisfy all of
the conditions to the obligations of the other party or parties hereto to
effect the First Merger set forth in _Article_ __ _ VII_, to obtain all
necessary waivers, consents, approvals and other documents required to be
delivered hereunder and to effect all necessary registrations and filings and
to remove any injunctions or other impediments or delays, legal or otherwise,
in each case in order to consummate and make effective the First Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement for the purpose of
securing to the parties hereto the benefits contemplated by this Agreement;
_provided_ , _however_ , the Company shall be solely obligated, and Parent
shall have no obligation, to make any payments or perform any obligation
described in _Section_ __ _ 7.8(a)(iv)_.

7.5 _Tax Matters_.

 

(a) _Transfer Taxes_. All Transfer Taxes shall be borne by the Indemnifying
Parties. The Person(s) required by applicable Law to file any necessary Tax
Returns and other documentation with respect to any Transfer Taxes shall
timely file, or shall cause to be timely filed, with the relevant Governmental
Entity each such Tax Return and shall timely pay to the relevant
Governmental Entity all Transfer Taxes due and payable thereon (subject to
reimbursement in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 7.5(a)_). If required by
applicable Law, Parent, the First-Step Surviving Company or the Surviving
Company, as the case may be, will and will cause its Affiliates to, join in
the execution of any such Tax Returns and other documentation. Parent,
Parents Affiliates (including the First-Step Surviving Company and the
Surviving Company) and the Indemnifying Parties shall cooperate in the
execution and delivery of all instruments and certificates reasonably
necessary to minimize the amount of any Transfer Taxes and to enable any of
the foregoing to comply with any Tax Return filing requirements for
such Transfer Taxes.

(b) _Tax Returns_.

 

(i) Parent, at its expense, shall prepare and timely file, or cause to be
prepared and timely filed, all Tax Returns of the Company and each Subsidiary
that are first required to be filed after the Closing Date, and shall timely
remit, or cause to be timely remitted, to the appropriate Governmental Entity
all Taxes reflected on such Tax Returns, subject to Parents right
to indemnification pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.2(a)_. To the extent such
Tax Returns relate to any Pre-Closing Tax Period, such Tax Returns shall be
prepared in accordance with applicable Law and consistent with the past
practices of the Company and its Subsidiaries in all material respects, except
to the extent necessary to comply with applicable Law.

 



-55-  Parent shall deliver or cause to be delivered drafts of all income or other
material Tax Returns that show any Taxes that would reasonably be expected to
give rise to a $100,000 or greater liability of the Indemnifying Parties
under _Section_ __ _ 9.2_ to the Stockholder Representative for its review
and comment at least thirty (30) days prior to the due date of any such Tax
Return. Parent shall consider in good faith all of the Stockholder
Representatives reasonable comments to such Tax Returns.

(ii) Parent, the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries will not (and will
not permit their respective Affiliates to) (i) except for Tax Returns prepared
and filed in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 7.5(b)(_ _i_ _)_ , file or amend
any Tax Returns of the Company or its Subsidiaries with respect to any Pre-
Closing Tax Period, (ii) with respect to Tax Returns prepared and filed in
accordance with Section 7.5(b)(i), after the date such Tax Returns are
filed pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.5_ _(b)(_ _i_ _)_ , amend any such Tax
Return, (iii) make or change any Tax election or change any method of
accounting that has retroactive effect to any Tax Return of the Company
or its Subsidiaries for a Pre-Closing Tax Period, or (iv) agree to extend or
waive the statute of limitations with respect Taxes of the Company or its
Subsidiaries for a Pre-Closing Tax Period, other than as requested by a Tax
authority in connection with an ongoing audit, in each such case except (A)
with the prior written consent of the Stockholder Representative (which will
not be unreasonably withheld, delayed, or conditioned), (B) if such action
would not reasonably be expected to form the basis for a claim of
indemnification pursuant to this Agreement or (C) solely with respect to the
actions described in clauses (i) or (ii), if required by applicable Law (
_provided_ , _however_ , Parent shall consult in good faith with the
Stockholder Representative as to the requirements of applicable Law prior to
taking any such action). Parent, the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries
will not (and will not permit their respective Affiliates to) enter into any
voluntary disclosure (or otherwise initiate discussions or examinations with a
Governmental Entity) with respect to any Taxes or Tax Returns of the Company
or its Subsidiaries for a Pre-Closing Tax Period without first consulting the
Stockholder Representative in good faith.

 

(c) _Tax Controversies_.

 

(i) Parent shall deliver a written notice to the Stockholder Representative
promptly following any demand, claim, or notice of commencement of a claim,
proposed adjustment, assessment, audit, examination or other administrative or
court proceeding with respect to Taxes of any of the Company or its
Subsidiaries for which the Indemnifying Parties may have an indemnification
obligation pursuant to this Agreement (a " _Tax Claim_ ") and shall describe
in reasonable detail and to the Knowledge of Parent the facts constituting the
basis for such Tax Claim, the nature of the relief sought, and the amount of
the claimed Losses (including Taxes), if any (the " _Tax Claim Notice_ "),
_provided_ , _however_ , that the failure or delay to so notify the
Stockholder Representative shall not relieve the Indemnifying Parties of any
claim of indemnification pursuant to this Agreement, except to the extent
that the Indemnifying Parties are prejudiced thereby.

(ii) Parent shall control all Tax Claims; _provided_ , that (x) Parent shall
keep the Stockholder Representative reasonably informed of all material
developments and events relating to such Tax Claim, (y) the Stockholder
Representative shall have the right to participate in (but not control) at
the expense of the Indemnifying Parties the defense of such Tax Claim
(including participating in any discussions with the applicable Governmental
Entity regarding such Tax Claims), and (z) if the Stockholder Representative
does not consent to a settlement or compromise of a Tax claim, such consent
not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, such settlement or
compromise shall not be determinative of the amount of any Losses. 

(iii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
the procedures for all Tax Claims shall be governed exclusively by this
_Section_ __ _ 7.5_.

 



-56- (d) _Income Tax Matters_. Pre-Closing Taxes and the Tax assets and Tax
liabilities included in Current Assets and Current Liabilities, respectively,
shall be calculated in accordance with the following assumptions (whether or
not the Tax Returns described in _Section_ __ _ 7.5(b)_ are in fact prepared
in accordance with these assumptions):

(i) The taxable year of each of the Company and its Subsidiaries ends as
of the end of the day on the Closing Date;

(ii) No election under Section 338 of the Code (or any comparable applicable
provision of state, local or non-U.S. Tax Law) is made with respect to the
acquisition of the stock of the Company or its Subsidiaries pursuant to this
Agreement;

 

(iii) No Taxes are incurred by any of the Company or its Subsidiaries on the
Closing Date after the Closing outside the ordinary course of business (other
than as explicitly contemplated by this Agreement);

(iv) The Company does not make an election under Section 965(n) of the Code;

(v) The Company makes a timely election under Revenue Procedure 2011-29,
2011-18 I.R.B. 746, to apply the seventy percent (70%) safe-harbor to any
Third Party Expenses that are "success based fees" as defined in Treasury
Regulations Section 1.263(a)-5(f);

(vi) All Transaction Deductions are deducted on Tax Returns for the taxable
period that ends (or is deemed to end) as of the end of the day on the Closing
Date to the extent permitted by applicable Law; and

 

(vii) To the extent permitted by Law, any net operating losses of the Company
or its Subsidiaries arising in taxable periods ending (or deemed to end) on
or prior to the Closing Date are applied against income arising in Pre-Closing
Tax Periods (including, if permitted by applicable Law, pursuant to a
carryback).

 

(e) Parent, the Surviving Company, any Affiliate of the foregoing, the
Indemnifying Parties and the Stockholder Representative intend for
all applicable Tax purposes that:

(i) The Representative Expense Amount shall be treated as having been received
and voluntarily set aside by the Indemnifying Parties on the Closing Date,
and no Tax withholding or reporting shall be required in connection with the
subsequent distribution of any portion of the Representative Expense Amount to
the Indemnifying Parties.

 

(ii) Except for amounts described in _Section_ __ _ 7.5(e_ _)(_ _iii)_ below,
the entirety of the Total Consideration (as finally determined pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 1.4_, including the Escrow Amounts and any amounts subject to
the Founder Consideration Holdback Agreement) shall be allocated to Company
Capital Stock and Company Warrants, as applicable, and none shall be
allocated to the Key Employee Employment Agreements, Non-Competition and Non-
Solicitation Agreements or otherwise treated as compensation.

(iii) Any payments made in respect of Company Options pursuant to this
Agreement shall be treated as compensation paid by the Company as and when
received by the holder thereof to whom such payment is due (which, for the
avoidance of doubt, shall be the Closing Date with respect to the
Representative Expense Amount, and when released to such holder of Company
Options from the Escrow Fund, as applicable). __

 



-57- (iv) No party shall take any action or filing position inconsistent with the
Tax treatment agreed to in this _Section_ __ _ 7.5(e)_, unless otherwise
required by a change in Law or by a Tax authority in connection with the good
faith resolution of an ongoing audit.

 

(f) _Cooperation_. Parent and the Stockholder Representative, on behalf of the
Indemnifying Parties, shall cooperate, as and to the extent reasonably
requested by the other party, in connection with (i) the filing of any Tax
Returns of or with respect to the Company, any Subsidiary or their respective
operations, and (ii) any audit, examination, voluntary disclosure or other
administrative or judicial proceeding, contest, assessment, notice of
deficiency, or other adjustment or proposed adjustment with respect to Taxes
of the Company, any Subsidiary or their respective operations (a "
_Tax Contest_ "). Such cooperation shall include retaining and providing
records and information that are reasonably relevant to any such Tax Return or
Tax Contest, and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to
provide additional information and explanation of any materials provided
hereunder.

(g) _Tax Sharing Agreements._ In Parents sole discretion, any Tax sharing,
indemnification or allocation agreement, arrangement, practice or policy
(other than an Ordinary Commercial Agreement) to which the Company or any
Subsidiary is a party or by which it is bound shall be terminated as of the
Closing Date, and none of the Company or any Subsidiary shall have any
liability or obligation pursuant thereto.

7.6 _Employee Matters_.

(a) _Offers of Employment to Non-Transitional Continuing Employees_. Parent
shall offer employment to each employee of the Company, effective as of the
Effective Time, other than Designated Non-Continuing Employees, any employees
who have received a notice of termination, and Transitional Employees, and
each such employee who continues employment with Parent or any Affiliate
thereof after the Closing will be a " _Non-Transitional Continuing Employee_."
During the period beginning as of the Effective Time and ending on no earlier
than the first (1st) anniversary of the Effective Time (the " _Benefit Period_
"), Parent shall provide each Non-Transitional Continuing Employee with at
least the same level of base wages or base salary, as applicable, and employee
benefits (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not include cash incentive
compensation and equity compensation) that are at least the same as those
provided to similarly situated employees of Parent.

(b) _Benefits Provided to Non-Transitional Continuing Employees._ Parent
shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, grant all Non-Transitional
Continuing Employees credit for any service to the Company and its Affiliates
earned prior to the Closing for purposes of eligibility, vesting and
determination of the level of benefits, vacation or paid time off accrual and
severance benefit determinations, under any benefit or compensation plan,
program, agreement or arrangement in which a Non-Transitional Continuing
Employee participates that may be established or maintained by Parent or its
Affiliates on or after the Closing (the " _New Plans_ "), as applicable;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that such service credit shall not be recognized to
the extent that it would result in a duplication of benefits for the same
period of time. In addition, Parent shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to,
cause (i) to be waived all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-
work requirements and similar limitations, eligibility waiting periods
and evidence of insurability requirements under any New Plans to the extent
waived or satisfied by a Non-Transitional Continuing Employee under any
Company benefit plan as of the Closing and (ii) any deductible, coinsurance
and covered out-of-pocket expenses paid on or before the Closing by any Non-
Transitional Continuing Employee (or covered dependent thereof) to be taken
into account for purposes of satisfying the corresponding deductible,
coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket provisions after the Closing under any
applicable New Plan in the same plan year in which the Closing occurs.

 



-58- (c) _Proprietary Information and Inventions Assignment Agreement_ _s_. Prior
to the Closing, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
each current Employee or Contractor of the Company and its Subsidiaries to
have entered into and executed, and each Person who becomes an Employee or
Contractor of the Company or any Subsidiary after the date of this Agreement
and prior to the Closing shall be required by the Company to enter into and
execute, a Proprietary Information Agreement with the Company or the
applicable Subsidiary effective as of such Employees or Contractors first
date of employment or service.

(d) _Termination of Employee Plans_. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall
take all action necessary to terminate the Plan and any and all other Company
Employee Plans (other than the Company Employee Plans described in the
following sentence) that Parent requests to be terminated, such termination to
be effective at or before the Effective Time, unless Parent provides prior
written notice to the Company that any such Company Employee Plan shall not be
terminated. Effective as of no later than the day immediately preceding the
Closing Date, the Company shall terminate any and all Company Employee Plans
intended to include group severance pay or benefits or any Code Section 401(k)
arrangement (each, a " _401(k) Plan_ ") unless Parent provides prior written
notice to the Company that any such 401(k) Plan shall not be terminated. The
Company shall provide Parent with evidence that each Company Employee Plan
required to be terminated pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 7.6(d)_ has been
terminated pursuant to resolutions of the board of directors (or similar
body) of the Company, as the case may be. The form and substance of such
resolutions shall be subject to review and approval of Parent. The Company
also shall take such other actions in furtherance of terminating any such
Company Employee Plan as Parent may require. In the event that termination of
a 401(k) Plan would reasonably be anticipated to trigger liquidation charges,
surrender charges or other fees, then such charges and/or fees shall be
included in Third Party Expenses and shall be the responsibility of the
Company, and the Company shall take such actions as are necessary to
reasonably estimate the amount of such charges and/or fees and provide such
estimate in the Statement of Expenses.

(e) _Payment of Accrued Employee Amounts_. Prior to the Closing, the Company
shall (i) pay out all vacation, and/or paid time off that has been accrued
but unused by any Employee, as well as all accrued wages, pro-rated bonuses
and other accrued but unpaid benefits of any Employee as of the Closing
Date (collectively, the " _Accrued Employee Amounts_ ") and (ii) use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain an acknowledgement, from each holder of a
Company Option that is an Employee, that all such Accrued Employee Amounts
have been paid to such Employee (an " _Accrued Employee Amount Payment
Acknowledgement_ ").

(f) _New Employment Arrangement_ _s_ _._ Prior to the Closing, Parent may
extend an offer of employment to certain Other Employees in Parents customary
form (an " _Offer Letter_ ") to become an employee of Parent effective upon
the Closing, on such terms and conditions reasonably acceptable to Parent.

(g) _Transitional Services Agreement_. Prior to the Closing, Parent shall
enter into a transitional services agreement with each of the Employees listed
in _Schedule 7.6(g)_ (each, a " _Transitional Employee_ "), to be effective
upon the Closing, on such terms and conditions reasonably acceptable to
Parent.

(h) _Severance for Designated Non-Continuing Employees_. Prior to
the Closing, the Company shall terminate the employment of each individual
who is a Designated Non-Continuing Employee, effective as of no later than
immediately prior to the Closing. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall
accrue or pay all severance pay or benefits (including but not limited to cash
and any acceleration of vesting) to each such Designated Non-Continuing
Employee in exchange for a release of claims (which is reasonably
satisfactory to Parent) from each Designated Non-Continuing Employee.

 



-59- (i) _No Employment Commitment or Plan Amendments_. No provision of this
Agreement is intended, or shall be interpreted, to provide nor create any
third party beneficiary rights or any other rights of any kind or nature
whatsoever in any Stockholder, Key Employee, Non-Transitional
Continuing Employee, Transitional Employee, Other Employee, consultant,
contractor or any other Person, including any rights of employment for any
specified period and/or any employee benefits, in favor of any Person, union,
association, Non-Transitional Continuing Employee, Key Employee, Transitional
Employee, Other Employee, consultant or contractor or any other Person, other
than the parties hereto and their respective successors and
permitted assigns, and all provisions of this Agreement will be personal
solely among the parties to this Agreement. In addition, no provision of this
Agreement is intended, or shall be interpreted, to amend any term or condition
of the Plan or any other employee related plan, program or policy of the
Company or any Subsidiary.

7.7 _Payoff Letters and Release of Liens_.

 

(a) _Payoff Letters_. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall obtain from
each creditor of the Company or any Subsidiary, and deliver to Parent, an
executed payoff letter, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent,
setting forth: (i) the amounts required to pay off in full on the Closing
Date, the Indebtedness owing to such creditor (including the
outstanding principal, accrued and unpaid interest and prepayment and other
penalties) and wire transfer information for such payment; (ii) upon payment
of such amounts, a release of the Company and its Subsidiaries; and (iii) the
commitment of the creditor to release all Liens, if any, that the creditor
may hold on any of the assets of the Company prior to the Closing Date (each,
a " _Payoff Letter_ ").

 

(b) _Release of Liens_. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall file all
agreements, instruments, certificates and other documents, in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent, that are necessary or appropriate
to effect the release of all Liens, including those Liens set forth in
_Schedule_ __ _ 7.7(b)_.

 

7.8 _Third Party Expenses_.

 

(a) Whether or not the First Merger is consummated, except as otherwise
expressly provided herein, each party shall be responsible for its
own expenses and costs that it incurs (and whether paid prior to, at or after
the Effective Time) with respect to the negotiation, execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement. Without limiting or expanding the foregoing,
the Company shall be responsible for all fees and expenses incurred by or on
behalf of the Company or any Subsidiary (and whether paid prior to, at or
after the Effective Time) in connection with this Agreement, the First Merger
and the other transactions contemplated hereby, including: (i) all legal,
accounting, financial advisory, consulting, finders and all other fees and
expenses of third parties incurred by the Company or any Subsidiary in
connection with the negotiation and effectuation of the terms and conditions
of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including costs
incurred in connection with the purchase of the Tail Policy; (ii) any
termination, pre-payment, balloon or similar fees or payments (including
penalties) of the Company or any Subsidiary on account of outstanding
Indebtedness of the Company or any Subsidiary, or resulting from the early
termination of Contracts, resulting from, or in connection with,
the transactions contemplated hereby (it being understood that this clause
(ii) shall not include any amounts included in Closing Indebtedness); (iii)
any bonus, commission, or other incentive compensation payment or other
obligation of any kind payable or owed by the Company to service providers of
the Company arising out of or in connection with the transaction and any
severance (including such severance costs incurred pursuant to _Section_ __ _
7.6(h))_ or change-in-control payments or other

 



-60-  obligations (including payments with either "single-trigger" or "double-
trigger" provisions) of the Company or any Subsidiary to Employees resulting
from, or in connection with, the transactions contemplated hereby, including
any payments made pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.6(f);_ (iv) any Transaction
Payroll Taxes associated with amounts paid on or about the Closing Date; and
(v) any payments in connection with any change in control obligations
resulting from or in connection with the Mergers or any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, or any payment or consideration (including,
without limitation, the payment of a consent fee, "profit sharing" payment or
other consideration (including increased rent payments), or the provision of
additional security (including a guaranty) in connection with notices or
consents required in connection with Lease Agreements) arising under or in
relation to obtaining any consents, waivers or approvals of any party under
any Contract of the Company or any Subsidiary as are required in connection
with the Mergers for any such Contract to remain in full force and
effect following the Closing or resulting from agreed-upon modification or
early termination of any such Contract, all of which shall be subject to
Parents approval (clauses (i)  (v), collectively, the " _Third
Party Expenses_ "). For the avoidance of doubt, no fees and expenses shall be
double counted when calculating Third Party Expenses, and Third Party Expenses
shall not include Taxes (other than Transaction Payroll Taxes associated with
amounts paid on or about the Closing Date).

(b) At least four (4) Business Days prior to the Closing, the Company shall
provide Parent with a statement, in a form reasonably satisfactory to Parent,
setting forth all paid and Unpaid Third Party Expenses incurred by or on
behalf of the Company or any Subsidiary as of the Closing Date, or anticipated
to be incurred or payable by or on behalf of the Company or any Subsidiary
after the Closing (the " _Statement of Expenses_ "). The Company shall
deliver, from each vendor or other payee on the Statement of Expenses, an
invoice or statement setting forth the amounts required to pay off in full on
the Closing Date, the Third Party Expenses owing to such vendor or other payee
and wire transfer information for such payment. The Company shall take all
necessary action to ensure that Third Party Expenses shall not be incurred by
the Company after the Closing Date without the express prior written consent
of Parent. No Subsidiary shall incur any Third Party Expenses.

 

7.9 _Securities Law Compliance_. The Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause each Stockholder to deliver all documentation, in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to Parent, necessary to determine whether or
not such Stockholder is an Accredited Investor, including the accredited
investor questionnaire attached to _Exhibit_ __ _ I_ (collectively, the "
_Investor Suitability Documentation_ "). Notwithstanding the delivery of any
Investor Suitability Documentation to Parent prior to the Closing, any
Stockholder may, in the reasonable discretion of Parent, be deemed an "
_Unaccredited Investor_ " for purposes of this Agreement.

7.10 _Securities Law Exemption; Transfer Restrictions; Stop-Transfer
Instructions, Legends_.

(a) The Company and Parent shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause

this Agreement in connection with the Mergers to validly qualify for an
exemption from the registration and prospectus delivery requirements of the
Securities Act and the equivalent state "blue sky" laws.

(b) The shares of Parent Class A Common Stock constitute "restricted
securities" under the Securities Act, and may not be transferred absent
registration under the Securities Act or an exemption therefrom, and any such
transfer shall be subject to compliance with applicable state securities laws.
A Stockholder that receives shares of Parent Class A Common Stock may, (i) if
it is a partnership, transfer the shares of Parent Class A Common Stock for no
consideration to its partners ( _provided_ that each was a partner at the
Effective Time) in accordance with such partnership interests, or (ii) if it
is a limited liability company, transfer the shares of Parent Class A Common
Stock for no consideration to its members in accordance with their interest in
the limited liability company ( _provided_ that each was a member at the

 



-61-  Effective Time); _provided_ that in each case (x) such transferring
Stockholder shall give Parent written notice prior to the time of such
transfer stating the name and address of the transferee and identifying the
securities with respect to which the rights under this Agreement are being
transferred; and (y) such transferee shall agree in writing, in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent, to be bound by the restrictions
on transfer set forth in this Agreement.

(c) To ensure compliance with the restrictions imposed by this Agreement,
Parent may issue appropriate "stop-transfer" instructions to its transfer
agent. Parent shall not be required (a) to transfer on its books any shares of
Parent Class A Common Stock that have been sold or otherwise transferred
in violation of any of the provisions of this Agreement or (b) to treat as
owner of such shares of Parent Class A Common Stock, or to accord the right to
vote or pay dividends, to any purchaser or other transferee to whom such
shares of Parent Class A Common Stock has been purportedly so transferred.

(d) Each book-entry security entitlement representing any shares of Parent
Class A Common Stock (or any other securities issued in respect of such shares
upon any stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, merger, consolidation
or similar event) issued to or held by any Stockholder in accordance with
the terms hereof shall bear the following legends (in addition to any other
legends required by law, Parents certificate of incorporation, Parents
bylaws or any other agreement to which such Stockholder is a party):

 

THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED HEREBY HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE
SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE "ACT"), OR UNDER THE SECURITIES LAWS
OF ANY STATE. THESE SECURITIES ARE SUBJECT TO RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFERABILITY
AND RESALE AND MAY NOT BE TRANSFERRED OR RESOLD EXCEPT AS PERMITTED UNDER THE
ACT AND APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS, PURSUANT TO REGISTRATION OR
EXEMPTION THEREFROM. THE ISSUER OF THESE SECURITIES MAY REQUIRE AN OPINION OF
COUNSEL IN FORM AND SUBSTANCE SATISFACTORY TO THE ISSUER TO THE EFFECT THAT
ANY PROPOSED TRANSFER OR RESALE IS IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE ACT AND ANY
APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS.

7.11 _Access to Information_. At all times prior to the Effective Time the
Company shall afford Parent and its Representatives reasonable access during
normal business hours to (i) all of the assets, properties, Books and Records
and Contracts of the Company and its Subsidiaries, including all Company IP,
(ii) all other information concerning the business, assets, properties and
personnel (subject to restrictions imposed by applicable law) of the Company
and its Subsidiaries as Parent may reasonably request, and (iii) all Employees
of the Company and its Subsidiaries as identified by Parent. The Company
agrees to provide to Parent and its accountants, counsel and other
Representatives copies of internal financial statements (including Tax Returns
and supporting documentation) promptly upon request. No information or
knowledge obtained in any investigation conducted pursuant to this _Section_
__ _ 7.11_ or otherwise shall affect or be deemed to qualify, limit, modify,
amend or supplement any representation or warranty contained herein or in the
Disclosure Schedule, the conditions to the obligations of the parties to
consummate the Mergers in accordance with the terms and provisions of this
Agreement, or the rights of Parent or any Indemnified Party under or arising
out of a breach of this Agreement.

 



-62- 7.12 _Insurance_.

 

(a) During the period beginning at the Effective Time and ending six years
after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall ensure that each of the
First-Step Surviving Company and the Surviving Company, fulfills and honors
the obligations of the Company to the Companys present and former directors
and officers (the " _Indemnified D andOs_") pursuant to the terms of the
Companys Certificate of Incorporation, the Companys Bylaws and any other
agreement between the Company and Indemnified DandOs, in each case as in effect
on date this Agreement is executed (the " _Existing Indemnity Obligations_
"); _provided_ , _however_ , that all rights to indemnification in respect of
any claims asserted or made within such six-year period shall continue until
the disposition of such claim.

(b) The Company shall purchase prior to the Closing a fully prepaid "tail" or
"runoff" insurance policy, which (i) has an effective term of six years from
the Closing, (ii) covers the current and former directors and officers of the
Company during the six-year period immediately following the Closing
with respect matters occurring at or prior to the Closing and (iii) contains
coverage terms comparable to those applicable to the current directors and
officers of the Company (the " _Tail Policy_ "). Parent, Merger Subs, the
First-Step Surviving Company, and the Surviving Company shall maintain such
Tail Policy in full force and effect for the term of such policy.

7.13  _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company shall give prompt notice
to Parent of: (a) the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event, the
occurrence or non-occurrence of which is likely to cause any of the
conditions to the obligations of Parent to consummate the Mergers set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 2.2_ _(b)(_ _i_ _)_ or  _(ii)_ not to be satisfied;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 7.13_ shall not (a) limit or otherwise affect any remedies
available to the party receiving such notice, or (b) constitute an
acknowledgment or admission of a breach of this Agreement. No disclosure by
the Company pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 7.13_, however, shall affect or
be deemed to qualify, limit, modify, amend or supplement any representation
or warranty contained herein or in the Disclosure Schedule for purposes of
indemnification, the conditions to the obligations of the parties to
consummate the Mergers in accordance with the terms and provisions of this
Agreement, or the rights of Parent or any Indemnified Party under or arising
out of a breach of this Agreement. Any unintentional breach of this _Section_
__ _ 7.13_ shall be deemed a breach of the underlying representation of
warranty and not, for the avoidance of doubt, a breach of this _Section_ __ _
7.13_.

7.14 _Remediation Plan_. The Company shall implement the remediation plan set
forth on _Schedule 7.14_ (the " _Remediation Plan_ ").

 

7.15 _Self-Disclosure_. The Company shall submit an initial Voluntary Self
Disclosure to OFAC and any other applicable agencies regarding its potential
non-compliance with U.S export control and economic sanctions laws, and shall
comply with any reasonable requests from OFAC or other appropriate agency
including for additional or supplemental information during the period the
voluntary self-disclosure is pending with OFAC or other agency.

recoverable under this _Section_ __ _ 9.2(a_ _)(_ _ii)_ );

-66- (d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
this  _Article_ __ _ IX_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the

any representation, warranty or covenant in this Agreement; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (i) this _Section_ __ _ 9.2(d)_ shall not be deemed a waiver
by any party of any right to specific performance or injunctive
relief pursuant to the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 6.4_ and _Article XI_ ,

had knowledge of such fraud or willful breach.

(e) The rights of the Indemnified Parties to indemnification, compensation or

knowledge acquired at any time, whether before or after the execution and
delivery of this Agreement or the Closing Date, with respect to the accuracy
or inaccuracy of or compliance with, any representation, warranty, covenant or

other remedy based on any such representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement. No Indemnified Party shall be required to show reliance on any
representation, warranty, certificate or other agreement in order for such

Made Available to Parent and its Representatives, including in the diligence
process or in any electronic data room, except as expressly set forth in
_Article II_ of this Agreement (as subject to the related portions of the
Disclosure Schedules), and Parent disclaims, on behalf of itself and the other
Indemnified Parties, reliance on any other representations and warranties of
any kind or nature express or implied (including, but not limited to, any
relating to the future or historical financial condition, results of
operations, assets or liabilities or prospects of the Company and its
Subsidiaries), _provided_ that the foregoing disclaimer shall not apply in
connection with any claim based on fraud or willful breach of any party.
Nothing in this Agreement shall limit the right of Parent or any other
Indemnified Party to pursue remedies under any Related Agreement against the
parties thereto.

 

9.3 _Limitations on Indemnification_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Indemnified Parties
may not recover for indemnification under  _Section_ __ _ 9.2(a)(_ _i_ _)_
for breaches of or inaccuracies in the representations and warranties
contained in this Agreement or the Officers Certificate (other than for
breaches of the IP and Privacy Representations and Surviving Representations)
until such time as the cumulative amount of all Losses that may be claimed
under _Section_ __ _ 9.2(a)(_ _i_ _)_ exceeds $1,500,000 (the " _Basket_ "),
at which time the Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to recover in
accordance with this Agreement all such Losses, including those that comprised
any portion of the Basket.

 

(b) Except in the case of fraud or willful breach in connection with this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or with respect to the IP
and Privacy Representations and Surviving Representations, the Indemnified
Parties sole and exclusive source of recovery for indemnification claims
under _Section_ __ _ 9.2(a_ _)(_ _i_ _)_ or  _Section_ __ _ 9.2(a)(ii)_
shall be recourse against the cash and stock held by the Escrow

 



-67-  Agent as Escrow Amount, and the liability of each Indemnifying Party for
indemnification claims under _Section_ __ _ 9.2(a_ _)(_ _i_ _)_ or 
_Section_ __ _ 9.2(a)(ii)_ shall be limited, in the aggregate, to a dollar
amount equal to such Indemnifying Partys Pro Rata Portion of the Escrow
Amount.

 

(c) In the event of fraud or willful breach in connection with this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby, claims under  _Section_ __ _
9.2(a)(_ _i_ _)_ and _Section_ __ _ 9.2(a)(ii)_ relating to IP and Privacy
Representations, Surviving Representations or claims under  _Section_ __ _
9.2(a)(_ _iii_ _)_ through _(x)_ , the Indemnified Parties shall be entitled
to bring indemnification claims directly against the Indemnifying Parties;
_provided_ , _however_ , that (i) the Indemnified Parties shall only be
permitted to recover Losses from the Indemnifying Parties in respect of such
claims if and the extent that the Escrow Amount is no longer available, and
(ii) in no event shall the liability of any Indemnifying Party for (A) claims
under _Section_ __ _ 9.2(a)(_ _i_ _)_ and _(ii)_ relating to IP and Privacy
Representations exceed $80,000,000 in the aggregate (inclusive of any and all
amounts paid from the Escrow Amount) and (B) claims under _Section_ __ _
9.2(a)(_ _i_ _)_ and _(ii)_ relating to Surviving Representations or claims
under _Section_ __ _ 9.2(a)(_ _iii_ _)_ through _(x)_ , exceed the Total
Consideration actually received (including any amounts remaining in the Escrow
Fund and the Representative Expense Fund) by such Indemnifying Party
hereunder, in each case except in the case of fraud or willful breach (in
which event there shall be no limitation on the liability of such
Indemnifying Party in connection with a claim based on fraud or willful breach
on the part of such Indemnifying Party or on the part of the Company in which
such Indemnifying Party participated or had knowledge of such fraud or
willful breach, it being understood that the liability of any other
Indemnifying Party shall be capped at the Merger Consideration actually
received by such Indemnifying Party hereunder) or under applicable Law except
to the extent imposed under applicable Law.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, nothing in
this Agreement shall act to limit, expand or extend any common law duty or
obligation under applicable Law to mitigate any Losses that may be suffered by
the Indemnified Parties.

 

(e) Losses shall be calculated net of actual recoveries under existing
insurance policies and contractual indemnification or contribution provisions
(in each case, calculated net of any actual collection costs and reserves,
deductibles, or premium adjustments); _provided_ , _however,_ that in the
event that the Indemnified Parties first recover from the Escrow Amount or
the Indemnifying Parties for any Losses and thereafter recover for those same
Losses pursuant to any existing insurance policies and contractual
indemnification or contribution provisions, then the amount so recovered shall
be returned to the Escrow Amount or paid to the Indemnifying Parties, as
applicable. In addition, Losses shall exclude exemplary or punitive damages,
unless specifically awarded to a third party and paid to such third party by
an Indemnified Party. For avoidance of doubt, the Indemnified Parties shall
have no obligation to seek any such recovery under insurance policies or
indemnity, contribution or other similar agreements for any Losses prior to
seeking indemnification under this Agreement.

 

(f) Any liability for indemnification under this _Article IX_ shall be
determined without duplication of recovery by reason of the state of facts
giving rise to such liability constituting a breach or inaccuracy of more than
one representation, warranty, covenant or certificate.

 

(g) For purposes of this _Article IX_ , all Parent Class A Common Stock
subject to recovery shall be valued at Parent Trading Price. 

9.4 _Indemnification Claim Procedures_.

 

(a) Subject to the limitations set forth in _Section_ __ _ 9.1_, if an
Indemnified Party wishes to make an indemnification claim under this
_Article_ __ _ IX_, such Indemnified Party shall deliver a written notice (an
" _Indemnification Claim Notice_ ") to the Stockholder Representative (or in
the event an Indemnified 

 



-68-  Party elects to pursue such indemnification claim directly against an
Indemnifying Party, to such Indemnifying Party directly) (i) stating that an
Indemnified Party has paid, incurred, suffered or sustained, or reasonably
anticipates that it may pay, incur, suffer or sustain Losses, and (ii)
specifying such Losses in reasonable detail (to the extent available), the
date (if available) that each such Loss was paid, incurred, suffered or
sustained, or the basis for such anticipated liability, and, if applicable,
the nature of the misrepresentation, breach of warranty or covenant to which
such item is related. Parent may update an Indemnification Claim Notice from
time to time to reflect any change in circumstances following the date
thereof.

(b) If the Stockholder Representative on behalf of the Indemnifying Parties
(or the Indemnifying Party in the event that indemnification is being sought
hereunder directly from such Indemnifying Party) shall not object in writing
within the 30-day period after receipt of an Indemnification Claim Notice by
delivery of a written notice of objection containing a reasonably detailed
description of the facts and circumstances supporting an objection to
the applicable indemnification claim (an " _Indemnification Claim Objection
Notice_ "), such failure to so object shall be an irrevocable acknowledgment
by the Stockholder Representative on behalf of the Indemnifying Parties (or
the applicable Indemnifying Party) that the Indemnified Party is entitled to
the full amount of the claim for Losses set forth in such Indemnification
Claim Notice. In such event, the Parent and Stockholder Representative shall
jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to promptly release from the Escrow Amount
cash and shares of Parent Class A Common Stock with an aggregate value equal
to the Losses set forth in such Indemnification Claim Notice, 50% of which
shall be in cash and 50% of which shall be in shares of Parent Class A Common
Stock.

(c) In the event that the Stockholder Representative shall deliver
an Indemnification Claim Objection Notice in accordance with _Section_ __ _
9.4(b)_ (or in the event that indemnification is being sought hereunder
directly from an Indemnifying Party, if such Indemnifying Party shall object
to any claim or claims made in any Indemnification Claim Notice to recover
claims directly from such Indemnifying Party within 30 days after delivery of
such Indemnification Claim Notice), the Stockholder Representative (or such
objecting Indemnifying Party) and Parent shall attempt in good faith to agree
upon the rights of the respective parties with respect to each of such claims.
If the Stockholder Representative (or such objecting Indemnifying Party) and
Parent should so agree, a memorandum setting forth such agreement shall be
prepared and signed by both parties. In such event, Parent shall be entitled
to receive from the Escrow Amount cash and stock with an aggregate value equal
to the Losses set forth in such Indemnification Claim Notice, 50% of which
shall be in cash and 50% of which shall be in shares of Parent Class A Common
Stock. Should the amount held in the Escrow Amount, if any, be insufficient to
satisfy in whole the amount to be paid to an Indemnified Party in accordance
with such memorandum, then each Indemnifying Party shall, within ten (10)
Business Days following the date of such memorandum, pay to the Indemnified
Party, such Indemnifying Partys Pro Rata Portion of such shortfall either
in cash or shares of Parent Class A Common Stock, or some combination
thereof, subject to the election of such Indemnifying Party in its sole and
absolute discretion.

 

(d) If no such agreement can be reached after good faith negotiation and prior
to thirty (30) days after delivery of an Indemnification Claim Objection
Notice, Parent may pursue arbitration subject and pursuant to the provisions
in _Article XI_.

9.5 _Third-Party Claims_. In the event that an Indemnified Party becomes
aware of a third party claim (a " _Third Party Claim_ ") that the Indemnified
Party reasonably believes may result in a demand against the Escrow Amount or
for other indemnification pursuant to this _Article_ __ _ IX_, the
Indemnified Party shall promptly notify the Stockholder Representative of such
claim; _provided_ that failure to so notify shall not affect the right of the
Indemnified Parties to seek indemnification from the Escrow Amount hereunder,
except to the extent that any holder of Company Capital Stock is actually
prejudiced thereby. The

 



-69-  Stockholder Representative shall be entitled on behalf of the Indemnifying
Parties to participate in, but not determine or conduct, the defense of the
Third Party Claim at the Indemnifying Parties sole cost and expense, and
shall be entitled to receive regular updates on any material developments and
copies of all pleadings, notices and material communications with respect to
such Third Party Claim. For avoidance of doubt, the right to participate
shall mean a right to provide input on overall strategy and to receive
periodic updates on status, but not a right to prior approval of filings or to
participate in actual proceedings. Parent shall have the right to
select counsel reasonably acceptable to the Stockholder Representative and to
conduct the defense of, and to settle, any such Third Party Claim. If Parent
settles a Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the
Stockholder Representative (which consent shall not be unreasonably
conditioned, withheld or delayed), then the costs and expenses of the
settlement will not be deemed dispositive of the validity or amount of such
Loss; _provided_ , _further_ , that if Parent settles a Third Party Claim
without the prior written consent of the Stockholder Representative (which
consent shall not be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed) and the
Stockholder Representative shall not have objected within thirty (30) days
after a written request for such consent by Parent, the entire costs and
expenses of the settlement shall be deemed dispositive of the validity or
amount of such Loss. In the event that the Stockholder Representative has
consented to any such settlement, adjustment or compromise, the Indemnifying
Parties or the consenting Indemnifying Parties, as applicable, shall have no
power or authority to object under any provision of this _Section_ __ _ 9.5_
to the existence of the Losses or the amount of such settlement, adjustment
or compromise.

_ARTICLE X _

 

 _STOCKHOLDER REPRESENTATIVE_

 

10.1 _Appointment and Authority of Stockholder Representative_. By virtue of
the execution and delivery of a Joinder Agreement, and the adoption of this
Agreement and approval of the Mergers by the Stockholders, the consummation of
the Mergers or participating in the Mergers and receiving the benefits
thereof, including the right to receive the consideration payable in
connection with the Mergers, each of the Indemnifying Parties shall be deemed
to have agreed to appoint Shareholder Representative Services LLC as its
representative, agent and attorney-in-fact, as the Stockholder Representative
for and on behalf of the Indemnifying Parties to give and receive notices and
communications in respect of indemnification claims under this Agreement to
be recovered against the Escrow Amount, to authorize payment to any
Indemnified Party from the Escrow Amount in satisfaction of any
indemnification claims hereunder by any Indemnified Party, to object to such
payments, to agree to, negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of,
and demand arbitration and comply with orders of courts and awards of
arbitrators with respect to any such indemnification claims, to assert,
negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of, and demand arbitration
and comply with orders of courts and awards of arbitrators with respect to,
any such indemnification claim by any Indemnified Party hereunder against any
Indemnifying Party or by any such Indemnifying Party against any Indemnified
Party or any dispute between any Indemnified Party and any such Indemnifying
Party, in each case relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, and to take all other actions that are either (i)
necessary or appropriate in the judgment of the Stockholder Representative for
the accomplishment of the foregoing or (ii) specifically mandated by the terms
of this Agreement. Such agency may be changed by the Indemnifying Parties
from time to time upon not less than 30 days prior written notice to Parent;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Stockholder Representative may not be
removed unless holders of a two-thirds interest of the Escrow Amount agree to
such removal and to the identity of the substituted agent. The Stockholder
Representative may resign upon 30 days prior written notice to the
Indemnifying Parties and Parent. In the event of any such resignation, a
successor stockholder representative, which shall be any stockholder of the
Company that holds 20% or greater of the outstanding Company Capital Stock as
of the date hereof, shall be appointed by the Stockholders with the
written approval of Parent, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld
or delayed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a vacancy in the position of
Stockholder Representative may be filled by the holders of a majority in
interest of the Escrow Amount. No bond shall be required of the Stockholder
Representative. After the Closing, notices or communications to or from the
Stockholder Representative shall constitute notice to or from the Indemnifying
Parties.

 



-70- 10.2 _Exculpation and Indemnification of Stockholder Representation_. The
Stockholder Representative shall not be liable for any act done or omitted in
connection with the Stockholder Representatives services hereunder and any
agreements ancillary hereto as Stockholder Representative, except in the event
of liability directly resulting from the Stockholder Representatives bad
faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Stockholder Representative
shall not be liable for any action or omission pursuant to the advice of
counsel. The Indemnifying Parties shall indemnify the Stockholder
Representative and hold the Stockholder Representative harmless against any
and all losses, liabilities, expenses, damages, claims, penalties, fines,
forfeitures, fees and costs, including the reasonable fees and expenses of
any legal counsel and experts and their staffs retained by the Stockholder
Representative and all expense of documentation location, duplication and
shipment (" _Stockholder Representative Expenses_ "), arising out of or
in connection with the Stockholder Representatives execution and performance
of this Agreement and any agreements ancillary hereto, in each case as such
Stockholder Representative Expense is suffered or incurred; _provided_ , that
in the event that any such Stockholder Representative Expense is finally
adjudicated to have been directly caused by the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of the Stockholder Representative, the Stockholder Representative
will reimburse the Indemnifying Parties the amount of such indemnified
Stockholder Representative Expense to the extent attributable to such gross
negligence or willful misconduct. If not paid directly to the Stockholder
Representative by the Indemnifying Parties, any such Stockholder
Representative Expenses may be recovered by the Stockholder Representative
from (a) the funds in the Representative Expense Fund, (b) the funds
constituting the Escrow Amount at such time as remaining amounts
would otherwise be distributable to the Indemnifying Parties and (c) the
Escrow Shares solely at such time and to such extent as any such shares are
released to the Indemnifying Parties; _provided_ , that while this section
allows the Stockholder Representative to be paid from the aforementioned
sources of funds, this does not relieve the Indemnifying Parties from their
obligation to promptly pay such Stockholder Representative Expenses as they
are suffered or incurred, nor does it prevent the Stockholder Representative
from seeking any remedies available to it at law or otherwise. In no event
will the Stockholder Representative be required to advance its own funds on
behalf of the Indemnifying Parties or otherwise. Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, any restrictions or limitations on liability
or indemnification obligations of the Indemnifying Parties set forth elsewhere
in this Agreement are not intended to be applicable to the indemnities
provided to the Stockholder Representative under this section. The foregoing
indemnities will survive the Closing, the resignation or removal of the
Stockholder Representative or the termination of this Agreement. A decision,
act, consent or instruction of the Stockholder Representative, including an
amendment, extension or waiver of this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _
11.5_ or _Section_ __ _ 11.6_, shall constitute a decision of the
Indemnifying Parties and shall be final, conclusive and binding upon the
Stockholders and Parent; and Parent may rely upon any such decision, act,
consent or instruction of the Stockholder Representative as being the
decision, act, consent or instruction of the Indemnifying Parties. Parent is
hereby relieved from any liability to any person for any acts done by Parent
in accordance with such decision, act, consent or instruction of the
Stockholder Representative.

11.3 _Confidentiality_. The Company and Parent hereby agree that the
information obtained in any investigation pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 7.11_
or any information obtained pursuant to the notice requirements of _Section_
__ _ 7.13_, or otherwise pursuant to the negotiation and execution of this
Agreement or the effectuation of the transactions contemplated hereby ("
_Confidential Information_ "), shall be governed by the terms of the Mutual
Non-Disclosure Agreement dated as of December 7, 2017 (the " _Confidential
Disclosure Agreement_ "), between the Company and Parent. The Stockholder
Representative shall keep all Confidential Information confidential;
_provided_ , that, notwithstanding the foregoing or anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, following Closing, the Stockholder
Representative shall be permitted to disclose

 



-73-  information as required by law or to employees, advisors, agents or
consultants of the Stockholder Representative and to the Indemnifying Parties,
in each case who have a need to know such information, _provided_ that such
persons are subject to confidentiality obligations with respect thereto.

11.4 _Public Disclosure_. Neither the Company nor any of its Representatives
shall issue any statement or communication to any third party (other than its
agents that are bound by confidentiality restrictions) regarding the subject
matter of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, including,
if applicable, the termination of this Agreement and the reasons therefor,
without the consent of Parent, unless required by applicable Law and except
pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 7.1_ and _Section_ __ _ 7.3_, respectively in
connection with the Company obtaining the Requisite Stockholder Approval and
the other consents and approvals of the Stockholders and other third parties
contemplated by this Agreement.

11.5 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto at any
time by execution of an instrument in writing signed on behalf of the party
against whom enforcement is sought. For purposes of this _Section_ __ _
11.5_, the Stockholders are deemed to have agreed that any amendment of this
Agreement signed by the Stockholder Representative shall be binding upon and
effective against the Stockholders whether or not they have signed such
amendment.

 

11.6 _Extension and Waiver_. At any time prior to the Closing, Parent, on the
one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, may, to the extent legally
allowed, (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations of
the other party hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and
warranties made to such party contained herein or in any document delivered
pursuant hereto, and (c) waive compliance with any of the covenants,
agreements or conditions for the benefit of such party contained herein. Any
agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver
shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf
of such party. For purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 11.6_, the Stockholders
are deemed to have agreed that any extension or waiver signed by the Company
shall be binding upon and effective against all Stockholders whether or not
they have signed such extension or waiver.

11.7  _Assignment_. This Agreement shall not be assigned by operation of law
or otherwise, except that Parent may assign its rights and delegate its
obligations hereunder to its Affiliates as long as Parent remains ultimately
liable for all of Parents obligations hereunder.

11.8 _Severability_. In the event that any provision of this Agreement or the
application thereof, becomes or is declared by an arbitrator or court of
competent jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of
this Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of
such provision to other persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as
reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties further
agree to replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a
valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible,
the economic, business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable
provision.

11.9 _Specific Performance and Other Remedies_.

(a) The parties to this Agreement agree that, in the event of any breach or
threatened breach by the other party or parties hereto, any Stockholder or
the Stockholder Representative of any covenant, obligation or other agreement
set forth in this Agreement, (i) each party shall be entitled, without any
proof of actual damages (and in addition to any other remedy that may be
available to it), to a decree or order of specific performance or mandamus to
enforce the observance and performance of such covenant, obligation or other
agreement and an injunction preventing or restraining such breach
or threatened breach, and (ii) no party hereto shall be required to provide
or post any bond or other security or collateral in connection with any such
decree, order or injunction or in connection with any related action or legal
proceeding.

  



-74- (b) Any and all remedies herein expressly conferred herein upon a party hereto
shall be deemed to be cumulative with, and not exclusive of, any other remedy
conferred hereby, or by law or in equity upon such party, and the exercise by
a party hereto of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other
remedy.

 

(c) The liability of any Person under _Article_ __ _ IX_ will be in addition
to, and not exclusive of, any other liability that such Person may have at
law or in equity based on such Persons fraud or willful breach.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, none of
the provisions set forth in this Agreement, including the provisions
set forth in _Article_ __ _ IX_, shall be deemed a waiver by any party to
this Agreement of any right or remedy which such party may have at law or in
equity based on any other Persons fraud or willful breach, nor will any
such provisions limit, or be deemed to limit (i) the amounts of recovery
sought or awarded in any such claim for fraud or willful breach, (ii) the time
period during which a claim for fraud or willful breach may be brought or
(iii) the recourse which any such party may seek against another Person with
respect to a claim for fraud or willful breach.

11.10 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the laws that
might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of laws
thereof.

 

11.11 _Conflict of Interest; Attorney-Client Privilege_.

 

(a) If the Stockholder Representative so desires, acting on behalf of the
Indemnifying Parties and without the need for any consent or waiver by the
Company or Parent, Cooley LLP (" _Cooley_ ") shall be permitted to represent
the Stockholder Representative and the Indemnifying Parties after the Closing
in connection with any matter, including without limitation, anything related
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, any other agreements
referenced herein or any disagreement or dispute relating thereto. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, after the Closing, Cooley shall be
permitted to represent the Stockholder Representative, the Indemnifying
Parties, any of their agents and Affiliates, or any one or more of them, in
connection with any negotiation, transaction or dispute (including any
litigation, arbitration or other adversary proceeding) with Parent, the
Company or any of their agents or Affiliates under or relating to this
Agreement, any transaction contemplated by this Agreement, and any related
matter, such as claims or disputes arising under other agreements
entered into in connection with this Agreement, including with respect to any
indemnification claims. Upon and after the Closing, the Company shall cease to
have any attorney-client relationship with Cooley, unless and to the extent
Cooley is specifically engaged in writing by the Company to represent the
Company after the Closing and either such engagement involves no conflict of
interest with respect to the Indemnifying Parties or the Stockholder
Representative consents in writing at the time to such engagement. Any such
representation of the Company by Cooley after the Closing shall not affect the
foregoing provisions hereof.

(b) All communications involving attorney-client confidences between an
Indemnifying Party, its affiliates or the Company and Cooley relating to the
negotiation, documentation and consummation of the First Merger and the
transactions contemplated hereby (" _Privileged Deal Communications_ ") shall
not be used by Parent in connection with any dispute under this Agreement with
any Indemnifying Party. For avoidance of doubt, Parent shall have the
exclusive ownership of the privilege relating to such Privileged Deal
Communications and shall have a right to access such Privileged Deal
Communications. Parent hereby agrees that the Company securityholders, Cooley
and the Stockholder Representative and their Representatives shall have a
right to access the Privileged Deal Communications following Closing in
connection with any dispute with any Indemnifying Party under this Agreement,
or

 



-75-  related to the Mergers or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Parent hereby agrees that neither it nor its Affiliates, including,
after Closing, the Surviving Company, shall assert attorney-client privilege
against the Company securityholders, Cooley or the Stockholder Representative,
or any of their Representatives, with respect to the Privileged Deal
Communications.

 

11.12 _Resolution of Disputes_.

 

(a) Subject to _Section_ __ _ 11.12(f)_ hereof, any claim or dispute arising
out of, related to or in connection with this Agreement, or the
interpretation, making, performance, breach or termination thereof (each, a "
_Dispute_ "), shall (except as specifically set forth in this Agreement) be
finally settled by binding arbitration in the County of San Francisco,
California in accordance with the Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and
Procedures (the " _Rules_ ") then in effect of the Judicial Arbitration and
Mediation Services, Inc. and judgment upon any such award rendered may
be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator shall
have the authority to grant any equitable and legal remedies that would be
available in any judicial proceeding instituted to resolve a Dispute.

 

(b) _Selection of Arbitrators_. Such arbitration shall be conducted by a
single independent arbitrator chosen by mutual agreement of Parent and
Stockholder Representative. Alternatively, at the request of either party
before the commencement of arbitration, the arbitration shall be conducted by
three independent arbitrators, none of whom shall have any competitive
interests with Parent or the Company. Parent and Stockholder Representative
shall each select one arbitrator. The two arbitrators so selected shall select
a third arbitrator.

 

(c) _Discovery_. In any arbitration under this _Section_ __ _ 11.12_, each
party shall be limited to calling a total of three witnesses both for
purposes of deposition and the arbitration hearing. Subject to the foregoing
limitation on the number of witnesses, the arbitrator or arbitrators, as the
case may be, shall set a limited time period and establish
procedures designed to reduce the cost and time for discovery while allowing
the parties an opportunity, adequate in the sole judgment of the arbitrator,
or a majority of the three arbitrators, as the case may be, to discover
relevant information from the opposing parties about the subject matter of
the Dispute. The arbitrator, or a majority of the three arbitrators, as the
case may be, shall rule upon motions to compel or limit discovery and shall
have the authority to impose sanctions for discovery abuses, including
attorneys fees and costs, to the same extent as a competent court of law or
equity, should the arbitrator, or a majority of the three arbitrators, as the
case may be, determine that discovery was sought without
substantial justification or that discovery was refused or objected to
without substantial justification.

(d) _Governing Law_. The arbitrator or arbitrators will apply Delaware
substantive and procedural law to any Dispute, without reference to rules of
conflict of law, and shall administer and conduct any arbitration in
accordance with the Delaware Rules of Civil Procedure. To the extent that the
Rules conflict with Delaware law, Delaware law shall take precedence. The
arbitrator, or a majority of the three arbitrators, as the case may be, shall
have the power to decide any motions brought by either party to the
arbitration, including motions for summary judgment or adjudication, and
motions to dismiss and demurrers, prior to any arbitration hearing. The
arbitrator, or a majority of the three arbitrators, as the case may be, shall
have the power to award any remedies available under applicable laws,
including injunctive relief, and may award reasonable attorneys fees and
reasonable out-of-pocket costs to the prevailing party except as prohibited
by applicable laws.

(e) _Decision_. The decision of the arbitrator or a majority of the three
arbitrators, as the case may be, shall be final, binding, and conclusive on
the parties to the arbitration. Such decision shall be written and shall be
supported by written findings of fact and conclusions that shall set forth the
award, judgment, decree or order awarded by the arbitrator or arbitrators.
Judgment may be entered on the arbitrators or arbitrators decision in any
court having jurisdiction.

 



-76- (f) _Court Action_. Except as provided for in this Agreement, neither
Stockholder Representative nor Parent will be permitted to pursue court
action regarding any Dispute that is subject to arbitration.

(g) _Other Relief_. The parties agree that, pursuant to applicable law, any
party may petition a court of competent jurisdiction for a temporary
restraining order, preliminary injunction, or other interim or conservatory
relief, as necessary to enforce the provisions of this Agreement and without
breach of this arbitration provision and without abridgement of the powers of
the arbitrator or arbitrators. The parties understand and agree that any
breach or threatened breach of this Agreement shall cause irreparable injury
and that money damages will not provide an adequate remedy therefor, and that
any relief to which the non-breaching party may be entitled may be rendered
ineffectual without injunctive relief and, accordingly, both parties hereby
consent to the issuance of an injunction. If either party seeks injunctive
relief, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover reasonable costs and
attorneys fees.

 

(h) _Costs and Expenses_. Subject to _Section_ __ _ 11.12(b)_, each party
shall pay its own costs and expenses (including counsel fees) (in the case of
the Stockholder Representative, on behalf of the Indemnifying Parties) of any
such arbitration, and each party waives its right to seek an order compelling
the other party to pay its portion of its costs and expenses (including
counsel fees) for any arbitration.

(i) _Confidentiality_. Stockholder Representative and Parent agree
to maintain in complete confidence any Dispute arising out of, relating to,
or in connection with this Agreement, or the interpretation, validity,
construction, performance, breach, or termination hereof, including the
existence of an arbitration proceeding and the outcome thereof, and shall not
disclose or publicize any such information to any third party (other than to
each parties employees, consultants, agents and advisors and, in the case of
the Stockholder Representative, the Indemnifying Parties, in each case who
have a need to know such information, _provided_ that such persons are subject
to confidentiality restrictions with respect thereto).

 

(j) _Agreement to Arbitrate_. Stockholder Representative has read and
understands this _Section_ __ _ 11.12_, which discusses arbitration.
Stockholder Representative understands that by signing this Agreement,
Stockholder Representative agrees to the extent permitted by applicable laws,
to submit any future claims arising out of, relating to, or in
connection with this Agreement, or the interpretation, validity,
construction, performance, breach, or termination thereof, to binding
arbitration, and that this arbitration clause constitutes a waiver of
Stockholder Representatives right to a jury trial and relates to the
resolution of all Disputes referred to in this _Section_ __ _ 11.12_;
_provided_ , that the foregoing shall not apply to any future claims relating
to _Section_ __ _ 10.2_.

 

11.13 ___Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY AND ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM
(WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO
THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIONS OF ANY PARTY HERETO IN NEGOTIATION,
ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE OR ENFORCEMENT OF THIS AGREEMENT.

 

11.14 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, Annex A hereto, the Exhibits and
Schedules hereto, the Disclosure Schedule, the Related Agreements, and the
documents and instruments and other agreements among the parties hereto
referenced herein constitute the entire agreement among the parties hereto
with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and supersede all
prior agreements and understandings both written and oral, among the parties
with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement, and are not intended to
confer upon any other person any rights or remedies hereunder.

 



-77- 11.15 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and
shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each
of the parties and delivered to the other party, it being understood that all
parties need not sign the same counterpart. The exchange of a fully executed
Agreement (in counterparts or otherwise) by electronic transmission in .PDF
format or by facsimile shall be sufficient to bind the parties to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement.

 

[ _Remainder of Page Intentionally Left Blank_ ]

 



-78- IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Parent, Merger Subs, the Company and the Stockholder
Representative have caused this Agreement to be executed as of the date first
written above.
