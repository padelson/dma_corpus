THIS ACQUISITION AGREEMENT (this " _Agreement_ ") is made and entered into as
of June 3, 2013 by and among salesforce.com, inc., a Delaware corporation ("
_Parent_ "), Excalibur Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-
owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "), and ExactTarget, Inc., a
Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "). All capitalized terms that are used
in this Agreement but not defined herein shall have the respective meanings
ascribed thereto in _Annex A_.

W I T N E S S E T H:

WHEREAS, Parent desires to acquire the Company on the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in this Agreement.

WHEREAS, in order to effect the foregoing acquisition, Parent and the Company
have agreed that Merger Sub shall commence a tender offer (the " _Offer_ ") to
acquire all of the outstanding Company Shares at a price of thirty-three and
75/100 Dollars ($33.75) per Company Share, net to the holder thereof in cash,
without interest (such amount, or any higher amount per Company Share that may
be paid pursuant to the Offer, being hereinafter referred to as the " _Offer
Price_ "), all upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein.

WHEREAS, in order to complete the foregoing acquisition, following the
completion of the Offer, Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Company,
each Company Share (other than Company Shares owned by the Company, Parent or
Merger Sub or Dissenting Shares) that is then outstanding will thereupon be
cancelled and converted into the right to receive cash in an amount equal to
the Offer Price, and the Company will survive the foregoing merger as a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent, all upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth herein.

 

WHEREAS, each of the respective Boards of Directors of Parent and Merger Sub
has approved this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Offer and the Merger, all upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth herein.

 

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company has unanimously (i) determined
that this Agreement is advisable, (ii) determined that this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger, taken
together, are at a price and on terms that are fair to, and in the best
interests of the Company and the Company Stockholders and (iii) approved this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer and
the Merger, all upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein.

 

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, as a
condition and inducement to the willingness of Parent and Merger Sub to enter
into this Agreement, certain stockholders of the Company, in their respective
capacities as stockholders of the Company, are entering into Support
Agreements with Parent (each, a " _Support Agreement_ " and collectively, the
" _Support Agreements_ ") pursuant to which the signatories thereto are
agreeing to, subject to the terms and conditions of such agreements, tender
their Company Shares into the Offer and to take (and refrain from taking)
certain other actions in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 



-1-  NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises and the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein, as
well as other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of

_Section 1.3_) by (y) the percentage that the number of Company Shares
beneficially owned by Parent and Merger Sub (after giving effect to the

Board to maintain at least two (2) directors who are members of the Company
Board immediately prior to such appointments by Parent (each a " _Continuing
Director_ " and, collectively, the " _Continuing Directors_ "); _provided,
however_ , that if the number of Continuing Directors is reduced below two
(2) for any reason, the remaining Continuing Director shall be entitled to
elect or designate a person meeting the foregoing criteria to fill such
vacancy who shall be deemed to be a Continuing Director for purposes of this
Agreement, or, if no

 



-10-   Continuing Directors then remain, the other directors shall designate two
(2) persons meeting the foregoing criteria to fill such vacancies, and such
persons shall be deemed to be Continuing Directors for purposes of this
Agreement. Each Continuing Director shall be an "independent director" as
defined by Rule 303A.02 of the NYSE Rules and eligible to serve on the
Companys audit committee under the Exchange Act and the NYSE Rules and at

1.3_. Parent shall provide to the Company in writing, and be solely
responsible for any information with respect to itself and its nominees,
directors, officers and affiliates, required by such Section 14(f) and Rule
14f-1.

(d) _Required Approvals of Continuing Directors_. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary set forth in this Agreement, from the Appointment Time through
the Effective Time, the approval of a majority of the Continuing Directors (or
the sole Continuing Director if there shall be only one (1) Continuing
Director) shall be required in order to:

(i) amend or terminate this Agreement, or agree or consent to any amendment
or termination of this Agreement, on behalf of the Company;

(ii) extend the time for performance of, or waive, any of the obligations or
other acts of Parent or Merger Sub under this Agreement;

 

(iii) waive any of the Companys rights under this Agreement; or

THE SECOND-STEP MERGER

2.1 _The Merger_.

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement
and the applicable provisions of Delaware Law, at the Effective Time, Merger
Sub shall be merged with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ "), the separate
corporate existence of Merger Sub shall thereupon cease and the Company shall
continue as the surviving corporation of the

 



-11-   Merger. The Company, as the surviving corporation of the Merger, is
sometimes referred to herein as the " _Surviving Corporation_."

 

(b) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
on the Closing Date, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall cause the
Merger to be consummated under Delaware Law by filing a certificate of merger
(or a certificate of ownership and merger, as applicable) in customary form
and substance (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") with the Secretary of State
of the State of Delaware (the " _Delaware Secretary of State_ ") in accordance
with the applicable provisions of Delaware Law. The time of such filing and
acceptance by the Delaware Secretary of State, or such later time as may be
mutually agreed in writing by Parent, Merger Sub and the Company and specified
in the Certificate of Merger, is referred to herein as the " _Effective
Time_."

(c) In the event that Merger Sub shall hold a number of Company Shares so as

"subsequent offering period" provided by Parent and Merger Sub in connection
therewith), the exercise of the Top-Up Option pursuant hereto or otherwise,
Parent shall take all necessary action to consummate and cause the Merger to

Sub in connection with the Offer, if applicable) for the purpose of voting

Recommendation (other than with respect to the Offer). The Company and
Parent, as the case may be, shall furnish all information concerning the
Company or Parent as the other party hereto may reasonably request in
connection with the preparation and filing with the SEC of the Proxy
Statement. Subject to all applicable Law, the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to be disseminated to the
Company Stockholders as promptly as reasonably practicable following the
filing thereof with the SEC. No filing of, or amendment or supplement to, or

-12-   promptly after it receives notice thereof, of any request by the SEC or its
staff for an amendment or revisions to the Proxy Statement, or comments
thereon and responses thereto, or requests by the SEC or its staff for
additional information in connection therewith. If at any time prior to the
Company Stockholders Meeting, any information relating to the Company or
Parent, or any of their respective directors, officers or Affiliates, should
be discovered by the Company or Parent which should be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement so that the Proxy Statement
would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party which
discovers such information shall promptly notify the other party or parties
hereto, as the case may be, and an appropriate amendment or supplement to the
Proxy Statement describing such information shall be promptly prepared and
filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by applicable Law, disseminated
to the Company Stockholders. The Company shall cause the Proxy Statement to

this Agreement in accordance with Delaware Law at the Company Stockholders

automatically into the right to receive a cash amount equal to the Merger
Consideration, provided that the foregoing right to receive such Merger
Consideration in respect of such shares of Company Restricted Stock shall be
unvested and subject to the same vesting schedule, repurchase option or
obligation, risk of forfeiture or other condition as in effect with respect to
each such share of Company Restricted Stock as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time and shall not be paid or payable unless and until such time as
such vesting conditions are met and such repurchase option, risk of forfeiture

paid therefor.

(iv)  _Dissenting Company Shares_.

(A) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, all
Company Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and held by stockholders who shall have neither voted in favor
of the Merger nor consented thereto in writing and who shall have properly and
validly exercised their statutory rights of appraisal in respect of such
Company Shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (collectively, "
_Dissenting Company Shares_ ") shall not be converted into, or represent the
right to receive, the Merger Consideration pursuant to this _Section 2.7_.
Such stockholders shall be entitled to receive payment of the appraised value
of such Dissenting Company Shares in accordance with the provisions of Section
262 of the DGCL, except that all Dissenting Company Shares held by
stockholders who shall have failed to perfect or who shall have effectively
withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal of such Dissenting Company Shares
under such Section 262 of the DGCL shall thereupon be deemed to have been

 



-16-   converted into, and to have become exchangeable for, as of the Effective
Time, the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without any interest
thereon, upon surrender of the certificate or certificates that formerly
evidenced such Company Shares in the manner provided in _Section 2.8_.

 

(B) The Company shall give Parent (1) prompt notice of any demands for
appraisal received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands, and any other

Dissenting Company Shares. The Company shall not, except with the prior
written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to any
demands for appraisal or settle or offer to settle any such demands for

2.8 _Payment of Merger Consideration_.

(a) _Payment Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall select a bank
or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as the payment
agent for the Merger (the " _Payment Agent_ ").

 

(b) _Exchange Fund_. Promptly following the Effective Time, Parent shall

the Payment Agent, for payment to the Company Stockholders pursuant to the
provisions of this _Article II_ (such cash amount being referred to herein as
the " _Exchange Fund_ ").

 

(c) _Payment Procedures_. Promptly following the Effective Time, Parent and
Merger Sub shall cause the Payment Agent to mail to each holder of record (as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time) of a certificate or certificates
(the " _Certificates_ ") or non-certificated Company Shares represented by
book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ "), which immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented outstanding Company Shares (other than Canceled
Company Shares and Dissenting Company Shares) (i) a letter of transmittal in
customary form (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk
of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates or transfer of the Book-Entry Shares to the Payment Agent) and
(ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or
transfer of Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration payable
in respect thereof pursuant to the provisions of this _Article II_. Upon (i)
surrender of Certificates for cancellation to the Payment Agent or to
such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with such
letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with
the instructions thereto, or (ii) receipt of an "agents message" by the
Paying Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of the transfer as the Paying
Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a transfer of Book-Entry Shares,
the holders of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration payable in respect
thereof pursuant to the provisions of this _Article II_, and the Certificates
so surrendered or Book-Entry Shares so transferred shall forthwith be
canceled. The Payment Agent shall accept such Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares

 



-17-   upon compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Payment
Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with
normal exchange practices. No interest shall be paid or accrued for the
benefit of holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on the Merger
Consideration payable upon the surrender of such Certificates or transfer of
Book-Entry Shares pursuant to this _Section 2.8_. Until so surrendered or
transferred, outstanding Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be deemed
from and after the Effective Time, to evidence only the right to receive the
Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to the provisions of
this  _Article II_.

(d) _Transfers of Ownership_. In the event that a transfer of ownership of
Company Shares is not registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the
Company, or if Merger Consideration is to be paid in a name other than that in
which the surrendered Certificate or transferred Book-Entry Shares are
registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the Company, the Merger
Consideration may be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the
surrendered Certificate or transferred Book-Entry Shares are registered in the
stock transfer books or ledger of the Company only if such Certificate is
properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for surrender and transfer or
such Book-Entry Shares are properly transferred and the Person requesting such
payment has paid to Parent (or any agent designated by Parent) any transfer
or other Taxes required by reason of the payment of Merger Consideration to a
Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry
Share, or established to the satisfaction of Parent (or any agent designated
by Parent) that such transfer or other Taxes have been paid or are otherwise
not payable.

(e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Payment Agent
shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the
Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to this _Article II_
; _provided, however_ , that Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition
precedent to the payment of such Merger Consideration, require the owners of
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in such sum as
it may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Payment Agent with respect to
the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

(f) _Required Withholding_. Each of the Payment Agent, Merger Sub, Parent and
the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as may be required to
be deducted or withheld therefrom under U.S. federal or state, local or
non-U.S. law. To the extent that such amounts are so deducted or withheld,
such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having
been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid.

 

(g) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, none of the Payment Agent, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
any other party hereto shall be liable to a holder of Company Shares for any
amount properly paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar law.

 

(h) _Distribution of Exchange Fund to Parent_. Any portion of the Exchange
Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares on the

 



-18-   date that is six (6) months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to
Parent (or its designee) upon demand, and any Company Stockholders who have
not theretofore surrendered their Certificates or transferred their Book-
Entry Shares evidencing such Company Shares for exchange pursuant to the
provisions of this _Section 2.8_ shall thereafter look for payment of the
Merger Consideration payable in respect of the Company Shares evidenced by
such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares solely to Parent, as general creditors
thereof, for any claim to the applicable Merger Consideration to which such
holders may be entitled pursuant to the provisions of this  _Article II_.

the Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out

action on behalf of the Company and Merger Sub to accomplish the foregoing.
From and after the Effective Time, the directors and officers of the

confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation any and all right,
title and interest in, to and under any of the rights, properties or assets of
the Company acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a

this _Article III_ to the extent that it is reasonably apparent from the text
of 

 



-19-   such disclosure that such disclosure is applicable to such other section or
subsection of this _Article III_ , the Company hereby represents and warrants
to Parent and Merger Sub as follows: 

3.1 _Organization and Good Standing_.

(a) The Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under Delaware Law. The Company has the requisite power and authority
to carry on its respective business as it is presently being conducted and to
own, lease or operate its respective properties and assets. The Company is
duly qualified to do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction
where the character of its properties owned or leased or the nature of its
activities make such qualification necessary (to the extent the "good
standing" concept is applicable in the case of any jurisdiction outside the
United States), except where the failure to be so qualified or in good
standing would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material
Adverse Effect.

(b) The Company has delivered or made available to Parent (i) true, correct
and complete copies of the certificate of incorporation and bylaws or other
constituent documents, as amended to date, of the Company, and (ii) true,
correct and complete copies in all material respects of the minutes (or, in
the case of draft minutes, the most recent drafts thereof) of all meetings,
and any action taken by written consent, of the Company Stockholders, the
Company Board and each committee of the Company Board, excluding any minutes
related to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, in each
case occurring at any time during the three years prior to the date of this
Agreement. The Company is not in violation of its certificate of incorporation
or bylaws in any material respect.

3.2 _Authorization and Enforceability_.

 

(a) The Company has all requisite power and authority to execute and deliver
this Agreement and subject, in the case of the consummation of the Merger, to
obtaining the Requisite Stockholder Approval, to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby and to perform its obligations hereunder.

(b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company and the
consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby (including
the Offer and the Merger) have been duly authorized by all necessary
corporate action on the part of the Company and no additional corporate
proceedings on the part of the Company are necessary to authorize this
Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
(including the Offer and the Merger), other than in the case of the
consummation of the Merger, obtaining the Requisite Stockholder Approval.
Assuming that the representations of Parent and Merger Sub set forth in
_Section 4.6_ are accurate, and if the holdings of Company Shares by Parent
and/or Merger Sub do not meet the threshold required by Section 253 of the
DGCL, the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding
Shares, voting together as a class (the " _Requisite Stockholder Approval_
"), is the only vote of the holders of any class or series of Company Capital
Stock necessary (under applicable Law or otherwise) to adopt this Agreement
and approve the Merger.

 



-20-  (c) At a meeting duly called and held prior to the execution of this
Agreement, the Company Board has, upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth herein, (i) unanimously determined that this Agreement is
advisable, (ii) unanimously determined that this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger, taken
together, are at a price and on terms that are fair to, and in the best
interests of the Company and the Company Stockholders, (iii) unanimously
approved this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including
the Offer and the Merger, and the Support Agreements, which approval, to the
extent applicable, constituted approval under the provisions of Section 203 of
the DGCL as a result of which this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby (including the Offer and the Merger) as well as the
Support Agreements and the transactions contemplated thereby, are not and will
not be subject to the provisions of, or any restrictions under, the provisions
of Section 203 of the DGCL, and (iv) unanimously resolved to recommend that
the Company Stockholders accept the Offer, tender their Company Shares to
Merger Sub pursuant to the Offer and, to the extent applicable, adopt this
Agreement in accordance with the applicable provisions of Delaware Law (the "
_Company Board Recommendation_ "). Prior to making the determinations and
effecting the approvals set forth in this _Section 3.2(c)_, the Company has
received the opinion of J.P. Morgan Securities LLC to the effect that, as of
the date of this Agreement, the consideration to be paid to the holders of the
Company Shares in the proposed Offer and Merger, together and not separately,
is fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders, and, as of the date
of this Agreement, such opinion has not been withdrawn, revoked or modified.

(d) Assuming that the representations of Parent and Merger Sub set forth in
_Section 4.6_ are accurate, the Company Board has taken all necessary actions
so that the restrictions on business combinations set forth in Section 203 of
the DGCL and any other similar applicable Law are not applicable to this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Offer and
the Merger) or the Support Agreements or the transactions contemplated
thereby. To the Companys Knowledge, no other state takeover statute or
similar statute or regulation applies to or purports to apply to the Offer,
the Merger, the Support Agreements or the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby.

 

(e) At a meeting duly called and held at which all members of the Compensation
Committee of the Company Board (the " _Compensation Committee_ ") were
present, the Compensation Committee (i) duly and unanimously adopted
resolutions approving as an "employment compensation, severance or other
employee benefit arrangement" within the meaning of Rule 14d-10(d)(1) under
the Exchange Act, (A) each Company Stock Plan, (B) the treatment of Company
Equity Awards in accordance with the terms set forth in this Agreement, the
applicable Company Stock Plan and any applicable Employee Plan, (C) the terms
of _Section 6.9_ and _Section 6.10_, and (D) each other Employee Plan that
under the terms of this Agreement is required to be set forth in _Sections
3.17(a)(i)_ and _3.17(a)(ii)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule which
resolutions have not been rescinded, modified or withdrawn in any way, and
(ii) has taken all other actions necessary to satisfy the requirements of the
non-exclusive safe harbor under Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act with
respect to the foregoing arrangements. Each member of the Compensation
Committee is an "independent director" within the meaning of the requirements
of Rule 14d-10(d) under the Exchange Act.

 



-21-  (f) This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company and,
assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by Parent and Merger
Sub, constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company,
enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, except that such
enforceability (i) may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws affecting or relating to
creditors rights generally and (ii) is subject to general principles of
equity.

 

3.3 _Required Governmental Consents_. No consent, approval, Order or
authorization of, or filing or registration with, or notification to (any of
the foregoing being a " _Consent_ "), any Governmental Authority is required
on the part of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the
execution, delivery and performance by the Company of this Agreement and the
consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby (including
the Offer and the Merger), except (a) the filing and recordation of the
Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware and such filings with Governmental Authorities to satisfy the Laws
of states in which the Company and its Subsidiaries are qualified to do
business, (b) such filings and approvals as may be required by any federal or
state securities laws, including compliance with any applicable requirements
of the Exchange Act, (c) compliance with any applicable requirements of the
HSR Act and (d) such other Consents, the failure of which to obtain would not,
individually or in the aggregate, (i) be or reasonably be expected to be,
material to the business, operations, properties, assets, liabilities,
condition (financial or otherwise) or results of operations of the Company and
its Subsidiaries, taken together as a whole, or (ii) would or would
reasonably be expected to materially impede the ability of the Company to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the
Offer and the Merger) in accordance with the terms hereof and applicable Law.

3.4 _Conflicts_. The execution, delivery or performance by the Company of this
Agreement, the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated
hereby (including the Offer and the Merger) and the compliance by the Company
with any of the provisions hereof do not and will not (a) violate or conflict
with any provision of the certificates of incorporation or bylaws or other
constituent documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (b) subject
to obtaining such Consents set forth in Section 3.4(b) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, violate, conflict with, or result in the breach of or
constitute a default (or an event which with notice or lapse of time or both
would become a default) under, or result in the termination of, or accelerate
the performance required by, or result in a right of termination or
acceleration under, any Material Contract, (c) assuming compliance with the
matters referred to in _Section 3.3_ and, in the case of the consummation of
the Merger, subject to obtaining the Requisite Stockholder Approval, violate
or conflict with any applicable Law or Order applicable to the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries or by which any of their properties or assets are bound or

of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, except in the case of each of
clauses (b), (c) and (d) above, for such violations, conflicts, defaults,
terminations, accelerations or Liens which would not, individually or in
the aggregate, (i) be or reasonably be expected to be, material to business,
operations, properties, assets, liabilities, condition (financial or
otherwise) or results of operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken
together as a whole, or (ii) reasonably be expected to materially impede the
ability of the Company to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including the Offer and the Merger) in accordance with the terms
hereof and applicable Law.

(a) The Company and its Subsidiaries shall immediately cease any and all
existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any Persons conducted

promptly (and in any event within three (3) Business Days following the date
hereof) request in writing each Person which has heretofore executed a
confidentiality agreement in connection with its consideration of acquiring
the Company or any portion thereof to return or destroy all confidential
information heretofore furnished to such Person by or on behalf of the
Company, and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to have such
information returned or destroyed (to the extent destruction of such
information is permitted by such confidentiality agreement).

(b) At all times during the period commencing with the execution and
delivery of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier to occur of the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article VII_ and the Effective
Time, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not, and shall use their
reasonable best efforts to cause any of their respective directors, officers
or other employees, controlled affiliates, or any investment banker, attorney
or other advisors or representatives retained by any of them (collectively,
the " _Company Representatives"_ ) not to (and shall not authorize any of
them to), directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage,
assist, facilitate or knowingly induce the making, submission or announcement
of, an Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Transaction, (ii) except as
expressly provided in _Section 6.1(c)_, participate or engage in discussions
or negotiations with any Person (other than Parent or Merger Sub or any
designees of Parent or Merger Sub) regarding an Acquisition Proposal or
Acquisition Transaction, or furnish any non-public information relating to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or afford access to the business,
properties, assets, books or records of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to, or take any other action intended to knowingly encourage,
assist or facilitate, any Person (other than Parent or Merger Sub or any
designees of Parent or Merger Sub) that is seeking to make or has made an

"standstill" or other similar agreement between the Company or any of its

to the Companys obligations set forth therein, prior to the Appointment
Time, the Company Board may, directly or indirectly through advisors, agents
or other intermediaries, subject to the

 



-52-   Companys material compliance with the provisions of this _Section 6.1_,
(A) engage or participate in discussions or negotiations with any Person that
has made (and not withdrawn) a _bona fide,_ written Acquisition Proposal that
the Company Board concludes in good faith (after consultation with a financial
advisor of nationally recognized standing and its outside legal counsel)
constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal and (B)
furnish to any Person that has made (and not withdrawn) a _bona fide,_ written
Acquisition Proposal any non-public information relating to the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries pursuant to a confidentiality agreement the terms of
which are no less favorable to the Company with respect to confidentiality
than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement (which confidentiality
agreement shall not include any provisions that would prevent or restrict the
Company or the Company Representatives from providing any information to
Parent to which Parent would be entitled under any provision of this
Agreement); _provided, however_ , that in the case of any action taken
pursuant to the foregoing clauses (A) or (B), (1) none of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries shall have breached or violated in any material respect
the terms of this _Section 6.1_ or _Section 6.2_, (2) the Company Board has
determined in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel) that
the failure to take such action is reasonably likely to be a breach of its
fiduciary duties to the Company Stockholders under Delaware Law, (3) prior

gives Parent written notice containing the information set forth in _Section
6.1(d),_ and of the Companys intention to take such actions and (4)
contemporaneously with furnishing any non-public information to such Person,
the Company furnishes such non-public information to Parent (to the extent
such information has not been previously furnished by the Company to Parent).
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company acknowledge and hereby agree that any violation of the restrictions
set forth in this _Section 6.1_ by any Company Representative shall
constitute a breach of this _Section 6.1_ by the Company.

(d) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in  _Section
6.1(b)_, the Company shall reasonably promptly _,_ and in all cases within
twenty four (24) hours of its receipt, advise Parent in writing of (i) any
_bona fide_ Acquisition Proposal, (ii) any request for information that would
reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition
Transaction or (iii) any inquiry that would reasonably be expected to lead to
any Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Transaction, in each case, including
the material terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition
Transaction, request or inquiry (unless such Acquisition Proposal is in
written form, in which case the Company shall give Parent a copy thereof), and
the identity of the Person or group making any such Acquisition Proposal,
request or inquiry. The Company shall keep Parent promptly and reasonably
informed of the status, (including all material amendments or proposed
amendments) of any such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry. In addition
to the foregoing, the Company shall provide Parent with at least twenty-four
(24) hours (or such lesser notice as the Company Board or committee receives)
prior written notice of a meeting of the Company Board at which the Company
Board is reasonably expected to consider an Acquisition Proposal or
Acquisition Transaction, an inquiry relating to a potential Acquisition
Proposal or Acquisition Transaction, or a request to provide nonpublic
information to any Person in relation to an Acquisition Proposal or
Acquisition Transaction.

(a) Subject to the terms of this _Section 6.2_, the Company Board shall (i)
make the Company Board Recommendation and (ii) include the Company Board
Recommendation (with respect to the Offer) in the Schedule 14D-9 and permit
Parent to include the Company Board Recommendation in the Offer Documents.

 

(b) Subject to the terms of this _Section 6.2_, neither the Company Board nor
any committee thereof shall (i) fail to make, withhold, withdraw, amend,
qualify or modify, or publicly propose to refuse to make, withhold, withdraw,
amend, qualify or modify, the Company Board Recommendation, (ii) approve,
endorse or recommend an Acquisition Proposal, or fail to publicly recommend
against any such Acquisition Proposal that is a tender offer or exchange offer
for Company Shares within ten (10) Business Days after commencement of such
offer (and at all times thereafter during which any such tender offer or
exchange offer is pending) and reaffirm the Company Board Recommendation
within such ten (10) Business Day-period (and at all times thereafter during
which any such tender offer or exchange offer is pending), (ii) fail to
include the Company Board Recommendation in the Schedule 14D-9 or the Proxy
Statement, as applicable, (iii) resolve, agree or publicly propose to take any
of the foregoing actions (any action described in the preceding clauses (i),
(ii) and (iii) being referred to herein as a " _Company Board Recommendation
Change_ "); _provided, however_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing, a "stop,
look and listen" communication by the Company Board pursuant to and
in compliance with Rule 14d9-(f) of the Exchange Act shall not be deemed to
be a Company Board Recommendation Change provided that it also includes an
express reaffirmation of the Company Board Recommendation.

 

(c) Notwithstanding the limitations set forth in this _Section 6.2_, the
Company Board may effect a Company Board Recommendation Change with respect
to the Acquisition Proposal described in the following clause (i) at any time
prior to the Acceptance Time, if (i) the Company Board has received a _bona
fide,_ written Acquisition Proposal that constitutes a Superior Proposal,
(ii) neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has breached or violated
in any material respect the provisions of _Section 6.1_ or this _Section
6.2_ with respect to such Acquisition Proposal or any Person making such
Acquisition Proposal (whether or not related to such Acquisition Proposal),
(iii) the Company Board has determined in good faith (after consultation with
outside legal counsel and after considering any counter-offer or proposal
made by Parent pursuant to clause (v) below), that, in light of the foregoing
Superior Proposal, the failure by the Company Board to make a Company Board
Recommendation Change is reasonably likely to be a breach of its fiduciary
duties to the Company Stockholders under Delaware Law, (iv) prior to effecting
such Company Board Recommendation Change, the Company Board shall have given
Parent at least five (5) Business Days prior written notice thereof, which
notice shall attach such Superior Proposal and set forth the identity of the
Person making such Superior Proposal and all the material terms and conditions
of such Superior Proposal in reasonable detail and the opportunity to meet
with the Company Board and its outside legal counsel to discuss a
modification of the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that the
transactions contemplated hereby may be effected and (v) Parent shall not have
made, within five (5) Business Days after receipt of the Companys written
notice of its intention to effect a Company Board Recommendation Change, a
counter-offer or proposal that the Company Board shall have determined in good
faith (after consultation with a financial advisor

 



-54-   of nationally recognized standing and its outside legal counsel) is at least
as favorable to Company Stockholders as such Superior Proposal (it being
understood and hereby agreed that every subsequent material revision or
material modification to any such Superior Proposal shall require a new
written notice thereof by the Company to Parent pursuant to the preceding
clause (iv) and a new two (2) Business Day "matching" period under the
preceding clauses (iv) and (v) following the initial five (5)-Business Day
"matching" period). The Company shall keep confidential any such counter-
offers or proposals made by Parent to revise the terms of this Agreement,
other than in the event of any amendment to this Agreement and to the extent
required to be disclosed in any SEC Reports or applicable Law or stock
exchange listing requirement.

 

(d) Notwithstanding the limitations set forth in _Section 6.2(b)_ or
elsewhere in this Agreement, the Company Board may effect a Company Board
Recommendation Change at any time prior to the Appointment Time in response to
an Intervening Event if (i) the Company Board shall have determined in good
faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel) that, in light of such
Intervening Event, the failure by the Company Board to effect a Company Board
Recommendation Change is reasonably likely to be a breach of its fiduciary
duties to the Company Stockholders under Delaware Law, (ii) prior to effecting
such Company Board Recommendation Change, the Company Board shall have given
Parent at least three (3) Business Days prior written notice thereof, which
notice shall specify in reasonable detail the facts underlying the Company
Boards determination that an Intervening Event has occurred and the
rationale and basis for such Change in Recommendation (it being understood and
agreed that any material change to the facts and circumstances relating to
such Intervening Event shall require a new written notice by the Company to
Parent in compliance with this clause (ii) and a new three (3) Business Day
period under clause (iii) below) and the opportunity to meet with the
Companys outside legal counsel, all with the purpose and intent of enabling
Parent and the Company to discuss in good faith a modification of the terms
and conditions of this Agreement so as to obviate the need to effect a Company
Board Recommendation Change on the basis of such Intervening Event so that
the transactions contemplated hereby may be effected, and (iii) following the
expiration of such three (3)-Business Day period, the Company Board shall have
determined in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel) and
after giving consideration to any offer or proposal from Parent, that, in
light of such Intervening Event, the failure by the Company Board to effect a
Company Board Recommendation Change is reasonably likely to be a breach of
its fiduciary duties to the Company Stockholders under Delaware Law.

(e) Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company Board from taking
and disclosing to the Company Stockholders a position contemplated by Rule
14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act or complying with the provisions of Rule 14d-9
promulgated under the Exchange Act, provided that, in each case, any
statement(s) made by the Company Board pursuant to Rule 14e-2(a) under the
Exchange Act or Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act shall be subject to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement.

 

6.3 _Reasonable Best Efforts to Complete_. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
all actions, and to do, or cause to be done (and to assist and cooperate with
the other party hereto in doing), all things reasonably necessary, 

 



-55-   proper or advisable to consummate and make effective the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including the Offer and the Merger) as
expeditiously as reasonably practicable in accordance with the terms hereof,
including taking the actions set forth in _Section 6.3_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule and using reasonable best efforts to (a) cause the
conditions to the Offer set forth on _Section 1.1(b)_ and the conditions to
the Merger set forth in _Section 2.3(b)_ to be satisfied or fulfilled as soon
as reasonably practicable, (b) obtain all necessary consents, waivers and
approvals under any Material Contracts so as to maintain and preserve the
benefits under such Material Contracts following the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby (including the Offer and the Merger), (c)
obtain all necessary actions or non-actions, waivers, consents, approvals,
Orders and authorizations from Governmental Authorities, the expiration or
termination of any applicable waiting periods, making all necessary
registrations, declarations and filings (including registrations, declarations
and filings with Governmental Authorities, if any), and (d) execute or
deliver any additional instruments reasonably necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated by, and to fully carry out the purposes of, this
Agreement.

 

6.4 _Regulatory Approvals_.

(a) Without limiting the generality of _Section 6.3_, as soon as reasonably
practicable (and in any event within ten(10) Business Days) following the date
hereof, each of Parent and the Company shall file with the FTC and the
Antitrust Division of the DOJ a Notification and Report Form relating to this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Offer and
the Merger) as required by the HSR Act, as well as comparable pre-merger
notification filings, forms and submissions with any foreign Governmental
Authority that is required by other applicable Antitrust Laws, in each case as
Parent may reasonably determine. Each of Parent and the Company shall use
reasonable best efforts to promptly (i) cooperate and coordinate with the
other in the making of such filings, (ii) supply the other with any
information or documents that may be required in order to effectuate such
filings, and (iii) comply with any request for additional information made by
the FTC, the DOJ or the competition or merger control authorities of any other
jurisdiction. Each party hereto shall promptly inform the other party or
parties hereto, as the case may be, of any communication from any
Governmental Authority regarding any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including the Offer and the Merger). If any party hereto or
Affiliate thereof receives a request for additional information
or documentary material from any such Governmental Authority with respect to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Offer and the
Merger), then such party shall use reasonable best efforts to make, or cause
to be made, as soon as reasonably practicable and after consultation with the
other party, an appropriate response in compliance with such request. Neither
Parent nor the Company shall commit or agree (or permit their respective
Subsidiaries or Affiliates to commit or agree) with any Governmental
Authority to stay, toll or extend any applicable waiting period under the HSR
Act or other applicable Antitrust Laws, without the prior written consent of
the other (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, none
of Parent, Merger Sub or any of their Subsidiaries shall be required to, and
the Company may not, without the prior written consent of Parent, become
subject to, consent to, or offer or agree to, or otherwise take any action
with respect to, any requirement, condition, limitation, understanding,
agreement or order to (i) sell, license, assign, transfer, divest, hold
separate or

 



-56-   otherwise dispose of any assets, business or portion of business of the
Company, the Surviving Corporation, Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
respective Subsidiaries, (ii) conduct, restrict, operate, invest or otherwise
change the assets, business or portion of business of the Company, the
Surviving Corporation, Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective
Subsidiaries in any manner, or (iii) impose any restriction, requirement or
limitation on the operation of the business or portion of the business of the
Company, the Surviving Corporation, Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
respective Subsidiaries; provided that, if requested by Parent, the Company
will become subject to, consent to, or offer or agree to, or otherwise take
any action with respect to, any such requirement, condition, limitation,
understanding, agreement or order so long as such requirement, condition,
limitation, understanding, agreement or order is only binding on the Company
in the event the Closing occurs.

6.5 _Anti-Takeover Statutes_. Without limiting the generality of the
provisions of _Section 6.4_, in the event that any state anti-takeover or
other similar statute or regulation is or becomes applicable to this Agreement
or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the
Offer and the Merger), the Company, at the direction of the Company Board,
shall use reasonable best efforts to ensure that the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement (including the Offer and the Merger) may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Agreement, and otherwise to minimize the effect of such statute or
regulation on this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby
(including the Offer and the Merger).

6.6 _Access to Books, Records, Properties and Personnel_. At all times during
the period commencing with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and
continuing until the earlier to occur of the termination of this Agreement
pursuant to _Article VII_ and the Acceptance Time, the Company shall afford
Parent and its accountants, legal counsel and other representatives
reasonable access during normal business hours, upon reasonable notice, to the
properties, books and records and personnel of the Company to enable Parent to
obtain all information concerning the Leased Real Property, the Assets and
the businesses of the Company and its Subsidiaries, including the status of
product development efforts, properties, results of operations and personnel
of the Company, as Parent may reasonably request;  _provided, however_ , that
no information or knowledge obtained by Parent in any investigation conducted
pursuant to this _Section 6.6_ shall affect or be deemed to modify or waive
(i) any right or Claim of the Parent or the Surviving Corporation with
respect to any representation or warranty of the Company or a Subsidiary set
forth herein, or (ii) any condition to the obligations of Parent and Merger
Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer
and the Merger, or the remedies available to the parties hereunder; and
_provided further_ , that the terms and conditions of the Confidentiality
Agreement shall apply to any information provided to Parent pursuant to this 
_Section 6.6_. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be
required to provide access to or to disclose information where such access or
disclosure would contravene any law, rule, regulation, Order, judgment,
decree, or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement
or would reasonably be expected to violate or result in a loss or impairment
of any attorney-client or work product privilege. The parties will use
commercially reasonable efforts to make appropriate substitute disclosure
arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding
sentence apply.

6.7 _Notification Obligations_.

 



-57-  (a) At all times during the period commencing with the execution and delivery
of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier to occur of the

Time, the Company shall give reasonably prompt notice to Parent (i) upon

any of its Subsidiaries, that are related to the transactions contemplated by

or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty of the Company set
forth herein or the conditions to the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the
Merger, or the remedies available to the parties hereunder; and _provided
further_ , that the terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement

6.7(a)_.

 

(b) At all times during the period commencing with the execution and delivery
of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier to occur of the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article VII_ and the Effective
Time, the Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of (i) any notice or

to the date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time, alleging any
material breach of or material default under any Material Contract to which
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, or (ii) any notice or other
written communication received by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries from
any third party, subsequent to the date of this Agreement and prior to the
Effective Time, alleging that the consent of such third party is or may be
required in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(including the Offer and the Merger); _provided, however_ , that no such
notification shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or
warranty of the Company set forth herein or the conditions to the obligations
of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Offer and the Merger, or the remedies available to the parties
hereunder; and _provided further_ , that the terms and conditions of the
Confidentiality Agreement shall apply to any information provided to Parent
pursuant to this _Section 6.7(b)_.

(c) At all times during the period commencing with the execution and delivery
of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier to occur of the termination
of this Agreement pursuant to  _Article VII_ and the Effective Time, Parent
shall give reasonably prompt notice to the Company (i) upon becoming aware (A)
that any representation or warranty made by it or Merger Sub in this Agreement
has become untrue or inaccurate in any material respect, or (B) of any
failure of Parent or Merger Sub to comply with or satisfy in any material
respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied
by it under this Agreement, in the case of clauses (A) and (B) if as a result
of such breach the closing conditions to the Offer and the Merger would not be
satisfied, (ii) upon receiving any written notice or other written
communication from any Governmental Authority in connection with the
transactions

 



-58-   contemplated by this Agreement, or (iii) upon receiving any written notice
or other written communication that any Legal Proceedings have commenced that

however_ , that no such notification shall affect or be deemed to modify any
representation or warranty of Parent or Merger Sub set forth herein or the
conditions to the obligations of the Company to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger, or the remedies
available to the parties hereunder and _provided further_ , that the terms and
conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement shall apply to any information
provided to the Company pursuant to this _Section 6.7(c)_.

6.8 _Transaction-Related Litigation_. 

(a) The Company shall promptly advise Parent in writing of any litigation
commenced after the date hereof against the Company or any of its directors
by any Company Stockholders (on their own behalf or on behalf of the Company)
relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (including
the Offer and the Merger) and shall keep Parent reasonably and regularly
informed regarding any such litigation.

(b) The Company shall give Parent the opportunity to consult with the Company
regarding the defense or settlement of any litigation filed against the
Company or any of its directors or officers in connection with any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Offer and the
Merger), shall reasonably consider Parents views with respect to such
litigation and shall not settle any such litigation without the prior written
consent of Parent.

6.9 _Company Employee Matters_.

(a) _Treatment of Employee Equity Awards_.

(i) _Company Options_.

 

(A) Effective as of the Effective Time, each Company Option or portion thereof
that is vested (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any such Company
Option or portion thereof that vests on account of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement), outstanding and unexercised as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time and that is either (x) granted under the
Companys 2008 Equity Incentive Plan, or (y) is 2004 Plan Option that is a
Non-Continuing Option, shall, by virtue of the Merger, be immediately
cancelled and the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive, in
consideration of such cancellation, an amount in cash, without interest,
equal to the excess of the Merger Consideration (subject to any adjustment in
accordance with _Section 2.7(b)(i)_ of this Agreement) for each Company Share
subject to such Company Option over the per share exercise price of such
Company Option. Promptly following the Effective Time, Parent shall pay (or
cause to be paid) the cash amounts payable pursuant to this _Section
6.9(a)(i)(A)_ in respect of such Company Options, subject to _Section
2.8(f)_.

 



-59-  (B) Effective as of the Effective Time, each Company Option or
portion thereof, other than a Non-Continuing Option, that is outstanding and
unexercised as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and that is either
(x) not vested as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, or (y) a 2004
Plan Option, shall be assumed by Parent as a Parent Option. Except as
otherwise set forth in this Agreement, each such Company Option so assumed by
Parent pursuant to this _Section 6.9(a)(i)(B)_ shall continue to have, and be
subject to, the same terms and conditions (including vesting terms) set forth
in the applicable Company Stock Plan and any other plan or arrangement of the
Company relating to such Company Option, as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, except that (x) such assumed Company Option shall be
exercisable for that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock equal to
the product of the number of Company Shares that were issuable upon exercise
of such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by
the Exchange Ratio, with the result rounded down to the nearest whole number
of shares of Parent Common Stock and (y) the per share exercise price for the
shares of Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such assumed Company
Option shall be equal to the quotient obtained by dividing the exercise price
per Company Share at which such assumed Company Option was exercisable
immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Exchange Ratio, with the result
rounded up to the nearest whole cent. The exercise price of the option, the
number of shares purchasable pursuant to such option and the terms and
conditions of exercise of such option described in this _Section
6.9(a)(i)(B)_ are intended to comply with Section 409A of the Code, and in
the case of any Company Option to which Section 421 of the Code applies by
reason of its qualification under Section 422 of the Code, Section 424 of the
Code. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall provide each holder of a
2004 Plan Option, other than a Non-Continuing Option, that will be outstanding
as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, the election to choose, in lieu
of the assumption of such Company Option as provided for in this _Section
6.9(a)(i)(B)_, the automatic "cashless exercise" of such vested and
outstanding 2004 Plan Option to be effected as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time, contingent upon the consummation of the Merger with, for the
purposes of such cashless exercise, the fair market value per Company Share at
the time of such exercise deemed to be the Merger Consideration, with the
Company Shares issued in connection with such cashless exercise treated
as specified in _Section 2.7(b)(i)_.

(C) Effective as of the Effective Time, each Non-Continuing Option (or
portion thereof) that is outstanding, unvested and unexercised as of the
Effective Time and the vesting of which Non-Continuing Option has not
accelerated pursuant to the first sentence of _Section 6.9(a)(i)(A)_ shall
be cancelled without the payment of any consideration therefor.

 



-60-  (ii) _Company RSUs_. Effective as of the Effective Time, each Company RSU
that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (after
giving effect to any vesting that occurs on account of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement) shall be assumed by Parent as a Parent RSU.
Each Company RSU so assumed by Parent pursuant to this _Section 6.9(a)(ii)_
shall continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions
(including vesting terms) set forth in the applicable Company Stock Plan and
the Company RSU agreements relating thereto, as in effect immediately prior
to the Effective Time, except that such assumed Company RSU shall cover that
number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product of the
number of Company Shares underlying such Company RSU immediately prior to the
Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, with the result rounded down
to the nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock.

 

(iii) _Employee Stock Purchase Plan_. Promptly following the date hereof, the
Company shall take all action necessary to terminate the Company ESPP prior
to the commencement of the any offering period thereunder.

(iv)  _Implementation_. The Company shall take all actions reasonably
necessary to effect the transactions contemplated by this _Section 6.9(a)_
under the Company Stock Plans, all Company Option agreements, all Company RSU
agreements, the Company ESPP and any other plan or arrangement of the
Company, including delivering all required notices and making any
determinations and/or resolutions of the Company Board or a committee thereof.
Parent shall take all actions reasonably necessary or appropriate to have
available for issuance or transfer a sufficient number of shares of Parent
Common Stock for delivery upon exercise of the assumed Company Options and
assumed Company RSUs.

 

(v) _Form S-8_. Promptly after the Effective Time (but in no event later than
three (3) Business Days following the Effective Time), Parent shall prepare
and file with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-8 (if available for
use by Parent) registering the number of shares of Parent Common Stock
issuable upon the exercise of all assumed Company Options and settlement of
assumed Company RSUs, in each case that are eligible to be registered on Form
S-8; provided, however, that (A) in the event that the filing deadline
contemplated by this _Section 6.9(a)(v)_ shall occur during a trading
"blackout" period under Parents securities trading policies, then Parent
shall not be required to file the registration statement contemplated by this
_Section 6.9(a)(v)_ until such "blackout" period is no longer applicable,
and (B) Parent shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations hereunder
if Parent shall fail to fulfill its obligations under this _Section
6.9(a)(v)_ at a time when trading of Parent Common Stock has been suspended
globally under Parents then effective registration statements (it being
understood and agreed that if Parent is unable to file such registration
statement on Form S-8 due to a global trading suspension under Parents
then effective registration statements, then Parent shall file such
registration statement as soon as practicable after trading has been
restored).

 



-61-  (b) For a period of one (1) year following the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to) either (i) maintain for the benefit of each Continuing Employee the
Employee Plans and any other employee benefit plans or other compensation and
severance arrangements of the Surviving Corporation or any of its
Subsidiaries (together, the " _Company Plans_ " but excluding equity based
benefits and individual employment agreements) at benefit levels that are no
less than those in effect at the Company or its Subsidiaries on the date of
this Agreement, and provide compensation and benefits to each Continuing
Employee under such Company Plans, or (ii) provide compensation, benefits and
severance payments (other than equity based benefits and individual
employment agreements) to each Continuing Employee that, taken as a whole, are
no less favorable in the aggregate than the compensation, benefits and
severance payments (other than equity based benefits and individual
employment agreements) provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior
to the Effective Time (" _Comparable Plans_ "), or (iii) provide some
combination of (i) and (ii) above such that each Continuing Employee
receives compensation, benefits and severance payments (other than equity
based benefits and individual employment agreements) that, taken as a whole,
are no less favorable in the aggregate than the compensation, benefits and
severance payments (other than equity based benefits and individual
employment agreements) provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior
to the Effective Time. In each case, base compensation shall not be decreased
for a period of one year following the Effective Time for any Continuing
Employee employed during that one-year period.

(c) To the extent that a Company Plan or Comparable Plan is made available to
any Continuing Employee on or following the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) cause
to be granted to such Continuing Employee credit for all service with
the Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time for purposes of
eligibility to participate, vesting and entitlement to benefits where length
of service is relevant (including for purposes of vacation accrual and
severance pay entitlement);  _provided, however_ , that such service need not
be credited to the extent that it would result in duplication of coverage or
benefits with respect to the same period of service. In addition, and without
limiting the generality of the foregoing: (i) each Continuing Employee shall
be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and
all employee benefit plans sponsored by the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries (other than the Company Plans) (such plans, collectively, the "
_New Plans_ ") to the extent coverage under any such New Plan replaces
coverage under a comparable Company Plan in which such Continuing Employee
participates immediately before the Effective Time (such plans, collectively,
the " _Old Plans_ "); and (ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing
medical, dental, pharmaceutical, vision and/or disability benefits to any
Continuing Employee, the Surviving Corporation shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to (x) cause all waiting periods, pre-existing condition
exclusions, evidence of insurability requirements and actively-at-work or
similar requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such Continuing
Employee and his or her covered dependents, and the Surviving Corporation
shall cause any eligible expenses incurred by such Continuing Employee and his
or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan
ending on the date such employees participation in the corresponding New
Plan begins to be given full credit under such New Plan for purposes of
satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements
applicable to such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents for
the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with
such New Plan; and (y) credit the accounts of such Continuing Employees under
any New 

 



-62-   Plan which is a flexible spending plan with any unused balance in the
account of such Continuing Employee under the applicable Company Plan. Any
vacation or paid time off accrued but unused by a Continuing Employee as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be credited to such Continuing
Employee following the Effective Time, and shall not be subject to accrual
limits or other forfeiture and shall not limit future accruals. 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, no
provision of this Agreement shall be deemed to (i) guarantee employment for
any period of time for, or preclude the ability of Parent or the Surviving
Corporation to terminate, any Continuing Employee for any reason, or (ii)
subject to the limitations and requirements specifically set forth in this
_Section 6.9_, require Parent or the Surviving Corporation to continue any
Company Plan or prevent the amendment, modification or termination thereof
after the Effective Time. No provision of this Agreement is intended,
or shall be interpreted, to provide nor create any third party beneficiary
rights or any other rights of any kind or nature whatsoever in any
stockholder, Employee or any other Person, including any employee benefits, in
favor of any Person, union, association, Continuing Employee, Employee or any
other Person, other than the parties hereto and their respective successors
and permitted assigns, and all provisions hereof will be personal solely among
the parties to this Agreement. In addition, no provision of this Agreement is
intended, or shall be interpreted, to amend any term or condition of the Plan
or any other employee related plan, program or policy of Parent, the Company,
or any of their Subsidiaries.

 

(e) Unless Parent provides written notice to the Company that such 401(k)
plan(s) shall not be terminated, the Company shall terminate any and all
401(k) plans maintained by the Company or any ERISA Affiliates, in each case
effective as of the day immediately preceding the date the Company becomes a
member of the same Controlled Group of Corporations (as defined in Section
414(b) of the Code) as Parent (the " _401(k) Termination Date_ "). The Company
shall provide Parent evidence that the 401(k) plan(s) of the Company and its
Subsidiaries have been terminated pursuant to resolutions of the Company
Board or the board of directors of its Subsidiaries, as applicable. The
Company shall also take such other actions in furtherance of terminating any
such 401(k) Plans as Parent may reasonably request. If the Company 401(k) Plan
is terminated pursuant hereto as of the 401(k) Termination Date, Parent shall
permit Continuing Employees to roll over their account balances (including
loan notes) to a 401(k) Plan of Parent or an Affiliate.

 

(f) Unless Parent provides written notice otherwise, the Company shall, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, terminate any and all group severance,
separation, deferred compensation or salary continuation plans, programs or
arrangements maintained by the Company or any of its ERISA Affiliates, in each
case effective in each case as of the day immediately preceding the
Effective Time. The Company shall provide Parent evidence that such plans
have been terminated pursuant to resolutions of the Company Board or the board
of directors of its Subsidiaries, as applicable (the form and substance of
which resolutions shall be subject to reasonable review and approval of
Parent).

(g) Unless the Company Board shall have effected a Company
Board Recommendation Change in accordance with _Section 6.2_, the Company
shall consult in good faith with Parent, and give reasonable and good faith
consideration to any comments made by Parent in respect thereof, prior to
sending any written communications (including electronic

 



-63-   communications) to any employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
regarding this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby
(including the Offer or the Merger). In addition, except in the ordinary
course of business, the Company shall not make any material representations or
material commitments to any employees of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries that would bind Parent or the Company following the Closing,
solely in their capacity as employees, without the prior written consent of
Parent.

6.10 _Company Director and Officer Indemnification and Insurance_.

(a) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to honor
and fulfill in all respects the obligations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries under their respective certificates of incorporation and bylaws
(and other similar organizational documents) and all indemnification
agreements in effect as of the date of this Agreement between the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries and any of their respective current or former
directors, officers, employees, fiduciaries or agents (the " _Company
Indemnified Parties_ ") for a period of six (6) years after the Effective
Time. During such period, Parent shall not, nor shall it permit the Surviving
Corporation to, amend, repeal or otherwise modify such provisions for
indemnification in any manner that would affect the rights thereunder of
any individual who at any time on or prior to the Effective Time was a
director, officer, employee, fiduciary or agent of Company or its Subsidiaries
in respect of actions or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time
(including the transactions contemplated by this Agreement), unless such
modification is required by Law; _provided, however_ , that in the event any
claim or claims are asserted or made either prior to the Effective Time or
within such six-year period, all rights to indemnification in respect of any
such claim or claims shall continue until disposition of any and all such
claims. Any indemnification agreements with Indemnified Parties in existence
on the date of this Agreement shall be assumed by the Surviving Corporation
in the Merger, without any further action, and shall survive the Merger and
continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms.

(b) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall maintain in effect the Companys current
directors and officers liability insurance (" _D andO Insurance_") in respect
of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Appointment Time, covering
each person covered by the DandO Insurance as of the date of this Agreement, on
terms with respect to the coverage and amounts no less favorable, in the
aggregate, than those of the DandO Insurance in effect on the date of this
Agreement; _provided, however_ , that the Surviving Corporation may, at its
option, substitute therefor policies of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
any of their respective Subsidiaries containing terms with respect to coverage
and amounts no less favorable, in the aggregate, to such persons than the DandO
Insurance, _provided further, however_ , that in satisfying its obligations
under this _Section 6.10(b)_ Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not
be obligated to pay annual premiums in excess of two hundred fifty percent
(250%) of the amount paid by the Company for coverage for its last full
fiscal year (such two hundred fifty percent (250%) amount, the " _Maximum
Annual Premium_ ") (which premiums the Company represents and warrants to be
as set forth in _Section 6.10(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule),
provided that that if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed
such amount, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain
a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding the
Maximum Annual Premium. Prior to the Appointment Time, notwithstanding
anything to the

 



-64-   contrary set forth in this Agreement, the Company may purchase a six-year
"tail" prepaid policy (the " _Tail Policy_ ") on the DandO Insurance on terms
and conditions no less favorable, in the aggregate, than the DandO Insurance
and for an amount not to exceed two hundred fifty percent (250%) of the amount
paid by the Company for coverage for its last full fiscal year. In the event
that the Company does not purchase the Tail Policy, Parent may purchase a
Tail Policy on the DandO Insurance on terms and conditions no less favorable, in
the aggregate, than the DandO Insurance. In the event that the Company purchases
such a Tail Policy prior to the Appointment Time, Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall maintain such Tail Policy in full force and effect and
continue to honor their respective obligations thereunder, in lieu of all
other obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under the first
sentence of this _Section 6.10(b)_ for so long as such Tail Policy shall be
maintained in full force and effect.

(c) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns
shall (i) consolidate with or merge into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be
made so that the successors and assigns of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall assume all of the obligations of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation set forth in this _Section 6.10_.

(d) The obligations under this _Section 6.10_ shall not be terminated,
amended or otherwise modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any
Company Indemnified Party (or any other person who is a beneficiary under the
DandO Insurance or the Tail Policy referred to in _Section 6.10(b)_ (and their
heirs and representatives)) without the prior written consent of such affected
Company Indemnified Party or other person who is a beneficiary under the DandO
Insurance or the Tail Policy referred to in _Section 6.10(b)_ (and their
heirs and representatives). Each of the Company Indemnified Parties or other
persons who are beneficiaries under the DandO Insurance or the Tail Policy
referred to in _Section 6.10(b)_ (and their heirs and representatives) are
intended to be third party beneficiaries of this _Section 6.10_, with full
rights of enforcement as if a party thereto. The rights of the Company
Indemnified Parties (and other persons who are beneficiaries under the DandO
Insurance or the Tail Policy referred to in _Section 6.10(b)_ (and their

to, and not in substitution for, any other rights that such persons may have
under the certificate or articles of incorporation, bylaws or other equivalent
organizational documents, any and all indemnification agreements of or entered
into by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or applicable Law (whether at
law or in equity).

6.11 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
take all such steps as may be required to cause to be exempt under Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act any dispositions of shares of Company
Shares (including derivative securities with respect to such shares) that are
treated as dispositions under such rule and result from the Offer, the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated hereby by each director or officer of
the Company who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of
the Exchange Act with respect to the Company.

6.12 _Compensation Committee Approval of New Compensation Arrangements_.
Prior to the Effective Time, the Company (acting through its Compensation
Committee) will take all

 



-65-   steps that may be necessary or advisable to cause each compensation
arrangement entered into by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries on or after
the date of this Agreement to be approved by the Compensation Committee
(comprised solely of "independent directors" determined within the meaning of
Rule 14d-10(d) under the Exchange Act) as an "employment compensation,
severance or other employee benefit arrangement" within the meaning of Rule
14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act and to satisfy the requirements of the
non-exclusive safe harbor set forth in Rule 14d-10(d) of the Exchange Act.

6.13 _Obligations of Merger Sub_. Parent shall take all action necessary to
cause Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation to perform their respective
obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the Offer and the Merger, upon the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement.

6.14 _Top-Up Option_.

(a) The Company hereby grants to Merger Sub an irrevocable option (the "
_Top-Up Option_ "), exercisable only upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth herein, to purchase at a price per share equal to the
Offer Price that number of Company Shares (the " _Top-Up Option Shares_ ")
equal to the lowest number of Company Shares that, when added to the number of
Company Shares owned by Parent and its Subsidiaries at the time of such
exercise, shall constitute one share more than 90% of the Company Shares then
outstanding (the " _Short Form Threshold_ ") (after giving effect to the
issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares); _provided, however_ , (x) that the Top-
Up Option shall not be exercisable unless the Minimum Condition has been
satisfied and, immediately after such exercise and the issuance of Company
Shares pursuant thereto, the Short Form Threshold would be reached (assuming
the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares); and (y) that in no event shall the
Top-Up Option be exercisable for a number of Company Shares in excess of the
Companys total authorized and unissued Company Shares (treating any Company
Shares held in the treasury of the Company as unissued).

 

(b) The parties shall cooperate to ensure that the issuance and delivery of
the Top-Up Shares comply with all applicable Law, including compliance with
an applicable exemption from registration of the Top-Up Shares under the
Securities Act. Merger Sub may pay the Company the aggregate price required to
be paid for the Top-Up Option Shares either (i) entirely in cash or (ii) at
Merger Subs election, by (x) paying in cash an amount equal to not less than
the aggregate par value of the Top-Up Option Shares and (y) executing and
delivering to the Company a promissory note having a principal amount equal
to the balance of the aggregate purchase price pursuant to the Top-Up Option
less the amount paid in cash pursuant to the preceding clause (x) (a "
_Promissory Note_ "). Any such Promissory Note shall be full recourse
against Parent and Merger Sub and (i) shall bear simple interest at the prime
rate of Bank of America, N.A. in effect on the date such Promissory Note is
executed and delivered, (ii) shall mature thirty (30) days after the date of
execution and delivery of such Promissory Note and (iii) shall have no other
material terms.

(c) Provided that no Law or Order shall prohibit the exercise of the Top-Up
Option or the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares pursuant thereto, or
otherwise make such exercise or issuance illegal, Merger Sub may exercise the
Top-Up Option, in whole but not in 

 



-66-   part, at any one time after the Appointment Time and prior to the earlier to
occur of (i) the Effective Time and (ii) the termination of this Agreement
pursuant to _Article VII_. 

(d) In the event Merger Sub wishes to exercise the Top-Up Option, Parent or
Merger Sub shall provide to the Company one (1) Business Day prior written
notice (a " _Top-Up Exercise Notice_ ," the date of which notice is referred
to herein as the " _Top-Up Notice Date_ ") specifying the denominations of the
certificate or certificates evidencing the Top-Up Option Shares which such
party wishes to receive, and the place, time and date for the closing of the
purchase and sale pursuant to the Top-Up Option (the " _Top-Up Closing_ ").
The Company shall, as soon as practicable after receipt of the Top-Up
Exercise Notice, deliver a written notice to Parent and Merger Sub confirming
the number of Top-Up Option Shares and the aggregate purchase price therefore
(the " _Top-Up Notice Receipt_ "). At the Top-Up Closing, Merger Sub shall
pay the Company the aggregate price required to be paid for the Top-Up Option
Shares, by delivery of cash and, if applicable, a Promissory Note in an
aggregate principal amount equal to the amount specified in the Top-Up Notice
Receipt, and the Company shall cause to be issued and delivered to Merger Sub
a Certificate or Certificates representing the Top-Up Option Shares or, if the
Company does not then have certificated shares, the applicable number
of Book-Entry Shares. Such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares may include any
legends that are required by federal or state securities laws.

(e) Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge that the Top-Up Option Shares that
Merger Sub may acquire upon exercise of the Top-Up Option shall not be
registered under the Securities Act and shall be issued in reliance upon an
exemption from registration under the Securities Act. Parent and Merger Sub
represent and warrant to the Company that Merger Sub is, or shall be upon any
purchase of Top-Up Shares, an "accredited investor", as defined in Rule 501
of Regulation D under the Securities Act. Merger Sub agrees that the Top-Up
Option, and the Top-Up Option Shares to be acquired upon exercise of the Top-
Up Option, if any, are being and shall be acquired by Merger Sub for the
purpose of investment and not with a view to, or for resale in connection
with, any distribution thereof (within the meaning of the Securities Act).

(f) Any impact on the value of the Company Shares as a result of the issuance
of the Top-Up Option Shares will not be taken into account in any
determination of the fair value of any Dissenting Company Shares pursuant to
Section 262 of the DGCL.

that notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that such breach by the
Company, or such inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of
the Company, are curable by the Company through the exercise of commercially
reasonable efforts, then Parent shall not be permitted to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section 7.1(e)_ until the earlier to occur of (A)

-68-   terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 7.1(e)_ if such breach
or inaccuracy by the Company is cured within such twenty (20) calendar day
period); or

 

(f) by Parent, in the event that there shall have occurred a Company Material
Adverse Effect and such Company Material Adverse Effect is continuing and not
cured by the Company within the twenty (20) calendar day period after delivery
of written notice from Parent to the Company; or

(which has not been withdrawn as of the date of the effectiveness of such
termination) and (ii) the Company has substantially simultaneously with the
occurrence of such termination paid the Termination Fee Amount required by
_Section 7.4(c)_, provided that such termination shall not occur or be
effective until the date that is twenty one (21) Business Days following the
later to occur of (x) the scheduled expiration date of the Offer period
during which such Company Board Recommendation Change occurs and (y) the date
on which the Offer Conditions set forth in clauses (ii), (vii) and (viii) of

deemed applicable to any of the transactions contemplated hereby (including
the Offer and the Merger) any applicable Law that has the effect of making
the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated hereby (including
the Offer and the Merger) illegal or which has the effect of prohibiting or
otherwise preventing the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement (including the Offer and the Merger) or (b) issued or
granted any judgment, Order or injunction that has the effect of making any of
the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Offer and the Merger)

(including the Offer and the Merger), and such judgment, Order or injunction
has become final and non-appealable.

without liability of any party or parties hereto, as applicable (or any
stockholder, director, officer, employee, agent, consultant or representative
of such party or parties) to the other party or parties hereto, as
applicable, except (i) for the terms of this _Section 7.3_, _Section 7.4_,
and _Article VIII_ (and any definitions contained in any such Section and
Article), each of which shall survive the termination of this Agreement, and
(ii) that nothing herein shall relieve any party or parties hereto, as
applicable, from liability for any willful or intentional breach of, or fraud
in connection with, this Agreement.

 

7.4 _Termination Fees_.

(a) In the event that (i) following the execution and delivery of this
Agreement and prior to the termination of this Agreement, an Acquisition
Proposal (solely for this purpose substituting 50% for all references to 15%
and 85% in the related definition of "Acquisition Transaction") shall have
been publicly announced or shall have become publicly known and (ii) this
Agreement is thereafter terminated pursuant to Section 7.1(b) or Section
7.1(c), and (iii) within twelve (12) months following the termination of this
Agreement, either an Acquisition Transaction (whether or not the Acquisition
Transaction which is the subject of the Acquisition Proposal referenced in
the preceding clause (i)) is consummated or the Company enters into a
definitive acquisition agreement with respect to an Acquisition Transaction
(whether or not the Acquisition Transaction which is the subject of the

designated in writing by Parent.

 

(b) In the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section

to an account designated in writing by Parent.

 

(c) In the event that the Company intends to terminate this Agreement pursuant
to _Section 7.1(i)_, as a condition to the effectiveness of such
termination, the Company shall substantially simultaneously with the
occurrence of such termination pay to Parent (or its designee) the Termination
Fee Amount in cash by wire transfer of immediately available funds to
an account designated in writing by Parent.

(d) The Company acknowledges and hereby agrees that the provisions of this 
_Section 7.4_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including the Offer and the Merger), and that, without such
provisions, Parent would not have entered into this Agreement. Accordingly, if
the Company shall fail to pay in a timely manner the amounts due pursuant to
this _Section 7.4_, and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent makes a
claim that

 



-70-   results in a judgment against the Company, the Company shall promptly
reimburse Parent its reasonable costs and expenses (including its reasonable
attorneys fees and expenses) incurred in connection with such suit, together
with interest on the amounts set forth in this _Section 7.4_ at the prime
rate of Bank of America, N.A. in effect on the date such payment was required
to be made. Payment of the fees described in this  _Section 7.4_ shall not
be in lieu of, or replacement or substitution for, damages incurred in the
event of any breach of this Agreement.

(e) In the event that Parent shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 7.1(g)_, payment of the Termination Fee Amount by the Company
pursuant to _Section 7.4(b)_ shall constitute liquidated damages, and in the
event that Parent shall receive such Termination Fee Amount pursuant to
_Section 7.4(b)_, and the Company shall have no further liability under this
Agreement.
