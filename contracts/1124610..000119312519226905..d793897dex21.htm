AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 

This Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of August 22, 2019, is by and
among VMware, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Parent"), Calistoga Merger
Corp., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger
Sub"), and Carbon Black, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company").

 

Parent desires to acquire the Company on the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this agreement.

 

In furtherance of the acquisition of the Company by Parent, upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this agreement, Parent has agreed to
cause Merger Sub to commence a cash tender offer (as it may be extended and
amended from time to time as permitted under, or required by, this agreement,
the "Offer") to purchase all of the outstanding shares of common stock, par
value $0.001 per share, of the Company (the "Company Common Stock") at a price
per share of $26.00 (such amount, or any other amount per share paid in the
Offer in accordance with this agreement, the "Offer Price"), net to the
seller in cash, without interest and subject to any required withholding of
Taxes.

It is also proposed that following the consummation of the Offer, Merger Sub
shall, in accordance with section 251(h) of the Delaware General Corporation
Law (the "DGCL"), merge with and into the Company (the "Merger"), with
the Company surviving the Merger and each share of Company Common Stock that
is not validly tendered and irrevocably accepted for payment pursuant to the
Offer (except as otherwise provided herein) will be converted into the right
to receive the Offer Price.

Parent, Merger Sub and the Company acknowledge and agree that the Merger shall
be governed by and effected under section 251(h) of the DGCL and, subject to
the terms of this agreement, effected as soon as practicable following the
consummation (as defined in section 251(h) of the DGCL) of the Offer;

 

The board of directors of the Company (the "Company Board") has unanimously
(i) determined that the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby (collectively, the "Merger Transactions") are fair to and
in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders, (ii) approved this
agreement and the Merger Transactions and declared it advisable that the
Company enter into this agreement and consummate the Merger Transactions,
(iii) resolved that this agreement and the Merger shall be governed by and
effected under section 251(h) of the DGCL and (iv) resolved to recommend that
the CompanyÂ’s stockholders tender their shares of Company Common Stock in the
Offer (such recommendation, the "Company Board Recommendation").

 

The board of directors of Merger Sub has approved and declared it advisable
for Merger Sub to enter into this agreement and consummate the Merger
Transactions.

The board of directors of Parent has approved this agreement and the Merger
Transactions and Parent, in its capacity as the sole stockholder of Merger
Sub, has agreed to approve the adoption of this agreement.

Concurrently with the execution of this agreement, and as a condition and
inducement to ParentÂ’s and Merger SubÂ’s willingness to enter into this
agreement, certain stockholders of the Company are entering into agreements
with Parent and Merger Sub pursuant to which, among other things and subject
to the conditions in such agreements, such stockholders are irrevocably
agreeing to tender in the Offer the shares of Company Common Stock
beneficially owned by them (as the same may be amended from time to time
pursuant to their respective terms, the "Support Agreements").

The Company, Parent and Merger Sub desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with this
agreement.

The parties therefore agree as follows:

 

ARTICLE I

 

THE MERGER TRANSACTIONS

 1.1 The Offer

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this agreement, as
promptly as reasonably practicable following the date hereof, but in any
event no later than the tenth Business Day after the initial public
announcement of the execution of this agreement (subject to the Company having
timely provided any information required to be provided by it pursuant to
section 1.1(i) and section 1.2(d)), Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause
Merger Sub to, commence, within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange
Act, the Offer. The obligations of Merger Sub, and of Parent to cause Merger
Sub, to accept for payment, and pay for, any shares of Company Common Stock
validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer are subject
only to the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted under this
agreement) of the conditions set forth in annex I (as they may be amended in
accordance with this agreement, the "Offer Conditions").

 

(b) Parent and Merger Sub reserve the right, to the extent permitted by Law,
at any time, to waive, in whole or in part, any Offer Condition (other than
the Minimum Condition) or to modify the terms of the Offer in any manner;
except that, without the prior written consent of the Company, neither Parent
nor Merger Sub shall (i) reduce the maximum number of shares of Company
Common Stock sought to be purchased in the Offer, (ii) reduce the Offer Price
or change the form of consideration payable in the Offer, (iii) change, modify
or waive the Minimum Condition, (iv) impose conditions to the Offer that are
in addition to the Offer Conditions, or modify or amend any existing Offer
Condition in a manner adverse to the holders of the Company Common Stock, (v)
except as otherwise required or permitted by section 1.1(d), extend or
otherwise change the Expiration Time, (vi) provide for any "subsequent
offering period" within the meaning of Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act,
(vii) increase the Offer Price, except following an Adverse Recommendation
Change or the CompanyÂ’s delivery to Parent of a notice of a Superior Proposal
or in the event that Merger Sub is permitted to extend the Offer pursuant to
section 1.1(d)(i)(2), or (viii) otherwise amend, modify or supplement the
Offer in any manner adverse to the holders of Company Common Stock. The Offer
may not be terminated prior to its scheduled Expiration Time, unless this
agreement is terminated in accordance with article VII.

 

(c) The Offer shall initially expire at midnight (New York City time) at the
end of the day that is 20 Business Days (calculated in accordance with Rule
14d-1(g)(3) under the Exchange Act) following the commencement of the Offer
(such initial expiration date and time of the Offer, the "Initial Expiration
Time") or, if the Offer has been extended pursuant to and in accordance with
section 1.1(d), the date and time to which the Offer has been so extended (the
Initial Expiration Time, or such later expiration date and time to which the
Offer has been so extended, the "Expiration Time").

(d) Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, extend the Offer
(i) if on the then scheduled Expiration Time, the Minimum Condition has not
been satisfied or any of the other Offer Conditions has not been satisfied or
waived by Parent or Merger Sub if permitted hereunder, for one or more
occasions in consecutive increments of up to fifteen Business Days each, as
determined by Merger Sub in its sole discretion, in order to permit the
satisfaction of such Offer Conditions (subject to the right of Parent or
Merger Sub to waive any Offer Condition, other than the Minimum Condition);
provided, however, that (1) Merger Sub shall not be required to extend the
Offer to a date later than the Outside Date and (2) if all of the Offer
Conditions (other than the Minimum Condition and other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Expiration Time,
but subject to such conditions being able to be satisfied) have been satisfied
or waived, Merger Sub shall not be required to (but notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this agreement, in its sole discretion may) extend the
Offer to a date later than the earlier of (x) the Outside Date and (y) the
date that is twenty Business

 Days after the date that all of the Offer Conditions (other than the Minimum
Condition and other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Expiration Time, but subject to such conditions being able
to be satisfied) have been satisfied or waived, and (ii) if required by any
rule, regulation, interpretation or position of the SEC, the staff thereof or
the Nasdaq Global Select Market (the "Nasdaq") or the New York Stock Exchange
(the "NYSE"), except that Merger Sub shall not be required to extend the Offer
to a date later than the Outside Date. No extension pursuant to this section
1.1(d) shall be deemed to impair, limit, or otherwise restrict in any manner
the rights of the parties hereto to terminate this agreement pursuant to the
terms of article VII.

 

(e) On the terms and subject to the conditions of this agreement, (i) at or as
promptly as practicable following the Expiration Time, Merger Sub shall, and
Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, irrevocably accept for payment (the time of
acceptance for payment, the "Offer Acceptance Time") all shares of Company
Common Stock validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the
Offer and (ii) at or as promptly as practicable following the Offer Acceptance
Time (but in any event within three Business Days (calculated as set forth in
Rule 14d-1(g)(3) under the Exchange Act) thereafter) Merger Sub shall, and
Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, pay for all shares of Company Common Stock
validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer, in each
case without interest and subject to any applicable withholding of Taxes.
Parent shall provide or cause to be provided to Merger Sub, on a timely basis,
the funds necessary to purchase any shares of Company Common Stock that Merger
Sub becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer. 

(f) The Offer Price payable in respect of each share of Company Common Stock
shall be paid on the terms and subject to the conditions of this agreement.
The Company agrees that no shares of Company Common Stock held by the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries will be tendered pursuant to the Offer.

 

(g) Unless this agreement is terminated pursuant to article VII, neither
Parent nor Merger Sub shall terminate or withdraw the Offer prior to any
scheduled Expiration Time without the prior written consent of the Company. In
the event this agreement is terminated pursuant to article VII, Merger Sub
shall promptly following such termination irrevocably and unconditionally
terminate the Offer and shall not acquire any shares of Company Common Stock
pursuant thereto. If the Offer or this agreement is terminated in accordance
with this agreement, Merger Sub shall promptly return, or cause any depositary
acting on behalf of Merger Sub to promptly return, all tendered shares of
Company Common Stock to the tendering stockholders in accordance with
applicable Law.

(h) The Offer Price shall be adjusted appropriately and proportionately to
reflect the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend
(including any dividend or other distribution of securities convertible into
Company Common Stock), reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification,
combination, exchange of shares or other similar change with respect to the
Company Common Stock occurring on or after the date of this agreement and at
or prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, and such adjustment to the Offer Price
shall provide to the holders of shares of Company Common Stock the same
economic effect as contemplated by this agreement prior to such action.

 

(i) On the date of commencement of the Offer (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2
under the Exchange Act), Parent and Merger Sub shall file with the SEC a
Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with respect to the Offer (together with
all amendments and supplements thereto and including exhibits thereto, the
"Schedule TO"), which shall contain or incorporate by reference an offer to
purchase and a related letter of transmittal and other appropriate ancillary
offer documents (such Schedule TO and the documents included therein pursuant
to which the Offer will be made, together with any supplements or amendments
thereto, the "Offer Documents"), and cause the Offer Documents to be
disseminated to the holders of Company Common Stock as and to the extent

or the holder of any shares of capital stock of Merger Sub or the Company:

(a) Conversion of Merger Sub Capital Stock. Each share of capital stock of
Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately before the Effective Time shall
be converted into and become one fully paid and non-assessable share of
common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Surviving Corporation. From

of shares of the common stock of the Surviving Corporation into which they
were converted in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence.

 

(b) Cancellation of Certain Shares. Each share of Company Common Stock owned
by the Company as treasury stock or owned by Merger Sub immediately before
the Effective Time or that was irrevocably accepted by Merger Sub in the Offer
(collectively, the "Excluded Shares") shall be canceled automatically and
shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be paid for those Excluded
Shares.

(c) Conversion of Company Common Stock.

 

(i) Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
before the Effective Time (other than Excluded Shares and Dissenting Shares)
shall be converted automatically into and shall thereafter represent only the
right to receive the Offer Price (the "Merger Consideration"), without
interest and subject to any required withholding of Taxes, payable upon
surrender of such shares in accordance with section 2.2.

(ii) All shares of Company Common Stock that have been converted pursuant to
section 2.1(c)(i) shall be canceled automatically and shall cease to exist,
and the holders of (A) certificates which immediately before the Effective
Time represented such shares (the "Certificates") or (B) shares represented
by book-entry immediately before the Effective Time (the "Book-Entry Shares")
shall cease to have any rights with respect to those shares, other than the

(d) Equitable Adjustment. If at any time during the period between the date of
this agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the number of
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock shall occur as a result of any
stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or
other distribution of securities convertible into Company Common Stock),
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of
shares or other similar change with respect to Company Common Stock, then the
Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted to reflect such change.

2.2 Surrender of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares.

 

(a) Paying Agent. Not less than three Business Days before the Closing Date,
Parent shall (i) select a bank or trust company, satisfactory to the Company
in its reasonable discretion, to act as the paying agent for the payment of
the amounts to be paid pursuant to this article II (the "Paying Agent") and

conditions that are satisfactory to the Company in its reasonable discretion.
Parent shall be responsible for all fees and expenses of the Paying Agent.

 

(b) Payment Fund. At or as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time,
Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent, for
the benefit of the holders of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares, for payment
in accordance with this article II by the Paying Agent, sufficient funds for
the payment of the aggregate Merger Consideration (such funds provided to the
Paying Agent are referred to as the "Payment Fund").

(c) Payment Procedures.

 

(i) Letter of Transmittal. Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall
cause the Paying Agent to mail the following to each holder of record of a
share of Company Common Stock converted pursuant to section 2.1(c)(i): (A) a
letter of transmittal in customary form, specifying that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to such holderÂ’s shares shall pass
only upon proper delivery of Certificates to the Paying Agent or, in the case
of Book-Entry Shares, upon adherence to the procedures set forth in the letter
of transmittal; and (B) instructions for surrendering such Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares in exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration.

(ii) Surrender of Shares. Upon surrender of a Certificate or of a Book-
Entry Share for cancellation to the Paying Agent, together with a duly
executed letter of transmittal and any other documents reasonably required by
the Paying Agent, the holder of that Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be
entitled to receive, and the Paying Agent shall promptly pay in exchange
therefor, the Merger Consideration payable and issuable in respect of the
number of shares formerly evidenced by that Certificate or such Book-Entry
Share less any required withholding of Taxes. Any Certificates and Book-Entry
Shares so surrendered shall be canceled immediately. No interest shall accrue
or be paid on any amount payable upon surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares.

 

(iii) Unregistered Transferees. If any Merger Consideration is to be paid and
issued to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered
Certificate or Book-Entry Share is registered, then the Merger Consideration
may be paid or issued to such a transferee so long as (A) the surrendered
Certificate or Book-Entry Share, as applicable, shall be properly
endorsed and presented to the Paying Agent or shall otherwise be in proper
form for transfer and is accompanied by all documents reasonably required by
Parent to evidence and effect that transfer and (B) the Person requesting such
payment or issuance (x) pays any applicable transfer Taxes or (y) establishes
to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent and the Paying Agent that all such
transfer Taxes have already been paid or are not applicable.

 

(iv) No Other Rights. Until surrendered in accordance with this section
2.2(c), each Certificate and each Book-Entry Share in respect of shares of
Company Common Stock converted into the right to receive Merger Consideration
pursuant to section 2.1(c)(i) shall be deemed, from and after the Effective
Time, to

 



7

   ##### Table of Contents

   

 

 represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration. The Merger
Consideration paid upon the surrender of any Certificate or Book-Entry Share
in accordance with the terms of this article II shall be deemed to have been
paid and issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share and, in the case of a Certificate, the shares
of Company Common Stock formerly represented by it.

 

(d) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. If any Certificate is lost, stolen
or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and the execution
and delivery by such Person of a customary indemnity agreement to provide
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to
such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall pay the Merger Consideration to such
Person in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such
Certificate as contemplated by this article II.

 

(e) No Further Transfers. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of
the Company shall be closed and there shall be no further registration of
transfers of the shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding
immediately before the Effective Time.

(f) Withholding. Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation, the
depository for the Offer and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold, or cause to be deducted and withheld, from any amounts otherwise
payable under this agreement (pursuant to article I, this article II, or
otherwise) such amounts as are required to be deducted or withheld therefrom
under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), or any
applicable state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that any amounts
are so deducted and withheld and paid to the appropriate Governmental
Authorities, those amounts shall be treated as having been paid to the Person
in respect of whom such deduction or withholding was made for all purposes
under this agreement.

(g) No Liability. Notwithstanding any provision of this agreement to the
contrary, none of the parties hereto, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent shall be liable to any Person for Merger Consideration delivered to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law.

 

(h) Investment of Payment Fund. The Paying Agent shall invest the Payment Fund
as directed by Parent; however no such investment or losses thereon shall
affect the Merger Consideration payable to the holders of Company Common Stock
immediately prior to the Effective Time and Parent shall promptly provide, or
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to promptly provide, additional funds
to the Paying Agent for the benefit of such holders of Company Common Stock in
the amount of any such losses to the extent necessary to satisfy the
obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this article II.

 

(i) Termination of Payment Fund. Parent is entitled to require the Paying
Agent to return to Parent or ParentÂ’s designee any portion of the Payment
Fund that remains unclaimed by the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares one year after the Effective Time. Thereafter, any holder of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares who has not complied with this article II
shall look only to Parent or the Surviving Corporation, which shall remain
responsible for payment and issuance of the applicable Merger Consideration.
Any amounts remaining unclaimed by such holders at such time at which such
amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental
Authority shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the
property of Parent or its designee, free and clear of all claims of interest
of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 

2.3 Company Equity Awards.

 

(a) Each option to purchase shares of Company Common Stock (each, a "Company
Option") that has been granted under any Company Stock Plan will, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent,
Merger Sub or the holders thereof, be treated as follows:

 

(i) immediately after the Effective Time, each portion of any Company Option
that is not a Rollover Option and that was outstanding and vested immediately
prior to the Effective Time and then

 



8

   ##### Table of Contents

   

 

 exercisable for a per share exercise price less than the Merger
Consideration that would be payable in respect of the Company Common Stock
underlying such Company Option (any such portion of such Company Option, an
"In-the-Money Cash Out Option") will be canceled in exchange for payment to
the holder of such Company Option of an amount in cash equal to the amount,
if any, by which (A) the Merger Consideration that would be payable in
accordance with section 2.1(c) in respect of the shares of Company Common
Stock issuable upon exercise of such In-the-Money Cash Out Option had such In-
the-Money Cash Out Option been exercised in full prior to the Effective Time
exceeds (B) the aggregate exercise price for such In-the-Money Cash Out
Option (such payment to be net of Tax withholdings) (the "Company Option Cash
Out Amount"); and

(ii) as of the Effective Time, Parent shall, in a manner that is intended to
satisfy the requirements of section 409A of the Code and the proposed and
final Treasury Regulations thereunder, substitute the portion of any Company
Option that is outstanding and unvested immediately prior to the Effective
Time, is then held by a Continuing Employee and is exercisable for a per
share exercise price less than the Merger Consideration that would be payable
in respect of the Company Common Stock underlying such Company Option (any
such portion of such Company Option, a "Rollover Option") with an option to
acquire, on the same material terms and conditions as were applicable to such
Rollover Option as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (except (x) that
any continued employment or service requirement will be based on
the applicable Continuing EmployeeÂ’s continued employment or service (but
excluding any consultants) with Parent or its Subsidiaries (including the
Surviving Corporation) following the Closing and (y) as provided in clauses
(A) and (B) below), the number of shares of Class A Common Stock of Parent
("Parent Common Stock"), rounded down to the nearest whole share, determined
by multiplying the number of shares of Company Common Stock issuable upon the
exercise in full of such Rollover Option as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time by a fraction (such fraction, the "Option Exchange Ratio"), the
numerator of which will be the Merger Consideration and the denominator of
which will be equal to the average of the closing prices of Parent Common
Stock on the New York Stock Exchange as reported on
https://www.nyse.com/quote/XNYS:VMW for the ten trading days ending on (and
inclusive of) the trading day that is five trading days immediately prior to
the Closing Date, at an exercise price per share of Parent Common Stock equal
to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the per share exercise price of such
Rollover Option, by (y) the Option Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest
whole cent (each, as so adjusted, a "Substituted Option"). The Substituted
Options will continue to have, and be subject to, the same material terms and
conditions as were applicable to the Rollover Option as of immediately prior
to the Effective Time, except that:

(A) in the case of any Rollover Option that is intended to qualify as an
incentive stock option under section 422 of the Code, the Substituted Option
issued in exchange for such Rollover Option will not be an incentive stock
option; and

 

(B) in the case of any Rollover Option that includes in its terms an early
exercise feature, the Substituted Option issued in exchange for such Rollover
Option will not contain an early exercise provision.

(b) All Company Options that are not In-the-Money Cash Out Options or Rollover
Options will be canceled at the Effective Time without payment of any
consideration.

 

(c) As of the Effective Time each unvested Company RSU that is then held by a
Continuing Employee and remains outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time will be substituted with a restricted stock unit covering
Parent Common Stock (a "Parent RSU"). The number of shares of Parent Common
Stock subject to a Parent RSU will be determined by multiplying the number
of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Company RSU immediately
prior to the Effective Time by the Option Exchange Ratio and rounding down to
the nearest whole share of Parent Common Stock. The Parent RSUs will continue
to have, and be subject to, the

 



9

   ##### Table of Contents

   

 

 same material terms and conditions as were applicable to the Company RSUs as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that:

 

(i) any continued employment or service requirement will be based on the
applicable Continuing EmployeeÂ’s continued employment or service (but
excluding any consultants) with Parent or its Subsidiaries following the
Closing;

(ii) the vesting dates for the Parent RSUs will be changed following the
Effective Time to occur on the first day of the applicable month in which the
vesting for each Company RSU underlying such Parent RSU would have otherwise
occurred; and

 

(iii) on, and only with respect to, the first such vesting date, an additional
amount will vest equal to the number of Company RSUs, if any, that would have
vested between the Closing Date and the first day of the calendar month next
occurring thereafter had the original vesting schedule for the Company RSU
remained in effect.

 

(d) All Company RSUs not substituted as of the Effective Time pursuant to
section 2.3(c), will be canceled at the Effective Time without payment of any
consideration; provided, however, that any Company RSU that is vested, but not
settled, as of the Effective Time, shall be cancelled in exchange for payment
to the holder of such Company RSU of an amount in cash equal to the
Merger Consideration in accordance with section 2.3(i) ("Vested Company
RSU").

(e) For any Company Common Stock that, immediately prior to the Effective
Time, remains unvested or is subject to a repurchase option, risk of
forfeiture or other condition on title or ownership under any applicable
restricted stock purchase agreement or other Contract with the
Company ("Company Restricted Stock") and is held by a Continuing Employee, an
amount determined by multiplying the number of shares of Company Restricted
Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Merger
Consideration Stock held by such Continuing Employee shall be withheld at the
Closing by Parent from any consideration otherwise payable to such Continuing
Employee, and become payable, without interest, on the same vesting schedule
as was applicable to such Company Restricted Stock as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time. The Company shall not permit any Company Restricted Stock
to be tendered in the Offer.

 

(f) With respect to the CompanyÂ’s 2018 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the
"Company ESPP"), the Company will take all actions reasonably necessary to
provide that (i) no new Offering (as defined in the Company ESPP) shall
commence following the date of this agreement, (ii) no individual
participating in the Company ESPP shall be permitted to (A) increase the
amount of his or her rate of payroll contributions thereunder from the rate in
effect as of the date of this agreement, or (B) make separate non-payroll
contributions to the Company ESPP on or following the date of this agreement,
and (iii) no individual who is not participating in the Company ESPP as of the
date of this agreement may commence participation in the Company ESPP. No
later than three Business Days prior to the Effective Time, the outstanding
Offering that is in progress on such date shall terminate and be the final
Offering under the Company ESPP and the accumulated payroll deductions of each
participant under the Company ESPP will be returned to the participant by the
Surviving Corporation pursuant to the terms of the Company ESPP, without the
issuance of any shares of Company Common Stock or other Company Capital Stock.

 

(g) No later than 15 days after the Closing Date, __ Parent shall register the
shares of Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to Substituted Options and
Parent RSUs on a registration statement on Form S-8 (if such Form is
available).

 

(h) All Company Options, Company RSUs, rights under the Company ESPP and the
Company Stock Plans will terminate as of the Effective Time, and, following
the Effective Time, no holder of any Company Option or Company RSU or any
participant in the Company ESPP or any other Company Stock Plan will have

 



10

   ##### Table of Contents

   

 

 any right to acquire any equity securities of the Company, its Subsidiaries,
or the Surviving Corporation as a result of such holderÂ’s Company Options,
Company RSUs or other rights under any of the Company Stock Plans.

(i) Payment of the applicable portion of the Merger Consideration for each In-
the-Money Cash Out Option and Vested Company RSU will be made as follows: No
later than ten Business Days after the Closing Date, Parent shall, or shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to, deliver to the holder of (i) any In-the-
Money Cash Out Option the applicable portion of the Company Option Cash Out
Amount, or (ii) any Vested Company RSU the applicable portion of Merger
Consideration payable to the holder of such Vested Company RSU, in each case
of clauses (i) and (ii), net of Tax withholdings. To the extent that such
Taxes are so deducted or withheld and paid over to the appropriate
Taxing Authority, the amounts thereof will be treated for all purposes
hereunder as having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would
otherwise have been paid.

 

(j) Prior to the Expiration Time, the Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to effect the treatment of Company Options and
Company RSUs provided for under this section 2.3, under the Company Stock
Plans, under all Contracts governing the terms of all Company Options or
Company RSUs, and under any other applicable plan or arrangement to which the
Company is a party or by which the Company may be bound with respect to such
Company Options or Company RSUs, including (A) giving any required notice and
obtaining any required consent contemplated thereby, and (B) at the request of
Parent, sending to any holders of Company Options and Company RSUs notices
drafted by Parent (and subject to reasonable review and approval by the
Company, which approval will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed) with respect to the treatment of such instruments under this
agreement. The Company shall not send or otherwise make available any notices
to any holders of Company Options or Company RSUs, or solicit any consents or
other approvals from the holders of any Company Options or Company RSUs unless
and until Parent has reviewed and approved all such notices and related
documentation (including any email messages and notifications) to be sent or
made available to such holders (which approval may not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed).

 

(k) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Company Option or Company RSU is
subject to the Laws of a non-U.S. jurisdiction and Parent determines in good
faith that the treatment set forth in this agreement with respect to such
Company Option or Company RSU may not be effected using commercially
reasonable efforts, Parent may provide for different treatment (subject to
review and approval by the Company, which approval will not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 

2.4 Dissenting Shares.

 

(a) Notwithstanding any provision of this agreement to the contrary (but
subject to the other provisions of this section 2.4), any shares of Company
Common Stock that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and for which the holder thereof is entitled to demand and
properly demands the appraisal of such shares in accordance with, and complies
in all respects with, the DGCL (collectively, the "Dissenting Shares"), shall
not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in
accordance with section 2.1(c). At the Effective Time, (i) all Dissenting
Shares shall be canceled and cease to exist and (ii) the holders of
Dissenting Shares shall be entitled only to such rights as may be granted to
them under the DGCL.

 

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of section 2.4(a), if any holder of
Dissenting Shares effectively withdraws or loses such appraisal
rights (through failure to perfect such appraisal rights or otherwise), then
that holderÂ’s shares (i) shall be deemed no longer to be Dissenting Shares and
(ii) shall be treated as if they had been converted automatically at the
Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration upon
adherence to the procedures set forth in section 2.2(c).

(c) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt written notice of any demands
for appraisal of any shares of Company Common Stock, the withdrawals of such
demands and any other instrument served on the Company under the DGCL relating
to stockholdersÂ’ appraisal rights and (ii) the right to participate in and

provisions of any confidentiality or standstill agreement (or any similar
agreement) to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party relating
to any Takeover Proposal or any inquiry that constitutes or could reasonably
be expected to lead to a Takeover Proposal and shall enforce the provisions
of any such agreement, except that the Company shall be permitted on a
confidential basis to release or waive any standstill obligations solely to
the extent necessary to permit the other party thereto to submit a
Takeover Proposal to the Company Board on a confidential basis. The Company
shall provide prompt (and in any event within 24 hours) written notice to
Parent of each such release or waiver of any standstill obligations, including
in such notice the identities of the parties thereto and circumstances
relating thereto.

if earlier, the termination of this agreement in accordance with article VII,
the Company shall not, and the Company shall cause each of its Subsidiaries

Representative of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be deemed a
breach of this section 5.3 by the Company.

(c) Notwithstanding section 5.3(b) or any other provision of this agreement to
the contrary (but subject to this section 5.3(c)), at any time after the date
hereof until the Offer Acceptance Time, following the receipt by the Company
of a written Takeover Proposal (which Takeover Proposal did not arise out of
any material breach of section 5.3(a) or section 5.3(b) by the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries or any of its or its SubsidiariesÂ’ Representatives):

(i) the Company and its Representatives shall be permitted to contact the
Person making such Takeover Proposal, solely to clarify the terms of such
Takeover Proposal; and

 

(ii) if the Company Board determines in good faith (A) that such Takeover
Proposal constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior
Proposal and (B) after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the
failure to take the actions set forth in clauses (1) and (2) below with
respect to such Takeover Proposal would reasonably be expected to
be inconsistent with the Company BoardÂ’s fiduciary duties to the CompanyÂ’s
stockholders under applicable Law, then the Company may, in response to such
Takeover Proposal, (1) furnish access and information with respect to the
Company to the Person who has made such Takeover Proposal, and its
Representatives, pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, so long
as any material non-public information provided under this clause (1) has
previously been provided to Parent or is provided to Parent substantially
concurrently with the time it is provided to such Person, and (2) participate
in discussions and negotiations with such Person regarding such
Takeover Proposal.

changes or modifications to the financial or (other than immaterial changes
or modifications) other terms and conditions of such Takeover Proposal or
inquiry, offer or proposal, in each case also providing to Parent a copy of
each written Takeover Proposal or inquiry, offer or proposal and any written
changes or modifications thereto containing any terms or conditions of any
proposals or proposed transaction agreements (including all schedules and
exhibits thereto) relating to any Takeover Proposal or inquiry, offer or

hours after the CompanyÂ’s receipt thereof. Without limiting any of the

notify Parent orally and in writing if it determines to begin providing
information or to engage in discussions or negotiations concerning a Takeover
Proposal pursuant to section 5.3(c).

to approve, endorse, recommend or declare advisable, a Takeover Proposal (any
action described in clauses (i) and (ii) being referred to as an "Adverse

Board may, at any time before the Offer Acceptance Time, in response to a
Superior Proposal received by the Company Board after the date of this
agreement, make an Adverse Recommendation Change and terminate this agreement
to simultaneously enter into a definitive Acquisition Agreement, but only if:

 

(i) neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
Representatives has materially breached any of the provisions of this section
5.3;

(ii) the Company Board has determined in good faith, after consultation with
outside legal and financial advisors, that failure to do so would reasonably
be expected to be inconsistent with the Company BoardÂ’s fiduciary obligations
to the CompanyÂ’s stockholders under applicable Law;

 

(iii) the Company shall have first provided at least four Business DaysÂ’ prior
written notice (the "Notice Period") to Parent that the Company is prepared
to make an Adverse Recommendation Change and terminate this agreement to enter
into an Acquisition Agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal, which
notice shall include a copy of the written definitive agreements (including
all exhibits and schedules and ancillary agreements) providing for the
transaction that constitutes such Superior Proposal;

 

(iv) during the Notice Period, the Company has negotiated with Parent in good
faith (if requested by Parent) to enable Parent to propose in writing such
adjustments in the terms and conditions of this agreement or the Offer so that
such Superior Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal; and

 

(v) following the end of the Notice Period (it being understood and agreed
that any material change to the financial or other terms and conditions of
such Superior Proposal shall require an additional notice to Parent and a new
two Business Day period), and after considering such negotiations and any
adjustments in the terms and conditions of this agreement or the Offer that
have been agreed to in writing by Parent, the Company Board has determined in
good faith that, after consultation with its financial advisor, such Superior
Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Proposal.

Board may, at any time before the Offer Acceptance Time, make an Adverse
Recommendation Change in response to an Intervening Event, but only if:

its outside legal counsel, that failure to do so would reasonably be expected
to be inconsistent with the Company BoardÂ’s fiduciary obligations to the
CompanyÂ’s stockholders under applicable Law;

(ii) the Company shall have first provided prior written notice to Parent for
at least the duration of the Notice Period that the Company is prepared to
make an Adverse Recommendation Change in response to such Intervening Event,

renders an Adverse Recommendation Change necessary;

(iii) during the Notice Period, the Company has negotiated with Parent in good
faith (if requested by Parent) to enable Parent to propose in writing such
adjustments in the terms and conditions of this agreement or the Offer so that
the failure to make such Adverse Recommendation Change would no longer
reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the Company BoardÂ’s fiduciary
obligations to the CompanyÂ’s stockholders under applicable Law; and

(iv) following the end of the Notice Period (it being understood and agreed
that any material change to the conditions constituting such Intervening Event

in writing by Parent, the Company Board has determined that, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel, the failure to make such
Adverse Recommendation Change continues to reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with the Company BoardÂ’s fiduciary obligations to the CompanyÂ’s
stockholders under applicable Law.

 

(h) Nothing contained in this section 5.3 or elsewhere in this agreement shall
prohibit the Company, the Company Board or any committee or subcommittee
thereof from (i) complying with Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) or Item 1012(a) of
Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act (any such disclosure (other
than a "stop, look and listen" communication or similar communication of the
type contemplated by section 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act) being deemed to
be an Adverse Recommendation Change unless in such disclosure the Company
Board expressly reaffirms the Company Board Recommendation) or (ii) making any
disclosure to the stockholders of the Company that the Company Board
has determined in good faith, after consultation with outside legal advisors,
failure to make would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the
Company BoardÂ’s fiduciary obligations to the CompanyÂ’s stockholders under
applicable Law, so long as such disclosure is not an Adverse Recommendation
Change, conditional or otherwise. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event
shall the issuance of a "stop, look and listen" statement (or other similar
statement pursuant to any requirement of applicable Law), without more,
constitute an Adverse Recommendation Change.

5.4 Employee Matters

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, other than the employees set forth in section
5.4(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company shall terminate the
employment or consulting services of each individual who (i) Parent informs
the Company has not accepted an offer of employment from Parent as of the
Effective Time, or (ii) is mutually agreed by Parent and the Company, and
shall therefore be a Non-Continuing Employee, effective as of no later than
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 

(b) Unless requested by Parent not to take such action at least three Business
Days prior to the date on which the Company becomes an ERISA Affiliate of
Parent, the Company Board shall adopt a resolution terminating the Company
401(k) Plan (and any other plan maintained by the Company or any member of the
"controlled group" that is intended to be qualified under Code Section 401(a)
and includes a cash or deferred arrangement intended to qualify under Code
Section 401(k)) prior to the date on which the Company becomes an

 



43

   ##### Table of Contents

   

 

 ERISA Affiliate of Parent (but not earlier than ten Business Days prior to
such date) and shall provide evidence of such termination acceptable to Parent
prior to the Closing, except that any such amendment, suspension or
termination of the Company 401(k) Plan shall not impact the benefits required
to be provided pursuant to section 5.4(c). Parent shall allow eligible
rollover contributions to the Parent 401(k) Plan of account balances (in
cash) under the Company 401(k) Plan. Immediately prior to the termination of
the Company 401(k) Plan, the Company will have made all necessary payments to
fund the contributions: (i) necessary or required to maintain the tax-
qualified status of each such plan; (ii) for elective deferrals made pursuant
to each such plan for the period prior to termination; and (iii) for any
employer contributions (including any matching contributions) for the period
prior to termination.

(c) From and after the Effective Time, Parent, in its sole discretion, shall
either (i) continue (or cause the Surviving Corporation to continue) the
Employee Benefit Plans of the Company on substantially the same terms as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time or (ii) discontinue the
Employee Benefit Plans and permit all employees of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries who remain employees of Parent or its Subsidiaries or who do not
accept an offer of employment from Parent but have not been affirmatively
terminated pursuant to section 5.4(a) (each, a "Continuing Employee" and
collectively, the "Continuing Employees") to participate in the benefit
programs of Parent to the same extent as similarly situated employees of
Parent or its Subsidiaries. From and after the Effective Time, with respect
to any benefit plan maintained by Parent or its Subsidiaries that is not an
Employee Benefit Plan and in which Continuing Employees are eligible to
participate:

 

(i) Continuing Employees shall be given credit for service with the Company or
its Subsidiaries with respect to paid time-off and severance as applicable;

(ii) With respect to any Continuing Employee who moves to any U.S. group
health plans of Parent or its Subsidiaries on a date other than the first day
of the plan year, Parent shall cause any pre-existing conditions and
eligibility waiting periods under any such plan to be waived with respect to
the Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents;

(iii) If applicable, unused vacation days accrued by exempt U.S. Continuing
Employees through the Closing Date will be cashed-out by the Company in
connection with the Closing, and such Continuing Employees will be subject to
ParentÂ’s non-accrued vacation policy applicable to all exempt U.S. employees;
and

(iv) Unused vacation days, if any, accrued by all other Continuing Employees
under the plans and policies of the Company and its Subsidiaries will carry
over to Parent or the Surviving Corporation to the extent administratively
practicable or legally required, and each such Continuing Employee shall be
paid by Parent in cash for any accrued and unused vacation days that Parent
determines are not administratively practicable or legally required to carry
over.

 

(d) Parent agrees that each Continuing Employee shall, during the period
commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the first anniversary of the
Closing Date (the "Continuation Period"), be provided with an annual rate of
base salary or base wage and an annual target cash bonus opportunity or
commission plan that is in the aggregate no less favorable than the
annual rate of base salary or base wage and the annual target cash bonus
opportunity or commission plan, as applicable, provided to such Continuing
Employee by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the
Effective Time; provided that such rate of base salary or base wage shall not
be decreased during the Continuation Period.

(e) Parent further agrees, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation, to
honor and abide by the terms of any severance and change in control plans,
agreements and arrangements for the benefit of the Continuing Employees that
are in effect and have been listed on section 5.4(e) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, unless otherwise agreed to between the
applicable Continuing Employee and Parent.

(f) Parent agrees, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation, to determine
the amount of the CompanyÂ’s 2019 fiscal year annual bonuses (the "2019
Bonuses") based on actual performance and the level of

 



44

   ##### Table of Contents

   

 

 achievement of the applicable performance targets in accordance with the
terms of the applicable Employee Benefit Plan and otherwise in the Ordinary
Course of Business consistent with past practice, provided that the 2019
Bonuses shall be pro-rated based on a performance period commencing on January
1, 2019 and ending on the Closing Date. Parent agrees, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation, to pay the 2019 Bonuses at any time following the
Effective Time but on or prior to the next payroll on or after January 31,
2020, subject to the Continuing EmployeeÂ’s continued employment through such
date. Following the Effective Time, Continuing Employees shall (i)
participate in ParentÂ’s bonus plans and programs and earn pro-rated bonus
payments for the period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on January
31, 2020 and (ii) beginning February 1, 2020, participate in ParentÂ’s bonus
plans and programs to the same extent as similarly situated employees of
Parent or its Subsidiaries.

 

(g) Nothing in this section 5.4, whether express or implied, shall confer upon
any current or former employee of the Company, Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates, any rights
or remedies including any right to employment or continued employment for any
specified period, of any nature or kind whatsoever under or by reason of
this section 5.4. No provision of this section 5.4 is intended to modify,
amend or create any employee benefit plan of the Company, Parent, Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates.

 

5.5 Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance.

 

(a) Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to indemnification,
exculpation, and advancement of expenses existing in favor of the current or
former directors and officers of the Company as provided in the Company
Organizational Documents or in indemnification agreements with the directors
and officers of the Company in the form attached to the CompanyÂ’s most recent
annual report on Form 10-K for acts or omissions occurring prior to the
Effective Time, including in respect of the Merger Transactions, shall be
assumed and performed by the Surviving Corporation and shall continue in
full force and effect until the later of six years after the Effective Time
or the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations with respect to any
such claims against directors or officers of the Company arising out of such
acts or omissions, except as otherwise required by applicable Law.

(b) At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall purchase six-year
prepaid "tail" policies on terms and conditions providing coverage retentions,
limits and other material terms no less favorable than the current policies of
directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’ liability insurance and fiduciary liability
insurance maintained by the Company with respect to matters arising at or
prior to the Effective Time, except that the Company may not commit or spend
on such "tail" policies annual premiums in excess of 250% of the annual
premiums paid by the Company in its last full fiscal year prior to the date
hereof for the CompanyÂ’s current policies of directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’
liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance (the "Base Amount"),
and if such premiums for such "tail" policies would exceed 250% of the Base
Amount, then the Company shall purchase policies that provide the maximum
coverage available at an annual premium equal to 250% of the Base Amount. The
Company shall in good faith cooperate with Parent prior to the Effective Time
with respect to the procurement of such "tail" policies, including with
respect to the selection of the broker, available policy price and coverage
options. Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain such
policies in full force and effect for their full term and to honor the
obligations thereunder.

 

(c) In the event that Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its
successors or assigns shall (i) consolidate with or merge into any other
Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfer all or substantially all its
properties and assets to any Person then, and in each such case, Parent shall
cause proper provision to be made so that the successor and assign of Parent
or the Surviving Corporation assumes the obligations set forth in this section
5.5.

 

5.6 Commercially Reasonable Efforts. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this agreement and in accordance with applicable Law,

 commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions
and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to
ensure that, as promptly as practicable, the Offer Conditions and the
conditions set forth in article VI are satisfied and to consummate the Merger

from, and make any filings and notifications with, any Governmental Authority
or third party necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law to
consummate the Merger Transactions, (ii) make any other submissions necessary,
proper or advisable in connection with the Merger Transactions under the
Securities Act, the Exchange Act, the HSR Act, the DGCL, the Nasdaq and NYSE
rules and regulations and any other applicable Law and (iii) take or cause to
be taken all other actions necessary, proper or advisable consistent with
this section 5.7 to cause the expiration of the applicable waiting periods, or
receipt of required consents, approvals or authorizations, as applicable,
under such Laws. Parent and the Company shall cooperate and consult with
each other in connection with the making of all such filings and
notifications, including by providing copies of all relevant documents to the
non-filing party and its advisors before filing.

 

(b) As promptly as practicable after the date of this agreement (and in no
event later than the date that is five Business Days after the date hereof),
each of Parent and the Company shall file any Notification and Report Forms
and related material required to be filed by it with the FTC and the United
States Department of Justice, as applicable, with respect to the Merger
Transactions (which shall request the early termination of any waiting period
applicable to the Merger Transactions under the HSR Act), and shall promptly
make any further filings pursuant thereto that may be necessary, proper or
advisable.

 

(c) Each of Parent and the Company shall promptly inform the other party upon
receipt of any communication from any Governmental Authority regarding the
Merger Transactions. If Parent or the Company receives a request for
additional information from any Governmental Authority that is related to the
Merger Transactions, then such party shall endeavor in good faith to make, or
cause to be made, to the extent practicable and after consultation with the
other party, an appropriate response to such request as promptly as reasonably
practicable. No party shall participate in any meeting or engage in any
material substantive conversation with any Governmental Authority related to
the Merger Transactions without giving the other party prior notice of the
meeting or conversation and, unless prohibited by such Governmental Authority,
the opportunity to attend and participate. Parent shall advise the Company
promptly of any understandings, undertakings or agreements (oral or written)
which Parent proposes to make or enter into with any Governmental Authority in
connection with the Merger Transactions.

 

(d) Parent and the Company shall exercise commercially reasonable efforts to
resolve or defend against such objections, if any, as the FTC, the United
States Department of Justice or any other Governmental Authority may assert
with respect to the Merger Transactions and to obtain any clearance required
under the HSR Act, or any other approval, consent or authorization necessary
under applicable Law for the consummation of the Merger Transactions.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this agreement, Parent shall not
have any obligation to and, without the prior written consent of Parent, the
Company shall not (i) litigate or contest any Legal Proceeding or Order, (ii)
sell, license, divest, dispose or hold separate any assets, entities or
businesses (including, after the Effective Time, of the Surviving Corporation

relationships or contractual rights or obligations, (iv) otherwise take
actions that would limit their respective freedom of action with respect to,
or its ability to retain, one or more of their respective businesses, assets
or rights or interests therein, or (v) commit to take any such actions in the
foregoing clauses (i) through (iv). Subject to the provisions set forth above,
Parent and the Company shall take any of the following

 



46

   ##### Table of Contents

   

 

 actions to the extent necessary or appropriate to obtain the approval of any
Governmental Authority with jurisdiction over the enforcement of the HSR Act
regarding the Merger Transactions: (A) entering into negotiations; (B)
providing information required by Law; and (C) substantially complying with
any supplemental request for information in accordance with the HSR Act.
Parent shall not require the Company or its Subsidiaries to, and the Company
and its Subsidiaries shall not be required to, take any action with respect to
any Order or any applicable Law which would bind the Company or its
Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time or in the event the Merger does not
occur.

(e) Parent agrees that prior to the Closing Date it and its Subsidiaries will
not acquire or enter into any other Contract to acquire any other business,
assets or equity of any Person if such proposed acquisition would or would
reasonably be expected to prevent the consummation of the Merger Transactions.

 

5.8 Public Announcements. The initial press release regarding the Merger
Transactions shall be a joint press release by the Company and Parent. Parent
and the Company shall consult with each other before issuing any press release
or otherwise making any public statements about this agreement or any of the
Merger Transactions and shall give each other reasonable opportunity to
review and comment upon any such release or statement. Neither Parent nor the
Company shall issue any such press release or make any such public statement
prior to such consultation, except to the extent required by applicable Law,
Order or the Nasdaq or NYSE requirements. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a)
the Company shall not be required to consult with Parent in connection with,
or provide Parent an opportunity to review or comment upon, any press release
or other public statement or comment to be issued or made with respect to any
Takeover Proposal or with respect to any actions contemplated by section
5.3(e), section 5.3(f), section 5.3(g) or section 5.3(h), and (b) this
section 5.8 shall not apply to any press release or other public statement
(i) that contains substantially similar information that has been previously
announced or made public in accordance with the terms of this agreement or
(ii) is made in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice
and does not relate specifically to the signing of this agreement or the
Merger Transactions.

 

5.9 Fees and Expenses. Except as explicitly provided for otherwise in this
agreement, whether or not the Merger is consummated, all expenses (including
those payable to Representatives) incurred by any party to this agreement or
on its behalf in connection with this agreement and the Merger Transactions
("Expenses") shall be paid by the party incurring those Expenses. For the
avoidance of doubt, Parent shall pay all filing fees payable for filings
required or otherwise made pursuant to the HSR Act or any other antitrust
laws, and the Company shall not be required to pay any fees or other payments
to any Governmental Authority in connection with any filings under the HSR Act
or such other filings as may be required under applicable antitrust laws in
connection with the Merger or the other Merger Transactions.

 

5.10 Company Financing. Prior to the Closing Date, upon ParentÂ’s request, the
Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use commercially
reasonable efforts to, prior to or at, and conditioned upon, the occurrence of
the Closing, deliver all notices and take all other actions required to, at
ParentÂ’s option: (a) facilitate the termination of the commitments under the
Credit Agreement (as the same may be amended, modified, supplemented, restated
or amended and restated from time to time and in effect immediately prior to
the Closing, the "Subject Indebtedness") and repay or satisfy in full all
obligations then outstanding thereunder in accordance with the terms of, and,
in connection therewith, deliver to Parent, customary payoff letters
reflecting such terminations and repayments (each a "Payoff Letter"), and,
upon the occurrence of the payoff in accordance with the terms of each such
Payoff Letter, deliver all notices and take all other actions required to
release all of the Liens in connection therewith, or (b) obtain the waiver or
consent of the parties to the Subject Indebtedness necessary to authorize the
waiver or consent to the Merger Transactions in respect of the Subject
Indebtedness (the "Lender Consent"), such Lender Consent to be in a form
reasonably satisfactory to Parent.

5.11 Rule 16b-3. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall (and shall be
permitted to) take such steps as may be reasonably required or advisable to
cause dispositions of the CompanyÂ’s equity securities (including derivative
securities) pursuant to the Merger by each individual who is a director or
officer of the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the
Exchange Act.

5.12 Notification of Certain Matters. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of (a) any notice or other
communication received from any Governmental Authority in connection with this
agreement or the Merger Transactions or from any Person alleging that
the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the
Merger Transactions, if the subject matter of such communication or the
failure to obtain such consent would be material to the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or Parent, (b) any Legal Proceedings commenced or, to the
Knowledge of the Company, threatened against the Company which relates to this
agreement or the Merger Transactions and (c) any known fact, event or
circumstance that would reasonably likely to result in the failure of any of
the Offer Conditions or any of conditions set forth in article VI to be
satisfied. Absent fraud or Willful and Material Breach of this agreement, no
such notification (or failure to provide such notification) shall constitute
a breach of this agreement or affect any of the representations, warranties,
covenants, rights or remedies, or the conditions to the obligations of, the
parties hereunder.

 

5.13 Delisting. The Company shall cooperate with Parent and shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts prior to the Closing Date to cause the

Committee of the Company Board (the "Compensation Committee") will take such

pursuant to which consideration is payable to any holder of any security of
the Company to be approved by the Compensation Committee in accordance with
the requirements of Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act and the
instructions thereto as an "employment compensation, severance or other
employee benefit arrangement" within the meaning of Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under
the Exchange Act and to satisfy the requirements of the non-exclusive safe
harbor set forth in Rule 14d-10(d) of the Exchange Act.

 

5.15 Takeover Laws. The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
(a) take all action necessary to ensure that no Takeover Law is or becomes
applicable to any of the Merger Transactions and refrain from taking any
actions that would cause the applicability of such Laws and (b) if the
restrictions of any Takeover Law become applicable to any of the Merger
Transactions, take all action necessary to ensure that the Merger Transactions
may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by
this agreement and otherwise minimize the effect of such Takeover Law on the
Merger Transactions.

cause each member of the Company Board to execute and deliver a letter
effectuating his or her resignation as a director of the Company Board,

(c) The Company acknowledges that the fees and other provisions of this
section 7.6 are an integral part of the Merger Transactions and that without
these agreements, Parent would not enter into this agreement. Each party
further acknowledges that the Termination Fee is not a penalty, but represents
liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent and
Merger Sub in the circumstances in which the Termination Fee is payable for
the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while
negotiating this agreement and in reliance on this agreement and on the
expectation of the consummation of the Merger Transactions. Accordingly, if
the Company fails to timely pay any amount due pursuant to this section 7.6,
and, in order to obtain the payment, Parent or Merger Sub commences a Legal
Proceeding which results in a judgment against the Company for the payment
set forth in this section 7.6, the Company shall pay, as applicable, ParentÂ’s
or Merger SubÂ’s out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable
attorneysÂ’ fees and disbursements) in connection with such Legal Proceeding,

made through the date each such payment was actually received.

(d) For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the Company be obligated to
pay, or cause to be paid, the Termination Fee on more than one occasion. In
the event that Parent receives payment of the Termination Fee, the receipt of
the Termination Fee shall be deemed to be liquidated damages for any and all
losses or damages suffered or incurred by Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
respective Affiliates in connection with this agreement (and the termination
hereof) and the Offer and the Merger (and the abandonment thereof), and,
without limiting the applicability of section 7.6(c), none of Parent, Merger
Sub, or any of their respective Affiliates shall be entitled to bring or
maintain any claim, action or proceeding against the Company or any of its
Affiliates for damages or any equitable relief arising out of or in connection
with this agreement or any of the Merger Transactions, except that the
foregoing shall not prevent Parent, Merger Sub or any other Person from
bringing or maintaining a claim, action or proceeding based on fraud or a
Willful and Material Breach of this agreement.

8.15 Specific Performance

 

(a) The parties to this agreement agree that irreparable damage would occur if

their specific terms or were otherwise breached, and that

 



64

   ##### Table of Contents

   

 

 money damages or other legal remedies (including those as set forth in
section 7.6) would not be an adequate remedy for any such non-performance or
breach. It is accordingly agreed that, subject to section 8.15(b), the
parties to this agreement shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this agreement in the Chosen Courts,
without proof of damages or otherwise, this being in addition to any other
remedy at law or in equity, and the parties to this agreement hereby waive any
requirement for the posting of any bond or similar collateral in connection
therewith. Each party hereto agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an
injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief on the basis that
or otherwise assert that (i) the other party has an adequate remedy at law or
(ii) an award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any
reason at law or equity.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in section 8.15(a), the right of
the Company to seek an injunction, specific performance or other equitable
relief in connection with enforcing ParentÂ’s obligation to fund the Offer
Price and the Merger Consideration and ParentÂ’s and Merger SubÂ’s obligations
to cause the Offer Acceptance Time to occur and to effect the Closing (but not
the right of the Company to seek such injunctions, specific performance or
other equitable relief for any other reason) shall be subject to the
requirements that (i) all of the Offer Conditions have been satisfied or
waived (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at
the Offer Acceptance Time, but subject to such conditions being able to be
satisfied) or waived at the Expiration Time, and (ii) the Company has
irrevocably confirmed that it would take such actions required of it by this
agreement to cause the Closing to occur.

 

8.16 Counterparts; Effectiveness. This agreement may be executed in one or
more counterparts, each of which when executed will be deemed to be an
original but all of which taken together will constitute one and the same
agreement. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page to this
agreement may be made by electronic or digital delivery such as in Adobe
Portable Document Format or using generally recognized e-signature technology
(e.g., DocuSign or Adobe Sign). This agreement shall become effective when,

all of the other parties hereto.

set forth therein) as of the date of this agreement and as of the Expiration
Time with the same effect as though made as of the Expiration Time (except to
the extent expressly made as of an earlier date, in which case as of such

complied with or performed by it prior to the Expiration Time under the
