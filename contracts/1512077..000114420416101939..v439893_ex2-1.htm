3.30(b)-1 of the Company Disclosure Schedule</U> lists each Contract to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is or was
a party, or by which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is or was bound, that relates to the Trio Spinout Transaction (the
&ldquo;<U>Trio Spinout Contracts</U>&rdquo;). <U>Section 3.30(b)-2 of the Company Disclosure Schedule</U> lists each Contract to
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, or by which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is bound, to which
Trio Connect, LLC or any officer, manager, partner or director of Trio Connect, LLC or any of its Affiliates or Subsidiaries is
a party or which otherwise benefits the Trio Business (such Contracts, together with the Trio Spinout Contracts, are collectively
referred to as the &ldquo;<U>Trio Contracts</U>&rdquo;). Seller has made available to Buyer correct and complete copies of the
Trio Contracts, together with all amendments, exhibits, attachments, waivers or other changes thereto. Each Trio Contract has not
been breached or cancelled by the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or, to the Knowledge of Seller, any other party thereto. The
Company or each of its Subsidiaries has performed all obligations under each Trio Contract required to be performed by the Company
or such Subsidiary. To the Knowledge of Seller, there is no event which, upon giving of notice or lapse of time or both, would
constitute a breach or default under any Trio Contract or would permit the termination, modification or acceleration of any Trio
Contract, and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has assigned, delegated or otherwise transferred to any Person any
of its rights, title or interest under any Trio Contract. There have been, and are, no claims under or in connection with any Trio
Contract or any Intellectual Property associated therewith (including, without limitation, any claims related to validity, infringement,
enforceability, or otherwise) made by any Person or, to the Knowledge of Seller, threatened, and, to the Knowledge of Seller, there
are no facts or basis that would give rise to such a claim. Neither Seller, the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any payment
obligation under any Trio Contract. None of the Trio Contracts has resulted in or would reasonably be expected to result in, individually
or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect, any material adverse effect on the Company IP or any material adverse effect
on the Company&rsquo;s or any of its Subsidiaries&rsquo; competitive advantages. The Company and its Subsidiaries have, and will
continue to have, the rights (with sublicensing and licensing rights) to use, reproduce, prepare, and distribute all Intellectual
Property (including the Company IP) used in, material to or necessary for the Business as the Business was conducted prior to the
Company and its Subsidiaries entering into the Trio Contracts and to make, use, offer to sell and sell products and services under
all such Intellectual Property.</P>

event DLA Piper, Seller and the Common Shareholders shall (i) provide Buyer and its representatives reasonable access at reasonable
times, upon prior written notice and during normal business hours, to the Protected Information, and (ii) furnish Buyer and its

any Protected Information which is contained in the records or information systems of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, none
of Seller or the Common Shareholders nor any of their respective Affiliates or legal counsel shall use such discovery or knowledge
as a basis for claiming any conflict of interest on the part of Buyer, the Company or such Subsidiary&rsquo;s legal counsel or
for any claim seeking to disqualify any legal counsel from representing Buyer or the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in any
dispute or Proceeding to which Buyer, the Company or such Subsidiary is a party.</P>
