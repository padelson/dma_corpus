applicable withholding agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
consideration payable pursuant to or as contemplated by this Agreement or the
Escrow Agreement any Taxes or other amounts required under the Code or any
applicable Law to be deducted and withheld, and, to the extent that any
amounts are so deducted or withheld, such amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement as having been paid to the
Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, any compensatory
consideration subject to payroll reporting and withholding that are payable
pursuant to or as contemplated by this Agreement or the Escrow
Agreement shall be payable in accordance with the applicable payroll
procedures of the Company.

  



  

(i) _Accredited Investors_. Any Common Shareholder or Preferred
Shareholder who Buyer or Seller reasonably believes is not an
"accredited investor" as such term is defined in Rule 501(a) under the
Securities Act shall not be distributed any Buyer Shares payable at the
Closing or Buyer Common Stock in satisfaction of payment obligations pursuant
to _Section 1.13_ or Rollover Preferred Shares, as applicable, and the full
amounts of the Consideration and the Deferred Consideration Amount payable to
such Common Shareholder, and full amount of the Redemption Amount payable to
such Preferred Shareholder, respectively, shall be paid solely in cash.

  



  

(j) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement
to the contrary, none of Buyer, the Company or any other Person shall be
liable to Seller or to any other Person for any Consideration delivered to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law.

  



  

(k) _Deemed Distribution_. For the avoidance of doubt, any payment
made by Buyer directly to a Common Shareholder or Preferred Shareholder shall
be deemed a payment to Seller and a deemed distribution to such Common
Shareholder or Preferred Shareholder from Seller.

  



  

(l) _Exchange of Preferred EMC Units in Escrow_. At the Closing,
Seller shall cause the Preferred EMC Units held in the Indemnification
Escrow Fund (as such term is defined in the MTN Merger Agreement) to be
replaced with cash in an amount equal to the portion of the Redemption Amount
to which such Preferred EMC Units are entitled.

  



  

1.4 _Rollover Preferred Shares; Redemption Amount_. At the
election of a Preferred Shareholder, such Preferred Shareholder shall have
the right, subject to such Preferred Shareholder's execution of a
subscription agreement in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
Buyer, to receive Rollover Preferred Shares, in respect of all or a portion of
such Preferred Shareholder's pro rata portion of the Redemption Amount (as
calculated pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of the LLC Agreement),
provided that the value of all Rollover Preferred Shares issued hereunder
shall not exceed $27,000,000 (unless otherwise agreed to in writing by
Seller in its sole discretion). Each Preferred Shareholder electing to
exercise the right to receive Rollover Preferred Shares as full or partial
payment of such Preferred Shareholder's pro rata portion of the Redemption
Amount shall provide written notice to the Buyer of such election promptly
after the date hereof and in any event not later than ten (10) days prior to
the Closing Date. For the avoidance of doubt, and notwithstanding anything to
the contrary herein, in the event that the Closing shall have not occurred on
or before December 31, 2016 (for any reason), the Seller shall satisfy its
obligations to the Preferred Shareholders in respect of the aggregate amount
of interest accrued on the Preferred EMC Units following December 31, 2016 in
cash from the Estimated Cash Payment.

  



  

1.5 _[Reserved]_.

1.6 _Termination of Rights_. All consideration paid or payable in
respect of Interests in accordance with the provisions of this _ARTICLE 1_
, including the rights to additional payments under _Sections 1.3(e)_ and
_1.8(b)_ , shall be deemed to have been paid or payable in full satisfaction
of all rights pertaining to the Interests. After the Closing, Seller shall
cease to be, and shall have no rights as, a member of the Company, and such
Seller's rights shall consist only of the right to receive the
consideration provided for in this Agreement in respect of such Interests.

  



  

1.7 _Closing Payment Certificate_. At least five (5) Business Days
before the Closing Date, Seller shall prepare and deliver to Buyer (a) a
certificate (the " _Closing Payment Certificate_ ") signed by Seller setting
forth its best estimate of (i) Cash Amount, (ii) Debt Amount, (iii) Permitted
Indebtedness Amount, (iv) Transaction Expenses Amount, (iv) Working Capital
Surplus, if any, (v) Working Capital Deficit, if any, in each case in clauses
(i) through (v) as of the open of business on the Closing Date, and (vi)
based on such estimates in clauses (i) through (v), Seller's best estimates of
the Cash Payment (the " _Estimated Cash Payment_ ") and the Buyer Shares (the
" _Estimated Buyer Shares_ "), and (b) all records and work papers necessary
to compute and verify the information set forth in the Closing Payment
Certificate. Seller shall prepare the Closing Payment Certificate in good
faith based upon the books and records of the Company at and prior to the date

1.8 _Post-Closing Adjustment_.

  



  

 (a) Within ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall
prepare and deliver to Seller a statement setting forth Buyer's good faith
calculation of the Cash Amount, Debt Amount, Permitted Indebtedness Amount,
Transaction Expenses Amount, Working Capital, Working Capital Surplus, if
any, and Working Capital Deficit, if any, in each case as of the open of
business on the Closing Date and, based on such calculations, the Cash
Payment and the Buyer Shares (the " _Closing Statement_ "). If Seller has any
objections to the Closing Statement prepared by Buyer, then Seller shall
deliver a detailed written statement (the " _Objections Statement_ ")
describing (a) which items on the Closing Statement have not been prepared in
accordance with this Agreement, (b) the basis for Seller's disagreement with
the calculation of such items and (c) Seller's proposed dollar amount for
each item in dispute, to Buyer within thirty (30) days after delivery of the
Closing Statement. If Seller fails to deliver an Objections Statement within
such thirty (30) day period, then the Closing Statement shall become final and
binding on all Parties. Seller shall be deemed to have agreed with all
amounts and items contained or reflected in the Closing Statement to the
extent such amounts or items are not disputed in the Objections Statement. If
Seller delivers an Objections Statement within such thirty (30) day period,
then Seller and Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to resolve any
such disputes, but if a final resolution is not obtained within twenty (20)
days after Seller has submitted any Objections Statements, any remaining
matters which are in dispute shall be resolved by the office of an impartial
nationally recognized firm of independent certified public
accountants, appointed by mutual agreement of Buyer and Seller (the "
_Accountants_ "). The Accountants shall prepare and deliver a written report
to Buyer and Seller and shall submit a proposed resolution of such unresolved
disputes promptly, but in any event within twenty (20) days after the dispute
is submitted to the Accountants. The Accountants' determination of such
unresolved disputes shall be final and binding upon all Parties; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that no such determination shall be any more favorable to Buyer
than is set forth in the Closing Statement or any more favorable to Seller
than is proposed in the Objections Statement. The costs, expenses and fees of
the Accountants shall be borne by the Party whose calculation of the Cash
Payment and the Buyer Shares has the greatest difference from the final Cash
Payment and Buyer Shares as determined by the Accountants under this _Section
1.8_. The final Closing Statement, however determined pursuant to this
_Section 1.8(a)_ , shall produce the Working Capital Surplus, if any, the
Working Capital Deficit, if any, the Cash Amount, the Debt Amount, the
Permitted Indebtedness Amount and the Transaction Expenses Amount to be used
to determine the final Cash Payment and the Buyer Shares.

 (b) Within five (5) Business Days after __ the Cash Payment and

amount by which the Cash Payment exceeds the Estimated Cash Payment and (B)
Seller and Buyer shall issue joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent
to release to Seller, the Adjustment Escrow Amount;

absolute value of the difference between the Estimated Cash Payment and the
Cash Payment (and to the extent the Adjustment Escrow Amount is insufficient,
Seller shall deliver the balance in cash to Buyer) and (B) Seller and Buyer
shall issue joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent to release
to Seller, the remainder of the Adjustment Escrow Amount; or

  



  

(iv) if the Estimated Buyer Shares exceed the Buyer Shares, then (A)

Shares (and to the extent such Adjustment Escrow Amount is insufficient, shall
deliver the balance in cash to Buyer) and (B) Seller and Buyer shall issue
joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent to release to Seller,
the remainder of the Adjustment Escrow Amount.

1.9 _Calculations_. All calculations of Working Capital, the Cash
Amount, the Debt Amount, the Permitted Indebtedness Amount, the Redemption
Amount and the Transaction Expenses Amount under this Agreement, whether
estimates or otherwise, shall be determined in accordance with GAAP and, to
the extent consistent with GAAP, using the same accounting principles,
practices, procedures, policies and methods (with consistent classifications,
judgments, inclusions, exclusions and valuation and estimation methodologies)
used and applied by the Company in the preparation of the Most Recent Balance
Sheet, except that such statements, calculations and determinations: (a)
shall not include any purchase accounting or other adjustment arising out of
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (b)
shall be based on facts and circumstances as they exist prior to the Closing
and shall exclude the effect of any act, decision or event occurring on or
after the Closing, and (c) shall follow the defined terms contained in this
Agreement whether or not such terms are consistent with GAAP. In addition,
the determination of Working Capital, the Cash Amount, the Debt Amount, the

Statement shall be calculated consistent with the methodologies used in the
example calculations provided in _Schedule 1.9_.

1.13 _Deferred Consideration_. Subject to _Section 7.11_ , on the
first anniversary of the Closing Date, the Buyer shall pay to the Seller the
Deferred Consideration Amount (as adjusted pursuant to _ARTICLE VII_ ). Buyer
shall have the option to pay the Deferred Consideration Amount to Seller in
either (a) cash, (b) shares of Buyer Common Stock, 50% of which shall be
valued at the Buyer Common Stock Value, and 50% of which shall be valued at
the First Anniversary Buyer Common Stock Value, or (c) a combination of the

anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Buyer shall not issue any shares
of Buyer Common Stock in satisfaction of its payment obligations pursuant to
this _Section 1.13_  to the extent that the number of such shares of Buyer
Common Stock to be issued, together with the number of Buyer Shares issued at
Closing would be in excess of 19.99% of the voting capital stock of Buyer, as
calculated pursuant to applicable rules promulgated by NASDAQ (the " _Stock
Cap_ ") without approval of Buyer's shareholders. If Buyer's shareholders
do not approve the issuance of Buyer Common Stock in excess of the Stock Cap,
Buyer may issue a number of shares pursuant to this  _Section 1.13_ up to the
Stock Cap and shall pay any remaining amounts payable in cash.

  



  

1.14 _Intended Tax Treatment; Allocation_. The Parties acknowledge
and agree that, for federal (and, where applicable, state and local)
income Tax purposes, the Transaction shall be treated as a sale of the
Interests by Seller and purchase by Buyer of the assets of the Company and
its DRE Subsidiaries (other than any DRE Subsidiary that is owned, directly or
indirectly, by a corporation) subject to the liabilities of the Company and
its DRE Subsidiaries (other than any DRE Subsidiary that is owned, directly or
indirectly, by a corporation) as of the Closing Date, in each case in
exchange for the Consideration and the distribution of the proceeds
thereof by the Seller to the recipients thereof. Seller and Buyer and their
respective Affiliates shall report the Transaction and will prepare and file
all Tax Returns in a manner consistent with this _Section 1.14_ , and shall
not take any position for Tax purposes (including in any Proceeding or audit)
inconsistent with this _Section 1.14_ unless required to do so by
applicable Law. Within sixty (60) days of the determination of the Final
Closing Balance Sheet, Purchaser shall provide to Seller a
schedule allocating the Consideration, as adjusted pursuant to _ARTICLE 1_ ,
and as increased by the liabilities of the Seller and its DRE Subsidiaries
(other than any DRE Subsidiary that is owned, directly or indirectly, by a
corporation) as of the Closing Date (including, for the avoidance of doubt,
the Debt Amount, the Permitted Indebtedness Amount, the Transaction Expenses
Amount and the Redemption Amount) and other relevant items, shall be
allocated among the assets of the Company and its DRE Subsidiaries
(other than any DRE Subsidiary that is owned, directly or indirectly, by a
corporation) (the " _Allocation of Consideration Schedule_ "). If within the
thirty (30) days of receiving the Allocation of Consideration Schedule, Seller
has not objected, the Allocation of Consideration Schedule shall be final and
binding. If within thirty (30) days Seller objects to the Allocation of
Consideration Schedule, Seller and Buyer shall cooperate in good faith to
resolve their differences, provided that if after thirty (30) days, Seller and
Buyer are unable to agree, the parties shall retain Accountants to resolve
their dispute. The cost of the Accountants in respect of the matters under
this _Section 1.14_ shall be shared equally by Seller and Buyer. The parties
hereto shall make appropriate adjustments to the Allocation of Consideration
to reflect changes in the Consideration. The parties hereto agree for all Tax
reporting purposes to report the transactions in accordance with the
Allocation of Consideration Schedule, as adjusted pursuant to the
preceding sentence, and to not take any position during the course of any
audit or other proceeding inconsistent with such schedule unless required by
a determination of the applicable Governmental Authority that is final.

Company and each of its Subsidiaries to maintain accounting controls and
systems which are sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that (A) all

authorization, (B) all transactions are recorded as necessary to permit the
accurate preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles and to maintain proper accountability for

into Cash; or

(c) All accounts receivable reflected on the Most Recent Financial
Statements, and all accounts receivable of the Company and its
Subsidiaries generated since the Most Recent Fiscal Month End (the "
_Receivables_ "), constitute bona fide receivables resulting from the sale of
inventory, services or other obligations in favor of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as to which full performance has been fully rendered, and are
valid and enforceable claims. The Receivables are not subject to any pending
or threatened defense, counterclaim, right of offset, returns, allowances or
credits, except to the extent reserved against the accounts receivable.
The reserves against the accounts receivable for returns, allowances,
chargebacks and bad debts are commercially reasonable and have been
determined in accordance with GAAP, consistently applied in accordance with
past custom and practice.

reflected on the Financial Statements arose from bona fide transactions
in the Ordinary Course of Business, and all such accounts payable have either
been paid, are not yet due and payable in the Ordinary Course of Business, or
are being contested by the Company and its Subsidiaries in good faith. Except
as set forth on _Section 3.7(d) of the Company Disclosure Schedule_, the
Company has not entered into any extended payment plans regarding accounts
payable to suppliers for payment terms not in the Ordinary Course of Business

and its Subsidiaries (i) does not include any items that are obsolete or of a
quantity or quality not usable or salable in the Ordinary Course of Business
and (ii) includes only items sold by the Company and its Subsidiaries in the
Ordinary Course of Business. The inventory and equipment leased to customers
disposed of subsequent to the date of the Most Recent Fiscal Month End has
been disposed of only in the Ordinary Course of Business. No inventory of
the Company and its Subsidiaries is held on a consignment basis. The
quantities of each item of inventory of the Company and its
Subsidiaries (whether raw materials, work-in-process or finished goods) are
not excessive, but are reasonable in the present circumstances of the Company
and its Subsidiaries.

  



    

 -19-

 



    



  

(f) Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has established and
presently maintains a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to
provide reasonable assurances (i) that transactions, receipts and expenditures
of such entity are being executed and made only in accordance with
appropriate policies, procedures and authorizations of management and the
board of directors or management of such entity, (ii) that transactions
related to the business of such entity are recorded as necessary (A) to permit
preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP and (B) to
maintain accountability for assets. Since January 1, 2013, neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has identified or been made aware of
any fraud that involves the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or their
management, or other current employees or any claim or allegation relating to
any of the foregoing, and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has
received any written notice form its independent accountants regarding any of
the foregoing.

  



  

(g) The reserves reflected on the Financial Statements are for the
matters described on Section _3.7(g)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

  



  

3.8 _Undisclosed Liabilities_. The Company and its Subsidiaries do
not have any material liability (whether known or unknown, whether
asserted or unasserted, whether absolute or contingent, whether accrued or
unaccrued, whether liquidated or unliquidated, and whether due or to become
due), except for liabilities that (a) are accrued or reserved against on the
face of the Most Recent Financial Statements (rather than in any notes
thereto), (b) were incurred subsequent to the date of the Most Recent
Financial Statements in the Ordinary Course of Business, (c) result from the
obligations of the Company under this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements,
(d) liabilities and obligations pursuant to any Contract listed on _Section
3.13 of the Company Disclosure Schedule_ or not required by the terms of
_Section 3.13(a)_ to be listed on _Section 3.13 of the Company Disclosure
Schedule_, in either case which arose in the Ordinary Course of Business and
did not result from any default, tort, breach of contract or breach
of warranty or (e) would not be required to be disclosed on a balance sheet
pursuant to GAAP.

  



  

3.9 _Legal Compliance_.

  



  

(a) The Company and its Subsidiaries, and their respective
predecessors and Affiliates, are in material compliance with all
applicable Laws and Orders, and no Proceeding has been filed or commenced or,
to the Knowledge of Seller, threatened in writing alleging any failure so to
comply. Since January 1, 2013, the Company and its Subsidiaries have not
received any written notice or communication in writing alleging any material
non-compliance of the foregoing.

(b) _Section 3.9(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule_ sets forth
a correct and complete list of all Permits held by the Company and
its Subsidiaries and material to their business, including the names of the
Permits, whether the Permits are temporary or permanent and their respective
dates of issuance and expiration. Such Permits (i) constitute all Permits
necessary for the operation of the business of the Company and its
Subsidiaries and (ii) are valid and in full force and effect. No Proceeding is
pending or, to the Knowledge of Seller, threatened to revoke, suspend,
terminate, lapse or limit any such Permits. To the Knowledge of Seller,
no event has occurred that, with or without notice or lapse of time or both,
would reasonably be expected to result in the revocation, suspension,
termination, lapse, nonrenewal or limitation of any such Permits. None of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries has received any (A) written notice of
suspension, cancellation, modification, revocation, nonrenewal or termination
relating to any such Permits or (B) written notice, order, complaint or other
written communication claiming the existence of any default under any such
Permits, which default has not been cured. Each of Company and its
Subsidiaries has filed, obtained, maintained or submitted all reports,
documents, forms, notices, applications, records, claims, submissions and
supplements or amendments thereto as required by any such Permits and all
such reports, documents, forms, notices, applications, records, claims,
submissions and supplements or amendments were correct and complete in all
material respects, and not misleading on the date filed (or were corrected or
supplemented by a subsequent submission), except for any failure which would
not reasonably be expected to result in a Company Material Adverse Change.

  



  

(c) Neither the Company, nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor, to the
Knowledge of Seller, any of their respective officers, managers,
stockholders, members, directors, agents, employees, representatives,
contractors, any Joint Venture Partners or any other Persons acting on behalf
of any of the foregoing has, directly or indirectly, (i) made any illegal

received any unlawful contributions, payments, bribes, kickbacks,
expenditures, gifts or similar payments, (iii) made or paid any contributions,
directly or indirectly, to a domestic or foreign political party or

official (as defined in the FCPA) or (v) taken any other action that would
cause the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to be in violation of any Anti-
Fraud and Anti-Corruption Laws. There are no Proceedings, filings, or
governmental investigations alleging any such contributions, payments,
bribes, kickbacks, expenditures, gifts or fraudulent conduct or any other such
violation of any Anti-Fraud and Anti-Corruption Law. The transactions of the
Company and its Subsidiaries have been and are accurately and fairly
reflected on their respective books and records in compliance with the Anti-
Fraud and Anti-Corruption Laws, and the Company and each of its Subsidiaries
maintains a system of internal controls that complies with the Anti-Fraud and
Anti-Corruption Laws.

expected to result in, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material
Adverse Effect, any material adverse effect on the Company IP or any material
adverse effect on the Company's or any of its Subsidiaries' competitive
advantages. The Company and its Subsidiaries have, and will continue to have,
the rights (with sublicensing and licensing rights) to use, reproduce,
prepare, and distribute all Intellectual Property (including the Company IP)

action is necessary to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, each of
the Parties shall take such further action (including the execution and

Party (unless the requesting Party is entitled to indemnification therefor
under _ARTICLE 7_ or _ARTICLE 8_ below).

5.2 _Directors ' and Officers' Indemnification and Insurance_.

     



  

(a) Buyer agrees that all rights to indemnification, advancement of
expenses and exculpation by the Company now existing in favor of each Person
who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date hereof or who becomes
prior to the Closing an officer, director or manager of the Company (each, a
" _D andO Indemnified Party_") as provided in the Company's Organizational
Documents, in each case as in effect on the date of this Agreement, shall
survive the transaction contemplated hereby and shall remain in full force
and effect in accordance with their terms, and, in the event that any
proceeding is pending or asserted or any claim made during such period, until
the final disposition of such proceeding or claim.

  



  

(b) For six (6) years after the Closing, to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Law, Buyer and the Company (the " _D
andO Indemnifying Parties_") shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless each DandO
Indemnified Party against all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, fees,
expenses, judgments and fines arising in whole or in part out of actions or
omissions in their capacity as such occurring at or prior to the Closing
(including in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement), and shall advance and reimburse each DandO Indemnified Party for
any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such DandO Indemnified Party
in connection with investigating or defending any such losses, claims,
damages, liabilities, fees, expenses, judgments and fines as such expenses
are incurred, subject to, if required by Delaware law, the Company's receipt
of an undertaking by such DandO Indemnified Party to repay such legal and other
fees and expenses paid in advance if it is ultimately determined in a final
and non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction that such DandO
Indemnified Party is not entitled to be indemnified under applicable Law;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Company will not be liable for any
settlement effected without the Company's prior written consent (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

  



  

(c) Prior to the Closing, Buyer shall obtain "tail" insurance
policies with a claims period of at least six (6) years from the Closing with
at least the same coverage and amount and containing terms and conditions that
are not less advantageous to the directors and officers of the Company as the
Company's existing policies with respect to claims arising out of or relating
to events which occurred before or at the Closing (including in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) (the " _D andO Tail
Policy_"). Buyer shall bear the cost of the DandO Tail Policy; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Buyer shall not be required to pay a tail premium in excess
of 200% of the last annual premium paid by the Company for the
Company's existing policies before the date of this Agreement. During the
term of the DandO Tail Policy, Buyer shall not (and shall cause the Company not
to) take any action following the Closing to cause the DandO Tail Policy to be
cancelled or any provision therein to be amended or waived.

  



  

(d) The obligations of Buyer under this _Section 5.2_ shall survive
the Closing and shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to
adversely affect any DandO Indemnified Party to whom this _Section 5.2_ applies
without the consent of such affected DandO Indemnified Party (it being
expressly agreed that the DandO Indemnified Parties to whom this _Section 5.2_
 applies shall be third-party beneficiaries of this _Section 5.2_ , each of
whom may enforce the provisions of this _Section 5.2_ ).

(e) In the event Buyer, the Company or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other
Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in
such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of
its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in either such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Buyer or the
Company, as the case may be, shall assume all of the obligations set forth in
this _Section 5.2_. The agreements and covenants contained herein shall not
be deemed to be exclusive of any other rights to which any Indemnified Party
is entitled, whether pursuant to Law, Contract or otherwise. Nothing in this
Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall release, waive or
impair any rights to directors' and officers' insurance claims under any
policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the Company or its
officers, directors and employees, it being understood and agreed that the
indemnification provided for in this _Section 5.2_ is not prior to, or in
substitution for, any such claims under any such policies.

  



  

5.3 _Confidentiality_. Seller shall not (and shall cause the
Common Shareholders to not) disclose or use any Confidential Information,
except that, if and as long as a Common Shareholder is an employee of the
Company or any of the Subsidiaries after the Closing, then such
Common Shareholder may use the Confidential Information in the ordinary
course of his or her employment on behalf of the Company or such Subsidiary
so long as such use is in compliance with all policies and agreements
applicable to such Common Shareholder. Upon termination of such employment,
each Common Shareholder shall deliver promptly to Buyer or destroy, at the
request and option of Buyer, all tangible embodiments (and all copies) of the
Confidential Information that are in his or her possession. If any Common
Shareholder is requested or required pursuant to written or oral question or
request for information or documents in any Proceeding,
interrogatory, subpoena, civil investigation demand or similar process to
disclose any Confidential Information, then such Common Shareholder shall
notify Buyer promptly of the request or requirement so that Buyer may seek an
appropriate protective order or waive compliance with the provisions of this
_Section 5.3._ If, in the absence of a protective order or the receipt of a
waiver hereunder, any Common Shareholder is, on the advice of counsel,
compelled to disclose any Confidential Information to any tribunal or
else stand liable for contempt, then such Common Shareholder may disclose the
Confidential Information to the tribunal; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the
disclosing Common Shareholder shall use its, his or her best efforts to
obtain, at the request of Buyer, an order or other assurance that
confidential treatment will be accorded to such portion of the Confidential
Information required to be disclosed as Buyer shall designate. The foregoing
provisions shall not apply to any Confidential Information that is
generally available to the public immediately prior to the time of disclosure
unless such Confidential Information is so available due to the actions of a
Common Shareholder.

  



  

5.4 _Release_. Conditioned upon the Closing and from and after the
Closing, Seller, for itself, and its heirs, personal representatives,
successors and assigns (collectively, the " _Releasors_ "), hereby (a)
forever fully and irrevocably releases and discharges Buyer, the Company,
each of its respective Subsidiaries, and each of their respective
predecessors, successors, direct or indirect subsidiaries and past and
present stockholders, members, managers, directors, officers, employees,
agents, and other representatives (collectively, the " _Released Parties_ ")
from any and all actions, suits, claims, demands, debts,
agreements, obligations, promises, judgments, or liabilities of any kind
whatsoever in law or equity and causes of action of every kind and nature, or
otherwise (including, claims for damages, costs, expense, and attorneys',
brokers' and accountants fees and expenses) arising out of or related to
events, facts, conditions or circumstances existing or arising prior to the
Closing Date, which the Releasors can, shall or may have against the Released
Parties, whether known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, unanticipated as
well as anticipated (collectively, the " _Released Claims_ "), and (b)
irrevocably agree to refrain from directly or indirectly asserting any claim
or demand or commencing (or causing to be commenced) any Proceeding against
any Released Party based upon any Released Claim. Notwithstanding the
preceding sentence of this _Section 5.4_ , " _Released Claims_ " does not
include, and the provisions of this _Section 5.4_ shall not release or
otherwise diminish, (i) the obligations of any Party set forth in or arising
under any provisions of this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements.

the Closing, the Seller shall take no action to voluntarily enter into
bankruptcy, liquidation or any similar Proceeding or take, or cause to be
taken, any other action which would result in the dissolution of the Seller,

resulting in the Seller's failure to possess and maintain adequate resources
to satisfy its liabilities, contingent or otherwise (including, for the

to the consideration actually received by Seller hereunder.

  



  

(e) With respect to any matter described in _Section 7.1(a)_ , Buyer
Indemnitees must look first to the Representations and Warranties Insurance
Policy for priority of recovery, following which the Buyer Indemnitees may
avail themselves of any other remedy allowed by this Agreement.

  



  

(f) The Buyer Indemnitees shall not be entitled to indemnification
for any Losses to the extent a liability, whether accrued,
contingent, absolute, determined, determinable, or otherwise, with respect to
such Losses was specifically reserved against and reflected on the Financial
Statements as set forth on _Section 3.7(g) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule_, unless such liability exceeds the amount of such reserve (which
reserve must be reasonably apparent to cover such liability as set forth the
Financial Statements), which shall be Seller's responsibility, subject to the
terms of this Agreement. In addition, a Buyer Indemnitee may not
seek indemnification for Losses suffered by it if it has already received
payment for such Losses in a post-Closing adjustment under  _Section 1.8_.

  



  

(g) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, to the extent
that Buyer Indemnitees are seeking indemnification for a breach of the
representation set forth in _Section 3.7(a)_ as it relates to the SeaMobile
Financial Statements and amounts are held pursuant to the MTN Escrow
Agreement securing MTN shareholders' indemnification obligations to the
Company, prior to seeking recourse from Seller, Buyer shall have used its
reasonable best efforts to obtain such amounts from such escrowed funds and,
if it shall have failed to do so, shall agree to assign such claims to
Seller; provided, that, in the event that the members of the
Shareholders' Representative Committee (as defined in the MTN Merger
Agreement) do not provide timely acknowledgement of Buyer's claim and MTN
shareholders' obligations to indemnify Buyer for Losses identified in such
claim with funds held pursuant to the MTN Escrow Agreement, Buyer shall
thereby be deemed to have used its reasonable best efforts and shall not be
required to take any further action prior to seeking recourse from Seller
with respect to such claims.

  



  

7.5 _Limitations on Indemnification by Buyer_.

  



  

(a) With respect to the matters described in _Section 7.2(a)_ ,
Buyer shall have no liability with respect to such matters until
Seller Indemnitees have suffered Losses by reason of all such breaches in
excess of the Threshold, after which point Buyer shall be obligated to
indemnify only with respect to Losses in excess of the Threshold; _provided_ ,
that the foregoing limitations shall not apply in respect of any Losses
relating to (i) breaches of the Buyer Excluded Representations or (ii) any
intentional or fraudulent breach of a representation or warranty.

  



     

(b) With respect to the matters described in _Section 7.2(a)_ , the
aggregate maximum liability of Buyer shall be the Cap; _provided_ , that the
foregoing limitation shall not apply in respect of any Losses relating to (i)
breaches of the Buyer Excluded Representations or (b) any intentional or
fraudulent breach of a representation or warranty.

7.6 _Third-Party Claims; Direct Claims_.

  



  

(a) If a third party initiates a claim, demand, dispute, lawsuit or
arbitration (a " _Third-Party Claim_ ") against any Person (the "
_Indemnified Party_ ") with respect to any matter that the Indemnified Party
may make a claim for indemnification against any Party (the " _Indemnifying
Party_ ") under this _ARTICLE 7_ , then the Indemnified Party must promptly
notify the Indemnifying Party in writing of the existence of such Third-Party
Claim in reasonable detail, and must deliver copies of any documents served
on the Indemnified Party with respect to the Third-Party Claim, and will
indicate the estimated amount, if reasonably practicable, of Losses that has
been or may be sustained by the Indemnified Party; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,
that any failure on the part of an Indemnified Party to so notify an
Indemnifying Party shall not limit any of the obligations of the Indemnifying
Party under this _ARTICLE 7_ (except to the extent such failure materially
prejudices the defense of such proceeding).

  



  

(b) Upon receipt of the notice described in _Section 7.6(a)_ , the
Indemnifying Party shall have the right to defend the Indemnified Party
against the Third-Party Claim with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the
Indemnified Party, provided, that (i) the Indemnifying Party notifies the
Indemnified Party in writing within fifteen (15) days after the Indemnified
Party has given notice of the Third-Party Claim that the Indemnifying Party
shall indemnify the Indemnified Party from and against the entirety of any
Losses the Indemnified Party may suffer resulting from, arising out of,
relating to, in the nature of, or caused by the Third-Party Claim, (ii) the
Indemnifying Party provides the Indemnified Party with evidence reasonably
acceptable to the Indemnified Party that the Indemnifying Party shall have
the financial resources to defend against the Third-Party Claim, (iii) the
Third-Party Claim involves only money damages and does not seek an injunction
or other equitable relief and/or does not involve criminal or quasi-criminal
allegations, alleged violations of any Anti-Fraud and Anti-Corruption Laws,
or an actual or alleged breach of any of the representations in _Section
3.9(c)_ , (iv) settlement of, or an adverse judgment with respect to, the
Third-Party Claim is not, in the good faith judgment of the
Indemnified Party, likely to establish a precedential custom or practice
adverse to the continuing business interests or the reputation of the
Indemnified Party, (v) the Indemnifying Party conducts the defense of the
Third-Party Claim actively and diligently, (vi) the Indemnified Party shall
have been advised by counsel in writing that there is no conflict preventing
the Indemnifying Party from adequately representing the interests of the
Indemnified Party because such interests would be in conflict with those of
the Indemnifying Party, and (vii) the potential Losses involved in such
third-party claim could not reasonably be expected to exceed the Cap. The
Indemnifying Party shall keep the Indemnified Party apprised of all material
developments, including settlement offers, with respect to the Third-Party
Claim and permit the Indemnified Party to participate in the defense of the
Third-Party Claim. So long as the Indemnifying Party is conducting the
defense of the Third-Party Claim in accordance with _Section 7.6(b)_ , the
Indemnifying Party shall not be responsible for any attorneys' fees or other
expenses incurred by the Indemnified Party regarding the defense of the
Third-Party Claim.

  



    

 -63-

 



    



  

(c) In the event that any of the conditions under _Section 7.6(b)_
is or becomes unsatisfied, however, (i) the Indemnified Party may defend
against, and consent to the entry of any judgment on or enter into any
settlement with respect to, the Third-Party Claim in any manner it may
reasonably deem appropriate, (ii) the Indemnifying Parties shall reimburse the
Indemnified Party promptly and periodically for the costs of defending
against the Third-Party Claim (including reasonable attorneys' fees and
expenses) to the extent such defense arises out of any matter that the
Indemnified Party may make a claim for indemnification against any Party, and
(iii) the Indemnifying Parties shall remain responsible for any Losses the
Indemnified Party may suffer caused by any matter for which the Indemnified
Party may make a claim for indemnification against any Party.

  



  

(d) Any claim by an Indemnified Party on account of Losses that does
not result from a Third-Party Claim (a " _Direct Claim_ ") will be asserted
by giving the Indemnifying Party reasonably prompt written notice thereof, but
in any event not later than thirty (30) calendar days after the Indemnified
Party becomes aware of such Direct Claim. Such notice by the Indemnified Party
will describe the Direct Claim in reasonable detail, will include copies of
all available material written evidence thereof, and will indicate the
estimated amount, if reasonably practicable, of Losses that has been or may be
sustained by the Indemnified Party; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that any
failure on the part of an Indemnified Party to so notify an Indemnifying Party
shall not limit any of the obligations of the Indemnifying Party under this
_ARTICLE 7_ (except to the extent such failure materially prejudices the
defense of such proceeding). The Indemnifying Party will have a period of
thirty (30) days within which to respond in writing to such Direct Claim. If
the Indemnifying Party does not so respond within such thirty (30) day period,
the Indemnifying Party will be deemed to have rejected such claim, in which
event the Indemnified Party will be free to pursue such remedies as may
be available to the Indemnified Party at the Indemnifying Party's expense
pursuant to the terms and subject to the provisions of this Agreement.

  



  

(e) No Party shall be obligated to provide indemnification hereunder
if it timely objects to such obligation unless and until a court of competent
jurisdiction has determined that the Party from which indemnification is
sought is liable or responsible for such Losses in a final, non-appealable
judgment, unless otherwise settled by written agreement of the Parties. If the
party seeking indemnification prevails in such matter, it shall be entitled
to collect from the other Party the reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses
it incurred in connection with this _Section 7.6(e)_.

  



  

(f) Except in circumstances described in _Section 7.6(c)_ , neither
the Indemnified Party nor the Indemnifying Party shall consent to the entry
of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to the Third-Party
Claim without the prior written consent of the other party, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

  



  

7.7 _Other Indemnification Matters_. All indemnification payments
under this _ARTICLE 7_ shall be deemed adjustments to the Cash Payment. For
purposes of determining the amount of Losses resulting from misrepresentation
or breach of a representation or warranty, all qualifications or exceptions
in any representation or warranty relating to or referring to the terms
"material", "materiality", "in all material respects", "Company Material
Adverse Effect," "Company Material Adverse Change," "Buyer Material Adverse
Effect" or any similar term or phrase shall be disregarded, it being the
understanding of the Parties that for purposes of determining liability under
this _ARTICLE 7_ , the representations and warranties of the
Parties contained in this Agreement shall be read as if such terms and
phrases were not included in them.

  



    

 -64-

 



    



  

7.8 _Insurance Proceeds_. Any indemnification right herein shall
be reduced by any insurance proceeds actually received by the
Indemnified Party (other than proceeds received pursuant to the
Representations and Warranties Insurance Policy) but net of premiums,
deductions, future premium increases and any other increased insurance costs
as a result of such payment of proceeds.

  



  

7.9 _Mitigation_. The Indemnified Party shall take reasonable
steps to mitigate indemnifiable Losses. In the event that an Indemnified Party
fails to comply with such steps to mitigate, then notwithstanding anything
else to the contrary contained herein, the Indemnifying Party shall not be
required to indemnify the Indemnified Party for any Losses that would have
been avoided if the Indemnified Party had so complied.

  



  

7.10 _No Punitive Damages_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
elsewhere in this Agreement, no party shall, in any event, be liable to any
other Person for any punitive Losses of such other Person, except to the
extent such punitive Losses are actually awarded to such Person in a final
judgment relating to a Third-Party Claim.

  



  

7.11 _Order of Payments; Setoff_. __

  



  

(a) The Parties hereby agree that any obligation of Seller to
indemnify the Buyer Indemnitees for Losses shall be satisfied: first,
from the Indemnity Escrow Account until the funds in such account are
depleted, subject to the provisions of the Escrow Agreement; and thereafter,
at the election of the applicable Buyer Indemnitee but subject to the
limitations set forth in this Agreement, either (1) from the Seller by prompt
cash payment to the Buyer or the appropriate Buyer Indemnitee, (2) by
deduction from the Deferred Consideration Amount payable by the Buyer to
Seller in accordance with Section 1.13 (the " _Set-Off Right_ ") in an amount
equal to the amount of the indemnification claim, or (3) a combination of (1)
and (2).

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 7.11_
and in accordance with _Section 7.4(e)_ , in respect of any
indemnification claim made pursuant to _Section 7.1(a)_ for which coverage
may be available under the Representations and Warranties Insurance Policy,
Buyer Indemnitees must look first to the Representations and Warranties
Insurance Policy for priority of recovery, following which the Buyer
Indemnitees (subject to the limitations set forth in this Agreement) may avail
themselves of the Indemnity Escrow Account, the Set-Off Right and any other
remedy provided by this Agreement.

  



  

(c) In the event that a Buyer Indemnitee elects to exercise its Set-
Off Rights under _Section 7.11(a)_ or _(b)_ , the applicable Buyer Indemnitee
shall deliver a written notice to Seller specifying the specific right of set-
off to be exercised and the amount thereof.

  



    

 -65-

 



    



  

7.12 _Exclusive Remedy_. Subject to the rights of the Buyer
Indemnitees under the Representations and Warranties Insurance Policy, other
than claims for fraud, willful misconduct, criminal misconduct and as
provided in _Section 1.8_ , the indemnification provisions of this _ARTICLE
7_ and _ARTICLE 8_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Indemnified
Parties and their respective Affiliates with respect to claims under, or
otherwise relating to the transactions that are the subject of, this
Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing restrictions, each Party to this
Agreement shall be entitled to bring an action for injunctive or other
equitable relief to enforce the terms of this Agreement in accordance with
_Section 11.10_. To avoid any confusion, the foregoing provisions of this
_Section 7.12_ shall not limit or have any adverse effect on an Indemnified
Party's rights, remedies or recourse under the Escrow Agreement or the Non-
Competition and Non-Solicitation Agreements.

  



  

7.13 _Adjustments for Tax Benefits_. In determining Losses for
purposes of this Agreement, the Parties shall make appropriate adjustments
for Tax Benefits actually realized by the Indemnified Party. For purposes of
this Agreement, a " _Tax Benefit_ " means the reduction of Tax liabilities
(calculated on the basis of the actual reduction in cash payments for Taxes)
resulting from an increase in deductions, losses or tax credits or decrease
in the income, gain or recapture of tax credits that the Indemnified Party or
any subsidiary or other affiliate entity thereof could have reported or taken
into account in such year, net of any Tax cost attributable to the receipt of
any indemnity payment by the Indemnified Party hereunder including, without
limitation, the Tax cost, calculated on a present value basis, of any
reduction in the Indemnified Party's future depreciation or
amortization deductions.

  



  

7.14 _Buyer or Seller Knowledge_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary elsewhere in this Agreement, Buyer and Seller shall not be
liable under this Agreement for any Losses of the other Party based upon or
arising out of, in respect of Losses of Buyer, any inaccuracy in or breach of
any of the representations or warranties of the Company contained in this
Agreement (other than the representations and warranties set forth in
_Section 3.7(e)_ and _Section 3.9(c)_ ), or in respect of Losses of Seller,
any inaccuracy in or breach of any of the representations or warranties of
Buyer contained in this Agreement, to the extent Buyer or Seller,
as applicable, shows that there is reasonable evidence that Buyer or Seller,
as applicable, had actual knowledge of such inaccuracy or breach prior to the
date hereof and that such actual knowledge was obtained through information
disclosed in writing, by Seller not later than two (2) Business Days prior to
the date hereof through the electronic data room entitled "Project
Evolution" hosted by RR Donnelley, or by Buyer prior to the date hereof.

  



  

ARTICLE 8 
  
 TAX MATTERS

  



  

8.1 _Tax Indemnification_. In addition to the indemnification
provisions of _ARTICLE 7_ , except to the extent such Taxes are reflected as
a liability for purposes of calculating Working Capital or included in the
Debt Amount or Morgan Stanley Obligations set forth on the Closing Statement,
the Seller shall be liable for, and shall indemnify and hold Buyer Indemnitees
harmless from: (a) all Taxes imposed on or incurred by the Company and its
Subsidiaries with respect to all Pre-Closing Tax Periods (including that
portion of any Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date, to be determined
in accordance with _Section 8.3_ ), (b) all Taxes incurred by the Company and
its Subsidiaries caused by or resulting from the sale or exchange of the
Interests, and (c) all Taxes of any Person imposed on the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 as a
transferee or successor, by contract or otherwise, which Taxes relate to an
event or transaction occurring before the Closing.

  



  

   

 -66-

 



    



  

8.2 _Tax Periods Ending on or Before the Closing Date_.

     

  



  

(a) Buyer shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, and file, or cause
to be filed, all Tax Returns for the Company and its Subsidiaries (other than
Income Tax Returns) for Tax periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date
that are filed after the Closing Date. Buyer shall provide Seller with copies
of any such Tax Returns for Seller's reasonable review and comment, at least
thirty (30) days prior to the due date thereof. If, within twenty (20) days
after the receipt of the Tax Return, Seller (i) notifies Buyer that it
disputes the manner of preparation of the Tax Return and (ii) provides Buyer
with a statement setting forth in reasonable detail its proposed form of such
Tax Return, then Buyer and Seller shall attempt to resolve their disagreement
within five (5) days following Seller's notification of Buyer of such
disagreement. If Buyer and Seller are not able to resolve their disagreement,
the dispute shall be submitted to the Accountants. The Accountants shall
resolve the disagreement within thirty (30) days after the date on which they
are engaged or as soon as possible thereafter. The determination of the
Accountants shall be binding on the Parties. The cost of the services of the
Accountants shall be borne by the Party whose calculation of the matter in
disagreement differs the most from the calculation as finally determined by
the Accountants. If each of the Party's calculation differs equally from the
calculation as finally determined by the Accountants, then such cost will be
borne half by Seller and half by Buyer. Seller shall pay to Buyer, no later
than five (5) Business Days before the due date for the payment of Taxes with
respect to such Tax Return, all Taxes shown as due thereon, but only to the
extent such Taxes are not reflected as a liability for purposes of
calculating Working Capital or included in the Debt Amount or Morgan Stanley
Obligations set forth on the Closing Statement.

  



  

(b) Seller shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, and Buyer shall
file, or cause to be filed, all Income Tax Returns for the Company and its
Subsidiaries for Tax periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date that are
filed after the Closing Date. Seller shall provide Buyer with copies of any
such Income Tax Returns for Buyer's reasonable review and comment at least
thirty (30) days prior to the due date thereof (giving effect to any
extensions thereto). If, within twenty (20) days after the receipt of the
Income Tax Return, Buyer (i) notifies Seller that it disputes the manner of
preparation of the Income Tax Return and (ii) provides Seller with a
statement setting forth in reasonable detail its proposed form of such Income
Tax Return, then Buyer and Seller shall attempt to resolve their disagreement
within five (5) days following Buyer's notification of Seller of such
disagreement. If Buyer and Seller are not able to resolve their disagreement,
the dispute shall be submitted to the Accountants. The Accountants
shall resolve the disagreement within thirty (30) days after the date on
which they are engaged or as soon as possible thereafter. The determination
of the Accountants shall be binding on the Parties. The cost of the services
of the Accountants shall be borne by the Party whose calculation of the
matter in disagreement differs the most from the calculation as finally
determined by the Accountants. If each of the Party's calculation differs
equally from the calculation as finally determined by the Accountants, then
such cost will be borne half by Seller and half by Buyer. Seller shall pay
all Taxes due with respect to such Income Tax Returns, but only to the extent
such Income Taxes are not reflected as a liability for purposes of calculating
Working Capital or included in the Debt Amount or Morgan Stanley Obligations
set forth on the Closing Statement.

  



  

(c) This  _Section 8.2_ shall not apply to Straddle Period Returns
covered in _Section 8.3_.

  



    

 -67-

 



    



  

8.3 _Tax Periods Beginning Before and Ending After the Closing
Date_. Buyer shall timely prepare, or cause to be prepared, and timely file,
or cause to be filed, all Tax Returns for the Company and its Subsidiaries for
Straddle Periods (the " _Straddle Period Returns_ "). Buyer shall provide
Seller with copies of any Straddle Period Returns at least thirty (30) days
prior to the due date thereof (giving effect to any extensions thereto), in
the case of Income Tax Returns, and as soon as practicable in the case of all
other Tax Returns, accompanied by a statement (the " _Straddle Statement_ ")
setting forth and calculating in reasonable detail the Taxes that relate to
the portion of such Tax period ending on the Closing Date (the " _Pre-
Closing Taxes_ "). If Seller agrees with the Straddle Period Return and
Straddle Statement, Seller shall pay to Buyer, not later than five (5)
Business Days before the due date for the payment of Taxes with respect to
such Straddle Period Return, an amount equal to the Pre-Closing Taxes as
shown on the Straddle Statement, but only to the extent such Taxes are not
reflected as a liability for purposes of calculating Working Capital or
included in the Debt Amount or Morgan Stanley Obligations set forth on the
Closing Statement. If, within twenty (20) days after the receipt of the
Straddle Period Return and Straddle Statement, Seller (i) notifies Buyer that
it disputes the manner of preparation of the Straddle Period Return or the
Pre-Closing Taxes calculated in the Straddle Statement and (ii) provides
Buyer with a statement setting forth in reasonable detail its computation of
the Pre-Closing Taxes and its proposed form of the Straddle Period Return and
Straddle Statement, then Buyer and Seller shall attempt to resolve
their disagreement within five (5) days following Seller's notification of
Buyer of such disagreement. If Buyer and Seller are not able to resolve their
disagreement, the dispute shall be submitted to the Accountants. The
Accountants shall resolve the disagreement within thirty (30) days after the
date on which they are engaged or as soon as possible thereafter. The
determination of the Accountants shall be binding on the Parties. The cost of
the services of the Accountants shall be borne by the Party whose calculation
of the matter in disagreement differs the most from the calculation as
finally determined by the Accountants. If each of the Party's calculation
differs equally from the calculation as finally determined by the Accountants,
then such cost will be borne half by Seller and half by Buyer. For purposes
of this _Section 8.3_ , in the case of any Taxes that are imposed on a
periodic basis and are payable for a Tax period that includes (but does not
end on) the Closing Date, the portion of such Tax that relates to the portion
of such Tax period ending on the Closing Date shall (a) in the case of any
Taxes other than Taxes based upon or related to income, receipts, sales or
payroll be deemed to equal the amount of such Tax for the entire Tax period
multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days in the
Tax period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the
number of days in the entire Tax period, and (b) in the case of any Tax based
upon or related to income, receipts, sales or payroll, be deemed to equal the
amount that would be payable if the relevant Tax period ended on the Closing
Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, or any provision hereof to the contrary,
the Parties acknowledge and agree that, to the maximum extent permitted by
applicable Law, all Tax deductions attributable to payment of the Transaction
Expenses (" _Transaction Expense Deductions_ "), whether paid prior to, at,
or subsequent to Closing, shall be allocated to and reported in a Pre-Closing
Tax Period.

  



    

 -68-

 



    



  

8.4 _Cooperation on Tax Matters_. Buyer and Seller shall
cooperate, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other Party, in
connection with the filing and preparation of Tax Returns pursuant to this
_ARTICLE 8_ and any Proceeding related thereto. Such cooperation shall
include the retention and (upon the other Party's request) the provision of
records and information that are reasonably relevant to any such Proceeding
and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide
additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder.
Buyer and Seller shall retain all books and records with respect to Tax
matters pertinent to the Company and its Subsidiaries relating to any Tax
period beginning before the Closing Date until thirty (30) days after the
expiration of the statute or period of limitations of the respective Tax
periods. Subject to and conditioned on Seller acknowledging in writing its
obligation to indemnify the Buyer Indemnitees pursuant to _Section 8.1_ for
all Taxes ultimately determined to be payable with respect thereto, Seller
shall have the right to control any Proceeding relating to any Pre-
Closing Tax Period, other than a Straddle Period. The Buyer shall have the
right to control any Proceeding relating to a Straddle Period. The Party
controlling any such Proceeding in accordance with the foregoing shall keep
the other Party reasonably informed with respect thereto, and such other
Party shall have the right, but not the obligation, to participate therein, at
the sole cost and expense of such participating Party. The Party controlling
any Proceeding in accordance with the foregoing shall not settle
or compromise any such Proceeding without the prior written consent of the
other Party (i.e., Buyer, on the one hand, or Seller, on the other hand),
which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Any dispute
as to a whether to agree to a compromise or settlement in accordance with the
foregoing may be submitted by either Party to the Accountants for resolution.

  



  

8.5 _Certain Taxes_. All transfer (including real estate
transfer), documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other such Taxes
and fees (including any penalties and interest) incurred in connection with
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid 50% by
Seller and 50% by Buyer, when due, and Seller shall file all necessary Tax
Returns and other documentation with respect to all such transfer,
documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other Taxes and fees, and, if
required by applicable Law, Buyer shall join in the execution of any such Tax
Returns and other documentation.

  



  

8.6 _Amendments, Elections, Etc_. Except to the extent required by
Law, without the consent of Seller (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), Buyer shall not file any
amended Tax Return for the Company or its Subsidiaries with respect to any
Pre-Closing Tax Period, or make any Tax election that would have retroactive
effect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period, in each case which would have the
effect of increasing the amount of Taxes for which Seller is responsible
pursuant to _Section 8.1_ , or reducing the amount of Tax refunds to which
Seller is entitled pursuant to _Section 8.7_.

  



  

8.7 _Tax Refunds_. Except to the extent reflected as an asset for
purposes of calculating Working Capital or reflected as an offset to the Debt
Amount or Morgan Stanley Obligations on the Closing Statement, all refunds of
Taxes (including amounts credited against Taxes otherwise payable) paid by
the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period
(including that portion of any Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date, to
be determined in accordance with _Section 8.3_ ), that are received by Buyer,
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be for the account of Seller and
the amount of such refunds or credits, net of all costs (including Taxes)
imposed on or incurred by Buyer, the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect
to such refund or credit, shall be paid to Seller within fifteen (15) days
after receipt or entitlement thereto. Seller shall have the right, with the
prior written consent of Buyer, which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed, to require that Buyer file amended Tax Returns for
the Company or its Subsidiaries with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period in
order to seek a Tax refund or credit with respect thereto.

11.8 _Governing Law_. This Agreement and any claim, controversy or
dispute arising out of or related to this Agreement, any of the transactions
contemplated hereby, the relationship of the parties, and/or the
interpretation and enforcement of the rights and duties of the parties,
whether arising in contract, tort, equity or otherwise , shall be governed by
and construed in accordance with the domestic Laws of the State of Delaware
(including in respect of the statute of limitations or other limitations
period applicable to any such claim, controversy or dispute), without giving
effect to any choice or conflict of Law provision or rule (whether of the
State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application
of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Parties acknowledge and
irrevocably agree that any claim, controversy or dispute, whether in law or in
equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, involving any Credit
Facility Source arising out of, or relating to, the transactions
contemplated hereby, the Company Credit Facility Amendments or other Company
Credit Facility Documents, or the performance of services thereunder or
related thereto shall, except as expressly provided otherwise in the Company
Credit Facility Document, be governed by, and construed in accordance with,
the laws of the State of New York, without regard to the conflicts of
law rules of such State that would result in the application of the laws of
any other State.

  



  

11.9 _Amendments and Waivers_. No amendment of any provision of this
Agreement shall be valid unless the same shall be in writing and signed by
the Parties. No waiver by any Party of any provision of this Agreement or any
default, misrepresentation, or breach of warranty or covenant hereunder,
whether intentional or not, shall be valid unless the same shall be in writing
and signed by the Party making such waiver nor shall such waiver be deemed to
extend to any prior or subsequent default, misrepresentation, or breach of
warranty or covenant hereunder or affect in any way any rights arising by
virtue of any prior or subsequent such occurrence; _provided_ ,  _further_ ,
that no amendment, modification, consent, supplement or waiver to any of
_Sections 4.10(d)_ , _11.2_ ,  _11.8_ , this Section 11.9, _11.17_ and/or

11.10 _Injunctive Relief_.

  



  

(a) The Parties hereby agree that, in the event of breach of this
Agreement, damages would be difficult, if not impossible, to ascertain, that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were
otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that, in addition to and without
limiting any other remedy or right it may have, subject to _Section 11.10(b)_
, any Party shall be entitled to an injunction or other equitable relief in
any court of competent jurisdiction, without any necessity of proving damages
or any requirement for the posting of a bond or other security, enjoining any
such breach, and enforcing specifically the terms and provisions. Each Party
hereby waives any and all defenses it may have on the ground of lack of
jurisdiction or competence of the court to grant such an injunction or other
equitable relief.

  



    

 -92-

 



    



  

(b) Notwithstanding anything in _Section 11.10(a)_ or any other
provision in this Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall Seller or any
holders of membership or other equity interests of Seller (or, in each case,
any of their Affiliates or former, current and future
representatives, members, stockholders, partners, Affiliates and assignees
and each former, current or future representative, member,
stockholder, partner, Affiliate or assignee of any of the foregoing), be
entitled to the remedy of any injunction or other equitable relief to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, other than the Company's
right to such equitable relief in the instance that (i) all of the conditions
precedent under _Section 6.1_ shall have been satisfied (other than those
conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing), and (ii)
Seller shall have irrevocably confirmed in writing to Buyer that it is ready,
willing and able to effect the Closing. In no event shall Seller or any
holders of membership or other equity interests of Seller (or, in each case,
any of their Affiliates or former, current and future representatives,
members, stockholders, partners, Affiliates and assignees and each former,
current or future representative, member, stockholder, partner, Affiliate or
assignee of any of the foregoing) be entitled to the remedy of specific
performance of this Agreement prior to Closing other than solely under the
specific circumstances and as specifically set forth in this _Section
11.10(b)_.

  



  

11.11 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement that
is invalid or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions
hereof or the validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision
in any other situation or in any other jurisdiction.

  



  

11.12 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this
Agreement, each Party shall bear its own costs and expenses (including legal
fees and expenses) incurred in connection with this Agreement and the

of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any Party by virtue of the
authorship of any of the provisions of this Agreement. Any reference to any
Law shall be deemed also to refer to all rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder, unless the context requires otherwise. The word "including" shall

11.15 _Schedules_. Nothing in the schedules hereto shall be deemed
adequate to disclose an exception to a representation or warranty made herein
unless the schedule identifies the exception with reasonable particularity.
The Parties intend that each representation, warranty, and covenant contained
herein shall have independent significance. If any Party has breached any
representation, warranty or covenant contained herein in any respect, the
fact that there exists another representation, warranty or covenant relating
to the same subject matter (regardless of the relative levels of specificity)
which the Party has not breached shall not detract from or mitigate the fact
that the Party is in breach of the first representation, warranty, or
covenant. Unless the context requires otherwise, (a) the information
contained in the Company Disclosure Schedule is disclosed solely for the
purposes of this Agreement, and no information contained in any Section of
the Company Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to be an admission by any
party hereto to any third Person of any matter whatsoever, including an
admission of any violation of any Laws or breach of any agreement, (b)
information contained in a Section or subsection of the Company Disclosure
Schedule (or expressly incorporated therein) shall qualify the
representations and warranties made in the identically numbered Section or,
if applicable, subsection of this Agreement and all other representations and
warranties made in any other Section, subsection or Schedule solely to the
extent reasonably apparent on the face of such information, (c) references to
agreements in the Schedules are not intended to be a full description of such
agreements, and all such disclosed agreements should be read in their
entirety, and (d) nothing disclosed in any Schedule is intended to broaden any
representation or warranty contained in _ARTICLE 3_.

BASED UPON OR ARISING OUT OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT (INCLUDING, WITHOUT
LIMITATION, THE COMPANY CREDIT FACILITY DOCUMENTS) IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING
OR OTHER LITIGATION OF ANY TYPE BROUGHT BY ANY OF THE PARTIES AGAINST ANY
OTHER PARTY OR ANY AFFILIATE OF ANY OTHER SUCH PARTY, WHETHER WITH RESPECT TO
CONTRACT CLAIMS, TORT CLAIMS OR OTHERWISE (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, IN
ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM AGAINST ANY CREDIT FACILITY SOURCE).
THE PARTIES AGREE THAT ANY SUCH CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION SHALL BE TRIED BY A
COURT TRIAL WITHOUT A JURY. WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, THE PARTIES
FURTHER AGREE THAT THEIR RESPECTIVE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IS WAIVED BY
OPERATION OF THIS SECTION AS TO ANY ACTION, COUNTERCLAIM OR OTHER PROCEEDING
WHICH SEEKS, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, TO CHALLENGE THE VALIDITY OR ENFORCEABILITY
OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY PROVISION HEREOF. THIS WAIVER SHALL APPLY TO
ANY SUBSEQUENT AMENDMENTS, RENEWALS, SUPPLEMENTS OR MODIFICATIONS TO THIS
AGREEMENT.

11.18 _Legal Representation_.

  



  

 (a) Buyer, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Company and its Subsidiaries) acknowledges and agrees that DLA Piper LLP (US) (" _DLA Piper_ ") has acted as counsel for Seller, the Common Shareholders and the Company in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (the " _Acquisition Engagement_ "), and in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, DLA Piper has not acted as counsel for any other Person, including Buyer.

  



  

   

 -95-

 



    



  

 (b) Buyer, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates (including after the Closing, the Company and its Subsidiaries), acknowledges and agrees that all confidential communications occurring prior to the Closing between Seller, the Common Shareholders, the Company and their respective Affiliates, on the one hand, and DLA Piper, on the other hand, solely as it relates to the Acquisition Engagement, and any attendant attorney-client privilege, attorney work product protection, and expectation of client confidentiality applicable thereto (the " _Protected Information_ "), shall be deemed to belong solely to Seller, the Common Shareholders and their Affiliates (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries), and not to the Company or its Subsidiaries, and shall not pass to or be claimed, held, or used by Buyer or the Company or its Subsidiaries upon or after the Closing; _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing acknowledgment of retention shall not extend to any communications not related to the Acquisition Engagement. DLA Piper shall not disclose any Protected Information to any third parties (other than representatives, accountants and advisors of Seller, the Common Shareholders and their Affiliates so long as such representatives, accountants and advisors are instructed to maintain the confidence of such attorney-client communications) without the prior written consent of Buyer. Except in connection with any third-party claim or any claim not between Buyer on the one hand and the Common Shareholders on the other hand (in which event DLA Piper, Seller and the Common Shareholders shall (i) provide Buyer and its representatives reasonable access at reasonable times, upon prior written notice and during normal business hours, to the Protected Information, and (ii) furnish Buyer and its representatives with copies of all such Protected Information as Buyer may reasonably request), Buyer, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates (including after the Closing, the Company and its Subsidiaries) irrevocably waives any right it may have to discover or obtain Protected Information, to the extent that such Protected Information was subject to an attorney-client privilege, work product protection or other expectation of confidentiality owed to the Common Shareholders and/or their Affiliates. If, following the Closing, any legal counsel for Buyer, the Company or any of the Company's Subsidiaries discovers or is made aware of any Protected Information which is contained in the records or information systems of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, none of Seller or the Common Shareholders nor any of their respective Affiliates or legal counsel shall use such discovery or knowledge as a basis for claiming any conflict of interest on the part of Buyer, the Company or such Subsidiary's legal counsel or for any claim seeking to disqualify any legal counsel from representing Buyer or the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in any dispute or Proceeding to which Buyer, the Company or such Subsidiary is a party.

     



  

(c) From and after the Closing, the Company and its Subsidiaries
shall have no attorney-client relationship with DLA Piper, unless and to the
extent DLA Piper is expressly engaged in writing by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to represent the Company or any of its Subsidiaries after the
Closing.

  



  

(d) In any dispute or Proceeding arising after the Closing under or
in connection with this Agreement, Seller, the Company and Buyer agree that
Seller and the Common Shareholders shall have the right, at their election, to
retain DLA Piper to represent Seller and such Common Shareholders in such
matter, and Seller, the Company and Buyer hereby waive and consent to any such
representation in any such matter.

EXHIBIT A

  



  

FORM OF SUPPORT AGREEMENT AND RELEASE

  



  

This Support Agreement and Release (this "Support Agreement") is being
executed and delivered as of May 9, 2016, by EMC Acquisition Holdings, LLC, a
Delaware limited liability company ("Seller") and the undersigned members of
Seller holding that number of shares of Class A Units set forth on Schedule A
attached hereto (collectively, the "Holders"), in favor of Global Eagle
Entertainment Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Buyer"). Capitalized terms used
but not defined herein shall have the meanings given to them in the Purchase
Agreement (as hereinafter defined).

  



  

WHEREAS, Buyer and Seller have entered into that certain Interest Purchase
Agreement dated as of the date hereof (the "Purchase Agreement"), pursuant to
which Buyer has agreed to acquire from Seller and Seller has agreed to sell to
Buyer all of the issued and outstanding membership interests of EMC
Intermediate, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the "Company");

  



  

WHEREAS, the Holders are members of Seller and, as such, will benefit from
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement;

  



  

WHEREAS, pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, Seller has agreed, on the terms
and subject to the conditions contained in Article 7 thereof, to
certain indemnification obligations in favor of the Buyer Indemnitees
("Indemnification Obligations"); and

  



  

WHEREAS, as a material inducement for Buyer to consummate the transactions
contemplated by the Purchase Agreement, pursuant to which the Holders as
Common Shareholders will receive a portion of the Consideration, Buyer has
required that the Holders enter into this Support Agreement for its benefit
and for the benefit of the Releasees (as hereinafter defined), pursuant to
which the Holders shall support Seller's Indemnification Obligations under
the Purchase Agreement.

  



  

Now, Therefore, in consideration of the substantial direct and indirect
benefits to be derived by the Holders in connection with the transactions
contemplated by the Purchase Agreement (including the Consideration payable
thereunder) and the mutual covenants and agreements contained herein and in
the Purchase Agreement and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt
and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto (each, a
" _Party_ " and, collectively, the " _Parties_ ") hereby agree as follows:

  



   | 1.| _Consent_. Each Holder acknowledges and agrees that it has
received a copy of the Purchase Agreement and has reviewed the terms thereof.
By executing this Support Agreement, without any further action, each Holder
hereby approves and consents to, and waives any and all rights it may have to
object to, the Purchase Agreement or any transactions contemplated
thereunder, including the terms and conditions thereof and the Consideration
to be paid by Buyer in connection therewith, including, without limitation
(a) the terms of the Purchase Agreement set out in Article 2 therein and (b)
the establishment of the Escrow Accounts under the Escrow Agreement and the
provision thereof (including without limitation, the payment of a portion of
the Consideration to the Escrow Account that would otherwise be payable to the
Holders). No Holder shall revoke or rescind the approval and consent granted
hereby in any respect prior to, if applicable, the termination of the
Purchase Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1 thereof. In connection with and
conditioned upon the Closing, and provided that a Holder has signed and
returned this Support Agreement to Seller, Seller hereby agrees to distribute
to such undersigned Holder such Holder's allocable portion of the
Consideration pursuant to Seller's LLC Agreement, as and when paid to
Seller by Buyer in accordance with the Purchase Agreement and in the amounts
set forth on _Schedule B_ attached hereto (the "Consideration Share"), which
shall contain, calculated as of the Closing, the following (or, with respect
to the Cash Payment, Buyer Shares, Indemnity Escrow Amount and Adjustment
Escrow Amount, reasonable estimates thereof given an assumed Closing Date and
reasonable assumptions regarding Cash, Debt and Working Capital at Closing):
the name of each Holder, the number of Common Shares held by each Holder and
the portion of the Cash Payment, Buyer Shares, Indemnity Escrow Amount,
Adjustment Escrow Amount allocable to each Holder.  
---|---|--- 
    



 



    



   | 2.| _Contribution_. From and after the Closing, and subject to the
provisions set forth in the Purchase Agreement, each Holder shall agree to
make any necessary contributions (but expressly limited to proceeds actually
received by such Holder) to fund the Indemnification Obligations under the
Purchase Agreement (such, a "Contribution Obligation"). Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, nothing herein shall itself
change, amend, limit, extend or alter (nor shall it be deemed or construed as
changing, amending, limiting, extending or altering) Seller's Indemnification
Obligations under the Purchase Agreement in any manner whatsoever.  
---|---|--- 
  



   | 3.| _Limitation of Obligation_. Each Holder's Contribution
Obligation shall be limited to payment by such Holder of an aggregate cash
amount not exceeding an amount (the "Contribution Cap") equal to the
aggregate amount of the Cash Payment directly distributed or otherwise paid
and/or provided to such Holder from the Consideration.  
---|---|--- 
  



   | 4.| _Release_. Subject to _Section 5_ hereof, each Holder, on
behalf of himself, herself or itself, his or her heirs, beneficiaries,
executors, administrators, legal representatives and trusts, his, her or its
successors and assigns and each Person that is directly or indirectly, through
one or more intermediaries, controlled by such Holder and each Person that
has the ability to assert a claim on behalf of or through him, her or it
(collectively, the "Releasing Persons"), hereby absolutely and
unconditionally releases, waives and forever discharges to the fullest extent
permitted by law each of Seller, Buyer and the Company and each of their
respective Subsidiaries, respective past, present and future officers,
managers, directors, shareholders, partners, members, Affiliates (in each case
other than the Holders), employees, counsel and agents and related entities
(collectively, the "Releasees," and each a "Releasee") of and from any and
all claims, demands, suits, actions, arbitrations, audits, hearings,
investigations, litigation, causes of action, liabilities, debts, sums of
money, accounts, bonds, bills, rights, covenants, contracts, obligations,
controversies, entitlements, agreements, promises, damages, benefits, awards,
decisions, injunctions, orders, rulings, subpoenas, verdicts and judgments
whatsoever, whether state or federal, in law or in equity, known or unknown,
asserted or unasserted, suspected or unsuspected, liquidated or unliquidated,
absolute or contingent, which the Releasing Persons ever had, may now have or
hereafter have or claim to have against any Releasee for, upon, relating to,
arising out of, based in whole or in part upon, or by reason of (the
"Release"):  
---|---|--- 
  



   | a.| The ownership (or any claimed ownership) by such Holder (direct
or indirect) at any time at or before the effective time of the Closing of any
equity interest of Seller or any of its predecessor entities (by merger,
asset purchase or otherwise), or any other equity interest or right to
purchase an equity interest in Seller, such Holder's status as a member of
Seller at any time at or before the effective time of the Closing, or
such Holder's status (if any) as a party at any time at or before the
effective time of the Closing to any contract or agreement with Seller or its
Affiliates, in each case arising out of any act or omission occurring at any
time at or before the effective time of the Closing.  
---|---|--- 
  



  

   

2

 



    



   | b.| Such Holder's status as an officer, director, manager, employee
or consultant of Seller, its Subsidiaries or their Affiliates at any time at

result of any action or inaction by Seller or its Subsidiaries at any time at
or before the effective time of the Closing.  
---|---|--- 
     



   | c.| Any matter, cause, event or condition, or action or inaction of
any Releasee, occurring or existing at any time at or before the effective
time of the Closing, in each case whether or not relating to any claims
pending on, or asserted after, the Closing Date.  
---|---|--- 
  



  

Each Holder acknowledges and agrees that it has received, or has had the
opportunity to receive, independent legal advice regarding the Release set
forth herein and hereby assumes full responsibility for any damages, losses
or liabilities it may hereunder incur by reason of such Release.

  



   | 5.| _Limitations on Release_. Notwithstanding any other provision
hereof, the Release will not limit, reduce or otherwise affect (a) any right
or remedy of a Holder with respect to such Holder's right to receive the
Consideration with respect to such Holder's Common Shares pursuant to the
terms and subject to the conditions applicable thereto in the Purchase
Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement; (b) if such Holder is an
officer, director or employee or Seller or any of its Subsidiaries, any
rights of indemnification of, expense advancement, contribution or insurance
coverage or protection to such Holder that such Holder is entitled to pursuant
to an agreement to which Seller is party as of immediately prior to Closing
or (c) if such Holder is an employee of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries, any
accrued but unpaid portion of such Holder's salary and benefits (including
accrued vacation) that such Holder is entitled to receive as of the effective
time of the Closing. Each Holder represents and warrants that, as of the date
of this Support Agreement, such Holder has not assigned or transferred, or
purported to assign or transfer, any of the Released Claims.  
---|---|--- 
  



   | 6.| _Confidentiality_. _ _Each Holder hereby agrees to
refrain from disclosing any Confidential Information (as defined below) or
using any Confidential Information other than in connection with the
consummation of the Purchase Agreement and Transaction, and shall deliver
promptly to the Company or destroy, at the request and option of the Company,
all tangible embodiments (and all copies) of the Confidential
Information which are in its possession. In the event that any Holder is
requested or required (by oral question or request for information or
documents in any legal proceeding, interrogatory, subpoena, civil
investigative demand or similar process) to disclose any Confidential
Information, such Holder will notify the Company promptly of the request or
requirement so that the Company may seek an appropriate protective order or
waive compliance with the provisions of this _Section 6_. If, in the absence
of a protective order or the receipt of a waiver hereunder, such Holder is,
on the advice of counsel, compelled to disclose any Confidential
Information to any tribunal or else stand liable for contempt, such Holder
may disclose the Confidential Information to the tribunal; provided, however,
that such Holder shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, at
the request and the expense of the Company, an order or other assurance that
confidential treatment will be accorded to such portion of the Confidential
Information required to be disclosed as the Company shall designate. The
foregoing provisions shall not apply to any Confidential Information which is
generally available to the public immediately prior to the time of disclosure.
For purposes hereof, " _Confidential Information_ " shall mean any
information concerning the businesses and affairs of the Company and its
Subsidiaries and Affiliates that is not already generally available to the
public. The provisions of this _Section 6_ shall survive the Closing.

   | a.| _Organization_. Such Holder (if other than a natural person) is
duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
jurisdiction of such Holder's organization. Such Holder possesses all

loss to the Seller or Buyer was caused by Escrow Agent's gross negligence or
willful misconduct.

further act or consent of any Party.  
---|---|--- 
  



   | (b)| The Parties shall have the power at any time by mutual consent
to remove (with or without cause) Escrow Agent upon five (5) days' prior
written notice of such removal to Escrow Agent. Such removal shall take
effect upon transmission of all records pertaining to the Escrow Funds in the
possession of Escrow Agent and payment of all Escrow Funds to a successor
escrow agent designated in a Joint Written Direction. Escrow Agent

   | 8.| _Liability of Escrow Agent_.  
---|---|--- 
  



   | (a)| Escrow Agent shall not be liable to Seller or Buyer for any
action taken or omitted by Escrow Agent with respect to the Escrow Funds

the fraud, bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct of Escrow Agent
or the material breach of this Agreement by Escrow Agent was the cause of any
Loss to Seller or Buyer. Escrow Agent's sole responsibility shall be for the
safekeeping, disposition, investment and disbursement of the Escrow Funds in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Escrow Agent shall have no
implied duties or obligations and shall not be charged with knowledge or
notice of any fact or circumstance not specifically set forth herein. Escrow
Agent may rely upon any notice, instruction (including a Joint Written
Direction (such as a wire transfer instruction)), request, order, judgment,
certification, opinion or advice of counsel (including counsel chosen by
Escrow Agent), statement, demand or other instrument or document, not only as
to its due execution, validity (including the authority of the Person signing
or presenting the same) and effectiveness, but also as to the truth and
accuracy of any information contained therein, which Escrow Agent shall
believe in good faith to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by
the Person or parties purporting to sign the same. In no event shall Escrow
Agent be liable for incidental, indirect, special, consequential or punitive
damages of any kind whatsoever (including lost profits), even if Escrow Agent
has been advised of the likelihood of such loss or damage and regardless of
the form of action.  
---|---|---

   | (b)| Escrow Agent shall not be obligated to take any legal action or
commence any proceeding in connection with the Escrow Funds, any account in
which the Escrow Funds are deposited, this Agreement or the Purchase
Agreement, or to appear in, prosecute or defend any such legal action or
proceeding. Escrow Agent may consult legal counsel selected by Escrow Agent
in the event of any dispute or question as to the construction of any of the
provisions hereof or of its duties hereunder, or relating to any dispute or
question involving any party hereto.  
---|---|--- 
  



   | (c)| Escrow Agent is authorized, in its sole discretion, to comply
with orders issued or process entered by any court with respect to the Escrow
Funds, without determination by Escrow Agent of such court's jurisdiction in
the matter. If any portion of the Escrow Funds is at any time attached,
garnished or levied upon under any Court Order, or in case the payment,
assignment, transfer, conveyance or delivery of any such Escrow Funds
shall be stayed or enjoined by any Court Order, or in case any order,
judgment or decree shall be made or entered by any court affecting such
Escrow Funds or any part thereof, then and in any such event, Escrow Agent is
authorized, in its sole discretion, to rely upon and comply with any such
order, writ, judgment or decree which it is advised by legal counsel selected
by Escrow Agent is binding upon it without the need for appeal or other
action; and if Escrow Agent complies with any such order, writ, judgment or
decree, it shall not be liable to any of the Parties by reason of such
compliance even though such order, writ, judgment or decree may be
subsequently reversed, modified, annulled, set aside or vacated.

---|---|--- 
  



   | (a)| If notices, instructions (pursuant to a Joint Written Direction
or otherwise), approvals, consents, requests, or other communications in any
way related to the transfer or distribution of the Escrow Funds are received
by Escrow Agent as set forth in _Section 14_ , Escrow Agent is authorized, but
not required, to seek prompt confirmation of such communications by telephone
call-back to the sending Authorized Representative or
Authorized Representatives' telephone number(s) as set forth in _Schedule B_
, and Escrow Agent may rely upon the confirmation of anyone purporting to be
that Authorized Representative. The persons designated as Authorized
Representatives in _Schedule B_ hereto and their telephone numbers may be
changed only in a writing executed by Authorized Representatives or other
duly authorized officer of the applicable Party and actually received and
acknowledged by Escrow Agent and delivered in accordance with _Section 14_
above and, if applicable, this _Section 15_. If Escrow Agent is unable to
contact any such Authorized Representative, Escrow Agent is hereby authorized
(but not required) both to receive written instructions from and seek
confirmation of such instructions by telephone call-back to any one or more
of Seller's or Buyer's executive officers (each, an " _Executive Officer_ "),
as the case may be, who shall include individuals holding titles of Chief
Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, General Counsel and Vice
President or more senior thereto, as Escrow Agent may select. Such
Executive Officer(s) shall deliver to Escrow Agent a fully executed
incumbency certificate upon Escrow Agent's request, and Escrow Agent may rely
upon the confirmation of anyone purporting to be any such Executive
Officer(s). The Parties acknowledge and agree that the security procedures
set forth above are commercially reasonable.

account numbers or similar identifying numbers provided by a Party or the
Parties and confirmed by an Authorized Representative to identify (i) a
beneficiary, (ii) a beneficiary's bank, or (iii) an intermediary bank. Escrow
Agent may apply any of the Escrow Funds for any payment order Escrow Agent
executes using any such identifying number, even where Escrow Agent's use may
result in a Person other than a beneficiary being paid, or the transfer of
funds to a bank other than a beneficiary\'s bank or an intermediary bank
designated.

   | 16.| _Amendments and Waivers_. No amendment of any provision of this
Agreement shall be valid unless the same shall be in writing and signed by the

hereunder, whether intentional or not, shall be valid unless the same shall
be in writing and signed by the party making such waiver nor shall

misrepresentation, or breach of warranty or covenant hereunder or affect in
any way any rights arising by virtue of any prior or subsequent such
occurrence.

other situation or in any other jurisdiction.  
---|---|--- 
  



   | 18.| _Governing Law_. This Agreement and any claim, controversy or
dispute arising out of or related to this Agreement, any of the transactions
contemplated hereby, the relationship of the parties hereto, and/or the

whether arising in contract, tort, equity or otherwise, shall be governed by
and construed in accordance with the domestic laws of the State of Delaware
(including in respect of the statute of limitations or other limitations
period applicable to any such claim, controversy or dispute), without giving
effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the
State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application
of the laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.  
---|---|--- 
  



   | 19.| _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement and the Purchase Agreement
constitute the entire agreement among the parties hereto and supersedes any
prior understandings, agreements, or representations by or among the parties
hereto, written or oral, to the extent they relate in any way to the subject

   | 20.| _Succession and Assignment_. This Agreement shall be binding
upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns. No party hereto may assign either this
Agreement or any of its rights, interests, or obligations hereunder without
the prior written approval of the other parties; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that Buyer may (a) assign any or all of its rights and interests hereunder to
one or more of its Affiliates and designate one or more of its Affiliates to

obligations hereunder), (b) assign its rights under this Agreement for

Agreement to any Person that acquires Buyer, the Company or any of its
assets.

or employee of Escrow Agent may buy, sell, and deal in any of the securities
of Seller or Buyer and become pecuniarily interested in any transaction in
which Seller or Buyer may be interested, and contract and lend money to Seller
or Buyer and otherwise act as fully and freely as though it were not Escrow
Agent under this Agreement. Nothing herein shall preclude Escrow Agent
from acting in any other capacity for Seller or Buyer or for any other
entity.  
---|---|--- 
  



   | 24.| _Currency_. The currency applicable to any amount payable or
receivable under this Agreement is United States dollars.  
---|---|--- 
  



   | 25.| _Late Payment_. If any amount due to Escrow Agent under this
Agreement is not paid within thirty (30) days (subject to any longer time
period prescribed herein) after written notice to Seller and Buyer (other
than any amount that is subject to good faith dispute), Seller and Buyer
jointly and severally shall pay interest thereon (from the due date to the
payment date) at a per annum rate equal to ten percent (10%). If, due to the
joint and several nature of the indemnification obligations of Buyer and
Seller, Buyer is obligated to indemnify Escrow Agent in an amount that is
more than its fifty percent (50%) share of any such liability, then Buyer may,
as one source of recovery and without limitation of its other rights and
remedies, recover such excess amount from the Escrow Funds provided that
Seller and Buyer execute a Joint Written Direction, or such other
documentation as Escrow Agent may reasonably require, instructing Escrow Agent
to release such excess amount from the Escrow Funds to Buyer.

(including strikes), war, civil unrest, fire, floods, electrical outages,
equipment or transmission failures, internet interruption, vendor
failures (including information technology providers), and other similar
causes.

   | 28.| _Construction_. The parties hereto have participated jointly in
the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or
question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be
construed as if drafted jointly by the parties hereto and no presumption or
burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of

Agreement and those of the Purchase Agreement, (i) with respect to any

 _Confidentiality_. The Restricted Party, on behalf of the Restricted Party
and the other members of the Restricted Party Group, shall not, and shall
cause each of the other members of the Restricted Party Group and his or hers
and their respective representatives not to, directly or indirectly,
disclose, reveal, release, divulge or communicate to any Person other than
authorized representatives of the Affiliated Companies or use or otherwise
exploit for the benefit of the Restricted Party or any other Person (other
than any of the Affiliated Companies) any and all information and data in
whatever form, tangible or intangible, whether written or oral, that concerns
or relates to in any way to the Business of the Affiliated Companies,
including all confidential and proprietary information, research, designs,
customer lists, details of customer, vendor or supplier contracts, pricing
policies, operational methods, marketing plans or strategies, customer
profiles, materials prepared for customers, financial information, product
development techniques or plans, business acquisition plans, personnel
information and other business affairs relating to the Business
(collectively, the " _Confidential Information_ "); _provided_ , _however_ ,
_that_ , notwithstanding the foregoing, it is acknowledged and agreed that
the Restricted Party may disclose Confidential Information to any Governmental
Body, but only to the extent required by applicable Law, _provided_ that in
such event the Restricted Party shall provide as much prior notice as
possible of such disclosure to Buyer and the Company, exercise all
commercially reasonable efforts to preserve the confidentiality of the
Confidential Information, including reasonably cooperating with Buyer and the
Company (at Buyer's sole expense) to obtain an appropriate order or other
reliable assurance that confidential treatment shall be accorded such
information or data by such Governmental Body and shall disclose only that
portion of the Confidential Information which the Restricted Party is
legally required to disclose. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
confidentiality provisions of this _Section 3(c)_ shall not apply to any
Confidential Information which has been, is, or will be generally available to
the public other than as a result of a disclosure in violation of this
Agreement, of the Purchase Agreement or of any other Non-Competition and Non-
Solicitation Agreement entered into by the other Restricted Parties in
connection with the Closing.

  



  

 _Rights and Remedies Upon Breach_. 

  

 _ _

  

 _Equitable Remedies_. The Parties hereby agree that, in the event of breach
of this Agreement by any member of the Restricted Party Group (including the
Restricted Party), including any of the provisions of _Section 3_
(collectively, the " _Restrictive Covenants_ "), damages would be difficult,
if not impossible, to ascertain, that irreparable damage would occur in the
event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is
accordingly agreed that, in addition to and without limiting any other remedy
or right it may have, each of Buyer and the Company shall be entitled to an
injunction or other equitable relief in any court of competent jurisdiction,
without any necessity of proving damages or any requirement for the posting
of a bond or other security, enjoining any such breach, and enforcing
specifically the terms and provisions. The Restricted Party on behalf of the
Restricted Party and the other members of the Restricted Party Group,
hereby waives any and all defenses any member of the Restricted Party Group
may have on the ground of lack of jurisdiction or competence of the court to
grant such an injunction or other equitable relief. The Restricted Period
under _Sections 3(a)_ and _3(b)_  shall be extended by the number of days in
which the member of the Restricted Party Group is in violation or breach of
this Agreement. The covenants in this Agreement are independent, and the
existence of any claim or cause of action of any member of the
Restricted Party Group against Buyer or the Company, whether predicated on
this Agreement or otherwise, shall not constitute a defense to the
enforcement of this Agreement by Buyer and the Company.

  



  

(b) _Accounting_. Buyer and the Company shall be entitled to seek
to require the Restricted Party to account for and pay over to Buyer and the
Company all compensation, profits, monies, accruals, increments or other
benefits derived or received by any member of the Restricted Party Group as
the result of any transactions, events, circumstances or occurrences
constituting a violation or breach of or failure to perform obligations under
this Agreement by any member of the Restricted Party Group, including any of
the Restrictive Covenants.

  



    

 4

 



    



  

(c) _Remedies Cumulative_. All rights and remedies of Buyer and the
Company under this Agreement shall be cumulative and in addition to, and not
in lieu of, any other rights and remedies available to Buyer and the Company
under Law or in equity.

  



  

 _Other Obligations_. The terms of this Agreement supplement and do not
replace any other agreements to which any member of the Restricted Party Group
may be a party or other obligations any member of the Restricted Party Group
may have under laws regarding confidentiality, non-disclosure, assignment of
inventions, or the protection of intellectual property, including any
employment agreement, consulting agreement or offer letter between any member
of the Restricted Party Group and any of the Affiliated Companies or any
agreement between any member of the Restricted Party Group and any of the
Affiliated Companies.

  



  

 _Warranty and Freedom to Contract_. The Restricted Party represents and
warrants to Buyer and the Company that (a) none of the Restricted Party or any
other member of the Restricted Party Group is under legal disability and (b)
there are no restrictions, agreements or understandings, oral or written, to
which the Restricted Party or any other member of the Restricted Party Group
is a party or by which the Restricted Party or any other member of the
Restricted Party Group is bound, in either case, that prevents or makes
unlawful the Restricted Party's execution and delivery of this Agreement or
performance of the terms and conditions of this Agreement to their
fullest extent.

  



  

 _Terms of this Agreement; Right to Separate Counsel_. The Restricted Party
represents and warrants to Buyer and the Company that (a) the Restricted Party
has carefully read all of the terms and conditions hereof and agrees they are
necessary for the reasonable and proper protection of Buyer's investment in
the Business and the Business, (b) Buyer was materially induced to enter into
the Purchase Agreement by the Restricted Party's representation that the
Restricted Party will abide by and be bound by each of the covenants and
restraints contained herein, and (c) each and every covenant, restraint,
limitation or other provision in this Agreement is reasonable in all
respects, including the time period, geographic scope, subject matters and
legal remedies of Buyer and the Company pertaining thereto. Without limiting
the foregoing, the Restricted Party represents and warrants that the duration,
breadth and geographic scope of the Restrictive Covenants are reasonable and
necessary in order to protect the value of the Business acquired by Buyer. In
light of the foregoing, the Restricted Party acknowledges and agrees that (i)
this Agreement, including the Restrictive Covenants, does not impose any
undue hardship or unreasonable limitation on any of the members of the
Restricted Party Group, (ii) this Agreement is no broader than reasonably
necessary to afford Affiliated Companies with their legitimate desired
protection and (iii) the potential harm to the Affiliated Companies of the
non-enforcement of the Restrictive Covenants outweighs any potential harm to
the members of the Restricted Party Group of their enforcement by injunction
or otherwise. The Restricted Party acknowledges that the Restricted Party has
been advised by Buyer and the Company that the Restricted Party is entitled to
have this Agreement reviewed by counsel of the Restricted Party's choice, and
has done so.

  



    

 5

 



    



  

 _Consideration_. This Agreement is executed in connection with, and as a
condition of, the Purchase Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated thereby. The Restricted Party acknowledges and agrees that the
Affiliated Companies have a legitimate business interest in the protection of
the Business, including the goodwill associated with the Restricted Party's
specialized expertise and detailed knowledge of the nature and integral
operations of the Business and other confidential information relating
thereto, and, as such, the Restricted Party acknowledges receipt of adequate
consideration to execute and be bound by this Agreement for the benefit
of the Affiliated Companies. The Restricted Party further acknowledges that
as an equity owner of the Company, the Restricted Party will derive good and
valuable consideration upon the Closing. Based upon the foregoing, the
Restricted Party further acknowledges and agrees that the consideration
provided herein and in the Purchase Agreement is full and adequate
consideration for the Restrictive Covenants.

  



  

 _Responsibility for Restricted Party Group_. The Restricted Party shall be
responsible for any violations of the provisions hereof by any member of the
Restricted Party Group.

  



  

 _Miscellaneous_.

  

 _ _

  

 _Severability_. 

  



  

Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect the
validity, legality or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions
hereof or the validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision
in any other situation or in any other jurisdiction. Upon a determination that
any provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal, or incapable of being
enforced, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement
so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in
an acceptable manner in order that the transaction contemplated hereby is
consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible.

  



  

Subject to _Section 10(a)(i)_ , if the final judgment of a court of competent
jurisdiction declares that any of the Restrictive Covenants, or any part
thereof, is invalid, illegal or unenforceable, (A) the court making the
determination of invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall have the
power to reduce or modify the scope, duration or area of the Restrictive
Covenant, as the case may be, to delete specific words or phrases, or to
replace any invalid, illegal or unenforceable Restrictive Covenant with a
Restrictive Covenant that is valid, legal and enforceable and that comes
closer to expressing the intention of the invalid, illegal or
unenforceable term or provision, and such Restrictive Covenant shall be
enforceable as so reduced or modified after the expiration of the time within
which the judgment may be appealed and shall then be incorporated herein by
reference and treated as the covenant that has been agreed to by the Parties,
and (B) it is the intention of the Parties that such determination not bar, or
in any way affect, Buyer's or the Company's right to relief provided above in
any court of any other jurisdiction, as to breaches of such covenants in such
other respective jurisdictions, such Restrictive Covenants as they relate to
each jurisdiction being, for this purpose, severable into diverse and
independent covenants. In the event of litigation involving any of the
Restrictive Covenants, the non-prevailing party shall reimburse the
prevailing party for all costs and expenses, including reasonable
attorneys' fees and expenses, incurred in connection with any such
litigation, including any appeal therefrom. The existence of any claim or
cause of action by any member of the Restricted Party Group against any
Affiliated Company, whether predicated on this Agreement or otherwise, shall
not constitute a defense to the enforcement by Buyer or the Company of the
Restrictive Covenants, which Restrictive Covenants shall be enforceable
notwithstanding the existence of any breach by Buyer or the Company.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no member of the Restricted Party Group shall
be prohibited from pursuing such claims or causes of action against Buyer or
the Company.

 _Succession and Assignment_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure
to the benefit of the Parties and their respective successors and
permitted assigns. The Restricted Party may not assign either this Agreement
or any of his or her rights, interests, or obligations hereunder. Buyer, the
Company or any of the other Affiliated Companies may not assign this Agreement
or any of its respective rights, interests, or obligations hereunder without
the prior written approval of the Restricted Party; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that Buyer, the Company or such other Affiliated Company may (i) assign any
or all of its rights and interests hereunder to one or more of its Affiliates
and designate one or more of its Affiliates to perform its obligations
hereunder (in any or all of which cases Buyer, the Company or such other
Affiliated Company nonetheless shall remain responsible for the performance of
all of its obligations hereunder), (ii) assign its rights under this
Agreement for collateral security purposes to any lenders (including any
Financing Sources) providing financing to the Buyer or any of the Affiliated
Companies (including the Financing) or (iii) assign its rights under this
Agreement to any Person that acquires Buyer, the Company or such other
Affiliated Company or any of their respective assets.

SECTION 2 
 Registration Rights

  



  

2.1 _Registration_

  



  

(a) The Company agrees that, no later than thirty (30) days
following the Closing (the " _Filing Period_ "), it shall prepare and file
with the Commission a registration statement on Form S-3, or such other
registration statement form that is available to the Company if Form S-3 is
not available (the registration statement, the " _Resale Shelf Registration
Statement_ "), pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act (or any similar
rule or regulation hereafter adopted by the Commission) and use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Resale Shelf Registration
Statement to become effective and to remain effective until the earlier of
(i) three years after effectiveness and (ii) the date on which all Registrable
Securities are eligible for resale under Rule 144 (without regard to the
volume limitations contained in Rule 144(e), or such earlier date when Holders
cease to hold Registrable Securities (" _Effective Period_ "), _provided_
that the Effective Period shall be extended by an equal number of days that a
registration, offering or other disposition is deferred, postponed or
suspended pursuant to Section 2.1(b) below. The Company shall calculate the
number of Registrable Securities issuable pursuant to the Deferred
Consideration Amount multiplied by one hundred and twenty percent (120%) for
the purpose of determining the number of such securities to be included in
the Resale Shelf Registration Statement by using to the closing price of the
Company's common stock within five (5) days of filing the Resale Shelf
Registration Statement.

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if
(i) in the good faith judgment of the board of directors of the Company (the "
_Board_ "), effecting a registration (whether by the filing of the Resale
Shelf Registration Statement or by taking any other action) or the offering
of disposition of Registrable Securities thereunder should be postponed or
suspended because such registration, offering or disposal would (1)
materially impede, delay or interfere with a material acquisition, corporate
reorganization, financing, securities offering or other transaction involving
the Company or any of its subsidiaries (whether such transaction is then
pending or proposed to be undertaken); (2) require premature disclosure of a
matter that the Board has determined would not be in the best interests of
the Company to be disclosed at such time; (3) occur during an applicable
"blackout" period under the Company's insider trading policy; (4) render the
Company unable to comply with requirements under the Securities Act or
Exchange Act; or (5) have a material adverse effect on the Company, then by
delivery of written notice to all participating Holders of such
determination, the Company may (but not more than two times in any twelve
(12)month period, except in respect of clause (3), for which there shall be
no limitation in the event Holder is subject to the Company's insider trading
policy) so postpone effecting a registration or require such Holders to
refrain from offering or disposing Registrable Securities for a period of not
more than one hundred eighty (180) days.

  



    

 -3-

 



    



  

(c) The Holders will not be entitled to effect an underwritten
public offering of Registrable Securities pursuant to the Resale Shelf
Registration Statement.

  



  

(d) Each Holder agrees that it will not sell (including by short
sale) or otherwise dispose of, whether pursuant to the Resale Shelf
Registration Statement or otherwise, on any trading day Registrable
Securities that would represent, individually or when calculated
together with all sales of Registrable Securities by all Holders on such
trading day, greater than ten percent (10%) of the Average Daily Trading
Volume.

  



  

2.2 _Expenses of Registration_. All Registration Expenses incurred
in connection with Resale Shelf Registration Statement shall be borne by the
Company. All Selling Expenses relating to securities registered on behalf of
the Holders and any Other Selling Shareholders shall be borne by the Holders
and the holders of any Other Shares included in such registration _pro rata_
among each other on the basis of the number of Registrable Securities and
Other Shares, respectively, registered on their behalf.

  



  

2.3 _Registration Procedures_.

  



  

The Company will:

  



  

(a) Prepare and file with the Commission the Resale Shelf
Registration Statement;

  



  

(b) Prepare and file with the Commission such amendments and
supplements to the Resale Shelf Registration Statement and the prospectus
used in connection with the Resale Shelf Registration Statement as may be
necessary to comply with the applicable provisions of the Securities Act with
respect to the disposition of all securities covered by the Resale Shelf
Registration Statement for the Effective Period;

  



  

(c) Furnish such number of prospectuses, including any preliminary
prospectuses, and other documents incident thereto, including any
amendment of or supplement to the prospectus, as a Holder from time to time
may reasonably request;

  



  

(d) Notify each seller of Registrable Securities covered by the
Resale Shelf Registration Statement at any time when a prospectus
relating thereto is required to be delivered under the Securities Act of the
happening of any event as a result of which the prospectus included in the
Resale Shelf Registration Statement, as then in effect, includes an untrue
statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or
incomplete in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, and
following such notification, subject to Section 2.1(b), promptly prepare and
file a post-effective amendment to the Resale Shelf Registration Statement or
a supplement to the related prospectus or any document incorporated therein
by reference, and file any other required document that would be incorporated
by reference into the Resale Shelf Registration Statement and prospectus, so
that the Resale Shelf Registration Statement does not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading,
and that such prospectus does not contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading, and, in the case of a post-
effective amendment to the Resale Shelf Registration Statement, subject to
Section 2.1(b), use commercially reasonable efforts to cause it to be declared
effective as promptly as is reasonably practicable, and give to the Holders
listed as selling security holders in such prospectus a written notice
of such amendment or supplement, and, upon receipt of such notice, each such
Holder agrees not to dispose of any Registrable Securities pursuant to the
Resale Shelf Registration Statement until such Holder's receipt of copies of
the supplemented or amended prospectus or until it receives further written
notice from the Company that such sales may re-commence, and such Holder has
received copies of any additional or supplemental filings that are
incorporated or deemed incorporated by reference in such prospectus; it being
understood that each Holder hereby agrees to keep any disclosures under this
Section 2.3(d) confidential until such time as a supplement or amendment is
filed or the Company has otherwise publicly disclosed such information;

    

 -4-

 



    



  

(e) Use its commercially reasonable efforts, at the expense of the
Company, to obtain the withdrawal of any order suspending the
effectiveness of any Resale Shelf Registration Statement as soon as
reasonably possible (and promptly notify in writing each Holder covered
by such registration statement of the withdrawal of any such order);

  



  

(f) Use commercially reasonable efforts, at the expense of the
Company, to cause, all such Registrable Securities registered hereunder to be
listed on each national securities exchange on which similar securities of the
same class issued by the Company are then listed;

  



  

(g) Upon execution of confidentiality agreements in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to the Company, make available for
inspection by the selling Holders and any attorney or accountant or other
agent selected by the selling Holders (in each case after reasonable prior
notice and at reasonable times during normal business hours and without
unnecessary interruption of the Company's business operations), all financial
and other records, pertinent corporate documents, and properties of the
Company, and cause the Company's officers, directors, employees, and
independent accountants to supply all information reasonably requested by any
such seller, attorney, accountant, or agent, in each case, as reasonably
necessary or advisable to verify the accuracy of the information in the
Resale Shelf Registration Statement and to conduct appropriate due diligence
in connection therewith;

  



  

(h) Use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate, and cause each
of its principal executive officer, principal financial officer,
principal accounting officer, and all other officers and members of the
management to use their commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate in any
offering of Registrable Securities hereunder, which cooperation shall include,
without limitation, assisting with the preparation of any registration
statement or amendment thereto with respect to such offering and all other
offering materials and related documents, and participation in meetings with
attorneys, accountants and potential stockholders (to be scheduled in a
collaborative manner so as not to unreasonably interfere with the conduct of
the business of the Company);

  



  

(i) Use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with each
Holder and each agent, if any, participating in the disposition of
such Registrable Securities and their respective counsel in connection with
any filings required to be made with the Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority, Inc. (" _FINRA_ "), and use its commercially reasonable efforts to
make or cause to be made any filings required to be made by an issuer with
FINRA in connection with the filing of the Resale Shelf Registration
Statement;

  



  

(j) Notify each selling Holder, promptly after the Company receives
notice thereof, of the time when the Resale Shelf Registration Statement has
been declared effective or a supplement to any prospectus forming a part of
such Resale Shelf Registration Statement has been filed; and

    

 -5-

 



    



  

(k) After the Resale Shelf Registration Statement becomes effective,
notify each selling Holder of any request by the Commission that the Company
amend or supplement such registration statement or prospectus.

  



  

2.4 _Indemnification_

  



  

(a) To the extent permitted by law, the Company will indemnify and
hold harmless each Holder beneficially owning any Registrable
Securities covered by the Resale Shelf Registration Statement, each of its
officers, directors and partners, and each person or entity, if any,
controlling such Holder within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities
Act, against all expenses, claims, losses, damages and liabilities (or
actions, proceedings or settlements in respect thereof) arising out of or
based on: (i) any untrue statement (or alleged untrue statement) of a
material fact contained or incorporated by reference in any prospectus,
offering circular or other document (including any related registration
statement, notification or the like) incident to any such registration,
qualification or compliance, (ii) any omission (or alleged omission) to state
therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make
the statements therein not misleading, or (iii) any violation (or alleged
violation) by the Company of the Securities Act, any state securities laws or
any rule or regulation thereunder applicable to the Company and relating to
action or inaction required of the Company in connection with any offering
covered by such registration, qualification or compliance, and the
Company will reimburse each such Holder, each of its officers, directors,
partners, legal counsel and accountants and each person or entity controlling
such Holder, for any legal and any other expenses reasonably incurred in
connection with investigating and defending or settling any such claim, loss,
damage, liability or action; _provided_ that the Company will not be liable in
any such case to the extent that any such claim, loss, damage, liability, or
action arises out of or is based on any untrue statement or omission based
upon written information furnished to the Company by such Holder, any of such
Holder's officers, directors, partners, legal counsel or accountants, and any
person or entity controlling such Holder, and stated to be specifically for
use therein or such Holder\'s failure to deliver a copy of the Resale Shelf
Registration Statement, prospectus, preliminary prospectus, free writing
prospectus (as defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act or any successor
rule thereto) or any amendments or supplements thereto (if the same was
required by applicable law to be so delivered) after the Company has furnished
such Holder with a sufficient number of copies of the same prior to any
written confirmation of the sale of Registrable Securities; _provided_ ,
_further_  that, the indemnity agreement contained in this Section 2.4(a)
shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any such loss, claim,
damage, liability or action if such settlement is effected without the consent
of the Company (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld); and
_provided_ , _further_ that, the Company shall not be required to reimburse
the Holders for the expenses of more than one counsel to all Holders.

  



  

(b) To the extent permitted by law, each selling Holder, severally
and not jointly, will, if Registrable Securities held by such Holder are
included in the securities as to which such registration, qualification or
compliance is being effected, indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each
of its directors, officers, partners, legal counsel and accountants, each
person or entity who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of
the Securities Act, each other such Holder, and each of their officers,
directors and partners, and each person or entity controlling each other such
Holder, against all claims, losses, damages and liabilities (or actions in
respect thereof) arising out of or based on: (i) any untrue statement (or
alleged untrue statement) of a material fact contained or incorporated by
reference in any prospectus, offering circular or other document (including
any related registration statement, notification, or the like) incident to
any such registration, qualification or compliance made in reliance upon
and in conformity with information furnished in writing by or on behalf of
such selling Holder expressly for use in connection with such registration,
or (ii) any omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading made in
reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing by or on
behalf of such selling Holder expressly for use in connection with such
registration, and will reimburse the Company and such Holders, directors,
officers, partners, legal counsel and accountants, persons, or control persons
for any legal or any other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with
investigating or defending any such claim, loss, damage, liability or action,
in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue
statement or omission is made in such registration statement, prospectus,
offering circular or other document in reliance upon and in conformity with
written information furnished to the Company by such Holder and stated to be
specifically for use therein; _provided_ , _however_ , that the obligations of
such Holder hereunder shall be subject to the limitations set forth in
Section 2.4(d) and shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any such
claims, losses, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) if
such settlement is effected without the consent of such Holder (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld).

  



    

 -6-

 



    



  

(c) Each party entitled to indemnification under this Section 2.4
(the " _Indemnified_ ___Party_ ") shall give notice to the party required to
provide indemnification (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") promptly after
such Indemnified Party has actual knowledge of any claim as to which
indemnity may be sought, and shall permit the Indemnifying Party to assume
the defense of such claim or any litigation resulting therefrom; _provided_
that counsel for the Indemnifying Party, who shall conduct the defense of
such claim or any litigation resulting therefrom, shall be approved by the
Indemnified Party (whose approval shall not be unreasonably withheld), and
the Indemnified Party may participate in such defense at such party's
expense; and _provided_ _further_ that the failure of any Indemnified Party
to give notice as provided herein shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of
its obligations under this Section 2.4, to the extent such failure is not
prejudicial. No Indemnifying Party, in the defense of any such claim or
litigation, shall, except with the consent of each Indemnified Party, consent
to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement that does not include
as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to
such Indemnified Party of a release from all liability in respect to such
claim or litigation. Each Indemnified Party shall furnish such information
regarding itself or the claim in question as an Indemnifying Party may
reasonably request in writing and as shall be reasonably required in
connection with defense of such claim and litigation resulting therefrom.

  



  

(d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 2.4 is held
by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unavailable to an Indemnified
Party with respect to any loss, liability, claim, damage, or expense referred
to herein, then the Indemnifying Party, in lieu of indemnifying such
Indemnified Party hereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by
such Indemnified Party as a result of such loss, liability, claim, damage, or
expense in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of
the Indemnifying Party on the one hand and of the Indemnified Party on the
other in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such
loss, liability, claim, damage, or expense as well as any other relevant
equitable considerations. The relative fault of the Indemnifying Party and of
the Indemnified Party shall be determined by reference to, among other things,
whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the
omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the
Indemnifying Party or by the Indemnified Party and the parties' relative
intent, knowledge, access to information, and opportunity to correct or
prevent such statement or omission. No person or entity will be required under
this Section 2.4(d) to contribute any amount in excess of the net proceeds
from the offering received by such person or entity, except in the case of
fraud or willful misconduct by such person or entity. No person or entity
guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f)
of the Securities Act) will be entitled to contribution from any person or
entity who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.

  



  

The obligations of the Company and Holders under this Section 2.4 shall
survive the termination of this Agreement until the expiration of
the applicable period of the statute of limitations.

2.5 _Information by Holder_ Each Holder of
Registrable Securities shall promptly furnish in writing to the Company such
information regarding such Holder and the distribution proposed by such
Holder as the Company may from time to time reasonably request and such other
information as may be required in connection with any registration,
qualification, offering or compliance referred to in this Section 2,
including, without limitation, all such information as may be requested by
the Commission, and the Company shall not be required to include any
Registrable Securities of any Holder in any such registration, qualification
or offering if information described in this Section 2.5 is not
promptly furnished to the Company.

  



  

2.6 _Restrictions on Transfer_

  



  

(a) The holder of each certificate representing Registrable
Securities by acceptance and/or retention thereof, agrees to comply in
all respects with the provisions of this Section 2.6. Each Holder agrees not
to make any sale, assignment, transfer, pledge or other disposition of all or
any portion of the Restricted Securities, or any beneficial interest therein,
unless and until the transferee thereof has agreed in writing for the benefit
of the Company to take and hold such Restricted Securities subject to, and to
be bound by, the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, including,
without limitation, this Section 2.6 and Section 2.7.

  



  

(b) Before any proposed sale, pledge, or transfer of any Restricted
Securities, unless there is in effect a registration statement under
the Securities Act covering the proposed transaction, the Holder shall have
given prior written notice to the Company of the Holder's intention to make
such disposition and shall have furnished the Company with a detailed
description of the manner and circumstances of the proposed disposition, and
the Holder shall have furnished the Company, at the Holder's expense, with (i)
an opinion of counsel, reasonably satisfactory to the Company, to the effect
that such disposition will not require registration of such
Restricted Securities under the Securities Act or (ii) a "no action" letter
from the Commission to the effect that the transfer of such securities
without registration will not result in a recommendation by the Staff that
action be taken with respect thereto, whereupon the holder of such Restricted
Securities shall be entitled to transfer such Restricted Securities in
accordance with the terms of the notice delivered by the Holder to the
Company. The Company will not require such a legal opinion or "no action"
letter in any transaction in which such Holder distributes Restricted
Securities to an Affiliate for no consideration or pursuant to the terms set
forth in Section 2.7; _provided,_ that each transferee agrees in writing to be
subject to the terms of this Agreement. Each certificate or instrument
evidencing the Restricted Securities transferred as above provided
shall bear, except if such transfer is made pursuant to Rule 144, the
appropriate restrictive legend set forth in Section 2.6(c), except that such
certificate shall not bear such restrictive legend if, in the opinion of
counsel for such Holder and the Company, such legend is not required in order
to establish compliance with any provisions of the Securities Act.

  



  

(c) Each certificate representing Registrable Securities shall
(unless otherwise permitted by the provisions of this Agreement) be
stamped or otherwise imprinted with a legend substantially similar to the
following (in addition to any legend required under applicable state
securities laws or any other contractual arrangement):

  



  

THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED HEREBY HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE
SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE " _ACT_ "), OR UNDER THE SECURITIES
LAWS OF CERTAIN STATES. THESE SECURITIES MAY NOT BE OFFERED, SOLD OR OTHERWISE
TRANSFERRED, PLEDGED OR HYPOTHECATED EXCEPT AS PERMITTED UNDER THE ACT AND
APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS PURSUANT TO REGISTRATION OR AN EXEMPTION
THEREFROM. THE ISSUER OF THESE SECURITIES MAY REQUIRE AN OPINION OF COUNSEL
REASONABLY SATISFACTORY TO THE ISSUER THAT SUCH OFFER, SALE OR TRANSFER,
PLEDGE OR HYPOTHECATION OTHERWISE COMPLIES WITH THE ACT AND ANY APPLICABLE
STATE SECURITIES LAWS.

  



  

   

 -8-

 



    



  

(d) The legend set forth in Section 2.6(c) stamped on a certificate
evidencing the Restricted Securities and the stock transfer instructions and
record notations with respect to the Restricted Securities shall be removed
and the Company shall issue a certificate without such legend to the holder
of Restricted Securities if (i) those securities are sold pursuant to the
Resale Shelf Registration Statement declared effective by the Commission, or
(ii) the holder provides the Company with an opinion of counsel reasonably
acceptable to the Company to the effect that a sale or transfer of those
securities may be made without registration or qualification.

  



  

2.7 _Transfer or Assignment of Rights_ The rights granted to a
Holder by the Company under this Section 2 may be transferred or assigned (but
only with all related obligations) by a Holder only to (i) an Affiliate of
such Holder, (ii) a member of such Holder's immediate family or a trust
for the benefit of an individual Holder or one or more of Holders immediate
family members or (iii) any member, partner or stockholder of such Holder;
_provided,_ that such transfer or assignment shall only be effective upon
receipt by the Company of (x) written notice from the Holder certifying that
the transferee qualifies under clause (i), (ii) or (iii) of this sentence,
stating the name and address of such transferee and identifying the amount of
Registrable Securities with respect to which the rights under this Agreement
are being transferred, (y) a written agreement from such transferee to be
bound by all of the terms of this Agreement and (z) the Holder demonstrates
to the Company\'s satisfaction that the transfer or assignment of Registrable
Securities is effected in accordance with applicable securities laws. Upon
the Company\'s receipt of the documents referenced in (x), (y) and (z)
above, the transferee shall thereafter be deemed to be a "Holder." Except as
set forth above, this Agreement and the rights and obligations hereunder may
not be assigned by any party hereto without the prior written consent of each
of the other parties hereto.

  



  

2.8 _Market Stand-Off Agreement_ In connection with any
underwritten public offering by the Company for its own account or the account
of a security holder or holders, each Holder agrees to execute a market
standoff agreement with the underwriters for such offering in customary form
covering all Common Stock held by such Holder. The underwriters in connection
with such registration are intended third-party beneficiaries of this Section
2.8 and shall have the right and power to enforce the provisions of this
Section 2.8 as though they were a party hereto.

SECTION 3 
 Miscellaneous

  



  

3.1 _Amendment_ Except as expressly provided herein, neither
this Agreement nor any term hereof may be amended, waived, discharged or
terminated other than by a written instrument referencing this Agreement and
signed by the Company and the Holders holding a majority of the Common Stock
constituting Registrable Securities then outstanding _provided_ , _however_ ,
that persons who become assignees or other transferees of Registrable
Securities in accordance with this Agreement after the date of this Agreement
may become parties hereto, by executing a counterpart of this Agreement
without any amendment of this Agreement pursuant to this paragraph or any
consent or approval of any other Holder; and _provided_ , _further_ , that if
any amendment, waiver, discharge or termination operates in a manner that
treats any Holder different from other Holders, the consent of such Holder
shall also be required for such amendment, waiver, discharge or termination.
Any such amendment, waiver, discharge or termination effected in accordance
with this paragraph shall be binding upon each Holder and each future holder
of all such securities of such Holder. Each Holder acknowledges that by the
operation of this paragraph, the Company and such majority in interest will
have the right and power to diminish or eliminate all rights of such Holder
under this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, the Company shall be permitted, without the consent of any Holder,
to amend _Exhibit A_ to this Agreement solely to reflect (i) any adjustments
to the number of Buyer Shares held by a Holder pursuant to the Purchase
Agreement or (ii) any transfer or assignment of rights under this Agreement
made in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

Attn: Tomer Yosef-Or

  



  

Ladies and Gentlemen:

  



  

Reference is made to that certain Interest Purchase Agreement, dated as of
the date hereof (the " _Purchase Agreement_ "), by and between EMC
Acquisition Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (" _Seller_
"), and Global Eagle Entertainment Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _GEE_ ").
Capitalized terms used in this letter agreement (this " _Agreement_ ") and
not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings set forth in the Purchase
Agreement.

  



  

By execution below, simultaneous with the execution of the Purchase
Agreement, each of GEE and EMC HoldCo 2 B.V. (the " _Stockholder_ ") agrees
as follows:

  



    



 



    



  

 _Board Nominee_. 1.2 Until the earliest of (u) such date that the
Stockholder holds less than 5% of GEE's outstanding shares of common stock,
(v) the consummation by the Stockholder or any of its Affiliates (as defined
below) of a Competitive Transaction (as defined below), (w) the date that any
partner, member or employee of the Stockholder or any of its Affiliates
becomes a member of the board of directors, a board observer or executive
officer of any competitor of GEE or any of its subsidiaries, (x) GEE sells
all or substantially all of its assets, (y) GEE participates in any merger,
consolidation or similar transaction following the consummation of which, the
stockholders of GEE immediately prior to the consummation of such transaction
hold less than 50% of all of the outstanding common stock or other securities
entitled to vote for the election of directors of the surviving or resulting
entity in such transaction, and (z) stockholder's written notice to GEE that
it desires to terminate its rights pursuant to Section 1 (such date, the "
_Termination Date_ "), the Stockholder shall have the right (but not the
obligation) to nominate one (i) individual (the " _Nominee_ ") to stand for
election as a member of GEE's Board of Directors (the " _GEE Board_ "), so
long as such Nominee (A) is not prohibited or disqualified from serving as a
director of the GEE Board pursuant to any rule or regulation of the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission or The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC or by
applicable law, (B) satisfies all applicable governance guidelines or
policies of GEE, as in effect from time to time, and (C) is reasonably
satisfactory to the GEE Board in its good faith judgement. In the event that
a Nominee does not meet any of the foregoing requirements, the Stockholder
shall have the right to designate a different individual as a Nominee until a
Nominee satisfies all of such requirements. GEE hereby agrees that each of
Tomer Yosef-Or, C.J. Brucato and Jay Grossman is deemed to satisfy all of
such requirements. On the Closing Date, in accordance with the Certificate of
Incorporation of GEE as in effect from time to time (the " _GEE Certificate_
"), GEE shall take all action necessary to appoint the Nominee as a Class III
Director on the GEE Board with a term expiring at GEE's 2017 annual meeting of
stockholders. Thereafter, until the Termination Date, at any annual or
special meeting of stockholders of GEE at which that class of directors is up
for election, GEE shall nominate such Nominee as is designated by the
Stockholder to stand for such election in accordance with the foregoing and
the GEE Certificate. The designation by the Stockholder of such Nominee shall
be made by the Stockholder providing written notice of the name of such
Nominee to GEE not less than 120 days prior to each meeting of stockholders at
which that class of directors is up for election (assuming for these purposes
that each annual meeting shall be held on the anniversary of the prior year's
annual meeting, and in the case of any special meeting at which that class of
directors is up for election, such written notice shall be provided not later
than the later of (A) such 120 days prior to such special meeting or (B) the
seventh day following the day on which public announcement of the special
meeting is first made by GEE). For purposes of this Agreement, "Affiliates"
means, in addition to any Person otherwise constituting an Affiliate under the
definition of such term in the Purchase Agreement, for the avoidance of
doubt, (i) ABRY Partners, LLC (" _ABRY LLC_ ") and its current and future
Affiliates, (ii) any entity managed by ABRY LLC now or in the future and any
current or future Affiliates of such entity and (iii) any entity in which
ABRY LLC now or in the future owns a direct or indirect interest.

  



  

(a) The Stockholder shall cause any Nominee who is a member of the
GEE Board, at all times, to be mindful of and act in accordance with the
Nominee's fiduciary duties to all of GEE's stockholders and the Nominee's duty
of loyalty to GEE, including, without limitation, with respect to corporate
opportunities and conflicts of interest. The parties hereto acknowledge and
agree that a Nominee may abstain from a particular vote of the GEE Board in
the event such Nominee determines it would be appropriate to do so due to a
conflict of interest.

  



  

(b) The Stockholder acknowledges and agrees that the Nominee, as a
member of the GEE Board, will be recused or otherwise excluded or
omitted from portions or entireties of meetings of the GEE Board (and shall
not receive any information regarding acquisition or corporate development
activities of GEE and its subsidiaries) if the Stockholder or any of its
Affiliates is reviewing or evaluating any potential acquisition, investment
or other transaction involving a company or business that competes with any
business then engaged in (or contemplated to be engaged in) by GEE or any of
its subsidiaries (a " _Competitive Transaction_ "); provided that such
recusal or exclusion and the withholding of such information shall only apply
during the time the Stockholder or any of its Affiliates is evaluating or
reviewing any such Competing Transaction and for 90 days thereafter.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Stockholder agrees to provide GEE's
General Counsel with prompt written notice of any such Competitive
Transaction, in accordance with Section 11.7 of the Purchase Agreement.

  



  

(c) Immediately following the Termination Date, the Stockholder will
cause the Nominee to (i) no longer attend meetings of the GEE Board and
(ii) resign as a member of the GEE Board.

    

 2

 



    



  

(d) Upon the designation of any Nominee, the Stockholder shall sign
the Confidentiality Agreement attached hereto as Exhibit A (the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ ").

  



  

(e) The Stockholder acknowledges and agrees that, except as
otherwise set forth in this Agreement, the Nominee will only receive
information that the members of the GEE Board receive and that the Nominee
will have no rights to receive or request information that is not otherwise
provided to the entire GEE Board.

  



  

(f) The Stockholder acknowledges and agrees that the Nominee will be
entitled to receive any regular director fees normally paid in cash or
securities to all non-employee members of the GEE Board.

  



  

(g) The Stockholder shall, and shall cause the Nominee to, timely
provide GEE with accurate and complete information relating to the
Stockholder and the Nominee that is required to be disclosed by GEE under the
Securities Act and/or the Securities Exchange Act or GEE's charter and
bylaws, including such information required to be furnished by GEE with
respect to the Nominee in a proxy statement pursuant to Rule 14a-101
promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act. In addition, at GEE's request,
the Stockholder shall cause the Nominee to promptly complete and execute
GEE's director and officer questionnaire prior to being admitted to the GEE
Board or standing for reelection at an annual meeting of stockholders or at
such other time (and such other information) as may be reasonably requested
by GEE.

  



  

(h) The Nominee shall be subject to all of the requirements and
restrictions of GEE and the GEE Board applicable to GEE directors from time
to time, including, without limitation, GEE's Code of Ethics and insider
trading policy.

  



  

2. _Standstill_. _ _(a) Until the expiration of six (6) months after the Termination Date (such period, the " _Standstill Period_ "), the Stockholder agrees that without the prior written consent of the GEE Board, none of the Stockholder or its Affiliates will in any manner, directly or indirectly, (i) by purchase or otherwise, acquire, or propose or agree to acquire, ownership (of record or beneficially) of any securities issued by GEE or any direct or indirect rights (including, without limitation, any convertible, derivative or synthetic securities) or options to acquire (or otherwise act in concert with any person which so acquires, offers to acquire or agrees to acquire) such ownership (other than solely from an action by GEE such as a stock split, dividend or recapitalization; any rights granted to all stockholders of GEE, or any GEE securities that may be issued to the Stockholder as part of the Deferred Consideration Amount under the Purchase Agreement; or in connection with Board service by the Nominee); (ii) submit any proposal for, or otherwise offer to enter into, a transaction with GEE involving the acquisition (by merger, tender offer, purchase, statutory share exchange or otherwise) of ownership (including, but not limited to, beneficial ownership) of any securities issued by GEE; (iii) acquire or agree to acquire or effect control of GEE or directly or indirectly form, join, participate or encourage the formation of any group (other than with its Affiliates) within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the " _Exchange Act_ ") with respect to any voting securities of GEE or in order to acquire or affect control of GEE; (iv) make, or in any way participate, directly or indirectly in any "solicitation" of proxies to vote (as such terms are used in the rules of the Securities Exchange Commission) or become a participant in any proxy solicitation or seek to advise or influence any person with respect to the voting of any securities issued by GEE; or (v) initiate, propose or solicit votes for any stockholder proposal or induce or attempt to induce any other person to initiate any stockholder proposal (other than any stockholder proposals recommended by the GEE Board); (vi) call or seek to have called any meeting of the stockholders of GEE or execute any written consent in lieu of a meeting of holders of any securities of GEE; (vii) other than the Nominee, seek election or seek to place a representative on the GEE Board or seek the removal of any member of the GEE Board, in any case alone or in concert with others; (viii) otherwise, directly or indirectly, alone or in concert with others, seek to control the management, Board or policies of GEE; or (ix) make any public announcement with respect to any of the foregoing.

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing clause (a), the Standstill Period
shall terminate and the restrictions on the Stockholder set forth in clause
(a) above shall have no further force and effect in the event that GEE files
a petition in bankruptcy or for similar relief, is adjudicated bankrupt or
insolvent, consents to the appointment of a receiver or similar official,
makes a general assignment for the benefit of its creditors, or a bankruptcy
petition with regard to GEE is not discharged or denied within 90 days.

  



  

3. _Remedies_. (a) In the event that any covenant or agreement in this Agreement is not performed in accordance with its terms, each party hereto agrees that, in addition to any other remedy at law or in equity, the non-breaching party will have the right to an injunction, temporary restraining order, specific performance or other equitable relief in any court of competent jurisdiction enjoining any such breach and enforcing specifically the terms and provisions hereof. Each party hereto agrees not to oppose the granting of such relief in the event a court determines that such a breach has occurred, and to waive any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with such remedy.

  



  

(b) All rights, powers and remedies provided under this Agreement or
otherwise available in respect hereof at law or in equity shall be cumulative
and not alternative, and the exercise or beginning of the exercise of any
thereof by any party shall not preclude the simultaneous or later exercise of
any other such right, power or remedy by such party.

  



  

 _Effectiveness of this Agreement_. This Agreement shall become effective
only upon the Closing under the Purchase Agreement and shall have no force or
effect until such time or in the event the Closing does not occur. The
provisions of Section 1 of this Agreement shall continue in effect until the
Termination Date or such other time period specified in Section 1, at which
time such provisions of Section 1 of this Agreement shall terminate and be of
no further force or effect. Sections 2 and 3 of this Agreement shall
terminate upon the termination of the Standstill Period, at which time
Sections 2 and 3 shall be of no further force and effect. At the time that
Sections 1, 2 and 3 of this Agreement have terminated, this entire Agreement
shall be deemed terminated and shall have no further force and effect.

  



  

 _Miscellaneous_. (c) This Agreement may not be amended, supplemented or
modified except in writing, duly executed by all of the parties.
