ARTICLE II 
 CONVERSION OF SECURITIES; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES 

   

 Section 2.01. _Conversion of Securities_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Merger Co, the Company or the holders of any of the following securities, the following shall occur: 

  

 (a) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Each share of the common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the " _Company Common Stock_ ") (all issued and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock being hereinafter collectively referred to as the " _Shares_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any Shares to be cancelled pursuant to _Section 2.01(b)_ and any Dissenting Shares) shall be cancelled and shall be converted automatically into the right to receive $12.10 per share in cash, without interest (the " _Per Share Merger Consideration_ "), payable in the manner provided in  _Section 2.04_. (The result of (i) the number of Shares entitled to payment pursuant to this  _Section 2.01(a)_ times (ii) the Per Share Merger Consideration is referred to herein from time to time as the " _Merger Consideration_ ".) 

   

 (b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock, Parent-Owned Stock and Unvested Stock_. The following Shares shall automatically be cancelled at the Effective Time without any conversion thereof, and no payment or distribution shall be made with respect thereto: (i) Each Share held in the treasury of the Company; (ii) each Share directly owned by Parent, Merger Co or any direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent, Merger Co or the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time; and (iii) each Share held by the persons listed on _Schedule 3.03(a)_ that, in accordance with the terms of the agreement pursuant to which such Shares were issued, has not vested prior to, and will not vest as of, the Effective Time. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (c) _Capital Stock of Merger Co_. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Co issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation. Following the Effective Time, each certificate evidencing ownership of shares of Merger Co common stock shall evidence ownership of such shares of the Surviving Corporation. 

   

 (d) _Adjustments_. If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, there is a reclassification, recapitalization, stock split, stock dividend, subdivision, combination or exchange of shares with respect to, or rights issued in respect of, the Shares, the Per Share Merger Consideration shall be adjusted accordingly, without duplication, to provide the holders of Shares the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event. 

   

 Section 2.02. _Treatment of Options and Other Equity Awards_. 

  

 (a) _Options_. As of the Effective Time, each option then outstanding to purchase shares of Company Common Stock (each, a " _Company Stock Option_ ") granted under any plan, arrangement or agreement, including without limitation those set forth in _Schedule 3.03(a)_ (collectively, the " _Company Stock Option Plans_ "), regardless of whether vested or exercisable, shall fully vest and be deemed to be exercised and cancelled. Each holder of a Company Stock Option with respect to which the exercise price therefor is less than the Per Share Merger Consideration (an " _In-the-Money Option_ ") shall be entitled to receive, in consideration of the deemed exercise and cancellation of such In-the-Money Option, a payment of an amount of cash, without interest, equal to the product of (i) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such In-the-Money Option multiplied by (ii) the excess, if any, of the Per Share Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share of such In-the-Money Option, less applicable Taxes, if any, required to be withheld with respect to such payment. Any Company Stock Option that is not an In-the-Money Option shall not be entitled to any payment in respect thereof. 

   

 (b) _Restricted Shares_. As of the Effective Time, each Share then subject to vesting or other restrictions pursuant to any Company Stock Option Plan or pursuant to any agreement with the Company (collectively, " _Restricted Shares_ ") shall become vested or unrestricted to the extent provided in the agreement pursuant to which such Restricted Shares were issued. The Restricted Shares that so vest shall be converted into the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration under _Section 2.01(a)_, less any required withholding Taxes; the Restricted Shares that do not so vest prior to or as of the Effective Time shall be cancelled as provided in  _Section 2.01(b)_. 

   

 (c) _Company Action_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take or cause to be taken all actions necessary to (i) effectuate the treatment of the Company Stock Options and Restricted Shares set forth in this _Section 2.02_ (which shall include, with respect to Company Stock Options, delivery of at least 15 days prior written notice of the treatment described in _Section 2.02(a)_), and (ii) terminate each of the Company Stock Option Plans (in each case, to the extent not already terminated) effective as of or prior to the Effective Time. Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay to the holders of the Company Stock Options the cash payments to which they are entitled pursuant to this _Section 2.02_ prior to the later of (x) five (5) Business Days following the Effective Time and (y) the next regularly scheduled payroll date of the Surviving Corporation. 

   

 Section 2.03. _No Further Rights; Stock Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the records of the Company of Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates representing Shares outstanding 

   ##### 

  

    

immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with
respect to such Shares, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or by
law. On or after the Effective Time, any Certificates presented to the Paying
Agent or Parent for any reason shall be cancelled against delivery of the Per
Share Merger Consideration to which the holders thereof are entitled
pursuant to _Section 2.01(a)_, without interest. 

  

 Section 2.04. _Exchange of Certificates_. 

  

 (a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall enter into a paying agent agreement, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Company, with a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as agent for the stockholders of the Company in connection with the Merger (the " _Paying Agent_ "). At the Closing, Parent shall deposit with the Paying Agent, for the benefit of the holders of Shares, cash in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration required to be paid pursuant to _Section 2.01(a)_ (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. The Exchange Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that: (i) no such investment or losses thereon shall affect the Per Share Merger Consideration payable to the holders of Company Common Stock entitled thereto, and, following any losses, Parent shall promptly provide additional funds to the Paying Agent for the benefit of the stockholders of the Company in the amount of any such losses; and (ii) such investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America or any agency or instrumentality thereof and backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of America, in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $10 billion (based on the most recent financial statements of such bank that are then publicly available). Any net profit resulting from, or interest or income produced by, such investments shall be payable to the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as Parent directs. 

   

 (b) _Exchange Procedures for Shares_. As promptly as practicable, but no later than three (3) Business Days, after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each Person who was, at the Effective Time, a holder of Shares entitled to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.01(a)_: (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall be in customary form and shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the certificates evidencing such Shares (collectively, the " _Certificates_ ") shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent); and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Per Share Merger Consideration. Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of a Certificate for cancellation, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions (or, if such Shares are held in book-entry or other uncertificated form, upon the entry through a book-entry transfer agent of the surrender of such Shares on a book-entry account statement (it being understood that any references herein to "Certificates" shall be deemed to include references to book-entry account statements relating to the ownership of Shares)), the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the amount of cash that such holder has the right to receive in respect of the Shares formerly represented by such Certificate pursuant to _Section 2.01(a)_, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that are not registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment of the Per Share Merger Consideration with respect thereto may be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered if the Certificate representing such Shares is properly endorsed or otherwise in proper form for transfer, and the Person requesting such payment pays any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the payment of the Per Share Merger Consideration applicable to such Shares to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or establishes to the reasonable satisfaction 

   ##### 

  

   

of Parent that such tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered
as contemplated by this _Section 2.04(b)_, each Certificate shall be deemed
at all times after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive
upon such surrender the Per Share Merger Consideration to which the holder of
such Certificate is entitled pursuant to this _Article II_. No interest
shall be paid or will accrue on any cash payable to holders of Certificates
pursuant to the provisions of this _Article II_. 

   

 (c) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of Shares on the date that is six (6) months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation, upon demand, and any holders of Shares who have not theretofore complied with this _Article II_ shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for, and the Surviving Corporation shall remain liable for, payment of their respective claims for the Per Share Merger Consideration. Any portion of the Exchange Fund remaining unclaimed by holders of Shares as of a date which is immediately prior to such time that such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Entity shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. 

   

 (d) _No Liability_. None of the Paying Agent, Parent, Merger Co or the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any holder of Shares or Company Stock Options for any such Shares or Company Stock Options (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto), or cash delivered to a public official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or similar law. 

   

 (e) _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Paying Agent, the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Shares or Company Stock Options such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to such payment under all applicable Tax laws and pay such withholding amount over to the appropriate taxing authority. To the extent that amounts are so properly withheld by the Paying Agent, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Shares or Company Stock Options in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Paying Agent, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be. 

   

 (f) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate has been lost, stolen, defaced or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen, defaced or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall pay in respect of such lost, stolen, defaced or destroyed Certificate the Per Share Merger Consideration to which the holder thereof is entitled pursuant to _Section 2.01(a)_ , without interest.

Except as otherwise prohibited by applicable Law, the terms of any Contract entered into prior to the date hereof or any other duty of confidentiality owed to another Person, or as would be reasonably expected to violate any attorney-client privilege (it being understood that the parties shall each use reasonable best efforts to cause such information to be provided in a manner that does not result in such violation), from the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the Effective Time and the Termination Date, the Company shall (and shall cause the Subsidiaries to): (i) provide to Parent and to the officers, directors, members, partners, managers, employees, accountants, consultants, legal counsel, financing sources, agents and other representatives (collectively, " _Representatives_ ") of Parent reasonable access, during normal business hours and upon reasonable prior notice by Parent, to the officers, employees, agents, properties, offices and other facilities of the Company and the Subsidiaries and to the books and records thereof; and (ii) furnish promptly to Parent such information concerning the business, properties, contracts, assets, liabilities, personnel and other aspects of the Company and the Subsidiaries as Parent or its Representatives may reasonably request. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may impose reasonable restrictions and limitations on access to such officers, employees, agents, properties, offices, facilities, books and records and information, and Parent shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, use their reasonable best efforts to conduct any such investigation or consultation in such a manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the business or operations of the Company or the Subsidiaries or otherwise result in any unreasonable interference with the prompt and timely discharge by such employees of their normal duties. Neither the Company nor any of the Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or to disclose information where such access or disclosure would jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of the Company or the Subsidiaries or could reasonably be deemed to contravene any law, Contract entered into prior to the date of this Agreement or any other duty of confidentiality owed to another Person (it being agreed that the parties shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause such information to be provided in a manner that does not cause such violation or jeopardy). In addition to the foregoing, the Company shall provide to Parent, and shall cause the Subsidiaries to, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Companys and the Subsidiaries respective officers, employees, Representatives and advisors, including legal and accounting, to, provide to Parent all cooperation reasonably requested by Parent in connection with its financing and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Other Contemplated Transactions, including the following: (i) participation in meetings, presentations, road shows, due diligence sessions and sessions with rating agencies; (ii) assisting with the preparation of materials for rating agency presentations, offering documents, private placement memoranda, bank information memoranda, prospectuses and similar documents; (iii) furnishing Parent and its financing sources with financial and other pertinent information regarding the Company and the Subsidiaries, if subject to confidentiality and use restrictions reasonably satisfactory to the Company; and (iv) facilitating the entrance into one or more credit or other agreements satisfactory to Parent, _provided_  that, in all cases with respect to the above, the Company and the Subsidiaries shall incur no cost or expense that is not promptly

be obligated to become a party to (or otherwise bound by) any agreement or
other document prior to the Closing. The Company hereby consents to the use
of its and the Subsidiaries logos in connection with Parents financing;
provided that such logos are used solely in a manner that is not intended
to nor reasonably likely to harm or disparage the Company or any of the
Subsidiaries. 

   

 (b) _Confidentiality_. All materials, documents and information obtained by Parent or its Representatives pursuant to this _Section 6.04_ shall be kept confidential and otherwise dealt with in accordance with the confidentiality agreement, dated April 7, 2008 (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), between Luther King Capital Management Corporation and the Company, which agreement shall remain in full force and effect, notwithstanding the execution and delivery or termination of this Agreement.

The Company shall, and shall direct each of its Representatives to, cease immediately upon execution of this Agreement (x) any solicitations, discussions or negotiations with any Person (other than Parent and its Representatives) that has made or indicated an intention to make an Acquisition Proposal as of or prior to the date of this Agreement and (y) any other solicitations, discussions or negotiations relating to a transaction of the type referred to in the definition of Acquisition Proposal.

   ##### 

  

   

Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal, the Company shall
deliver to Parent a written notice advising it that the Company Board has
made such determination, specifying the material terms and conditions of such
Superior Proposal and the identity of the Person making such Superior
Proposal, and attaching such written Superior Proposal or a written summary of
any such oral Superior Proposal (such notice, a " _Notice of Superior
Proposal_ "). The Company agrees that neither it nor any of the Subsidiaries
shall modify, amend, terminate, waive or release any confidentiality or
standstill agreement to which the Company or any Subsidiary is a party and
that relates to a business combination involving the Company or any
Subsidiary or the assets of the Company or any Subsidiary without Parents
prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed, except that Parents prior written consent shall not be
required in connection with any such action if the Company Board (or any
committee thereof) determines in good faith (after consultation with its
independent financial advisor and upon the advice of its outside legal
counsel) that it is required to do so in order to comply with its fiduciary
duties under applicable law and it provides concurrent notice of such action
to Parent. 

   

 (c) _Change in Recommendation_. Except as set forth in this _Section 6.05(c)_, the Company Board and the Independent Committee shall not (i) withdraw, or modify or change in a manner adverse to Parent and Merger Co, the approval or recommendation of this Agreement or the Merger by the Company Board (or any committee thereof); (ii) approve, adopt or recommend any Acquisition Proposal; or (iii) approve or recommend, or allow the Company or any Subsidiary to enter into, any letter of intent, acquisition agreement or other similar agreement with respect to, or that is reasonably expected to result in, any Acquisition Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement expressly permitted by _Section 6.05(b)_). Notwithstanding the foregoing, (x) in response to the receipt of an unsolicited Acquisition Proposal, if the Company Board (or any committee thereof) (A) determines in good faith (after consultation with its independent financial advisor) that such Acquisition Proposal is credible and is a Superior Proposal and (B) determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that it is required to do so in order to comply with its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company under applicable law, then the Company Board may approve and recommend such Superior Proposal and, in connection with such Superior Proposal, withdraw, or modify or change in a manner adverse to Parent and Merger Co, the Company Board Recommendation, _provided_ , _however_ , that (1) the Company shall have first provided at least three (3) Business Days prior written notice to Parent of its intent to take such action, and Parent does not make, after being provided with reasonable opportunity to negotiate with the Company and its Representatives, within three (3) Business Days of receipt of such written notification, an offer that the Company Board determines, in good faith (after consultation with its independent financial advisor and legal counsel), is at least as favorable to the Company and its stockholders as the applicable Acquisition Proposal, (2) during such three (3)-Business Day period, the Company shall negotiate in good faith with Parent (to the extent Parent wishes to negotiate) to enable Parent to make such an offer, and (3), in the event of any amendment to the financial or other material terms of such Superior Proposal, the Company Board shall deliver to Parent an additional written Notice of Superior Proposal, and the three (3)-Business Day period referenced above shall be extended for an additional three (3) Business Days after Parents receipt of such additional Notice of Superior Proposal, and (y) other than in connection with an Acquisition Proposal, if the Company Board determines in good faith (after first providing Parent with at least three (3) Business Days notice of its intent to take such action, including the reasons therefor, and consultation with its independent financial advisor and upon the advice of its outside legal counsel) that it is required to do so in order to comply with its fiduciary duties under applicable law, then the Company Board may withdraw, or modify or change in a manner adverse to Parent and Merger Co, the Company Board Recommendation (either event described in the foregoing clauses (x) and (y), a " _Change in Board Recommendation_ "). Any action by the Company Board or a committee thereof that is or becomes disclosed publicly that is intended to indicate that the Company Board (or any committee thereof) does not unconditionally support adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders of the Company or does not believe that the Merger and the Agreement are in the best 

   ##### 

  

   

interests of the stockholders of the Company shall be deemed for all purposes
of this Agreement to be a Change in Board Recommendation. 

   

 (d) _Certain Disclosures_. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the Company Board from taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making any legally required disclosure to the Companys stockholders in connection with an Acquisition Proposal if the Company Board (or any committee thereof) determines in good faith (after consultation with its independent financial advisor and upon the advice of its outside legal counsel) that it is required to do so under applicable law; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall this _Section 6.05(d)_ affect the obligations of the Company specified in _Sections 6.05(b)_ and  _6.05(c)_. If Company Board fails to recommend against acceptance of a tender or exchange offer for any Shares that constitutes an Acquisition Proposal (other than by Parent or any of its Affiliates), including, for these purposes, by remaining neutral and expressing no opinion or stating that it is for any reason unable to take a position with respect to the acceptance of such tender or exchange offer by its stockholders, within ten (10) Business Days after commencement thereof (or prior to the date of the Company Stockholder Meeting, if sooner), such failure shall be deemed for all purposes of this Agreement to be a Change in Board Recommendation. 

   

 (e) _Acquisition Proposal Definition_. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means any proposal or offer (including any proposal from or to the Companys stockholders) from any Person or group other than Parent or any affiliate of Parent relating to (i) any direct or indirect acquisition or purchase, in a single transaction or series of transactions by such Person or group acting in concert, of (A) more than 20% of the fair market value (as determined in good faith by the Company Board) of the assets (including capital stock of the Subsidiaries), or of a portion of the business representing 20% of the fair market value (as determined in good faith by the Company Board) of the net revenues or net income, of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (B) over 20% of any class of equity securities of the Company (including any tender or exchange offer that, if consummated, would have such a result); or (ii) any merger, consolidation, reorganization, business combination, recapitalization, share exchange, liquidation, dissolution or other similar transaction involving the Company or any of the Subsidiaries, as a result of which any Person or group acting in concert would acquire the assets, securities or businesses described in any of clauses (A) or (B) above.

 (ii) if any Governmental Entity shall have enacted, issued, promulgated, enforced or entered any injunction, order, decree or ruling or taken any other action (including the failure to have taken an action) that, in either such case, has become final and non-appealable and has the effect of making consummation of the Merger illegal or otherwise preventing or prohibiting consummation of the Merger; _provided_ , _however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.01(b)(ii)_ shall not be available to the party whose failure to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement has been the cause of, or resulted in, the imposition of

resolved or lifted, as applicable; or 

   

 (iii) if this Agreement shall fail to receive the Stockholder Approval at the Company Stockholders Meeting (as such may be postponed or adjourned). 

  

 (c) _Termination by Parent_. By Parent: 

    

 (i) if it and Merger Co are not in breach of their obligations under this Agreement, and if (A) any of the representations and warranties of the Company herein would fail to be true and correct as of the Effective Time, as though made on and as of the Effective Time, such that _Section 7.02(a)_ would not be satisfied, or (B) there has been a breach on the part of the Company of any of its covenants or agreements herein such that _Section 7.02(b)_ would not be satisfied, and, in either such case, written notice of an intent to terminate based on such failure or breach has been provided to the Company and such failure or breach has not been, or cannot be, cured within 30 days after notice thereof to the Company; or

    #####

stockholders) than this Agreement (taking into account any alterations to
this Agreement agreed to in writing by Parent in response thereto).

   ##### 

  

   

Company shall pay to Parent an amount equal to the Company Termination Fee,
such payment to be made upon the earliest of the date of such communication
or of the entering into of such an agreement providing for, or consummating,

 (c) _Payment of Company Termination Fee_. The Company Termination Fee shall be paid by the Company as directed by Parent in writing in immediately available funds (i) concurrently with and as a condition to the effectiveness of a termination of this Agreement by the Company pursuant to _Section 8.01(d)(ii)_ and (ii) within two (2) Business Days after the date of the event giving rise to the obligation to make such payment in all other circumstances. 

   

 (d) _Company Termination Fee_. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Company Termination Fee_ " means an amount equal to 3.00% of the Merger Consideration. 

   

 (e) _Parent Termination Fee; Reimbursement of Platinum Fee_.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Companys right to receive payment of the Parent Termination Fee and an amount equal to the Platinum Fee paid by the Company pursuant to and on the terms and conditions set forth in this 

    ##### 

  

    

 _Section 8.03_ shall be the exclusive remedy of the Company and the
Subsidiaries against Parent, Merger Co or any of their respective
stockholders, partners, members, directors, officers or agents, or any other
of their respective Representatives, for the loss suffered as a result of
(and no decree of specific performance or any other equitable remedy shall be

 (c) _Certain References and Interpretation of Terms_. When a reference is made in this Agreement to an Article or Section, Schedule or Exhibit, such reference shall be to an Article, Section, Schedule or Exhibit of this Agreement, respectively, unless otherwise indicated. Whenever the words "include", "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation". The words "hereof", "herein" and "hereunder" and words of similar import when used in this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not any particular provision of this Agreement. The words "date hereof" shall refer to the date of this Agreement. The term "or" is not exclusive. The word "extent" in the phrase "to the extent" shall mean the degree to which a subject or thing extends, and such phrase shall not mean simply "if". The definitions contained in this Agreement are applicable to the singular as well as the plural forms of such terms. References to "the Agreement" include the Company Disclosure Schedule. References to a Person are also to its permitted successors and assigns. Whenever the context may require, any pronoun includes the corresponding masculine, feminine and neuter forms. 

   

 Section 9.04. _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law, or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect, so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

 Section 9.05. _Disclaimer of Other Representations and Warranties; Company Disclosure Schedules_. 

  

 (a) Parent, Merger Co and the Company each acknowledges and agrees that, except for the representations and warranties expressly set forth in this Agreement, (i) no party makes, and has not made, any representations or warranties relating to itself or its businesses or otherwise in connection with the Merger, (ii) no Person has been authorized by any party to make any representation or warranty relating to itself or its businesses or otherwise in connection with the Merger and, if made, such representation or warranty must not be relied upon as having been authorized by such party, and (iii) any estimates, projections, predictions, data, financial information, memoranda, presentations or any other materials or information provided or addressed to any party or any of its Representatives are not and shall not be deemed to be or to include representations or warranties unless any such materials or information is the subject of a representation or warranty expressly set forth in this Agreement. 

   

 (b) The representations and warranties contained in _Article III_ are qualified by reference to the Company Disclosure Schedule. Each of Parent and Merger Co acknowledges that (i) the Company Disclosure Schedule may include items or information that the Company is not required to disclose under this Agreement; (ii) disclosure of such items or information shall not affect, directly or indirectly, the scope of the disclosure obligation of the Company under this Agreement; and (iii) inclusion of information in the Company Disclosure Schedule shall not be construed as an admission that such information is material to the Company and the Subsidiaries. Similarly, in such matters where a representation or warranty is given or other information is provided, the disclosure of any matter in the Company Disclosure Schedule shall not imply that any other undisclosed matter having a greater value or other significance is material. Each of Parent and Merger Co further acknowledges that (iv) headings have been inserted on Sections of the Company Disclosure Schedule for the convenience of reference only and shall not affect the construction or interpretation of any of the provisions of this Agreement or the Company Disclosure Schedule, (v) cross references that may be contained in Sections of the Company Disclosure Schedule to other Sections of the Company Disclosure Schedule are not all-inclusive of all disclosures contained on such referenced Sections of the Company Disclosure Schedule and (vi) information contained in various Sections of the Company Disclosure Schedule may be applicable to other Sections of the Company Disclosure Schedule; accordingly, every matter, document or item referred to, set forth or described in one Section of the Company Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to be disclosed under each and every part, category, heading or subheading of such Section and all other Sections of the Disclosure Schedule and shall be deemed to qualify the representations and warranties of the Company in this Agreement, to the extent such matter, document or item may apply if (A) a cross-reference to such other Section of the Company Disclosure Schedule is made or (B) the relevance of such disclosure to such other Section of the Company Disclosure Schedule is readily apparent. 

   

 Section 9.06. _Entire Agreement; Assignment_. This Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersede all prior agreements and undertakings, both written and oral, among the parties, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof. This Agreement shall not be assigned (whether pursuant to a merger, by operation of law or otherwise);  _provided_ , _however_ , that this Agreement may be assigned by Parent upon delivery of written notice thereof to the Company, without abrogating Parents obligations hereunder, to any Affiliate of Parent. 

  

 Section 9.07. _Parties in Interest_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto, and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement, other than as expressly contemplated by  _Section 6.06_ (which is intended to be for the benefit of the Persons covered thereby and may be enforced by such Persons).

The parties hereby (a) submit to such exclusive jurisdiction of the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware or any federal court sitting in Delaware, for the purpose of any Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement brought by any party hereto, and (b) irrevocably waive, and agree not to assert by way of motion, defense, or otherwise, in any such Action, any claim that it is not subject personally to the jurisdiction of the above-named courts, that its property is exempt or immune from attachment or execution, that the Action is brought in an inconvenient forum, that the venue of the Action is improper, or that this Agreement or the Merger may not be enforced in or by any of the above-named courts. 

  

 Section 9.09. _Waiver of Jury Trial_.
