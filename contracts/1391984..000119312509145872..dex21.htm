Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer as soon as

may, without the consent of the Company, (A) extend the Offer for one or more
periods of time of up to twenty Business Days per extension if at any
scheduled expiration of the Offer any of the Offer Conditions are not
satisfied, until such time as such Offer Conditions are satisfied or waived or
(B) elect to provide a subsequent offering period for the Offer in accordance
with Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act, _provided_ that Purchaser shall not

be extended to the extent required by Law in connection with such increase in
the Offer Price, in each case without the consent of the Company.

(iii) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Purchaser shall
extend the Offer at the request of the Company on one or more occasions for
periods determined by Purchaser of up to twenty Business Days per extension

_Annex A_ , provided that Purchaser shall not be obligated to extend the Offer
pursuant to this clause (1) past the Termination Date; (2) the Offer Condition
set forth in _Paragraph 2(d)_ of _Annex A_ , if the inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties of the Company that caused the condition set
forth in _Paragraph 2(d)_ of _Annex A_ to not be satisfied are curable by the
Company through the exercise of commercially reasonable efforts within
thirty (30) calendar days, _provided_ that Purchaser shall not be obligated
to extend the Offer pursuant to this clause (2) if after the thirty (30)

Company of such inaccuracies, such inaccuracies are not cured by the Company
unless Parent or Purchaser is in material breach of any covenant or agreement
of Parent or Purchaser set forth in this Agreement; or (3)the Offer Condition
set forth in _Paragraph 2(e) _ of _Annex A_ , if the breach of the covenant
or agreement of the Company that caused the condition set forth in _Paragraph
2(e)_ of _Annex A_ to not be satisfied is curable by the Company through the
exercise of commercially reasonable efforts within thirty (30) calendar days,
provided that Purchaser shall not be obligated to extend the Offer pursuant to
this clause (3) if after the thirty (30) calendar day period after delivery of
written notice from Parent to the Company of such breach, such breach is not
cured by the Company unless Parent or Purchaser is in material breach of any

the SEC or the staff thereof or Nasdaq applicable to the Offer.

on the date of the Amended Offer Documents, together with all amendments
and supplements thereto, the " _Schedule 14D-9_ ") reflecting the terms of
this Agreement and containing, subject to _Section 7.7_, the Company Board
Recommendation. The Company hereby consents to the inclusion of the
Company Board Recommendation in the Amended Offer Documents (it being
understood that such consent shall not be deemed to limit the Company Boards
rights under _Section 7.7_)) and to the inclusion of a copy of the Schedule

stockholders. Parent and Purchaser shall be given a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment on the Schedule 14D-9 prior to its filing with the SEC. The

assistance (including periodic updates of such information) as Parent or
Purchaser or their agents may reasonably request in communicating the Offer to
the record and beneficial holders of the Shares. Subject to the
requirements of applicable Law, and except for such actions as are reasonably
necessary to disseminate the Amended Offer Documents and otherwise to perform
its obligations hereunder, Purchaser shall hold all information and documents
provided to it under this Section 2.3 in confidence in accordance with the
provisions of Section 7.9, and shall use such information and documents only
in connection with the Offer, and if this Agreement shall have been terminated
Parent and Purchaser shall deliver to the Company all such information and
documents (and all copies thereof).

(a) Promptly upon the purchase by Purchaser pursuant to the Offer of such
number of Shares as represents at least a majority of the then-outstanding
Shares, and from time to time thereafter, Purchaser shall be entitled to
designate such number of directors, rounded up to the next whole number, on
the Company Board as will give Purchaser representation on the Company Board
equal to the product of (x) the total number of directors on the Company
Board (after giving effect to any increase in the number of directors pursuant
to this Section 2.4) and (y) the percentage that such number of Shares so
purchased bears to the total number of Shares outstanding, and the Company
shall, upon request by Purchaser, promptly increase the size of the Company
Board or use its reasonable best efforts to secure the resignations of such
number of directors as is necessary to provide Purchaser with such level of
representation and shall cause Purchasers designees to be so elected or
appointed. The Company shall also use its reasonable best efforts to cause
individuals designated by Purchaser to constitute the same percentage of each
committee of the Company Board as the percentage of the entire Company Board
represented by individuals designated by Purchaser. The Companys obligations
to appoint designees to the Company Board shall be subject to Section 14(f)
of the Exchange Act. The Company shall take all actions necessary to effect
any such election or appointment of Purchasers designees, including mailing
to its stockholders the information required by Section 14(f) of the Exchange
Act and Rule 14f-l promulgated thereunder which, unless Purchaser otherwise
elects, shall be so mailed together with the Schedule 14D-9. Parent and
Purchaser will supply to the Company all information with respect to
themselves and their respective officers, directors and Affiliates required by
Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-l promulgated thereunder.

(b) Following the election or appointment of Purchasers designees pursuant to
_Section 2.4(a)_ and prior to the Effective Time, any amendment or
termination of this Agreement requiring action by the Company Board, any
extension of time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts
of Parent or Purchaser under this Agreement, any waiver of compliance
with any of the agreements or conditions under this Agreement that are for
the benefit of the Company, any exercise of the Companys rights or remedies
under this Agreement, any action to seek to enforce any obligation of Parent
or Purchaser under this Agreement (or any other action by the Company Board
with respect to this Agreement or the Merger if such other action adversely
affects, or could reasonably be expected to adversely affect, any of the
holders of Shares other than Parent or Purchaser) may only be authorized by,
and will require the authorization of, a majority of the directors of the
Company then in office who are directors of the Company on the date hereof or
their successors as appointed by such continuing directors (the " _Continuing
Directors_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that if there shall be no Continuing
Directors as a result of such individuals deaths, disabilities, resignations
or refusals to serve, then such actions may be effected by majority vote of
the Independent Directors, or, if no Independent Directors are then in office,
by a majority vote of the Company Board.



 

13 (c) In the event that Parents designees are elected or appointed to the
Company Board pursuant to _Section 2.4(a)_, until the Effective Time, (i)
the Company Board shall have at least such number of directors as may be
required by the Nasdaq rules or the federal securities Laws who are considered
independent directors within the meaning of such rules and Laws ("
_Independent Directors_ ") and (ii) each committee of the Company Board that
is required (or a majority of which is required) by the Nasdaq rules or the
federal securities Laws to be composed solely of Independent Directors shall
be so composed; _provided_ , _however_ , that in such event, if the number of
Independent Directors shall be reduced below the number of directors as may be
required by such rules or Laws for any reason whatsoever, the remaining
Independent Director(s) shall be entitled to designate persons to fill such
vacancies who shall be deemed to be Independent Directors for purposes of this
Agreement or, if no other Independent Director then remains, the other
directors shall designate such number of directors as may be required by the
Nasdaq rules and the federal securities Laws, to fill such vacancies who shall
not be stockholders or Affiliates of Parent or Purchaser, and such
Persons shall be deemed to be Independent Directors for purposes of this
Agreement.

Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of

Stock:

(a) _Purchaser Capital Stock_. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per
share, of Purchaser issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be converted into one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable

Corporation.

(b) _Company Capital Stock_.

(i) Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than any Dissenting Company Shares),
including any Company Restricted Stock that shall have ceased, as a result of
or immediately prior to the Effective Time, to be unvested or  



 

15  subject to a repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or other condition
pursuant to the terms of such Company Stock Award or other agreement governing
such Company Restricted Stock (which shall include any vesting as a result of
any termination of employment or transaction contemplated by employee

Stock, each share of Company Common Stock owned by Parent, any Subsidiary of
Parent, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of the Company, in each case as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be cancelled and
extinguished without any conversion thereof or consideration paid therefor.

(vi) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, all
shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time and held by a stockholder who shall have neither voted in
favor of the Merger nor consented thereto in writing and who shall have
properly and validly exercised such stockholders statutory rights of
appraisal in respect of such shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with
Section 262 of the DGCL (" _Dissenting Company Shares_ ") shall not be
converted into, or represent the right to receive, the Merger Consideration
pursuant to this _Section 3.7_. Any such stockholder shall be entitled to
receive payment of the appraised value of such Dissenting Company Shares in
accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL;  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing, all Dissenting Company Shares
held by a stockholder who shall have failed to perfect or who shall have
effectively withdrawn or lost such stockholders statutory right to appraisal
of such Dissenting Company Shares under such Section 262 of the DGCL shall
thereupon be deemed to have been converted into, and to have become
exchangeable for, the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without any
interest thereon, upon surrender of the certificate or certificates that
formerly evidenced such shares of Company Common Stock in the manner set forth
in _Section 3.9_. The Company shall give Parent (x) prompt notice of any
written demands for appraisal received by the Company, withdrawals of such
demands, and any other instruments served pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL
and received by the Company in respect of Dissenting Company Shares and (y)
the opportunity and right (at Parents election) to direct and control all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the
DGCL in respect of Dissenting Company Shares. The Company shall not, except
with the prior written consent of Parent or as required by an Order of a
Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction, voluntarily make any payment
with respect to any demands for appraisal or settle or offer to settle any
such demands for payment in respect of Dissenting Company Shares.

3.8 _Company Stock Awards_.

(a) At the Effective Time, each Company Option that is outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time, whether or not then vested or exercisable (each,
an " _Assumed Option_ "), shall be assumed by Parent.  



 

16  In accordance with its terms and subject to the requirements of Section 422
of the Code, each Assumed Option shall (i) be converted into an option to
acquire that number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product
obtained by multiplying (x) the number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to such Company Option, and (y) the Option Exchange Ratio, rounded
down to the nearest whole share of Parent Common Stock, and (ii) have an
exercise price per share equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the
per share exercise price of Company Common Stock subject to such Assumed
Option, by (y) the Option Exchange Ratio (which price per share shall be
rounded up to the nearest whole cent). Each Assumed Option shall otherwise be
subject to the same terms and conditions (including as to vesting and
exercisability) as were applicable under the respective Company Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time. It is the intention of the parties
that each Assumed Option that qualified as an incentive stock option (as
defined in Section 422 of the Code) shall continue to so qualify, to the
maximum extent permissible, following the Effective Time.

(b) At the Effective Time, each Company Restricted Stock Unit that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted by
Parent in accordance with its terms into a restricted stock unit (each, an "
_Assumed Restricted Stock Unit_ ") to acquire an amount of
Merger Consideration equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the
number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Restricted
Stock Unit, and (y) the Merger Consideration. Each Assumed Restricted Stock
Unit shall otherwise be subject to the same terms and conditions as were
applicable under the respective Company Restricted Stock Unit immediately
prior to the Effective Time, including, without limitation, that the right to
receive Merger Consideration payable with respect to the Assumed Restricted
Stock Unit following the Effective Time will be subject to the same vesting
restrictions that were applicable to the Company Restricted Stock Unit
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(c) The payout of the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 3.7(b)_ in
exchange for shares of Company Common Stock that constitute unvested
restricted stock or are otherwise subject to a right of repurchase or
redemption by the Company (the " _Company Restricted Stock_ ") issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be subject to the
same restrictions and vesting arrangements that were applicable to such shares
of unvested Company Common Stock immediately prior to or at the Effective
Time, subject to the terms of the applicable agreement governing such shares.

(d) Prior to the Closing, and subject to prior review and approval by Parent
(which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), the Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts to take all actions necessary to effect
the transactions anticipated by this _Section 3.8_ under all Contracts
relating to Company Options, Restricted Stock Units and Company Restricted
Stock including specifically obtaining any required consents and delivering
all required notices.

3.9 _Exchange Fund; Exchange of Shares_.

(a) _Exchange Fund_.

(i) Parent shall appoint a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the
Company to act as the exchange agent for the Merger (the " _Exchange Agent_
") pursuant to an agreement reasonably acceptable to the Company entered into
prior to the earlier of (i) date on which, if necessary, Parent and the
Company disseminate the Proxy Statement or (ii) the Closing.

(ii) At or prior to the Closing, Parent shall deposit (or cause to be
deposited) with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the holders of shares
of Company Common Stock, for exchange in accordance with the terms and
conditions of this _Article III_ , cash in an amount sufficient to pay the
Merger Consideration payable pursuant to  _Section 3.7(b)(i)_. All cash
deposited with the Exchange Agent pursuant hereto shall hereinafter be
referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_." Pursuant to irrevocable instructions,
the Exchange Agent shall promptly deliver the Merger Consideration from the
Exchange Fund to the former Company stockholders who are entitled thereto
pursuant to _Section 3.7_.



 

17 (b) _Exchange Procedures_.

(i) Promptly following the Effective Time, Parent and Purchaser shall cause
the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record (as of immediately prior
to the Effective Time) of a certificate that represented outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (a "
_Certificate_ "), and each holder of record of uncertificated shares of
Company Common Stock represented by book-entry shares (" _Book-Entry Shares_
") as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, (A) a letter of transmittal
in customary form (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and
risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of
the Certificates to the Exchange Agent), and (B) instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of Certificates (or Book-Entry Shares) in exchange
for the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof (in accordance with
_Section 3.7(b)_).

(ii) Upon surrender of Certificates for cancellation to the exchange Agent
(or upon receipt of an appropriate agents message in the case of Book-Entry
Shares), together with a letter of transmittal, properly completed and validly
executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, the holders of such
Certificates and Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor the cash amounts such holders are entitled to receive pursuant to
_Section 3.7(b)_, and any Certificates or Book-Entry Shares so surrendered
shall forthwith be canceled. The Exchange Agent shall accept such Certificates
and Book-Entry Shares upon compliance with such reasonable terms and
conditions as the Exchange Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange
thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices. No interest shall be
paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares on any cash amounts payable upon the surrender of such Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares pursuant to this _Section 3.9_. Until so surrendered,
outstanding Certificates and Book-Entry Shares shall be deemed, from and after
the Effective Time, to evidence only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration payable in respect thereof. Exchange of Book-Entry Shares shall
be effected in accordance with the customary procedures in respect of shares
represented by book entry on the stock ledger of the Company.

(c) _[Reserved]_.

(d) _[Reserved]_.

(e) _Required Withholding_. Each of the Exchange Agent, Parent and the
Surviving Entity shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
consideration payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement to
any holder or former holder of shares of Company Common Stock such amounts
that are required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under United States
federal or state, local or foreign Tax law. Parent shall timely pay the
amounts withheld to the appropriate Tax authority. To the extent that such
amounts are so deducted or withheld and paid out to the appropriate Tax
authority, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement
as having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have
been paid.

(f) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, none of the Exchange Agent, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
any other party hereto shall be liable to a holder of shares of Parent Common
Stock or Company Common Stock for any amount properly paid to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Laws.

(g) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. At the request of Parent, any portion of
the Exchange Fund which remains undistributed or unclaimed on the date that
is six (6) months immediately following the Effective Time shall be delivered
to Parent, and any holders of the Certificates who have not theretofore
surrendered Certificates in compliance with this  _Section_ _3.9_ shall
thereafter look only to Parent for payment of the Merger Consideration payable
in respect thereto pursuant to _Section 3.7(b)_.

3.10 _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. Subject to the
provisions of _Section 3.7_, from and after the Effective Time, all shares of
Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and  



 

18  shall automatically be cancelled, retired and cease to exist, and each
holder of a Certificate theretofore representing any shares of Company Common
Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right
to receive the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to
_Section 3.7(b)_ upon the surrender thereof in accordance with the provisions
of  _Section 3.9_. The Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender for
exchange of shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms
hereof, shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock, and there shall be no
further registration of transfers on the records of the Surviving Corporation
of shares of Company Common Stock which were outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time other than transfers to reflect, in accordance with
customary settlement procedures, trades effected prior to the Effective Time.
If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented
to Parent or the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled
and exchanged as provided in this _Article III_.

3.11 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent
shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the Merger
Consideration that is payable in respect thereof pursuant to _Section
3.7(b)_; _provided_ , however, that Parent and/or the Exchange Agent may, in
its discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require
the owners of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond
in such sum as it may reasonably direct (consistent with market practice) as
an indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or the Exchange Agent with respect to the Certificates alleged to
have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

3.12 _Tax Treatment_. The Merger is intended to constitute a taxable
transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

3.13 _Taking of Necessary Further Action_. If, at any time after the
Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full
right, title and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges,
powers and franchises of the Company and Purchaser, the directors and
officers of the Company and Purchaser shall take all such lawful and necessary
action.

Except (i) as disclosed in the Company SEC Reports filed with the SEC from and
after March 13, 2009 and prior to the date hereof (other than as set forth in

therein) or (ii) as set forth in the disclosure letter delivered by the
Company to NetApp, Inc. on May 20, 2009 in connection with the NetApp
Merger Agreement as originally executed (the " _Company Disclosure Schedule_
"), which identifies by reference to, or has been grouped under a heading
referring to, a specific section of this Agreement (with sections of the
Company Disclosure Schedule deemed to be changed to the extent necessary to
account for differences in Section numbering between this Agreement and the
NetApp Merger Agreement as originally executed) and constitutes an exception
hereto and disclosure made pursuant to any section of the Company Disclosure
Schedule shall be deemed to be disclosed against each of the other sections of
this Agreement to the extent the applicability of the disclosure to such other
section is readily apparent from the disclosure made (without reference to
the underlying documents referenced therein), the Company hereby represents
and warrants to Parent and Purchaser as follows:

4.1 _Organization and Standing_.

(a) The Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under Delaware Law. The Company has the requisite corporate power and
authority to carry on its respective business as it is presently being
conducted and to own, lease or operate its respective properties and assets.



 

19 (b) The Company is duly qualified to do business and is in good standing in
each jurisdiction where the character of its properties owned or leased or
the nature of its activities make such qualification necessary (to the extent
the "good standing" concept is applicable in the case of any jurisdiction
outside the United States), except where the failure to be so qualified or in
good standing would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company. The copies of the certificate of incorporation
and bylaws of the Company that are filed as exhibits to the Companys Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2008 (the "
_Company Form 10-K_ ") are complete and correct copies thereof as in effect on
the date hereof, and (b) all actions taken by written consent and all minutes

(a) The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority to execute and
deliver this Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder, and subject to
obtaining the Requisite Merger Approval, to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the
Company, the performance by the Company of its obligations hereunder, and
the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby have
been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the
Company other than, in the case of the consummation of the Merger, (i) the
filing with the SEC of a proxy statement with respect to and obtaining the
Requisite Merger Approval and (ii) the filing of the Certificate of Merger as
required by the DGCL, and no additional corporate or other actions or
proceedings on the part of the Company are necessary to authorize this
Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. This
Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming
the due authorization, execution and delivery by Parent and Purchaser,
constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable
against the Company in accordance with its terms, except that such
enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency (including,
without limitation, all laws relating to fraudulent transfers),
reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws affecting or relating to
creditors rights generally and is subject to general principles of equity
(regardless of whether enforcement is considered in a proceeding in equity or
at law).

(b) At a meeting duly called and held on or prior to the date hereof,
the Company Board unanimously (i) determined that this Agreement, the Offer
and the Merger are advisable, (ii) determined that this Agreement is fair to,
and in the best interests of, the Companys stockholders, (iii) approved

forth in _Section 5.10_ are accurate, the affirmative vote of the holders of
a majority of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, voting together
as a class, in favor of the Merger Proposal (the " _Requisite
Merger Approval_ ") is the only vote of the holders of any class or series of
Company Capital Stock necessary (under applicable Laws or otherwise) to adopt
the "agreement of merger" (as such term is used in Section 251 of the
DGCL) set forth in this Agreement and consummate the Merger.

4.3 _Non-contravention; Required Consents_.

(a) The execution, delivery or performance by the Company of this Agreement,
the consummation of the Offer, the consummation by the Company of the Merger
and the compliance by the Company with any  



 

20  of the terms hereof do not and will not (i) violate or conflict with any
provision of the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Company or
other equivalent charter documents of any of the Companys Subsidiaries, (ii)
subject to obtaining such Consents set forth in _Section 4.3(a)(ii)_ of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, violate, conflict with, or result in the breach
of or constitute a default (or an event which with notice or lapse of time or
both would become a default) under, or result in the termination of, or
accelerate the performance required by, or result in a right of termination or
acceleration under, any Material Contract, (iii) subject to obtaining the
Requisite Merger Approval, violate or conflict with any Law or Order
applicable to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or by which any of their
properties or assets are bound or (iv) result in the creation of any Lien
upon any of the properties or assets of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, except, in the case of each of clauses (ii), (iii) and (iv)
above, for such violations, conflicts, breaches, defaults, terminations,
accelerations or Liens which would not, individually or in the aggregate, have
a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

(b) No consent, approval, Order or authorization of, or filing or registration
with, or notification to (any of the foregoing being a " _Consent_ "), any
Governmental Authority is required on the part of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries in connection with the execution, delivery and performance by the
Company of this Agreement and the consummation by the Company of the
transactions contemplated hereby, except (i) applicable requirements, if any,
of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, state securities laws, the rules and

Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, (iii) compliance
with any applicable requirements of the HSR Act and any applicable foreign
antitrust, competition or merger control laws and (iv) such other Consents,

be reasonably expected to have a material adverse effect on the ability of
Parent or the Company to consummate the Offer or the Merger.

(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of (i) 300,000,000
(Three Hundred Million) shares of Company Common Stock, and (ii) 20,000,000

issued or authorized the issuance of any shares of Company Capital Stock
other than pursuant to the exercise of Company Options or the settlement of
Company Restricted Stock Units granted under a Company Option Plan in

fully paid, nonassessable and free of any preemptive rights.

(b) The Company has reserved 6,606,629 (Six Million Six Hundred Six Thousand

Company, being referred to collectively as " _Company Securities_ ") and (v)
no other obligations by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to make any

option (and whether such option is subject to Section 409A of the Code), the
date on which such option was granted, the vesting schedule for such option
(including any acceleration provisions with respect thereto), including the

Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, including the provisions of
this Agreement, covering any employee, consultant or director of the Company

Disclosure Schedule, respectively, set forth a complete and accurate list, as
of the date hereof, of (i) all material "employee benefit plans" (as defined

most recent annual report on Form 5500 required to have been filed for each
Employee Plan, including any required schedules thereto; (B) the most recent

provides material welfare benefits that are not fully insured through an
insurance contract.

(c) Each Employee Plan has been maintained, operated and administered in
compliance in all material respects with its terms and with all applicable
Laws, including the applicable provisions of ERISA and the

Company, threatened on behalf of or against any Employee Plan, the assets of

procedure.

(f) None of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries, or, to the Knowledge of
the Company, any of their respective directors, officers, employees or
agents has, with respect to any Employee Plan, engaged in or been a party to
any non-exempt "prohibited transaction," as such term is defined in Section

employees of the Company or its ERISA Affiliates, other than pursuant to
Section 4980B of the Code or any similar Laws.

(h) Each Employee Plan that is intended to be "qualified" under Section 401
of the Code either has received a favorable determination letter from the IRS
to such effect, or has applied (or has time remaining in which to apply) to
the IRS for such a determination letter, and nothing has occurred since the
date of such determination letter that would reasonably be expected to
materially and adversely affect the qualified status of any such Employee
Plan.

(i) Neither the execution or delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will, either alone or in

(ii) materially increase the amount or value of any benefit or compensation
otherwise payable or required to be provided to any such director, employee or
independent contractor, or (iii) result in the acceleration of the time of

contract, agreement, plan or arrangement to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party or by which it is bound to compensate any current or
former employee or other disqualified individual for excise taxes which may
be required pursuant to Section 4999 of the Code.

(j) All Contracts of employment or for services with any employee of the
Company or any of it Subsidiaries who provide services outside the United
States (" _Foreign Employees_ "), or with any director, independent
contractor or consultant of or to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, can
be terminated by three (3) months notice or less given at any time without
giving rise to any material claim for damages, severance pay, or compensation
(other than a statutory redundancy payment required by applicable Laws).

4.16 _Labor Matters_.

(a) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any Contract
or arrangement between or applying to, one or more employees, independent
contractors or directors and a union, trade union, works council, group of
employees, independent contractors or directors or any other labor-relations
body or entity, for collective bargaining or other negotiation, consultation,
or other employment-related purposes or reflecting the outcome of such
collective bargaining or negotiation or consultation with respect to their
respective employees, independent contractors or directors with any labor
organization, union, group, association, works council or other labor-
relations body or entity, or is bound by any equivalent national or  



 

32  sectoral agreement (" _Collective Bargaining Agreements_ "), and no such
agreement is currently being negotiated by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries. The consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement will not entitle any third party (including any union, trade union,
works council, group of employees or any other labor-relations body or entity)
to any payments under any Collective Bargaining Agreement or require the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to consult with any union, trade union,
works council, group of employees or any other labor-relations body or entity.
To the Knowledge of the Company, there are no activities or proceedings by
any labor organization, union, group or association or representative thereof
to organize any such employees, independent contractors or directors. There
are no material lockouts, strikes, slowdowns, work stoppages, concerted
refusals to work overtime, or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threats
thereof by or with respect to any employees nor have there been any such
lockouts, strikes, slowdowns, work stoppages, or concerted refusals to work
over time. The Company and its Subsidiaries are not, nor have they been, a
party to any redundancy agreements (including social plans or job protection
plans). There are no material actions, suits, claims, labor disputes or
grievances pending or threatened or reasonably anticipated relating to any
labor matters involving any employee, independent contractor or director,
including charges of unfair labor practices. Neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries has engaged in any unfair labor practices within the meaning
of the National Labor Relations Act or any similar state or local law,
including any similar law of a non-U.S. jurisdiction.

(b) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries is in compliance in all material
respects with all applicable federal, state and local laws, rules and
regulations, and, to the Companys Knowledge, foreign laws, rules and
regulations, respecting employment, employment practices, terms and conditions
of employment, worker classification, tax withholding, prohibited
discrimination, equal employment, fair employment practices, meal and rest
periods, immigration status, employee safety and health, wages (including
overtime wages), compensation, and hours of work, and in each case, with

and reported all amounts required by law or by agreement to be withheld and

payments to employees, independent contractors or directors, (ii) is not
materially liable for any arrears of wages, severance pay or any Taxes or any
penalty for failure to comply with any of the foregoing, and (iii) is not

unemployment compensation benefits, social security or other benefits or
obligations for employees (other than routine payments to be made in the

Company nor any Subsidiary is party to a conciliation agreement, consent
decree or other agreement or Order with any Governmental Authority with
respect to employment practices. The services provided by each employee or
director in the U.S. is terminable at the will of the Company and its
Subsidiaries and any such termination would result in no liability to the
Company or any Subsidiary. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
has any material liability with respect to any misclassification of: (i) any
Person as an independent contractor rather than as an employee, (ii) any
employee leased from another employer, or (iii) any employee currently or
formerly classified as exempt from overtime wages.

(c) Neither the Company nor and Subsidiary has taken any action which would
constitute a "plant closing" or "mass layoff" within the meaning of WARN,
issued any notification of a plant closing or mass layoff required by WARN, or
incurred any liability or obligation under WARN that remains unsatisfied. No
terminations prior to the Closing would trigger any notice or other
obligations under WARN.

property. _Section 4.17(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule contains a
complete and accurate list, as of the date hereof, of all of the existing

accordance with their respective terms (except as such enforceability may be
subject to laws of general application relating to bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or other laws relating to creditors rights
generally, the relief of debtors and rules of law governing specific

default under, or has received written notice of any material breach of or

event has occurred that with notice or lapse of time or both would constitute

on the Company.

obligation under any Environmental Laws; (iii) has entered into any agreement
that may require it to guarantee, reimburse, pledge, defend, hold harmless or
indemnify any other party with respect to material liabilities arising out of
Environmental Laws or the Hazardous Substances related activities of the

Substances in, on, or under any properties owned, leased or used at any time
by the Company or each of its Subsidiaries such as could give rise to any
material liability or material corrective or remedial obligation of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries under any Environmental Laws.

4.19 _Assets; Personal Property_. The machinery, equipment, furniture,
fixtures and other tangible personal property and assets owned, leased
or used by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (the " _Assets_ ") are, in
the aggregate, sufficient and adequate to carry on their respective businesses

or any of its Subsidiaries alleging that the Company or any of its

proceeding made, conducted or brought by a third Person against the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, and, to the Knowledge of the Company, no such suit,
claim, action, investigation or proceeding has been filed or threatened,
alleging that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of its or their
current products or services or other operation of the Companys or its
Subsidiaries business infringes or violates the Intellectual Property Rights

circumstances that could reasonably be expected to give rise to such suit or

Intellectual Property in any material respect.

Agreement, including the assignment to Parent by operation of law or otherwise
of any Material Contracts to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is
a party, will result in (i) Parent or any of its Affiliates (other than

respect to any material Intellectual Property Right owned by, or licensed to,
any of them, that would not otherwise be granted in the absence of this

Affiliates (other than Company) or the Company being bound by, or subject to,
any non-compete or other material restriction on the operation or scope of
its businesses, or (iii) Parent or any of its Affiliates (other than Company)
or the Company being obligated to pay any royalties or other material amounts

_Open Source Materials_ ") (including the GNU General Public License and the

any other, use or distribution of open source software give rise to any rights
in any third parties under any Company Intellectual Property, or obligations
for the Company or its Subsidiaries with respect to any Company Intellectual
Property, including any obligation to disclose or distribute any Company
Source Code, to license any Company Intellectual Property for the purpose of
making derivative works or to distribute any Company Intellectual Property or
Company Product without charge.

Subsidiaries is in full force and effect, no notice of cancellation has been
received with respect thereto, and there is no existing default or event
which, with the giving of notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a
default, by any insured thereunder, except for such defaults that would not,
individually or in the aggregate, result in a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company. There is no material claim pending under any of such policies as to
which coverage has been denied or disputed by the underwriters of such
policies.

4.22 _Related Party Transactions_. Except (a) as set forth in any Company SEC
Report filed prior to the date hereof and (b) for compensation or other
employment arrangements in the ordinary course, there are no transactions,
agreements, arrangements or understandings between the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any Affiliate (including any officer or
director) thereof, but not including any wholly owned Subsidiary of the
Company, on the other hand.

4.23 _State Anti-Takeover Statutes_. Assuming that the representations of
Parent and the Purchaser set forth in _Section 5.10_ are accurate, the
Company Board has taken all necessary actions so that the restrictions
on business combinations set forth in Section 203 of the DGCL are not
applicable to this Agreement and the Merger or the Offer. To the Knowledge of
the Company, no other state takeover statute or similar statute or regulation
applies to or purports to apply to the Merger or the Offer.

4.24 _Brokers_. Except for Qatalyst Partners LP (a true and correct copy of
whose engagement letter will be made available to Parent prior to the
Purchase Time), there is no investment banker, broker, finder, agent or other
Person that has been retained by or is authorized to act on behalf of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries who is entitled to any financial advisors
brokerage, finders or any other fee or commission in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

4.25 _Opinion of Financial Advisor_. The Company has received the opinion of
Qatalyst Partners LP to the effect that as of the date of this Agreement and
based upon and subject to the matters set forth in such opinion, the Offer
Price and the Merger Consideration to be received by holders of shares of
Company Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement is fair, from a financial
point of view, to such holders and such opinion has not been withdrawn,
revoked or modified in any respect.

the Company or any of its Subsidiaries have made or entered into on or prior
to the date hereof, including any such arrangements whereby payments have
been, or may be or become, payable, and any benefits that have been or may be
granted, according to employment compensation, severance and other employee
benefit plans, contracts or arrangements (i) have been made or entered into
solely in consideration of, and any such payments are or may become payable
solely for, past services performed, future services to be performed or future
services to be refrained from performing (and matters incidental thereto) and
(ii) any such payments have not been and will not be calculated based on
the number of Shares tendered or to be tendered in the Offer. The (A)
adoption, approval, amendment or modification of each arrangement described
above since the discussions relating to the transactions contemplated hereby
between the Company and the Parent began has been approved as an employment
compensation, severance or other employee benefit arrangement solely by
independent directors of the Company in accordance with the requirements of
Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act and the instructions thereto and (B)
"safe harbor" provided pursuant to Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act is
otherwise applicable thereto as a result of the taking prior to the execution
of this Agreement of all necessary actions by the Company Board, the
Compensation Committee of the Company Board or its independent directors.

discussion, and (D) furnish the other party with copies of all

at the time of the Company Stockholder Meeting, contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of

foregoing, prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Company shall notify
each other as promptly as practicable upon becoming aware of any event or
circumstance which should be described in an amendment of, or supplement to,
the Proxy Statement or any Regulation M-A Filing so that any such document

opportunity to review and comment on such document or response, (ii) shall
include in such document or response all comments reasonably and timely
proposed by such other party and (iii) shall not file or mail such document or
respond to the SEC prior to receiving such other partys approval, which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

(e) The Schedule 14D9 will not, at the time the Schedule 14D9 is filed with
the SEC and at any time prior to the Purchase Time, contain any untrue

were made, not misleading.

(g) None of the Amended Offer Documents will, at the times such documents are
filed with the SEC and at any time prior to the Purchase Time, contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required
to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements made
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not
misleading. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent or Purchaser will not be
responsible under this _Section 7.5(g)_ with respect to information supplied
in writing by or on behalf of the Company or any Affiliate of the Company
expressly for inclusion therein. The Amended Offer Documents will, at the time
the Amended Offer Documents are filed with the SEC and, at the time they are

DGCL as contemplated by _Section 3.1(b)_, the Company shall establish a
record date for, call, give notice of, convene, hold, and take a vote of
stockholders on the adoption of the "agreement of merger" (as such term is
used in Section 251 of the DGCL) set forth in this Agreement in accordance
with the DGCL (the " _Merger Proposal_ ") at a meeting of the Companys
stockholders (the " _Company Stockholder Meeting_ ") as promptly as
practicable following the consummation of the Offer (which shall be within
forty five (45) days following the date on which the  



 

48  Proxy Statement is first disseminated to Companys stockholders unless
Parent shall otherwise consent to a different date). The Company shall use
its reasonable best efforts to solicit proxies from the Companys
stockholders and, unless the Company Board has effected a Company Board
Recommendation Change pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of _Section
7.7_, the Company Board shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the
Requisite Merger Approval at the Company Stockholder Meeting or any
postponement or adjournment thereof. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
set forth in this Agreement, the Company shall submit the "agreement of
merger" (as such term is used in Section 251 of the DGCL) set forth in this
Agreement to the Companys stockholders for adoption at the Company
Stockholder Meeting, and the Companys obligations under this _Section 7.6_
shall not be terminated, superseded, limited, modified or otherwise affected
by the commencement, disclosure, announcement or submission to the Company of
any Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Transaction, or by any Company Board
Recommendation Change (whether or not in compliance with the terms hereof).
Parent and Purchaser each agree that at the Company Stockholder Meeting, all
of the Shares acquired pursuant to the Offer and all other shares of Company
Common Stock otherwise owned by Parent, Purchaser or their respective
controlled affiliates will be voted in favor of the Merger. For the avoidance
of doubt, the Company shall not be required to hold the Company Stockholder
Meeting if this Agreement is validly terminated in accordance with _Section
9.1_.

(b) Prior to such time as designees of Parent constitute at least a majority
of the Company Board pursuant to _Section 2.4(a)_, the Company shall not
establish a record date for, call, give notice of, convene or hold any meeting
of the Companys stockholders;  _provided_ , however, that notwithstanding
the foregoing or anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the
Company may establish a record date for, call, give notice of, convene and
hold its annual meeting of stockholders for 2009 (the " _Annual Meeting_ ")
and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to hold the Annual Meeting
within thirteen (13) calendar months from the date of its annual meeting of
stockholders for 2008. At the Annual Meeting, (x) the Company may submit to a
vote of its stockholders (i) the election of directors to the Company Board
and (ii) the ratification of its independent public accounting firm, and (y)
the Company shall not propose for consideration or submit for a vote any
matters other than those set forth in the previous sentence and such other
matters which the Company is legally required to submit to a vote of its
stockholders at the Annual Meeting. Parent and the Company shall cooperate in
good faith to determine whether the Merger Proposal shall be considered at the
Annual Meeting in lieu of a special meeting, and in such event, the terms and
provisions of _Section 7.6(a)_ shall be qualified by the terms and
provisions of this _Section 7.6(b_).

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the
Company may adjourn or postpone the Company Stockholder Meeting solely (i) for
up to ten (10) Business Days, if the Company Board shall have determined in
good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that it is
necessary or appropriate to postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholder
Meeting in order to (A) give Company Stockholder sufficient time to evaluate
any information or disclosure that the Company has sent to Company
Stockholders or otherwise made available to Company Stockholders by issuing a
press release, filing materials with the SEC or otherwise (including in
connection with any Company Board Recommendation Change) or (B) to enable the
additional time to solicit proxies from Company Stockholders or (ii) if the
Company is required to postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting by
applicable Law, Order or a request from the SEC or its staff.

7.7 _Company Board Recommendation_.

(a) Subject to the terms of this _Section 7.7_, the Company Board shall
recommend that the Companys stockholders accept the Offer and adopt the
"agreement of merger" (as such term is used in Section 251 of the DGCL) set
forth in this Agreement in accordance with the applicable provisions of the
DGCL (the " _Company Board Recommendation_ ") at the Company Stockholder
Meeting. Neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (x)
withhold, withdraw, amend or modify, or publicly propose to withhold,
withdraw, amend or modify the Company Board Recommendation or (y) approve,
endorse or recommend, or publicly propose to approve, endorse or
recommend any Acquisition Proposal or agreement pursuant to which an
Acquisition Transaction would be consummated (any of the actions referred to
in the preceding  



 

49  clauses (x) and (y) being a " _Company Board Recommendation Change_ ");
_provided_ , _however_ , that a "stop, look and listen" communication by the
Company Board to the Company Stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) of the
Exchange Act shall not be deemed to be a Company Board Recommendation Change
if it is accompanied by a statement of the Company Board expressly and
publicly reaffirming the Company Board Recommendation in connection with such
statement or disclosure.

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing terms of this _Section 7.7_, at any time
prior to the Purchase Time, the Company Board may effect a Company Board
Recommendation Change (and disclose to the Company Stockholders that the
Company Board has effected a Company Board Recommendation Change) if the
conditions set forth below have been satisfied prior to effecting such Company
Board Recommendation Change:

(i) the Company Board shall have received an Acquisition Proposal (which has
not been withdrawn) in writing after the date hereof; 

(ii) the Company Board shall have given Parent prompt written notice (A) of
the identity of the Person(s) making such Acquisition Proposal and all of the
material terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal (and if such
Acquisition Proposal is in written form, a copy of such Acquisition Proposal
and all related agreements, commitment letters and other material documents
provided or otherwise furnished by the Person(s) making such Acquisition
Proposal in connection therewith) (it being agreed that in the event that
there is any material revision to the terms of an Acquisition Proposal,
including any revision in price, the Company shall promptly notify Parent of
any such material revision); and

(iii) the Company Board shall have determined in good faith (after
consultation with its financial advisor and its outside legal counsel) that
(A) such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and (B) in light
of such Superior Proposal, the failure to make a Company Board Recommendation
Change is reasonably likely to be a breach of its fiduciary duties to the
Companys stockholders under Delaware Law;

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing terms of this _Section 7.7_, at any time
prior to Purchase Time, the Company Board may effect a Company Board
Recommendation Change (and disclose to the Company Stockholders that the
Company Board has effected a Company Board Recommendation Change) for a reason
unrelated to an Acquisition Proposal (it being understood and agreed that
any Company Board Recommendation Change proposed to be made in relation to an
Acquisition Proposal may only be made pursuant to and in accordance with the
terms of _Section 7.7(b)_)if the conditions set forth below have been
satisfied prior to effecting such Company Board Recommendation Change:

(i) the Company Board shall have determined in good faith (after consultation
with its outside legal counsel) that the failure to make a Company Board
recommendation Change is reasonably likely to be a breach of its fiduciary
duties to the Companys stockholders under Delaware Law; and

(ii) the Company Board shall have given Parent prompt notice upon determining
that it intends to effect such Company Board Recommendation Change.

(d) Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company Board from taking and
disclosing to the Companys stockholders a position contemplated by Rule
14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act or complying with the provisions of Rule 14d-9
promulgated under the Exchange Act; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) any such
statement or other disclosure shall be subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, including the provisions of _Article IX_ , and (ii) any such
statement or disclosure (other than a "stop, look and listen communication" of
the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act, and within the
time period contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f)(3)) shall be deemed to be a Company
Board Recommendation Change unless it is accompanied by a statement of the
Company Board expressly and publicly reaffirming the Company Board
Recommendation in connection with such statement or disclosure.

the period commencing with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and

such litigation. The Company shall give Parent the opportunity to consult with

applicable), and each registration statement and other document, proposed to
be filed by the Company with the SEC during such period a reasonable period of
time prior to the filing of such reports or registration statements (and in
any event, at least two (2) Business Days prior to the filing thereof with
the SEC).

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, no
information obtained pursuant to the access granted or notification provided
pursuant to this _Section 7.8_ shall be deemed to  



 

51  (i) amend or otherwise modify in any respect any representation or warranty
of the party hereto providing such access or notice, (ii) impair or otherwise
prejudice in any manner rights of the party receiving such access or notice to
rely upon the conditions to the obligations of such party to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or (iii) impair or otherwise
limit the remedies available to the party receiving such access or notice.
The terms of _Section 7.9 _shall apply to any information acquired or
provided pursuant to this _Section 7.8_.

contemplated by this Agreement, the parties have exchanged certain
confidential and proprietary information (all such information. the "
_Confidential Materials_ "). The parties shall not, and shall cause their

or other material derived therefrom (collectively, " _Notes_ ") except in
furtherance of the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and (ii) disclose any Confidential Material or Notes other
than to those of the receiving partys Representatives with a need to know the

pursuant to applicable legal or regulatory requirements and not for any
operational or competitive uses in the retaining partys business.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the termination of this Agreement shall not
affect the parties obligations pursuant to this _Section 7.9_ or those of
their Representatives.

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the
obligations set forth in _Sections 7.9(a)_ and _(b)_ shall be inoperative as
to particular portions of the Confidential Material if such information (i)
becomes generally available to and known by the public other than as a result
of a disclosure by the receiving party or its Representatives in violation of
this Agreement, (ii) was available to the receiving party on a non-
confidential basis prior to its disclosure hereunder, (iii) becomes available
to the receiving party on a non-confidential basis from a source other than
the another party or its Representatives when such source is entitled to make
such disclosure or (iv) is independently designed or developed by the
receiving party or its Representatives entirely by people who did not have
access or actual knowledge of the Confidential Material.

(d) If any party or its Representatives are requested or required (by oral
questions, interrogatories, requests for information, subpoena, civil
investigative demand, or similar process) to disclose any Confidential
Material or Notes, such party will provide the other party or parties, as
applicable, with prompt written notice of such request(s) so that the other
party or parties, as applicable, may seek an appropriate protective order

a party or its Representatives are, in the opinion of counsel, required to
disclose Confidential Material or Notes, such party may disclose only that
portion of such information as such party is advised by counsel is legally
required without liability hereunder; _provided_ , that such party agrees to
exercise its reasonable efforts to obtain assurance that confidential
treatment will be accorded such information.



 

52 7.10 _Public Disclosure_. Except with regard to any press releases or public
statements made or proposed to be made by the Company pursuant to _Section
7.7_, each of Parent and the Company shall consult with the other before
issuing any press release or making any public announcement or statement with
respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, and shall
not issue any such press release or make any such public announcement or
statement without the prior written consent of the other party hereto, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned;
_provided_ , _however_ , that either Parent or the Company may, without the
prior consent of the other party hereto, issue any such press release or make
any such public announcement or statement as may be required by Law or
the rules and regulations of Nasdaq or the NYSE, as applicable, if such party
first notifies and (if practicable) consults with the other regarding the
timing and substance of such public announcement or statement.

7.11 _Employee Matters_.

(a) From and after the enrollment of Designated Employees in the employee
benefit plans, programs and policies of Parent, Parent shall provide the
Designated Employees with substantially similar types and levels of benefits
as those provided to similarly situated employees of Parent. Effective as of
the day immediately preceding the Closing Date, each of the Company and any
ERISA Affiliate shall terminate any and all Employee Plans intended to include
a Code Section 401(k) arrangement (each, a " _401(k) Plan_ ") (unless Parent
provides written notice to the Company that such 401(k) Plans shall not be
terminated). Unless Parent provides such written notice to the Company, no
later than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company
shall provide Parent with evidence that such Employee Plan(s) have been
terminated (effective as of the day immediately preceding the Closing Date)
pursuant to resolutions of the Company Board or such Affiliate, as the case
may be. The form and substance of such resolutions shall be subject to the
reasonable review and approval of Parent. The Company also shall take such
other actions reasonably necessary in furtherance of terminating such
Employee Plan(s) as Parent may reasonably require. In the event that
termination of a 401(k) Plan would reasonably be anticipated to trigger
liquidation charges, surrender charges or other fees then the Company shall
take such actions as are necessary to reasonably estimate the amount of such
charges and/or fees and provide such estimate in writing to Parent no later
than fifteen (15) calendar days prior to the Closing Date. If, in accordance
with this  _Section 7.11_, Parent requests in writing that the Company not
terminate any 401(k) Plan, the Company shall take such actions as Parent may
reasonably require in furtherance of the assumption of any such 401(k) Plan by
Parent, including by adopting such amendments as Parent may deem necessary or
advisable in connection with such assumption, _provided_ , _however_ , Parent
provides written notice to the Company of such actions (identifying each
action) no later than three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date.

(b) From and after the Effective Time, and to the extent permitted
by applicable Law, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
recognize the prior service with the Company or its Subsidiaries of each
Designated Employee in connection with all employee benefit plans, programs or
policies of Parent or its Affiliates in which Designated Employees are
eligible to participate following the Effective Time for purposes of
eligibility and vesting and determination of level of benefits (but not for
purposes of benefit accruals under any defined benefit pension plan or to the
extent that such recognition would result in duplication of benefits). From
and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, (i) cause any pre-existing conditions or limitations
and eligibility waiting periods under any group health plans of Parent or its
Affiliates to be waived with respect to Designated Employees and their
eligible dependents to the extent such Designated Employees and their eligible
dependents were not subject to such preexisting conditions and limitations
and eligibility waiting periods under the comparable Employee Plans as of the
time immediately preceding the Closing, and (ii) provide each Designated
Employee with credit for any deductibles paid under any Employee Plan that
provides medical, dental or vision benefits in the plan year in effect as of
the Closing Date in satisfying any applicable deductible or out of pocket
requirements under any medical, dental or vision plans of Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries that such employees are eligible to
participate in after the Effective Time to the same extent that such expenses
were recognized under the comparable Employee Plan. The provisions of this
_Section 7.11(b)_ are not intended to confer upon any person other than the
parties hereto any rights or  



 

53  remedies hereunder, and nothing herein shall be deemed to amend any Employee
Plan to reflect the terms of this _Section 7.11(b)_. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Parent shall continue to sponsor or maintain, as the case may be,
the employee benefit plans programs or policies of the Company that provide
health, dental, vision, accidental death or disability and life insurance

the indemnification, exculpation from liability and advancement of expense
provisions set forth in the certificate of incorporation and bylaws (or other
similar organizational documents) of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of
the date hereof, and during such six (6) year period, such provisions shall

or (ii) transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
Person, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that
the successors and assigns of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and/or any
such Subsidiaries, as applicable, shall assume all of the obligations of
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries, as applicable, under
this _Section 7.12_.

(d) The obligations under this _Section 7.12_ shall not be terminated,
amended or otherwise modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any
Indemnified Party or any other person who is a beneficiary under the DandO

that such persons may have under the certificate or articles of
incorporation, bylaws or other equivalent organizational documents, any and
all indemnification agreements of or entered into by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, or applicable Laws (whether at law or in equity).
