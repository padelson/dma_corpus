shall be afforded a new five (5) Business Day Company Matching Period from the
later of the date on which the Purchaser received the Company Superior
Proposal Notice and the date on which the Purchaser received all of the
materials set forth in Section 5.5(1)(d) from the Company.

standstill, non- disclosure, use, business purpose or similar restriction with
the Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries;    
---|---|---

of the determination of the Purchaser Board that such Acquisition Proposal
constitutes a Superior Proposal and of the intention of the Purchaser to enter
into such definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal,
together with a written notice from the Purchaser Board regarding the value
and financial terms that the Purchaser Board, in consultation with its
financial advisors, has determined should be ascribed to any non-cash
consideration offered under such Superior Proposal (the " **Purchaser**
**Superior Proposal Notice** ");      
---|---|--- 
  
   | (d)   | the Purchaser has provided the Company a copy of the

has determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal
counsel and financial advisors, that such Acquisition Proposal continues to
constitute a Superior Proposal (if applicable, compared to the terms of the

proposal would, upon acceptance, result in the Acquisition Proposal for the
Purchaser previously constituting a Superior Proposal ceasing to be a Superior
Proposal; and (b) the Purchaser shall negotiate in good faith with the Company
to make such amendments to the terms of this Agreement and the Arrangement as
would enable the Company to proceed with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement on such amended terms. If the Purchaser Board determines that such

Proposal that results in an increase in, or modification of, the consideration

shall be afforded a new five (5) Business Day Purchaser Matching Period from
the later of the date on which the Company received the Purchaser Superior
Proposal Notice and the date on which the Company received all of the
materials set forth in Section 5.7(1)(d) from the Purchaser.    
---|--- 
  
 (4)   | The Purchaser Board shall promptly reaffirm the Purchaser Board
Recommendation by press release after any Acquisition Proposal for the
Purchaser which is not determined to be a Superior Proposal is publicly
announced or publicly disclosed or the Purchaser Board determines that a
proposed amendment to the terms of this Agreement as contemplated under
Section 5.7(2) would result in an Acquisition Proposal no longer being a
Superior Proposal. The Purchaser shall provide the Company and its outside
legal counsel with a reasonable opportunity to review the form and content of
any such press release and shall make all reasonable amendments to such press
release as requested by the Company and its counsel.

the Company after a date that is less than ten (10) Business Days before the
Purchaser Meeting, if necessary, the Purchaser shall either proceed with or
shall postpone the Purchaser Meeting, if necessary, to a date that is not more
than fifteen (15) Business Days after the scheduled date of the Purchaser
Meeting, if necessary, as directed by the Company acting reasonably; provided,

___Bids_ __ and similar provisions under Securities Laws relating to the

 (7)   | Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at
any time following the date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time,

shall be after the Effective Date, and    
---|---|--- 
  
   | (b)   | if the Change of Control Proposal requires approval by the

damages, and out-of-pocket expenditures, which the Purchaser or the Company,
as applicable, will suffer or incur as a result of the event giving rise to
such damages and resultant termination of this Agreement, and are not
penalties. The Company and the Purchaser irrevocably waive any right they may
have to raise as a defence that any such liquidated damages are excessive or
punitive. For greater certainty, each Party agrees that, upon any termination
of this Agreement under circumstances where the Company or the Purchaser is
entitled to the Company Termination Fee or the Purchaser Termination Fee, as
applicable, and such applicable termination fee is paid in full, the Company
or the Purchaser, as the case may be, shall be precluded from any other remedy
against the other Party at Law or in equity or otherwise (including, without
limitation, an order for specific performance), and shall not seek to obtain
any recovery, judgment, or damages of any kind, including consequential,
indirect, or punitive damages, against the other Party or any of their
respective Affiliates in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby; provided, however, that payment of the Company
Termination Fee or the Purchaser Termination Fee, as applicable, shall not be
in lieu of any damages or any other payment or remedy available (including,
without limitation, an order for specific performance) in the event of any
wilful breach by such Party of any of its obligations under this Agreement or
fraud.    \- 61 -

invalidate delivery of that notice or other communication to a Party.

  

 **Section 8.5   Time of the Essence.  **

 

Time is of the essence in this Agreement.

  

 **Section 8.6   Injunctive Relief.  **

 

The Parties agree that irreparable harm would occur for which money
damages would not be an adequate remedy at law in the event that any of the
provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the
Parties shall be entitled to injunctive and other equitable relief to
prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement, and to enforce
compliance with the terms of this Agreement without any requirement for the
securing or posting of any bond in connection with the obtaining of any such
injunctive or other equitable relief, this being in addition to any other
remedy to which the Parties may be entitled at law or in equity.

  

 **Section 8.7   Third Party Beneficiaries.  **

  (1)   | Except as provided in Section 4.5(4) and Section 4.8 which,
without limiting their terms, are intended as stipulations for the benefit of
the third Persons mentioned in such provisions (such third Persons referred to
in this Section 8.7 as the " **Indemnified** ******Persons** "), the Company
and the Purchaser intend that this Agreement will not benefit or create any
right or cause of action in favour of any Person, other than the Parties and
that no Person, other than the Parties, shall be entitled to rely on the
provisions of this Agreement in any action, suit, proceeding, hearing or other
forum.

Section 4.5(4) and Section 4.8, which are    \- 63 -

    | intended for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each
Indemnified Person, his or her heirs and his or her legal representatives, and
for such purpose, the Company confirms that it is acting as trustee on their
behalf, and agrees to enforce such provisions on their behalf. The Parties
reserve their right to vary or rescind the rights at any time and in any way
whatsoever, if any, granted by or under this Agreement to any Person who is
not a Party, without notice to or consent of that Person, including any
Indemnified Person.  
---|--- 
 

 **Section 8.8 Waiver.  **

 

No waiver of any of the provisions of this Agreement will constitute a waiver
of any other provision (whether or not similar). No waiver will be binding
unless executed in writing by the Party to be bound by the waiver. A
Party's failure or delay in exercising any right under this Agreement will
not operate as a waiver of that right. A single or partial exercise of
any right will not preclude a Party from any other or further exercise of
that right or the exercise of any other right.

  

 **Section 8.9 Entire Agreement.  **

 

This Agreement, together with the Confidentiality Agreement, constitutes the
entire agreement between the Parties with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and supersedes all prior agreements,

Confidentiality Agreement conflict with the terms of this Agreement, the terms
of this Agreement shall prevail. There are no representations, warranties,
covenants, conditions or other agreements, express or implied, collateral,
statutory or otherwise, between the Parties in connection with the
subject matter of this Agreement, except as specifically set forth in
this Agreement. The Parties have not relied and are not relying on any other
information, discussion or understanding in entering into and completing the

this Agreement are assignable or transferable by any Party without the prior
written consent of the other Party.    
---|--- 
 

 **Section 8.11 Severability.  **

 

If any provision of this Agreement is determined to be illegal, invalid or
unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction, that provision will be
severed from this Agreement and the remaining provisions shall remain in
full force and effect. Upon such determination that any term or other
provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to
effect the original intent of the Parties \- 64 -

transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the fullest extent

 **2.2  Binding Effect.  **

    | This Plan of Arrangement and the Arrangement, upon the filing of the
Articles of Arrangement and the issuance of the Certificate of Arrangement,
will become effective, and be binding on the Purchaser, the Company, all
holders and beneficial owners of Common Shares (including Dissenting Holders),
Company Optionholders, holders of Company RSUs, the registrar and transfer
agent of the Company, the Depositary and all other Persons, at and after the
Effective Time without any further act or formality required on the part of
any Person.  
---|--- 
 

 **2.3  Arrangement.  **

 

At the Effective Time each of the following events shall occur and shall be
deemed to occur sequentially as set out below without any further
authorization, act or formality, in each case, unless stated otherwise,
effective as at five minute intervals starting at the Effective Time: 

    | (a)   | notwithstanding the terms of the Rights Plan, the Rights
Plan shall be terminated and all rights issued pursuant to the Rights Plan
shall be cancelled without any payment in respect thereof;    
---|---|--- 
  
   | (b)   | each Common Share outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time held by a Company Shareholder in respect of which Dissent
Rights have been validly    
---|---|--- 
  withdrawn shall be deemed to have been transferred without any further act or
formality, to the Purchaser, free and clear of any Liens, in consideration for
a debt claim against the Purchaser in an amount and payable in accordance with
Article 3, and:  
---|--- 
  
   | (i)   | such Company Shareholder will cease to be the holder of such
Dissenting Shares and will cease to have any rights as holder of such Common
Shares other than the right to be paid fair value for such Dissenting Shares
as set out in Section 3.1(a);    
---|---|--- 
  
   | (ii)   | such Company Shareholder's name will be removed as the
registered holder of such Dissenting Shares from the registers of Common
Shares maintained by or on behalf of the Company; and    
---|---|--- 
  
   | (iii)   | the Purchaser will be deemed to be the transferee of such
Dissenting Shares, free and clear of any Liens.    
---|---|--- 
  
   | (c)   | each Common Share outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than any Common Share in respect of which a Company
Shareholder has validly exercised, and has not withdrawn or been deemed to
have withdrawn, its Dissent Right, and Common Shares held by the Purchaser or
any Affiliate thereof) shall be transferred to, and acquired by the Purchaser,
without any further act or formality on the part of the holder of such Common
Share or the Purchaser, free and clear of all Liens, in exchange for the
Consideration, and the name of each such Company Shareholder will be removed
from the register of holders of Common Shares and added to the register of
holders of Purchaser Shares, and the Purchaser will be recorded as the
registered holder of such Common Shares so exchanged and will be deemed to be
the legal and beneficial owner thereof;    
---|---|--- 
  
   | (d)   | each Company Option which is outstanding and which has not
been duly exercised prior to the Effective Time, notwithstanding the terms of
the Company Stock Option Plan, without any further action by or on behalf of a
Company Optionholder, be deemed to be assigned and transferred by such holder
to the Company in exchange for a cash payment from the Company equal to the
amount by which $9.40 exceeds the exercise price of such Company Option less
applicable withholdings, and such Company Option shall immediately be
cancelled and, for greater certainty, where such amount is a negative, neither
the Company nor the Purchaser shall be obligated to pay the Company
Optionholder any amount in respect of such Company Option, and the Company
Stock Option Plan will terminate and none of the former Company Optionholders,
the Parties or any of their respective successors or assigns shall have any
rights, liabilities or obligations in respect of the Company Options or the
Company Stock Option Plan; and    
---|---|--- 
  
   | (e)   | notwithstanding any vesting or exercise provisions to which
a Company RSU might otherwise be subject, the Effective Date shall be deemed
to be the    
---|---|--- 
  the then issued and outstanding Company RSUs, and each such Company RSU will
be redeemed for two Purchaser Shares plus $0.001 in cash (less any applicable
withholding), and thereafter the Company RSU Plan will terminate and none of
the former holders of Company RSUs, the Parties or any of their respective
successors or assigns shall have any rights, liabilities or obligations in
respect of the Company RSU Plan.  
---|--- 
 

 **2.4  Adjustment to Consideration.  **

 

If, on or after the date of the Arrangement Agreement, the Company sets a
record date for any dividend or other distribution on the Common Shares that
is prior to the Effective Time or the Company pays any dividend or other
distribution on the Common Shares prior to the Effective Time: (i) to
the extent that the amount of such dividends or distributions per Common
Share does not exceed the Consideration per Common Share, the Consideration
per Common Share shall be reduced by a number of Purchaser Shares equal to
the amount of such dividends or distributions, as applicable; and (ii) to the
extent that the amount of such dividends or distributions per Common Share
exceeds the Consideration per Common Share, such excess amount shall be placed
in escrow for the account of the Purchaser or another Person designated by
the Purchaser.

  

 **2.5  No Fractional Shares  **

 

In no event shall any holder of Common Shares or Company RSUs be entitled to
a fractional Purchaser Share. Where the aggregate number of Purchaser Shares
to be issued to a person as consideration under or as a result of this
Arrangement would result in a fraction of a Purchaser Share being issuable,
the number of Purchaser Shares to be received by such securityholder shall be
rounded down to the nearest whole Purchaser Share and no person will be
entitled to any compensation in respect of a fractional Purchaser Share.

  

 **2.6  Section 85 Election  **

 

An Eligible Holder whose Common Shares are exchanged for the Consideration
Shares and cash pursuant to the Arrangement shall be entitled to make a joint
income tax election, pursuant to Section 85 of the Tax Act (and any
analogous provision of provincial income tax law) (a " **Section** ******85
Election** ") with respect to the exchange. The Eligible Holder will be
required to submit information to the Purchaser in a manner that will
specified by the Purchaser within 30 days of the Effective Date. The
information to be provided by the Eligible Holder will include the number of
shares transferred, the transferred properties' cost base, the applicable
agreed amounts for the purposes of such election and other information
necessary to complete the Section 85 Election. The Purchaser shall, within
60 days after receiving the submission, and subject to such submission being
correct and complete and complying with requirements imposed under the Tax
Act (or applicable provincial income tax law), sign and return a copy of a
completed Section 85 Election to the Eligible Holder for filing with the
Canada Revenue Agency (or the applicable provincial tax authority). Neither
the Purchaser, the Company nor any successor corporation shall be responsible
for the proper completion of any joint election form nor, except for the
obligation to sign and return duly completed joint election forms which are
received within 90 days of the Effective Date, for any taxes, interest or
penalties

     resulting from the failure of an Eligible Holder to properly complete or
file such joint election forms in the form and manner and within the time
prescribed by the Tax Act (or any applicable provincial legislation). In its
sole discretion, the Purchaser or any successor corporation may choose to
sign and return a joint election form received by it more than 90 days
following the Effective Date, but will have no obligation to do so.

  

 **ARTICLE 3 
RIGHTS OF DISSENT  **

 

 **3.1  ** **Rights** ** of Dissent.**

  

Pursuant to the Interim Order, registered holders of Common
Shares may exercise dissent rights (" **Dissent** ******Rights** ") under
Division 2 of Part 8 of the BCBCA, as modified by this Article 3, the
Interim Order and the Final Order, with respect to their Common Shares in
connection with the Arrangement, provided however that written objection to
the Arrangement Resolution contemplated by subsection 242(1)(a) of the BCBCA
must be received by the Company not later than 5:00 p.m. (Vancouver time) on
the Business Day that is two Business Days immediately preceding the date of
the Company Meeting (as it may be adjourned or postponed from time to time).
Registered holders of Common Shares who duly exercise their Dissent Rights
with respect to their Common Shares (" **Dissenting** ******Shares** ") shall
be deemed to have transferred the Common Shares held by them and in
respect of which Dissent Rights have been validly exercised to the Purchaser
free and clear of all Liens, as provided in Section 2.3(b), and if they:

     | (a)   | ultimately are entitled to be paid fair value for their
Dissenting Shares: (i) shall be deemed not to have participated in the
transactions in Article 2 (other than Section 2.3(b)), (ii) will be entitled
to be paid the fair value of such Dissenting Shares, which fair value,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the BCBCA, shall be
determined as of the close of business on the day before the Arrangement
Resolution was adopted; and (iii) will not be entitled to any other payment or
consideration, including any payment that would be payable under the
Arrangement had such holders not exercised their Dissent Rights in respect of
such Dissenting Shares; or    
---|---|--- 
  
   | (b)   | ultimately are not entitled, for any reason, to be paid fair
value for such Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to have participated in the
Arrangement on the same basis as a non-dissenting holder of Common
Shares;    
---|---|--- 
 

but in no case will the Company be required to recognize such persons as
holding Common Shares on or after the Effective Date.

  

 **3.2  Recognition of Dissenting Holders.  **

    | (a)   | In no circumstances shall the Purchaser, the Company or
any other Person be required to recognize a Person exercising Dissent Rights
unless such Person is the registered holder of those Common Shares in respect
of which such rights are sought to be exercised.    
---|---|--- 
  the Company or any other Person be required to recognize Dissenting Holders as
holders of Common Shares in respect of which Dissent Rights have been validly
exercised after the completion of the transfer under Section 2.3(b), and the
names of such Dissenting Holders shall be removed from the registers of
holders of the Common Shares in respect of which Dissent Rights have been
validly exercised at the same time as the event described in Section 2.3(b)
occurs. In addition to any other restrictions under Division 2 of Part 8 of
the BCBCA, none of the following shall be entitled to exercise Dissent Rights:
(i) holders of Company Options or holders of Company RSUs; and (ii) Company
Shareholders who have failed to exercise all the voting rights carried by the
Common Shares held by such holders against the Arrangement Resolution.    
---|---|--- 
 

 **ARTICLE 4 CERTIFICATES AND PAYMENTS  **

 

 **4.1  ** **Depositary** ** and Procedures.**

     | (a)   | The Purchaser will deposit Purchaser Shares and cash
with the Depositary to satisfy the consideration issuable and/or payable to
the Company Shareholders pursuant to this Plan of Arrangement (other than
Company Shareholders validly exercising Dissent Rights and who have not
withdrawn their notice of objection).    
---|---|--- 
  
   | (b)   | After the Effective Date, certificates formerly representing
Common Shares which are held by a Company Shareholder will, except for Common
Shares held by Dissenting Holders, represent only the right to receive the
Consideration issuable and/or payable therefor pursuant to Section 2.3 in
accordance with the terms of this Plan of Arrangement.    
---|---|--- 
  
   | (c)   | No dividends or other distributions declared or made after
the Effective Date with respect to the Purchaser Shares with a record date
after the Effective Date will be payable or paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered certificate or certificates for Common Shares which, immediately
prior to the Effective Date, represented outstanding Common Shares and will
not be payable or paid until the surrender of certificates for Common Shares
for exchange for the Consideration issuable and/or payable therefor pursuant
to Section 2.3 in accordance with the terms of this Plan of Arrangement.    
---|---|--- 
  
   | (d)   | As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Date,
the Depositary will (i) forward to each Company Shareholder that submitted a
duly completed Letter of Transmittal to the Depositary, together with the
certificate (if any) representing the Common Shares held by such Company
Shareholder, the certificates representing the Purchaser Shares issued to such
Company Shareholder pursuant to Section 2.3(c), which shares will be
registered in such name or names and either (A) delivered to the address or
addresses as such Company Shareholder directed in their Letter of Transmittal
or (B) made available for pick up at the offices of the Depositary in
accordance with the instructions of the Company Shareholder in the Letter of
Transmittal, and    
---|---|--- 
  Company Shareholder has the right to receive under the Arrangement for such
Common Shares.  
---|--- 
  
   | (e)   | Company Shareholders that did not submit an effective Letter
of Transmittal prior to the Effective Date may take delivery of the
Consideration issuable and/or payable to them by delivering the certificates
representing Common Shares formerly held by them to the Depositary at the
offices indicated in the Letter of Transmittal. Such certificates must be
accompanied by a duly completed Letter of Transmittal, together with such
other documents as the Depositary may require. Certificates representing the
Purchaser Shares issued to such Company Shareholder pursuant to Section 2.3
will be registered in such name or names as such Company Shareholder directed
in their Letter of Transmittal and such certificates representing Purchaser
Shares and a cheque representing the cash consideration payable pursuant to
Section 2.3 will be delivered to the address or addresses such Company
Shareholder directed in their Letter of Transmittal or made available for pick
up at the offices of the Depositary in accordance with the instructions of the
Company Shareholder in the Letter of Transmittal, as soon as reasonably
practicable after receipt by the Depositary of the required certificates and
documents.    
---|---|--- 
  
   | (f)   | Any payment made by way of cheque by the Depositary (or the
Company, if applicable) pursuant to this Plan of Arrangement that has not been
deposited or returned to the Depositary (or the Company) or that otherwise
remains unclaimed, in each case, on or before the third anniversary of the
Effective Date, and any right or claim to payment hereunder that remains
outstanding on the third anniversary of the Effective Date shall cease to
represent a right or claim of any kind or nature. Any certificate which
immediately prior to the Effective Date represented outstanding Common Shares
and which has not been surrendered, with all other instruments required by
this Article 4, on or prior to the third anniversary of the Effective Date,
will cease to represent any claim against or interest of any kind or nature in
the Company, the Purchaser or the Depositary.    
---|---|--- 
  
   | (g)   | No holder of Common Shares or Company RSUs shall be entitled
to receive any consideration with respect to such Common Shares or Company
RSUs other than any consideration to which such holder is entitled to receive
in accordance with Section 2.3 and this Section 4.1 and, for greater
certainty, no such holder will be entitled to receive any interest, dividends,
premium or other payment in connection therewith.    
---|---|--- 
 

 **4.2  Lost Certificates.  **

 

In the event any certificate, which immediately before the Effective Time
represented one or more outstanding Common Shares that was exchanged pursuant
to Section 2.3, is lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed, the Depositary will issue and/or pay in exchange for such
lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, the consideration to which such
Person is entitled in respect of the  Common  Shares  represented  by 
such  lost,  stolen, or destroyed  certificate

     pursuant to Section 2.3 deliverable in accordance with such Person's Letter
of Transmittal. When authorizing such issuances and/or payment in exchange for
any lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, the Person to whom consideration
is to be issued and/or paid will, as a condition precedent to the issuance
and/or payment thereof, give a bond satisfactory to the Purchaser and the
Depositary (acting reasonably) in such sum as the Purchaser may direct or
otherwise indemnify the Purchaser and the Company in a manner satisfactory
to the Purchaser and the Company, acting reasonably, against any claim that
may be made against the Purchaser and/or the Company with respect to the
certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

  

 **4.3  No Liens.  **

 

Any exchange or transfer of securities pursuant to this Plan of Arrangement
shall be free and clear of any Liens or other claims of third parties of
any kind.

  

 **4.4  Withholding Rights.  **

    | (a)   | The Purchaser, the Company and the Depositary, as
applicable, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration
otherwise payable or otherwise deliverable to any Company Securityholders
under the Plan of Arrangement (including, without limitation, any amounts
payable pursuant to Article 3) such amounts as the Purchaser, the Company or
the Depositary, as applicable, determines, acting reasonably, are required or
permitted to be deducted and withheld from such consideration under the Tax
Act, the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986 or any provision of any
other Law. To the extent that consideration is so withheld, such consideration
shall be treated for all purposes hereof as having been paid to the Company
Securityholder in respect of which such deduction, withholding and/or
remittance was made; provided that such consideration is actually remitted to
the appropriate Governmental Entity.    
---|---|--- 
  
   | (b)   | Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Plan of Arrangement, no Purchaser Shares shall be delivered to a holder of
Company RSUs until such holder has either: (a) provided the Purchaser with an
amount in cash equal to any amounts required to be withheld from such holder
under any provision of any Laws in respect of Taxes or (b) provided the
Purchaser with evidence satisfactory to the Purchaser, in its sole discretion,
that no amounts are required to be withheld from such holder under any
provision of any Laws in respect of Taxes.    
---|---|--- 
 

 **4.5  Paramountcy.  **

 

From and after the Effective Time: (a) this Plan of Arrangement shall take
precedence and priority over any and all Common Shares, Company Options and
Company RSUs issued or outstanding prior to the Effective Time, (b) the
rights and obligations of the Company Securityholders, the Company, the
Purchaser, the Depositary and any transfer agent or other depositary therefor
in relation thereto, shall be solely as provided for in this Plan of
Arrangement, and (c) all actions, causes of action, claims or proceedings
(actual or contingent and whether or not previously asserted) based on or in
any way relating to any Common Shares,  Company  Options  or  Company 
RSUs  shall be deemed  to have  been  settled,

     compromised, released and determined without liability except as set forth in
this Plan of Arrangement.
