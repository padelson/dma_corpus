owned Subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ ") and XO Group Inc., a Delaware
corporation (the " _Company_ ").

  



  

 _RECITALS_

  



  

WHEREAS, Parent desires to acquire the Company, on the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in this Agreement;

  



  

WHEREAS, in furtherance of such acquisition of the Company by Parent, and on
the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and
in accordance with the provisions of the General Corporation Law of the State
of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ "), Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the
Company (the " _Merger_ "), with the Company surviving the Merger as a
wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent;

  



  

WHEREAS, the board of directors of the Company (the " _Company Board_ ") has
(a) approved and declared the advisability of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, (b) directed that the
adoption of this Agreement be submitted for consideration by the Company's
stockholders at a meeting thereof and (c) resolved to recommend that the
Company's stockholders adopt this Agreement;

  



  

WHEREAS, the board of directors of Merger Sub has (a) approved and declared
the advisability of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Merger and (b) resolved to recommend that the sole stockholder
of Merger Sub adopt this Agreement;

  



  

WHEREAS, Parent, as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub, has approved and
adopted this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the Merger;

  



  

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and
as a condition and inducement to the Company's willingness to enter into this
Agreement, the Permira Funds and the Spectrum Arrangement Funds are each
entering into a fee funding arrangement in favor of the Company (the " _Fee

conditions contained therein, the Permira Funds and the Spectrum Arrangement
Funds are each agreeing to fund certain obligations of Parent and Merger Sub
in connection with this Agreement; and

  



  

WHEREAS, the board of directors of Parent (the " _Parent Board_ ") approved
and declared the advisability of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Merger; and

  



  

WHEREAS, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and also to prescribe certain

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, and of the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, the parties
hereto agree as follows:

  



  

ARTICLE I

  



  

 _The Merger_

  



  

Section 1.1. _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub
shall be merged with and into the Company, in accordance with the provisions
of the DGCL, and the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall
thereupon cease. The Company shall be the surviving corporation in the Merger
(sometimes hereinafter referred to as the  " _Surviving Corporation_ ") and,
following the Merger, shall be a wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent, and the
separate corporate existence of the Company, with all its rights, privileges,
immunities, powers and franchises, shall continue unaffected by the Merger,
except as set forth in this Agreement.

  



  

Section 1.2. _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_
") shall take place: (a) at 9:00 a.m., New York City time, no later than the
third (3rd) Business Day following the satisfaction or waiver (if permissible
under applicable Law) of all of the conditions set forth in _Article VI_
(other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the
Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions at the
Closing), at the offices of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen and Katz, 51 West 52nd
Street, New York, New York 10019 or (b) at such other date, time, or place as
agreed to in writing by Parent and the Company; provided, that the Closing
shall not occur earlier than November 23, 2018. The date on which the Closing
actually occurs is referred to herein as the " _Closing Date_." For the
avoidance of doubt, a condition may only be waived in writing by the party or
parties entitled to such condition under this Agreement.

  



  

Section 1.3. _Effective Time_. Subject to the terms and conditions
hereof, on the Closing Date, the Company and Parent shall cause a certificate
of merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") to be duly executed and filed
with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in accordance with
Section 251 of the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective at the time when
the Certificate of Merger has been duly filed with the Secretary of State of
the State of Delaware or at such later time as the parties shall agree in
writing and specify in the Certificate of Merger in accordance with the DGCL
(the " _Effective Time_ ").

  



  

ARTICLE II

  



  

 _Effects of the Merger_

  



  

Section 2.1. _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the
effects specified in this Agreement and the applicable provisions of the DGCL.

  



  

Section 2.2. _Certificate of Incorporation_. Subject to _Section
5.10_, and without any further action on the part of the Company or
Merger Sub, at the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation (the " _Charter_ ") shall be amended and restated in
its entirety to be in the form of the certificate of incorporation of Merger
Sub (except with respect to the name of the Surviving Corporation, which from
and after the Effective Time shall be the name of the Company), until
thereafter amended as provided therein or by applicable Law.

  



    

 | 2| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

Section 2.3. _Bylaws_. Subject to _Section 5.10_, without any
further action on the part of the Company or Merger Sub, at the Effective
Time, the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation (the " _Bylaws_ ") shall be
amended and restated in their entirety to be in the form of the bylaws of
Merger Sub (except that the name of the Surviving Corporation shall be the
name of the Company), until thereafter amended as provided therein or in the
Charter or by applicable Law.

  



  

Section 2.4. _Directors_. The directors of Merger Sub immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall, from and after the Effective Time, be the
directors of the Surviving Corporation until their successors have been duly
elected or appointed and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation
or removal in accordance with the Charter and the Bylaws.

  



  

Section 2.5. _Officers_. The officers of the Company immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall, from and after the Effective Time, be the
officers of the Surviving Corporation until their successors have been duly
elected or appointed and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation
or removal in accordance with the Charter and the Bylaws.

  



  

Section 2.6. _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, as a
result of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of
any capital stock of the Company, any party hereto or any other Person:

  



  

(a) _Merger Consideration_. Each share of Common Stock (each "
_Share_ " or, collectively, the " _Shares_ ") issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Cancelled Shares,
Converted Shares and Dissenting Shares (collectively, " _Excluded Shares_ "))
shall at the Effective Time automatically be cancelled and converted into the
right to receive $35.00 in cash (the " _Merger Consideration_ "), without
interest, whereupon such Shares shall cease to exist and no longer be
outstanding, and each holder thereof shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration,
without interest, upon surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in
accordance with _Section 2.7_.

  



  

(b) _Cancellation of Cancelled Shares; Conversion of Converted
Shares_. Shares that immediately prior to the Effective Time are held by the
Company in treasury or by Parent or Merger Sub (collectively, " _Cancelled
Shares_ ") shall at the Effective Time automatically be cancelled and shall
cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered or deliverable in
exchange therefor. Shares that immediately prior to the Effective Time are
held by any wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company or any wholly owned
Subsidiary of Parent (other than Merger Sub) (collectively, " _Converted
Shares_ ") shall at the Effective Time automatically be converted into such
number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of common stock, par value $0.01
per share, of the Surviving Corporation such that the ownership percentage of
any such Subsidiary in the Surviving Corporation immediately following the
Effective Time shall equal the ownership percentage of such Subsidiary in the
Company immediately prior to the Effective Time.

  



  

(c) _Conversion of Merger Sub Common Stock_. At the Effective Time,
each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

  



    

 | 3| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

Section 2.7. _Payment_.

  



  

(a) _Paying Agent; Exchange Fund_. Prior to the Effective Time,
Parent shall designate a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the
Company to act as agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ") for the payment of the Merger
Consideration in accordance with this _Article II_, and in connection
therewith, shall enter into an agreement reasonably acceptable to the Company
relating to the Paying Agent's responsibilities with respect to this
Agreement. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall
cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent in trust for the benefit of the
holders of Shares a cash amount sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger
Consideration (not including, for the avoidance of doubt, any Merger
Consideration payable with respect to Excluded Shares) (such cash being
hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The Exchange Fund
shall not be used for any purpose except as set forth herein. The Paying
Agent shall invest the Exchange Fund as reasonably directed by Parent;
_provided_ , that such investments shall be in short-term obligations of, or
guaranteed in full by, the United States of America with maturities no more
than thirty (30) days or in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or
better by Moody's Investor Service, Inc. or Standard and Poor's Corporation.
Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be
payable to Parent or the Surviving Corporation and any amounts in excess of
the amounts payable under this _Article II_ shall be promptly returned to
the Surviving Corporation. To the extent that there are any losses with
respect to any such investments, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, promptly replace or restore the cash in the Exchange Fund so
as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all times maintained at a level
sufficient for the Paying Agent to pay the aggregate Merger
Consideration under this _Article II_. No investment losses resulting from
investment of the funds deposited with the Paying Agent shall diminish the
rights of any holder of Shares to receive the Merger Consideration as provided
herein.

  



  

(b) _Exchange Procedures_.

  



  

(i) _Letter of Transmittal_ _._ As soon as reasonably practicable
after the Effective Time (but in any event no later than three (3) Business
Days after the date on which the Effective Time occurs), Parent shall, or
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, cause the Paying Agent to mail to
each Record Holder of a certificate (a " _Certificate_ ") or book-entry share
(a " _Book-Entry Share_ ") that immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented Shares, which Shares were converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.6(a)_, (A) a letter of
transmittal (which shall be in customary form and with such other provisions
as Parent and the Company shall reasonably agree, and which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon
delivery of such Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as
provided in _Section 2.7(e)_) or transfer such Book-Entry Shares to the
Paying Agent (including customary provisions with respect to delivery of an
"agent's message" with respect to Book-Entry Shares)) and (B)
instructions for effecting the surrender of Certificates (or affidavits of
loss in lieu thereof as provided in _Section 2.7(e)_) or Book-Entry Shares
to the Paying Agent in exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration
therefor.

---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(ii) _Payment for Shares_. Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in _Section
2.7(e)_) or Book-Entry Shares, together with, in the case of Certificates,
such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance
with the instructions thereto, or in the case of Book-Entry Shares, receipt of
an "agent's message" by the Paying Agent, and such other customary documents
as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor, and the Paying Agent shall be required to deliver to each such
holder, the amount in cash (after giving effect to any required withholding
taxes as provided in _Section 2.7(g)_ that such holder has the right to
receive pursuant to _Section 2.6(a)_). No interest will be paid or accrued on
any amount payable in respect of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. If
payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the
Person in whose name a surrendered Certificate or, in the case of a Book-Entry
Share, a surrendered Share is registered, it will be a condition of payment
that the Certificate or, in the case of a Book-Entry Share, the Share so
surrendered be endorsed properly or otherwise be in proper form for transfer
and that the Person requesting such payment has paid all transfer and
other similar Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger
Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate
or, in the case of a Book-Entry Share, the Share surrendered and has
established to the reasonable satisfaction of the Paying Agent that such
Taxes have been paid or are not required to be paid.

  



  

(c) _Closing of Transfer Books_. From and after the Effective Time,
the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation shall be closed and
there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer
books of the Surviving Corporation of the Shares that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. Until surrendered as contemplated by
_Section 2.7(b)_, each Certificate and Book-Entry Share (other than Excluded
Shares) shall, from and after the Effective Time, represent only the right to
receive the Merger Consideration, without interest thereon, as contemplated by
_Section 2.6(a)_. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or, in the case
of Book-Entry Shares, such Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation,
Parent or the Paying Agent for transfer or any other reason, they shall be
cancelled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration as provided in this
_Article II_.

  



  

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange
Fund (including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains
unclaimed by the Record Holders of Shares one (1) year after the Effective
Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation. Any Record Holder of
Shares (other than Excluded Shares) who has not theretofore complied with this
_Article II_ shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation and
Parent, which shall remain responsible for payment of the Merger Consideration
for such Shares as provided in this _Article II_, without any interest
thereon. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, none of the
Surviving Corporation, Parent, Merger Sub, the Paying Agent or any other
Person shall be liable to any Record Holder of Shares for any amount properly
delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Laws.

  



    

 | 5| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, and if required by Parent, the
posting by such holder of a bond in customary amount and upon such terms as
may be required by Parent as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent with respect to
such Certificate, Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent to pay in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the
Merger Consideration payable in respect of the Shares previously evidenced by
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, without any interest thereon.

  



  

(f) _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, if required by the DGCL (but only to the extent
required thereby), Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time (other than Cancelled Shares and Converted Shares) and
that are held by holders of such Shares who have not voted in favor of the
adoption of this Agreement or consented thereto in writing and who are
entitled to and have properly exercised appraisal rights with respect thereto
in accordance with, and who have complied in all respects with, Section 262
of the DGCL (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") will not be converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration, and holders of such Dissenting
Shares will be entitled to receive payment of the fair value of such
Dissenting Shares in accordance with the provisions of such Section 262 unless
and until any such holder fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or loses
its rights to appraisal and payment under the DGCL. If, after the Effective
Time, any such holder fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or loses such
right, such Dissenting Shares will thereupon be treated as if they had been
converted into and had become exchangeable for, at the Effective Time, the
right to receive the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon. At
the Effective Time, any holder of Dissenting Shares shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto, except the rights provided in Section 262 of the
DGCL and as provided in the previous sentence. The Company will give Parent
(i) prompt notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisals of
Shares, including any holder's notice of its intent to demand payment
pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL that the Company receives, withdrawals of
such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to Section 262 of the
DGCL and received by the Company, and (ii) the opportunity to participate in
and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such notices and
demands. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of
Parent, make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal, offer
to settle or settle any such demands or approve any withdrawal of any such
demands.

  



  

(g) _Withholding_. Each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and
the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement (including
pursuant to _Section 2.6(a)_ and _Section 2.8_) such Taxes as it is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ ") or under
any other applicable provision of Law. To the extent that amounts are so
deducted and withheld and timely paid over to the appropriate Governmental
Entity, such deducted and withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made.

Section 2.8. _Company Equity Awards_.

  



  

(a) Each outstanding option to acquire Shares (each, a " _Company
Stock Option_ "), that is outstanding, unexercised and vested immediately
prior to the Effective Time in accordance with its terms (each a "Vested
Option"), shall, as of the Effective Time, be converted into the right to
receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the excess, if any, of
the Merger Consideration _over_ the exercise price per Share of such Vested
Option in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, _multiplied by_
(ii) the total number of Shares subject to such Vested Option immediately
prior to the Effective Time, subject to any applicable Tax withholding. The
Surviving Corporation shall pay the holders of Vested Options the cash
payments described in this _Section 2.8(a)_ on or as soon as reasonably
practicable after the Closing Date, but in any event no later than the second
regular payroll date following the Closing Date.

  



  

(b) Each Company Stock Option that is outstanding and unvested
immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, an " _Unvested Option_
") shall, as of the Effective Time, be substituted and automatically convert
into an award to receive an amount in cash (a " _Substituted Option Award_ ")
equal to the product of (i) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration
_over_ the exercise price per Share of such Unvested Option in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, _multiplied by_ (ii) the
total number of Shares subject to such Unvested Option immediately prior to
the Effective Time. Such Substituted Option Award shall be subject to the
terms set forth on Section 5.1(b)(xiv) of the Company Disclosure Schedule and
shall otherwise remain subject to the same vesting terms and conditions that
applied to such award immediately prior to the Effective Time, including
continued employment with Parent or the Company through the applicable
vesting date, and the applicable cash amounts shall be paid out, less any
applicable Tax withholding, within thirty days of the end of the calendar
quarter in which the applicable vesting date occurs.

  



  

(c) Each compensatory award in respect of a Share subject to
vesting, repurchase or other lapse restriction (each, a " _Company RSA Award_
" and, together with the Company Stock Options, the " _Company Equity Awards_
") that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, as of
the Effective Time, be substituted and automatically convert into an award to
receive an amount in cash (each, a "Substituted RSA Award") equal to the
product of (i) the total number of Shares underlying such Company RSA Award
and (ii) the Merger Consideration. Such Substituted RSA Award shall be subject
to the terms set forth on Section 5.1(b)(xiv) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule and otherwise remain subject to the same vesting terms and
conditions that applied to such award immediately prior to the Effective
Time, including continued employment with Parent or the Company through the
applicable vesting date, and shall be paid, less any applicable Tax
withholding, within thirty days of the end of the calendar quarter in which
the applicable vesting date occurs.

  



  

(d) As soon as practicable following the date hereof, the Company
shall take all actions with respect to the Company ESPP to provide that (i)
with respect to any offering periods in effect as of the date hereof (the "
_Current ESPP Offering Period_ "), no employee who is not a participant in
the Company ESPP as of the date hereof may become a participant in the Company
ESPP and there will be no increase in the amount of payroll deductions
permitted to be made by the participants under the Company ESPP during the
Current ESPP Offering Period; (ii) subject to the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Company ESPP shall terminate
immediately prior to the Effective Time, (iii) if the Current ESPP Offering
Period terminates prior to the Effective Time, then the Company ESPP shall be
suspended and no new offering period shall be commenced under the
Company ESPP prior to the termination of this Agreement, and (iv) if the
Current ESPP Offering Period is still in effect at the Effective Time, then
the last day of such Current ESPP Offering Period shall be accelerated to a
date before the Closing Date as specified by the Company Board or its
designated committee in accordance with the terms of the Company ESPP.

(e) For the avoidance of doubt, if a holder of a Substituted Option
Award or Substituted RSA award (each, a " _Converted Award_ ") vests in such
Converted Award in accordance with Sections 2.8(b) and 2.8(c) of this
Agreement and such holder subsequently terminates employment with the Company
and its Affiliates for any reason prior to the date on which such Converted
Award is paid, the holder will be nevertheless be entitled to receive payment
for such vested portion of such Converted Award at the time such payment
would have been made had such holder remained employed with the Company or
any of its Affiliates (including, after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation). Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board or any authorized
committee thereof shall adopt such resolutions as may reasonably be
appropriate or required in its discretion to effectuate the actions
contemplated by this _Section 2.8_.

  



  

Section 2.9. _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. In the event that,
between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the Company changes
the number of Shares issued and outstanding as a result of a
reclassification, stock split or reverse stock split, stock dividend or stock
distribution, recapitalization, combination, merger, issuer tender or exchange
offer, or other similar transaction, the Merger Consideration shall be
correspondingly adjusted to reflect such change and to provide the holders of
Shares the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to
such action, and as so adjusted shall, from and after the date of such event,
be the Merger Consideration.

Except as set forth in (a) any form, document or report publicly filed with

Subsidiaries is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing (with
respect to jurisdictions that recognize that concept) under the Laws of its
respective jurisdiction of organization and each has all requisite corporate
or similar power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and
assets and to carry on its business as currently conducted, except where the
failure to be in good standing or to have such corporate or similar power and
authority would not constitute a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company
and each of its Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed to do business and
is in good standing (with respect to jurisdictions that recognize that
concept) as a foreign corporation (or other applicable entity) in each
jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing or operation of its properties or
assets or conduct of its business requires such qualification or licensing,
except in such jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or licensed
or to be in good standing would not constitute a Company Material Adverse
Effect. The Company has made available to Parent true, complete and
correct copies of its certificate of incorporation and bylaws, in each case
as amended and in effect as of the date of this Agreement.

  



  

Section 3.2. _Subsidiaries_.

rights. All of the outstanding shares of capital stock or equity interests of
each Subsidiary of the Company are owned by the Company, directly or
indirectly, free and clear of all Liens, other than Permitted Liens.

  



  

(b) As of the date hereof, neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries required to be listed in Section 3.2(a) of the

Company RSA Awards), (ii) zero Shares were held by the Company in its
treasury, (iii) 1,495,914 Shares were reserved for issuance pursuant to

with such exceptions as would not constitute a Company Material Adverse
Effect.

  



  

(b) Subject to obtaining the Stockholder Approval, neither the
execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement by the Company nor

ARTICLE IV

  



  

 _Representations and Warranties of Parent and Merger Sub_

  



  

Except as set forth in the disclosure letter delivered by Parent to the
Company and its Representatives prior to entering into this Agreement (the  "
_Parent Disclosure Schedule_ ") (it being acknowledged and agreed that
disclosure of any item in any section or subsection of the Parent Disclosure
Schedule, whether or not an explicit cross reference appears, shall be deemed
disclosure with respect to any other section or subsection to which the
relevance of such item is reasonably apparent on the face of such
disclosure), Parent and Merger Sub jointly and severally hereby represent and
warrant to the Company as follows:

  



    

 | 24| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

Section 4.1. _Organization_. Parent and Merger Sub are
corporations, in each case, duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing (with respect to jurisdictions that recognize that concept) under
the Laws of its respective jurisdiction of organization and each has all
requisite corporate or similar power and authority to own, lease and operate
its properties and assets and to carry on its business as currently
conducted, except where the failure to be in good standing or to have such
corporate or similar power and authority would not constitute a Parent
Material Adverse Effect. Each of Parent and Merger Sub is duly qualified or
licensed to do business and is in good standing (with respect to
jurisdictions that recognize that concept) as a foreign corporation (or other
applicable entity) in each jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing or
operation of its properties or assets or conduct of its business requires such
qualification or licensing, except in such jurisdictions where the failure to
be so qualified or licensed or to be in good standing would not constitute a
Parent Material Adverse Effect. For purposes of this Agreement, a " _Parent
Material Adverse Effect_ " means any fact, circumstance, change, event,
occurrence or effect that, individually or in the aggregate, has, or would
reasonably be expected to have, a material adverse effect of Parent's or
Merger Sub's ability to timely consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Merger. Parent has made available to the
Company true, complete and correct copies of the organizational or governing
documents of Parent and Merger Sub, in each case as amended and in effect as
of the date of this Agreement.

  



  

Section 4.2. _Merger Sub_.

  



  

(a) The authorized capital stock of Merger Sub consists solely of
1,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, all of which are
validly issued and outstanding. All of the issued and outstanding capital
stock of Merger Sub is, and at the Effective Time will be, owned by Parent or
a wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent free and clear of all Liens.

  



  

(b) Merger Sub has been formed solely for the purpose of the Merger
and, prior to the Effective Time, will have engaged in no other
business activities and will have owned no assets and incurred no liabilities
or obligations other than in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby and activities incidental to its formation.

  



  

Section 4.3. _Authority_.

  



  

(a) Each of Parent and Merger Sub has the requisite power and
authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and to perform its
obligations hereunder and to consummate the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent
and Merger Sub and the consummation by each of Parent and Merger Sub of the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby have been duly
authorized by all necessary actions on the part of each of Parent and Merger
Sub, subject to the adoption of this Agreement by Parent, as the sole
stockholder of Merger Sub (which such adoption shall occur immediately
following the execution of this Agreement) and the filing of the Certificate
of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, and no
other actions on the part of Parent or Merger Sub are necessary to authorize
the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by
each of Parent and Merger Sub and (assuming the due and valid authorization,
execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company) constitutes a valid
and binding obligation of each of Parent and Merger Sub, enforceable against
each of them in accordance with its terms, except as limited by the
Enforceability Exceptions.

  



    

 | 25| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) The Parent Board has approved and declared the advisability of
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including

the Merger is fair to, and in the best interests of, Merger Sub and its sole
stockholder, (ii) approved and declared the advisability of this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, and (iii)
resolved to recommend that the sole stockholder of Merger Sub adopt
this Agreement.

  



  

(c) No vote of the stockholders of Parent or the holders of any
other securities of Parent (equity or otherwise) is required by Law or the
organizational documents of Parent in order for Parent to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger.

  



  

Section 4.4. _Consents and Approvals; No Violations; No Source of
Conflicting Interests_.

  



  

(a) Except as may be required under, and other applicable
requirements of, the Exchange Act, the HSR Act, the DGCL, the rules and
regulations of NYSE, state securities laws and any other applicable
Regulatory Laws, neither the execution, delivery or performance of
this Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub nor the consummation by Parent and
Merger Sub of the transactions contemplated hereby will require Parent or
Merger Sub to make any notice to, or filing with, or obtain any permit,
authorization, consent or approval of, any Governmental Entity of competent
jurisdiction, with such exceptions as would not constitute a Parent Material
Adverse Effect.

  



  

(b) Neither the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement
by the Parent or Merger Sub nor the consummation by Parent or Merger Sub of
the transactions contemplated hereby will (i) contravene, conflict with, or
result in any violation or breach of any provision of the certificate of
incorporation or bylaws of Parent or Merger Sub or, (ii) assuming compliance
with the matters referred to in _Section 4.4(a)_, contravene, conflict with
or result in a violation or breach of any provision of any applicable Law,
require any consent or other action by any Person under, constitute a default,
or an event that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would
constitute a default under, or cause or permit the termination, cancellation
or acceleration of any right or obligation under, any provision of any
Contract to which Parent or Merger Sub is a party, with such exceptions as
would not constitute a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

(c) Neither Parent nor Merger Sub, nor any of their Affiliates, owns
any five percent (5%) or greater equity interest in any Person set forth on
Section 5.17(a) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule.

  



  

Section 4.5. _Information Supplied_. None of the information
supplied or to be supplied by or on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub for
inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement will, at the
time the Proxy Statement is first mailed to the Company's stockholders or at
the time of the Stockholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, neither Parent nor Merger Sub makes any representation or warranty
with respect to statements made or incorporated by reference in the Proxy
Statement based on information supplied by or on behalf of the Company or its
Subsidiaries.

  



    

 | 26| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

Section 4.6. _Litigation_. As of the date of this Agreement, there
is no Action pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened in writing
against Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (including Merger Sub), or any of
their properties, rights or assets, for which an adverse result
would constitute a Parent Material Adverse Effect. As of the date of this
Agreement, there is no Order imposed upon or, to the Knowledge of Parent,
threatened in writing against Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (including
Merger Sub), or any of their properties, rights or assets that constitutes a
Parent Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

Section 4.7. _Financing_.

  



  

(a) Parent and Merger Sub are party to and have accepted an executed
commitment letter, dated as of the date hereof, (as the same may be
amended, modified or replaced in accordance with _Section 5.12(b)_ hereof,
and (together with all exhibits, annexes and schedules thereto, the " _Debt
Commitment Letter_ ")) from JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., UBS Securities LLC, UBS
AG, Stamford Branch, Jefferies Finance LLC and Royal Bank of Canada (as such
parties may be supplemented or amended in accordance with _Section
5.12(b)_ hereof, collectively, the " _Lenders_ "), relating to the commitment
of the Lenders to provide, subject only to the terms and conditions thereof,
the full amount of the debt financing stated therein (the " _Debt Financing_
").

  



  

(b) Parent and Merger Sub are party to and have accepted executed
commitment letters, dated as of the date hereof (together with all
exhibits and schedules thereto, the " _Equity Commitment Letters_ " and,
together with the Debt Commitment Letter, the " _Commitment Letters_ "), from
the Permira Funds and the Spectrum Funds (the " _Investors_ "), relating to
the commitment of the Investors, subject only to the terms and conditions
thereof, to invest in Parent the full amount of the cash equity
financing stated therein (the " _Equity Financing_ " and, together with the
Debt Financing, the " _Financing_ "). Parent and Merger Sub have delivered to
the Company true, complete and correct copies of the executed Commitment
Letters and any fee letters related thereto (in the case of any such fee
letters only, redacted solely for provisions related to fees and
other economic terms that are customarily redacted in connection with
transactions of this type, none of which could adversely affect the
conditionality, enforceability, availability, termination or aggregate
principal amount of the Financing).

  



  

(c) Except as expressly set forth in the Commitment Letters, there
are no conditions precedent to the obligations of the Lenders and the
Investors to provide the Financing or any contingencies that would permit the
Lenders or the Investors to reduce the total amount of Financing, including
any condition or contingency relating to the availability of the Financing
pursuant to any "flex" provision. As of the date hereof, assuming the
satisfaction in full of the conditions set forth in _Sections 6.1_ and _6.2_ ,
neither Parent nor Merger Sub has any reason to believe that it will be
unable to satisfy on a timely basis all of the terms and conditions to be
satisfied by it in the Commitment Letters on or prior to the Closing Date, nor
does Parent or Merger Sub have Knowledge that any Lender or any Investor will
not perform its obligations thereunder. Other than any fee letter related to
the Debt Commitment Letter that has been delivered to the Company pursuant to
_Section 4.7(a)_, there are no side letters, understandings or other
agreements, contracts or arrangements of any kind relating to the Commitment
Letters that could affect the availability of the Financing.

  



    

 | 27| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(d) Assuming the Financing is funded in accordance with the
Commitment Letters, and giving effect to any "flex" provisions in or related
to the Debt Commitment Letter (including with respect to fees and original
issue discount), the Financing will provide Parent with cash proceeds on the
Closing Date sufficient for the satisfaction of all of Parent's and Merger
Sub's obligations under this Agreement and under the Commitment Letters,
including the payment of the Merger Consideration, any payments in respect of
equity compensation obligations to be made in connection with the Merger,
payment of any fees and expenses of or payable by Parent, Merger Sub or the
Surviving Corporation, and any repayment or refinancing of any outstanding
indebtedness of Parent, the Company and their respective Subsidiaries
contemplated by, or required in connection with the transactions described in,
this Agreement or the Commitment Letters (such amounts, collectively, the "
_Merger Amounts_ ").

  



  

(e) As of the date hereof, the Commitment Letters constitute the
legal, valid, binding and enforceable obligations of Parent and Merger Sub
and, to the Knowledge of the Parent, all the other parties thereto, and is in
full force and effect. Assuming the accuracy of the representations and
warranties set forth in _Article III_ such that the condition set forth in
_Section 6.2(a)_ would be satisfied, as of the date hereof, no event has
occurred which (with or without notice, lapse of time or both) would
constitute a breach or failure to satisfy a condition by Parent or Merger Sub
under the terms and conditions of the Commitment Letters, and neither Parent
nor Merger Sub has any reason to believe that any of the conditions to the
Financing will not be satisfied by Parent or Merger Sub, as applicable, on a
timely basis or that the Financing will not be available to Parent on the
Closing Date. Parent has paid in full (or caused to be paid) any and all
commitment fees or other fees required to be paid pursuant to the terms
of the Commitment Letters on or before the date of this Agreement, and will
pay (or cause to be paid) all amounts due on or before the Closing Date. As
of the date hereof, the Commitment Letters have not been modified, amended or
altered and the commitments under the Commitment Letters have not been
withdrawn or rescinded in any respect, and, to the Knowledge of Parent, no
withdrawal or rescission thereof is contemplated.

  



  

(f) In no event shall the receipt or availability of any funds or
financing (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Financing) by Parent,
Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates or any other financing or
other transactions be a condition to any of Parent's or Merger Sub's
obligations under this Agreement.

  



  

Section 4.8. _Share Ownership_. As of the date hereof and at all
times prior to the time that is immediately prior to the Effective Time,
neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates (including Merger Sub) is or has
been at any time during the period commencing three years prior to the date
hereof through the date hereof, an "interested shareholder" of the Company, as
such term is defined in Section 203 of the DGCL, and neither Parent nor any
of its Subsidiaries (including Merger Sub) is or will be the beneficial owner
of any Shares.

  



    

 | 28| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

Section 4.9. _Fee Funding Arrangement_. Concurrently with the
execution of this Agreement, the Permira Funds and the Spectrum Arrangement
Funds have each delivered to the Company a true, complete and correct copy of
a duly executed Fee Funding Arrangement. Each Fee Funding Arrangement is in
full force and effect, has not been amended, modified, withdrawn or rescinded
in any respect, and is the legal, valid, binding and enforceable obligation
of the Permira Funds and the Spectrum Arrangement Funds, as applicable. No
event has occurred or circumstance exists which, with or without notice,
lapse of time or both, could constitute a default or breach on the part of
the Permira Funds or the Spectrum Arrangement Funds under the applicable Fee
Funding Arrangement.

  



  

Section 4.10. _Brokers_. No broker, finder, investment banker,
financial advisor or other similar Person, other than J.P. Morgan Securities
LLC, the fees and expenses of which will be paid by Parent, is entitled to
any broker's, finder's, financial advisor's or other similar fee or
commission in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub or any
of their respective Affiliates.

  



  

Section 4.11. _Solvency_.

  



  

(a) Neither Parent nor Merger Sub is entering into the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement with the actual intent to hinder, delay or
defraud either present or future creditors of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. As of the Effective Time, assuming (i) the satisfaction or
waiver of the conditions set forth in _Sections 6.1_ and _6.2_ , and (ii) (A)
the representations and warranties of the Company contained in this Agreement
(other than those qualified by materiality or "Company Material Adverse
Effect") are true and correct in all material respects and (B) the
representations and warranties of the Company contained in this Agreement
that are qualified by materiality or "Company Material Adverse Effect" are
true and correct in all respects, after giving effect to all of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Financing and
the payment of the aggregate Merger Consideration (including the amounts
payable pursuant to _Sections 2.7_ and _2.8_ ) and any other repayment or
refinancing of debt that may be required in connection with the consummation
of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
payment of all related fees and expenses, the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, will be Solvent.

  



  

(b) For purposes of this _Section 4.11_: (i) the term " _Solvent_ "
means, with respect to any Person as of a particular date, that on such date,
(A) the sum of the assets, at a fair valuation, of such Person exceeds its
debts, (B) such Person has not incurred debts beyond its ability to pay such
debts as such debts mature and (C) such Person does not have unreasonably
small capital with which to conduct its business; (ii) "debt" means any
liability whether or not reduced to judgment, liquidated, unliquidated,
fixed, contingent, matured, unmatured, disputed, undisputed, legal,
equitable, secured or unsecured; and (iii) the amount of any unliquidated or
contingent liabilities at any time shall be the maximum amount which, in
light of all the facts and circumstances existing at such time, could
reasonably be expected to become an actual or matured liability.

  



  

(c) Prior to the date of this Agreement, the Permira Funds'
previously announced investment of $350 million in Parent was consummated and
the Permira Funds are, and will continue to be, the majority shareholder of
Parent, owning a majority of the outstanding and issuable equity interests of
Parent and with control and authority to direct the actions of Parent, subject
to applicable law.

Section 4.12. _Exclusivity of Representations_. Except for the
representations and warranties expressly set forth in this _Article IV_,
neither Parent nor Merger Sub nor any other Person makes any other express or
implied representation or warranty on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub or any
of their respective Affiliates.

  



  

Section 4.13. _No Other Company Representations or Warranties_. Each
of Parent and Merger Sub has conducted its own independent review and
analysis of the business and assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, and
each of them acknowledges that it and its Representatives have received
access to such books and records, facilities, equipment, Contracts and other
assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries that it and its Representatives

this _Section 5.2(c)_, including any public announcement that the Company or
the Company Board has made any determination required under this _Section
5.2(c)_ to take or engage in any such actions, shall not constitute a Change

(d) Except as set forth in _Section 5.2(e)_ or in _Section
5.2(f)_, the Company Board shall not (i) publicly withhold, withdraw, amend,
qualify or modify (or publicly propose to withhold, withdraw, amend, qualify

Company Recommendation, (vi) following the initial public announcement of any

contemplated by Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange Act other than recommending
rejection of such tender offer or exchange offer) within ten (10)
Business Days of commencement of such tender offer or exchange offer or (vii)
publicly announce its intention, authorize or resolve to take, or that it
will fail to take, as applicable, any such foregoing actions (any of the
foregoing, a " _Change of Recommendation_ ").

  



  

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary set
forth in this Agreement, (x) if the Company Board determines that an
Intervening Event has occurred and that the failure to effect a Change of
Recommendation in response to such Intervening Event would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law or (y) if the
Company has received a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal from a third
party that was not solicited, initiated, encouraged, facilitated or otherwise
obtained in breach, in any material respect, of the provisions of this
Agreement and that the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with the Company's outside legal counsel and financial advisors,
constitutes a Superior Proposal (after giving effect to all of the adjustments
to the terms and conditions of this Agreement that have been proposed to the
Company by Parent in writing during the Notice Period provided pursuant to
this _Section 5.2(e)_ to which Parent has irrevocably committed), then the
Company Board may effect a Change of Recommendation and/or, in response to a
Superior Proposal, terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.3(a)_ in
order to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement providing for such
Superior Proposal; _provided_ , that, in the case of either _clause (x)_ or

at least three (3) Business Days in advance (the " _Notice Period_ "), that
it intends to effect a Change of Recommendation and/or terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.3(a)_, which notice shall specify the basis
for the Change of Recommendation and/or termination and, in the case of a
Superior Proposal, the identity of the Person or group of Persons making such
Superior Proposal and the material terms thereof and a copy of any
proposed Alternative Acquisition Agreement and any related financing
commitments (which may be redacted for provisions related to fees and other
economic "flex" terms that are customarily redacted in connection with
transactions of such type); and

  



    

 | 37| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(ii) the Company's Representatives shall have been available to
negotiate with Parent and Merger Sub in good faith (to the extent Parent and
Merger Sub desire to negotiate) during the Notice Period to make such
adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement as would obviate
the need for the Company to effect a Change of Recommendation and/or terminate
this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.3(a)_.

  



  

 _provided_ , _further_ , that the actions of the Company or the Company
Board in making any of the foregoing determinations and the Company's
authorizing and providing of any such notice pursuant to this section shall
not in and of itself constitute a Change of Recommendation for any purpose
hereunder or the termination of this Agreement, so long as the Company Board
does not determine finally to make a Change of Recommendation or terminate
the Agreement.

  



  

(f) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.2_ or elsewhere in this
Agreement shall be deemed to prohibit the Company or the Company Board or any
committee thereof from (i) making any disclosure to the Company's stockholders
if, in the good faith judgment of the Company Board, after consultation with
its outside legal counsel, failure to make such disclosure could reasonably be
likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law,

including taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by
Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A under the

any "stop-look-and-listen" communication to stockholders of the Company
pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act (or any similar
communications to stockholders of the Company). The Company shall in no event
be deemed to violate this _Section 5.2_ as a result of responding to any
unsolicited proposal or inquiry solely by advising the Person making such
proposal or inquiry of the terms of this _Section 5.2_.

  



  

(g) The Company shall:

  



  

(i) promptly (and, in any event, within forty-eight (48) hours),
notify Parent, in writing, if, from and after the date hereof until the No-
Shop Period Start Date, any offer constituting an Acquisition Proposal is
received by the Company or any of its Representatives, indicating (except to
the extent prohibited by applicable Law or Contract) the identity of the
Person or group of Persons making such Acquisition Proposal and a description
of the material terms and conditions of any such Acquisition Proposal,

informed of the status and terms of any such Acquisition Proposal (including
any material changes, modifications or amendments thereto); and

Representatives, indicating (except to the extent prohibited by applicable

Agreement, from and after the No-Shop Period Start Date, the Company shall be
permitted to terminate, waive, amend or release any provision of any
confidentiality, "standstill" or similar obligation of any Person if the
Company Board determines in good faith after consultation with its outside
legal counsel that failure to take such action could reasonably be expected
to be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations under applicable Law.

submitting this Agreement to the Company's stockholders, the Company Board
may submit this Agreement to the Company's stockholders without the Company
Recommendation, in which event the Company Board may communicate the basis for
its lack of recommendation to the Company's stockholders in the Proxy
Statement or an appropriate amendment thereof or supplement thereto. Parent
agrees to provide or cause to be provided all information with respect to
itself, its Affiliates and their respective Representatives as may be
reasonably requested by the Company for inclusion in the Proxy Statement and
any such other filings.

correspondence with the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement. The Company
and Parent shall each use its reasonable best efforts to promptly provide
responses to the SEC with respect to all comments received on the Proxy
Statement from the SEC and to make any amendments or filings as may be
necessary in connection therewith. The Company shall cause the definitive
Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Company's stockholders as promptly as
reasonably practicable after the date the SEC staff advises that it has no
further comments thereon or that the Company may commence mailing the Proxy
Statement.

(c) Subject to applicable Law, prior to filing or mailing the Proxy
Statement or filing any other required filings (or, in each case, any

SEC with respect thereto, the Company shall (unless and until a Change of
Recommendation has occurred or in connection with the matters described in
_Section 5.2_) provide Parent with an opportunity to review and comment on
(which comments shall be made promptly) such document or response and shall
consider in good faith including in such document or response comments
reasonably proposed by Parent.

Agreement; _provided_ , that the Company may postpone or adjourn to a later
date the Stockholders Meeting (i) with the consent of Parent (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), (ii) to
allow time for the filing and dissemination of any supplemental or amended
disclosure document that the Company Board has determined in good faith is
required to be filed and disseminated under applicable Law, (iii) if there are
insufficient Shares represented (either in Person or by proxy) to constitute
a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the Stockholders Meeting, (iv)
if the Company has not received proxies representing a sufficient number of
shares of Common Stock to adopt this Agreement, or (v) if required by
applicable Law or if, in the good faith judgment of the Company Board (after
consultation with legal counsel), the failure to do so would be a violation
of its fiduciary obligations under applicable Law; _provided_ , _further_ ,
that in no event shall the Company be required to hold the Stockholders
Meeting prior to the fifth (5th) Business Day following the later of (A) the
No-Shop Period Start Date and (B) the first date as of which no Person
qualifies as an Excluded Party.

this _Section 5.5_, Parent and the Company each agrees to make, or cause to
be made (including, to the extent required, in the case of Parent, to cause
the Ultimate Parent Entity of Parent to make), an appropriate filing of a
Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as practicable (and
in any event within fifteen (15) Business Days) after the date hereof this
Agreement (unless a later date is mutually agreed between the parties hereto)
and each party hereto agrees (i) to respond, or cause to be responded to
(including, to the extent required, in the case of Parent, to cause any of the
Parent Entities to respond), as promptly as reasonably practicable any
inquiries or request for additional information and material from a
Governmental Entity pursuant to the HSR Act or any other Regulatory Law, and
(ii) to take all other actions necessary to cause the expiration or
termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act as promptly
as possible after the date of this Agreement. In furtherance and not in
limitation of the foregoing, the parties hereto shall (in the case of Parent,
cause the Parent Entities to) request and use reasonable best efforts to
obtain early termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act, and no party
shall (in the case of Parent, shall cause the Parent Entities not to) agree
to extend any waiting period under any Regulatory Law applicable to or commit
not to consummate any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
without the prior written consent of all other parties (such consent not to
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

  



  

(c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the other provisions of
this _Section 5.5_, but subject to the final sentence of this paragraph
limiting Parent's obligation to agree to the remedies specified in such
sentence, Parent shall, and shall cause each of the Parent Entities to, use
their respective reasonable best efforts to do all things necessary, proper,
or advisable to consummate and make effective, as soon as practicable, but in
any event before the Termination Date, the Merger. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, nothing in this _Section 5.5_ shall require Parent or
any of the Parent Entities or any of their respective Subsidiaries or
Affiliates to, and the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of
Parent, take or commit to take any action, including by consent decree, hold
separate order or otherwise, that would require the sale,
divestiture, disposition or license of, or limit in any respect Parent's, the
Parent Entities' (including the Surviving Corporation) or any of their
respective Subsidiaries' or Affiliates' freedom of action with respect to, or
their ability to operate or retain, one or more businesses, product lines,
rights, services, licenses or assets of Parent, the Parent Entities
(including the Surviving Corporation) or any of their respective Subsidiaries
or Affiliates, or the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, other than any such
actions that, individually or in the aggregate, are of a _de minimis_ nature.

its staff on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement or the
transactions and other agreements contemplated hereby (excluding any

doctrine), and (vi) promptly furnish the other parties with such necessary
information and reasonable assistance as such other parties and their
Affiliates may reasonably request in connection with their preparation of
necessary filings, registrations or submissions of information to any
Governmental Entity in connection with this Agreement or the transactions and
other agreements contemplated hereby and thereby, including any filings

Section 5.6. _Access and Reports_.

  



  

(a) Subject to applicable Law, from and after the date of this
Agreement to the Effective Time or the earlier termination of this
Agreement, upon reasonable request, the Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, afford to Parent, Merger Sub and/or their
respective Representatives reasonable access, during normal business hours,
to its officers, key employees, properties, offices and other facilities,
books, Contracts and records; _provided_ , that (i) the foregoing shall not
require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to permit access to (A) any
inspection or any information that would violate any of its obligations
with respect to confidentiality, (B) any information to the disclosure of
which would result in the loss of attorney-client privilege, accountant-
client privilege or other similar privilege applicable to such documents or
information, trade secret protection or the protection afforded under the
work product doctrine, (C) any information that in the reasonable opinion of
the Company would violate any applicable Law or result in a breach of a
Contract to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries are bound or (D) any
information related to the negotiation and execution of this Agreement or to
transactions potentially competing with or alternative to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or proposals from other third parties relating

with respect to any of the foregoing, whether prior to or after execution of
this Agreement; provided, that in the event the restrictions of the foregoing

Company shall, at Parent's request, reasonably cooperate in good faith to
design and implement alternative disclosure arrangements to enable Parent (or
alternatively one or more of the Parent Entities) to evaluate any such
information, in each case without resulting in any such violation or loss,
and (ii) any such investigation shall be conducted in such a manner as not to
interfere unreasonably with the normal business or operations of the Company
or its Subsidiaries or otherwise result in any undue burden with respect to
the prompt and timely discharge by employees of the Company or its
Subsidiaries of their normal duties and Parent shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to minimize to the extent reasonably practicable any
disruption to the businesses of the Company that may result from any such
requests for access. Each of Parent and the Company, as it deems advisable and
necessary, may reasonably designate as contemplated by the Clean Team NDA or

information were Evaluation Material (as defined in the Mutual NDA), which
Confidentiality Agreements shall remain in full force and effect in
accordance with its terms and shall apply to Parent and Merger Sub as if they
were direct parties thereto.

  



  

(c) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall

party or any of its Affiliates or Representatives in connection with, arising

consult with the other parties before issuing such press release or making
such public announcement or filing).

Section 5.8. _Employee Benefits_.

  



  

(a) For a period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on
December 31 of the year during which the Closing Date occurs (the "
_Continuation Period_ "), Parent shall, or shall cause its applicable
Subsidiary to, provide each employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries who
continues in employment with Parent, the Surviving Corporation or their
Subsidiaries following the Effective Time (collectively, the " _Continuing
Employees_ ") (while they are employed by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
their Subsidiaries) with (i) a base salary or regular hourly wage (whichever
is applicable) and annual cash incentive compensation opportunity that is
substantially comparable, in the aggregate, to the base salary or regular
hourly wage (whichever is applicable) and annual cash incentive compensation
opportunity for the applicable Continuing Employee as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time and (ii) other compensation and employee benefits
(excluding equity based compensation) that are no less favorable in the
aggregate than the other compensation and employee benefits (excluding equity
based compensation) provided or available to similarly situated employees of
Parent; _provided_ , that until such time as Parent or the Surviving
Corporation shall cause Continuing Employees to participate in a benefit plan
sponsored or maintained by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (each a " _New
Plan_ "), a Continuing Employee's continued participation in the applicable
Company Benefit Plan shall be deemed to satisfy the foregoing provisions of
this clause (ii) (it being understood that participation in the applicable New
Plans may commence at different times with respect to each Company Benefit
Plan). Effective as of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation hereby
expressly assumes the Company Benefit Plans and agrees to perform the
obligations of the Company thereunder in accordance with the terms and
conditions thereof.

  



  

(b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, during the
twelve month period immediately following the Closing Date, the
Surviving Corporation shall provide each Continuing Employee whose employment
is terminated by Parent or one of its Subsidiaries with severance in amounts
and on terms and conditions that are no less favorable than the severance
benefits and protections provided to each such Continuing Employee as set
forth in Section 5.8(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule (the " _Company
Severance Policy_ ").

  



  

(c) Parent shall cause any employee benefit plans of Parent and its
Subsidiaries in which the Continuing Employees are entitled to
participate during the Continuation Period to take into account for purposes
of eligibility and vesting and, solely with respect to severance, vacation,
and paid time off policies, benefit accruals (except to the extent it would
result in a duplication of benefits or was not recognized by the Company or
its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time), service prior to the Effective
Time by such employees to the Company and its Subsidiaries (and any
predecessors to the extent recognized by the Company and its Subsidiaries
prior to the Effective Time) as if such service were with Parent or its
Subsidiaries.

  



  

(d) With respect to any benefit plan sponsored or maintained by
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries in which Continuing Employees
participate during the Continuation Period, Parent shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to, (i) waive any eligibility requirements or pre-existing
condition limitations or waiting period requirements with respect to any such
plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical or vision benefits to any
Continuing Employee to the same extent waived under the analogous Company
Benefit Plan prior to the Closing Date, and (ii) give effect, in determining
any deductible, co-insurance and maximum out-of-pocket limitations, to any
eligible expenses paid by such employees during the calendar year in which the
Effective Time occurs (or such plan year in which a Continuing Employee
commences participation in any new plan of the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries) under analogous Company Benefit Plans.

  



    

 | 45| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(e) The Company shall take, or shall cause to be taken, all actions
necessary or appropriate to terminate, effective no later than the day
immediately preceding the Closing Date, any Company Benefit Plan sponsored or
maintained by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that contains a cash or
deferred arrangement intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code
(each, a " _401(k) Plan_ "), unless Parent, in its sole and absolute
discretion, provides the Company or such Subsidiary with written notice of
its election that any such 401(k) Plan should not be terminated (an "
_Election Notice_ ") at least three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing
Date. Unless Parent provides an Election Notice to the Company, the Company
shall deliver to Parent, on or prior to the Closing Date, evidence that the
Company's board of directors has validly adopted resolutions to terminate
each 401(k) Plan, effective no later than the day immediately preceding the
Closing Date. In the event that the 401(k) Plan is terminated, Continuing
Employees shall be eligible to participate, effective as of the first day of
the first month beginning after the Effective Time, in a 401(k) plan
sponsored or maintained by Parent or one of its Subsidiaries (the " _Parent
401(k) Plan_ "). The parties shall take any and all actions as may be
required, including amendments to the 401(k) Plan and Parent 401(k) Plan, to
permit the Continuing Employees who are actively employed to make rollover
contributions to the Parent 401(k) Plan of "eligible rollover distributions"
(with the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code) in the form of cash,
notes (in the case of loans) or a combination thereof.

  



  

(f) The parties to this Agreement agree that, with respect to any
matter addressed by this _Section 5.8_, the Company shall not be permitted
to send any written notice or any other communications or written materials to
any group of employees, officers, directors or consultants of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries without the prior written consent of Parent (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

  



  

(g)  Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any Continuing
Employee or other service provider any right to continue in the employ or
service of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any Affiliate of Parent, or
shall interfere with or restrict in any way the rights of Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates, which rights are
hereby expressly reserved, to discharge or terminate the services of any
Continuing Employee at any time for any reason whatsoever, with or without
cause. In no event shall the terms of this Agreement be deemed to (i)
establish, amend, or modify any Company Benefit Plan or any other employee
benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement maintained or sponsored by
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or their Affiliates, or (ii) alter or limit
the ability of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
Subsidiaries or Affiliates to amend, modify or terminate any Company Benefit
Plan in accordance with its terms after the Closing Date. Without limiting
_Section 8.9_, this _Section 5.8_ shall be binding upon and inure solely to
the benefit of each of the parties to this Agreement and nothing in this
_Section 5.8_ shall create any third party beneficiary rights in
any Continuing Employee or current or former service provider of the Company
or its Affiliates (or any beneficiaries or dependents thereof).

  



  

Section 5.9. _Expenses; Transfer Taxes_.

  



  

(a) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or the Fee
Funding Arrangements, whether or not the Merger is consummated, all costs
and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the
party incurring such expense, except that all filing fees under the HSR Act in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be
borne by Parent.

  



  

(b) Except as otherwise provided in _Section 2.7(b)(ii)_, all
transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other such Taxes
imposed with respect to the transfer of Shares pursuant to the Merger shall be
borne by the Surviving Corporation.

Section 5.10. _Indemnification; Directors ' and Officers'
Insurance_.

  



  

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to, indemnify and hold harmless, to the
fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, each present and former (or
future, but prior to the Effective Time) director, officer and employee of
the Company or any Subsidiary, including any employee who serves as a
fiduciary of a Company Benefit Plan (collectively, together with such
person's heirs, executors or administrators, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ")
against any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees),
judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in
settlement incurred in connection with any actual or threatened Action or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
arising out of, related to or in connection with any action or omission
occurring or alleged to have occurred whether prior to or at the Effective
Time (including in connection with such Indemnified Parties' service as a
director, officer, employee or other fiduciary of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or services performed by such persons at the request of or for
the benefit of the Company or its Subsidiaries), whether asserted or claimed
prior to, at or after the Effective Time, including, for the avoidance of
doubt, in connection with (i) the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(including as to any act or omission occurring or alleged to have occurred in
connection with the process resulting in and the adoption and approval of
this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby)
and (ii) actions to enforce this provision or any other indemnification,
exculpation or advancement right of any Indemnified Party. Without limiting
the foregoing, Parent, for a period of six (6) years from and after the
Effective Time, shall cause the Charter and the Bylaws to contain provisions
no less favorable to the Indemnified Parties with respect to indemnification,
exculpation from liabilities and rights to advancement of expenses than those
set forth as of the date of this Agreement in the certificate of incorporation
and bylaws of the Company, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or
otherwise modified in a manner that would adversely affect the rights
thereunder of any Indemnified Party. In addition, from and after the
Effective Time, each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall
advance costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees) as incurred by any
Indemnified Party promptly (and in any event within ten (10) days) after
receipt by Parent of a request for such advance to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Law; _provided_ , that the Person to whom expenses
are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is
ultimately determined (after exhausting all available appeals) that such
Person is not entitled to indemnification. Any Indemnified Party wishing to
claim indemnification under this _Section 5.10(a)_, upon learning of any
claim, action or proceeding in respect of which such indemnification will be
sought, shall notify the Surviving Corporation thereof in writing; provided,
that the failure to so notify the Surviving Corporation shall not affect the
indemnification obligations of the Surviving Corporation or Parent under this
_Section 5.10(a)_. For the avoidance of doubt, in the event of any matter in
respect of which indemnification is sought pursuant to this Agreement, Parent
and the Surviving Corporation shall cooperate with the Indemnified Party in
the defense of any such matter.

  



    

 | 47| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall obtain and fully
pre-pay the premium for (and, following the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to, maintain with reputable and financially sound carriers) the extension of
(i) the directors' and officers' liability coverage of the Company's existing
directors' and officers' insurance policies, and (ii) the Company's existing
fiduciary liability insurance policies (collectively,  " _D andO Insurance_"),
in each case for a claims reporting or discovery period (whichever is greater)
of six (6) years from and after the Effective Time with respect to any claim
arising from facts or events that existed or occurred at or prior to the
Effective Time with terms, conditions, retentions, coverage limits and limits
of liability that are at least as favorable as the coverage provided under
the Company's existing policies in effect on the date hereof. If the Company
and the Surviving Corporation for any reason fail to obtain such "tail"
insurance policies as of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall,
and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, continue to maintain in
effect for a period of six (6) years from and after the Effective Time the
DandO Insurance in place as of the date hereof with terms, conditions,
retentions, coverage limits and limits of liability that are at least as
favorable as the coverage provided in the Company's existing policies as of
the date hereof, or the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to, purchase comparable insurance as the DandO
Insurance for such six-year period with terms, conditions, retentions and
limits of liability that are at least as favorable as the coverage provided
under the Company's existing policies as of the date hereof.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (A) in no event shall the Company or the
Surviving Corporation be required to expend for any such policies pursuant to
this _Section 5.10(b)_ an annual premium amount in excess of 300% of the
aggregate of the annual premiums paid by the Company as of immediately prior
to the Effective Time for such insurance, and (B) if the annual premiums of
such insurance coverage exceed such maximum amount, the Company or the
Surviving Corporation shall obtain a policy with the greatest
coverage available for such maximum amount.

  



  

(c) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their
successors or assigns shall (i) consolidate with or merge into any
other corporation or entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfer all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any individual, corporation
or other entity, then, in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so
that such surviving or acquiring Person(s), as the case may be, shall assume
all of the obligations set forth in this _Section 5.10_.

  



  

(d) The provisions of this _Section 5.10_ are intended to be for
the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties.

  



  

(e) The rights of the Indemnified Parties under this _Section 5.10_
shall be in addition to any rights such Indemnified Parties may have under
the certificate of incorporation or bylaws or comparable governing documents
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, under any applicable Contracts or
Laws or otherwise. All rights to indemnification, exculpation from liabilities
for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time and rights
to advancement of expenses relating thereto now existing in favor of
any Indemnified Party (whether asserted or claimed prior to, at, or after the
Effective Time) as provided in the certificate of incorporation or bylaws or
comparable governing documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
any Contract or otherwise between such Indemnified Party and the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries shall survive the Merger and continue in full force
and effect (and shall be so maintained) and such rights shall not be amended,
repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely affect any
right thereunder of any such Indemnified Party. Nothing in this Agreement is
intended to, shall be construed to or shall release, waive or impair any
rights to insurance claims under any policy that is or has been in existence
with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any Indemnified
Party, it being understood and agreed that the indemnification provided for in
this  _Section 5.10_ is not prior to, or in substitution for, any such
claims under any such policies.

  



    

 | 48| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(f) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any actual
or threatened Action or investigation (whether arising before, at or after the
Effective Time) is made against such any such Indemnified Parties with
respect to matters subject to indemnification hereunder, the provisions of
this _Section 5.10_ shall continue in effect until the final disposition of
such Action or investigation (including continuing in effect until the final
disposition of any Action arising out of any such investigation).

  



  

Section 5.11. _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall take all steps reasonably necessary to cause any dispositions
of equity securities (including derivative securities) of the Company in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby by
each individual who is a director or officer of the Company to be exempt under
Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

  



  

Section 5.12. _Financing_.

  



  

(a) Parent and Merger Sub shall use reasonable best efforts to take,
or cause to be taken, all actions, and do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary, proper or advisable to obtain and consummate the Financing
on or prior to the date upon which the Merger is required to be consummated
pursuant to the terms hereof. In furtherance and not in limitation of the
foregoing, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to
be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable to obtain the Financing on the terms and conditions
described in the Commitment Letters as promptly as possible but in any
event prior to the date upon which the Merger is required to be consummated
pursuant to the terms hereof, including by (i) maintaining in effect the
Commitment Letters and (ii) satisfying (or obtaining a waiver of) on a timely
basis all conditions applicable to Parent and Merger Sub in the Commitment
Letters (including consummating the Refinancing (as defined in the Debt
Commitment Letter)) and complying with their obligations thereunder. In the
event that all conditions contained in the Commitment Letters (other than (x)
with respect to the Debt Financing, the availability of the Equity Financing,
(y) with respect to the Equity Financing, the availability of the Debt
Financing and (z) other conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at
the Closing) have been satisfied, Parent and Merger Sub shall use their
reasonable best efforts to cause the Lenders and Investors to fund the
Financing in an amount no less than the Merger Amounts (including by seeking
to enforce their rights under the Commitment Letters, in the event of any
breach by the other parties thereto). To the extent necessary to consummate
the Closing, Parent will use the proceeds of the Financing otherwise
earmarked for post-Closing obligations and/or cash made available by the
Company to satisfy Merger Amounts required to be satisfied on the Closing
Date. Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall comply with its respective
obligations under the Commitment Letters in a timely and diligent manner.

  



    

 | 49| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) Parent shall not, and shall not permit Merger Sub to, without
the prior written consent of the Company: (i) permit (x) any amendment
or modification to, or any waiver of any provision or remedy under, the
Commitment Letters or (y) the replacement of the Second Lien Facility by any
Alternate Junior Financing (each as defined in the Debt Commitment Letter) as
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter, if such amendment, modification,
waiver or replacement (A) adds new (or adversely modifies any existing)
conditions to the consummation of all or any portion of the Financing, (B)
reduces the amount of the Financing, (C) adversely affects the ability of
Parent to enforce its rights against other parties to the Commitment Letters
as so amended, replaced, supplemented or otherwise modified, relative to the
ability of Parent or Merger Sub, as applicable, to enforce its rights against
the other parties to the Commitment Letters as in effect on the date hereof
or (D) could otherwise reasonably be expected to prevent, impede or delay
the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement; or (ii) terminate a Commitment Letter.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, it is understood
and agreed that the Parent may amend the Debt Commitment Letter to add
lenders, arrangers, bookrunners, agents, managers or similar entities that
have not executed the Debt Commitment Letter as of the date of this
Agreement. Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly deliver to the Company copies
of any amendment, modification, waiver or replacement of a Commitment Letter
and the documentation related to any Alternate Junior Financing (as defined in
the Debt Commitment Letter).

  



  

(c) In the event that any portion of the Debt Financing becomes
unavailable, regardless of the reason therefor, Parent and Merger Sub will
(i) use reasonable best efforts to obtain alternative debt financing (in an
amount no less than, when taken together with the available portion of the
Financing, the Merger Amounts) from the same or other sources on terms and
conditions that substantially equivalent or more favorable to Parent and its
Subsidiaries than the terms and conditions contemplated in the Debt Commitment
Letter and which do not include any terms or conditions to the consummation
of such alternative debt financing that would reasonably be expected to make
the funding of such alternative debt financing less likely to occur than the
conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter and (ii) promptly notify
the Company of such unavailability and the reason therefor. For the purposes
of this Agreement, the term "Debt Commitment Letter" and "Debt Financing"
shall be deemed to include any commitment letter (or similar agreement) (and
the financing contemplated thereby) with respect to any alternative or
replacement financing arranged in compliance herewith including any Alternate
Junior Financing (as defined in the Debt Commitment Letter) (and any
Debt Commitment Letter remaining in effect at the time in question). Parent
and Merger Sub shall provide the Company with reasonably prompt notice (which
may be oral or in writing) of any material breach or material default by any
party to the Debt Commitment Letter of which Parent or Merger Sub obtain
Knowledge and the receipt of any written notice or other written communication
from any Lender with respect to any breach, default, termination or
repudiation by any party to the Debt Commitment Letter or any
definitive agreement with respect thereto of any provision thereof. At the
request of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall keep the
Company reasonably informed on a reasonably current basis of the status of
its efforts to consummate the Financing. The foregoing
notwithstanding, compliance by Parent and Merger Sub with this _Section
5.12_ shall not relieve Parent and Merger Sub of their obligations to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement whether or not the
Financing is available.

reasonably request in connection with the Debt Financing, and, upon request,
identifying any such information, if any, as is suitable for distribution to
"public side" lenders;

foregoing);

  



  

(viii) furnishing to Parent, at least three (3) Business Days prior to

 | 52| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

it being understood that the Company shall have satisfied its obligations set
forth in _clauses (ii)_, _(iii)_ , _(v)_ , _(vi)_ , _(vii)_ , _(ix),_  and
_(x)_ of this sentence if the Company shall have used its reasonable best
efforts to comply with such obligations whether or not any applicable
deliverables are actually obtained or provided. The foregoing notwithstanding,
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to take or
permit the taking of any action pursuant to this _Section 5.13_ that (A)
would require the Company, its Subsidiaries or any Persons who are directors
of the Company or its Subsidiaries to pass resolutions or consents to approve
or authorize the execution of the Debt Financing or execute or deliver any
certificate, document, instrument or agreement or agree to any change or
modification of any existing certificate, document, instrument or agreement
(other than (i) using reasonable best efforts to deliver the customary
authorization letters referred to in _clause (ii)_ of this _Section
5.13(a)_ or (ii) those effective as of the Closing), (B) cause any
representation or warranty in this Agreement to be breached by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, (C) require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
pay any commitment or other similar fee or incur any other expense, liability
or obligation in connection with the Debt Financing prior to the Closing or

agreement, certificate, document or instrument be effective until the
Closing, (D) cause any director, officer or employee or stockholder of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to incur any personal liability, (E)
provide access to or disclose information that the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries determines would jeopardize any attorney-client privilege of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries; _provided_ , that in the event the
restrictions of the foregoing _clause (ii)(E)_ apply, the Company shall
provide Parent with a reasonable description of the information not provided
and the Company shall cooperate in good faith to design and implement
alternative disclosure arrangements to enable to evaluate any such
information, in each case without resulting in any such violation, (F)
require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into any instrument or
agreement that is effective prior to the Effective Time or that would be
effective if the Closing does not occur (other than using reasonable best
efforts to deliver the customary authorization letters referred to in _clause
(ii)_ of this _Section 5.13(a)_) or (G) in respect of its obligations set
forth in clauses (i), (ii), (iii), (v), (vi), (vii), (ix), and (x) above,
would unreasonably and materially interfere with the ongoing operations of
the Company and its Subsidiaries. Nothing contained in this _Section
5.13_ or otherwise shall require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
prior to the Closing, to be an issuer or other obligor with respect to the
Debt Financing. Parent shall, promptly upon request by the Company, reimburse
the Company for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred by the Company or
its Subsidiaries or their respective Representatives in connection with the
cooperation contemplated by this _Section 5.13_ and shall indemnify and hold
harmless the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective
Representatives from and against any and all losses suffered or incurred by
them in connection with the arrangement of the Debt Financing, any action
taken by them at the request of Parent pursuant to this _Section 5.13_ and
any information used in connection therewith (other than (x) as a result of
the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such indemnitee or (y)
information provided in writing by the Company or its Subsidiaries
specifically in connection with its obligations pursuant to this _Section
5.13_).

  



  

(b) For the avoidance of doubt, the parties hereto acknowledge and
agree that the provisions contained in this _Section 5.13_, represent the
sole obligation of the Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective
Representatives with respect to cooperation in connection with the
arrangement of any financing (including the Financing) to be obtained by
Parent or Merger Sub with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and no other provision of this Agreement (including the Exhibits and
Schedules hereto) shall be deemed to expand or modify such obligations. In no
event shall the receipt or availability of any funds or financing (including,
for the avoidance of doubt, the Financing) by Parent, Merger Sub or any of
their respective Affiliates or any other financing or other transactions be a
condition to any of Parent's or Merger Sub's obligations under this Agreement.

  



  

(c) All non-public or otherwise confidential information regarding
the Company or its Subsidiaries obtained by Parent or its
Representatives pursuant to this _Section 5.13_ shall be kept confidential
in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreements; _provided_ , that Parent
and Merger Sub shall be permitted to disclose information as necessary and
consistent with customary practices in connection with the Financing subject
to customary confidentiality arrangements set forth in the Debt Commitment
Letter. The Company hereby consents to the reasonable and customary use of
its and its Subsidiaries' logos in connection with the Debt Financing.

  



  

Section 5.14. _Transaction Litigation_. The Company, on the one
hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, shall give each other the
opportunity to participate in the defense, settlement or prosecution of any
Transaction Litigation; _provided_ , that no such party or Representative of
such party shall compromise, settle, come to an arrangement regarding or agree
to compromise, settle or come to an arrangement regarding any Transaction
Litigation or consent to the same unless the Company, in the case of any such
action by Parent or Merger Sub, or Parent, in the case of any such action by
the Company, shall have consented in writing (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned). Without limiting in any way
the obligations of the parties hereto under  _Section 5.5_, each of the
Company and Parent shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to,
cooperate in the defense or settlement of any Transaction Litigation.

Board who are in office immediately prior to the Effective Time, which
resignations shall be effective as of (but conditioned on the occurrence of)
the Effective Time.

  



  

Section 5.16. _State Takeover Statutes_. The Company and the Company
Board and the Parent and the Parent Board shall (a) take all
reasonable action necessary to ensure that no Takeover Statute is or becomes
applicable to the Merger and (b) if any Takeover Statute becomes applicable
to the Merger, take all reasonable action necessary to ensure that the Merger
may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by
this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such Takeover Statute
on the Merger. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Takeover Statute_ " shall
mean a "fair price," "moratorium,"  "control share acquisition" or similar
anti-takeover statute or regulation enacted under the Laws of any state in
the United States that is applicable to the Company.

  



  

Section 5.17. _Conduct of Parent and Merger Sub; Obligations of
Merger Sub_.

purchasing all or a portion of the assets of or all or a portion of the
equity in, or entering into an exclusive business arrangement with, any Person
set forth on Section 5.17(a) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule.

  



  

(b) Parent shall take all actions necessary to cause Merger Sub and
the Surviving Corporation to perform when due their respective
obligations under this Agreement.

without the prior written consent of the Company (not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), Parent shall not permit or agree to permit
any Person who holds Shares to rollover (or reinvest the Merger Consideration
with respect to (or other proceeds from the sale of) such Shares) for any
equity interests (or rights to obtain any equity interests) in Parent or any
Person of which Merger Sub is a direct or indirect Subsidiary.

due and payable in accordance with this _Section 7.5(c)(i)_, from and after
such termination and timely payment of the Parent Termination Fee in full
pursuant to and in accordance with this _Section 7.5(c)(i)_, Parent shall

Agreement (including failing to take such actions as are required of them in
order to consummate the Merger) in accordance with its specified terms or
otherwise breach or threaten to breach such provisions. The parties
acknowledge and agree that the parties hereto shall be entitled, in addition
to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity, to an

prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof.

  



  

(b) Without limiting the foregoing, each of the parties agrees that
it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and
other equitable relief on the basis that (i) there is adequate remedy at law
or (ii) an award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any
reason at law or in equity. Any party seeking an order or injunction to
prevent breaches or threatened breaches and to enforce specifically the terms
and provisions of this Agreement shall not be required to provide any bond or
other security in connection with any such order or injunction.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the parties
hereto hereby acknowledge and agree that the Company shall be entitled to
specific performance or any other equitable remedy to cause Parent or Merger
Sub to consummate the Merger only if (A) all conditions set forth in _Section
6.1_ and _Section 6.2_ have been satisfied or waived (other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing (
_provided_ , that those other conditions would be capable of being satisfied
if the Closing were on such date)) and Parent has failed to consummate the
Closing when required to hereunder, (B) the Debt Financing (or any alternative
thereto in accordance with this Agreement) has been funded or would be funded
following the delivery of a drawdown notice by Parent and the satisfaction of
those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing,
including the funding of the Equity Financing and (C) the Company has
irrevocably confirmed in writing to Parent that if specific performance is
granted and the Debt Financing is funded, then it is willing to complete the
Closing in accordance with _Article I_.

  



  

(c) While the Company may pursue either (i) a grant of specific
performance in accordance with this _Section 8.7_ or (ii) the payment of
either the Parent Termination Fee or the Reverse Termination Fee in accordance
with _Section 7.5_, under no circumstances will the Company be entitled to
receive both (A) a grant of specific performance to cause the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby and (B) any portion of either the
Parent Termination Fee or the Reverse Termination Fee.

may not be amended in a manner adverse to any Debt Financing Source Party in
any respect without the prior written consent of the Lead Arrangers), (c) if

beneficiaries of, and shall be entitled to rely on, _Article II_, (d) if the
Effective Time occurs, the Indemnified Parties shall be third party
beneficiaries of, and shall be entitled to rely on, _Section 5.10_ (
