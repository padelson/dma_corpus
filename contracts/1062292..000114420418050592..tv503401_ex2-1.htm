of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the parties, and no presumption
or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provision of this Agreement.
Where a reference in this Agreement is made to a Section or Exhibit, such reference shall be to a Section of or Exhibit to this
Agreement unless otherwise indicated. Whenever the words &ldquo;include,&rdquo; &ldquo;includes&rdquo; or &ldquo;including&rdquo;
are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words &ldquo;without limitation.&rdquo; The words &ldquo;hereof,&rdquo;
 &ldquo;herein&rdquo; and &ldquo;hereunder&rdquo; and words of similar import when used in this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement
as a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement. The word &ldquo;or&rdquo; shall be deemed to mean &ldquo;and/or.&rdquo;

as otherwise indicated in this Agreement. The definitions contained in this Agreement are applicable to the singular as well as

any applicable Law. All references to dollar amounts in this Agreement shall be references to U.S. dollars unless otherwise expressly
set forth herein. The mere inclusion of an item in the Company Disclosure Schedule or the Parent Disclosure Schedule as an exception
to a representation or warranty shall not be deemed an admission that such item represents a material exception or material fact,
event or circumstance or that such item is material or constitutes a Company Material Adverse Effect or Parent Material Adverse
Effect or that the inclusion of such item therein is required. For purposes of this Agreement, the term &ldquo;made available&rdquo;,
with respect to any document or item required to be made available to Parent as of the date of this Agreement or otherwise, shall
mean such document or item has been provided directly to Parent, Investors or any of the foregoing&rsquo;s Affiliates or other
