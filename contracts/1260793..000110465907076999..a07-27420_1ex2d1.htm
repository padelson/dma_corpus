Subsidiaries or Related Entities shall be required to take any such action

# **ARTICLE III 
 EFFECTS OF THE MERGER**

  

Section 3.01 _Effects of Merger on Shares_. As of the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Parent, Merger
Sub, the holders of Company Common Shares or holders of any limited liability
interests in Parent or Merger Sub:

  

### (a) The membership interests of Merger Sub issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into issued and
outstanding membership interests of the Surviving Entity, so that thereafter
Parent will be the sole and exclusive owner of the membership interests of
the Surviving Entity.

  

### (b) Each Company Common Share that is owned by the Parent, Merger Sub or
any other wholly-owned Subsidiaries of Parent or by the Company (held in
treasury) or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no
payment shall be made with respect thereto.

  

### (c) Each Company Common Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time (other than shares to be canceled in accordance with
_Section 3.01(b)_ and Dissenting Shares) shall automatically be converted
into, and shall be cancelled in exchange for, the right to receive an amount
in cash, without interest, equal to (i) $13.30, plus (ii) an amount equal to
the product obtained by multiplying $0.00164384 by the number of days between
the last dividend declaration date for which regular monthly dividends on the
Company Common Shares have been declared and the date immediately prior to
the Closing Date, less (iii) the sum of all Excess Distributions (the "
_Company Common Share Merger Consideration_ "). As of the Effective Time, all
Company Common Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than shares to be canceled in accordance with _Section
3.01(b)_ and Dissenting Shares) shall be cancelled in accordance with this
_Section 3.01(c)_ , and when so cancelled, shall no longer be outstanding and
shall automatically cease to exist, and (x) each holder of a certificate (a "
_Certificate_ ") representing any such Company Common Share shall cease to
have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Company
Common Share Merger Consideration for each such Company Common Share, without
interest and (y) each holder of shares of Company Common Shares not
represented by a Certificate (each an " _Uncertificated Share_ ") shall
thereafter only have the right to receive the Company Common Share Merger
Consideration for each such Uncertificated Share, without interest.

  

Section 3.02 _Equity Awards_.

  

### (a) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each qualified or
nonqualified option to purchase Company Common Shares granted under the
Incentive Plans that is outstanding and unexercised as of the Effective Time
(whether vested or unvested) (collectively, the " _Options_ ") shall be
cancelled, and the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive from the
Company, in consideration for such cancellation, a single lump sum
cash payment equal to the product of (A) the number of Company Common
Shares issuable upon exercise of such Option

  



        
   

  



  

### (assuming full vesting) immediately prior to the Effective Time and (B)
the excess, if any, of the Company Common Share Merger Consideration over the
exercise price per Company Common Share issuable upon exercise of such Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time, less any required withholding taxes
(the " _Option Merger Consideration_ "). For the purposes of clarity, all tax
deductions created as a result of the cancellation and exchange of Options
for the Option Merger Consideration pursuant to this _Section 3.02(a)_ shall
be for the benefit of the Company and all parties to this Agreement shall
file all Tax returns consistently with the foregoing.

  

(b) The Company shall take all actions necessary to ensure that the Options
and the Incentive Plans shall be terminated and the provisions in any other
plan, program, arrangement or agreement providing for the issuance or grant
of any other interest in respect of equity interests in the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries shall be deemed to be terminated and of no further force and
effect as of the Effective Time and no holder of any Option or any
participant in any Incentive Plan shall, thereafter, have any right
thereunder to (i) acquire any securities of the Company, the Surviving Entity
or any Subsidiary thereof, or (ii) receive any payment or benefit with
respect to any award previously granted under the Incentive Plans except as
provided in _Section 3.02(a)_.

Company Common Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time and that are held by Company stockholders who, in
accordance with Title 3, Subtitle 2, of the MGCL (the " _Dissenter s Rights
Provisions_"), (i) properly filed a written objection prior to the Company
Stockholders Meeting, (ii) have not voted in favor of approving this
Agreement and the Merger, (iii) shall have demanded properly in writing fair
value for such shares, and (iv) have not effectively withdrawn, lost or
failed to perfect their rights under the Dissenters Rights Provisions
(collectively, the " _Dissenting Shares_ "), will not be converted as
described in _Section 3.01(c)_ or have the right to receive the Company
Common Share Merger Consideration but at the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, shall be
cancelled and shall cease to exist and shall represent the right to receive
only those rights provided under the Dissenters Rights Provisions;
_provided, however, that_ all Company Common Shares held by Company
stockholders who shall have failed to perfect or who effectively shall have
withdrawn or lost their rights to demand fair value of such Company
Common Shares under the Dissenters Rights Provisions shall thereupon be
deemed to have been canceled and to have been converted, as of the Effective
Time, into the right to receive the Company Common Share Merger Consideration
relating thereto, without interest, in the manner provided in _Section
3.01(c)_. Persons who have perfected statutory rights with respect to
Dissenting Shares (the " _Dissenting Stockholders_ ") as described above will

Dissenting Shares.

  

### (b) The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any demands received
by the Company for appraisal of any Shares, withdrawals or such demands and

### (c) No dissenters or appraisal or similar rights shall be available with
respect to the Contemplated Transactions.

  

Section 3.04 _Paying Agent; Exchange Procedure_.

  

### (a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint a
bank or trust company reasonably satisfactory to the Company to act as Paying
Agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ") for the payment in accordance with this
_Article III_ of the Company Common Share Merger Consideration. At or before
the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the
Paying Agent a cash amount in immediately available funds equal to the
product of (x) the Company Common Share Merger Consideration and (y) the
number of Company Common Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time (exclusive of any Dissenting Shares and Company Common
Shares to be cancelled pursuant to _Section 3.01(b)_ ) (such cash being
referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The Parent shall cause the Paying
Agent to make, and the Paying Agent shall make, payments of the Company
Common Share Merger Consideration out of the Exchange Fund in accordance with
this Agreement. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose.
Any and all interest earned on cash deposited in the Exchange Fund shall be
paid to the Surviving Entity.

  

### (b) _Share Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the share
transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be
no further registration of transfers of the Company Common Shares. From and
after the Effective Time, persons who held Company Common Shares immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have rights with respect to such
shares, except as otherwise provided for herein. On or after the
Effective Time, any Certificates of the Company (or affidavits of loss in
lieu thereof) presented to the Paying Agent, the Surviving Entity or the
transfer agent for any reason shall be cancelled and exchanged for the
Company Common Share Merger Consideration, with respect to the Company Common
Shares formerly represented thereby.

  

### (c) _Exchange Procedures for Certificates_. Promptly after the Effective
Time (but in any event within four (4) Business Days), the Surviving Entity
or Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each person who immediately
prior to the Effective Time held of record Company Common Shares (other than
holders of Dissenting Shares and Shares to be canceled pursuant to
_Section 3.01(b)_ ): (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that
delivery of Certificates shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass to the Paying Agent, only upon delivery of the
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to the Paying Agent, and
which letter shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent
and the Company may reasonably agree) and (ii) instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of the holders Certificates (or affidavits of loss
in lieu thereof) in exchange for the Company Common Share Merger
Consideration as provided in _Section 3.01_ to which the holder thereof is
entitled. Upon surrender of a Certificate (or affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof) for cancellation to the Paying Agent together with such letter of
transmittal, duly executed and completed in accordance with the instructions
thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying
Agent, or, in the case of Uncertificated Shares, at or promptly following the
receipt by the Paying Agent of a duly executed letter of transmittal and such
other documentation as may be reasonably required by the Paying Agent, the
holder of such Certificate or Uncertificated Shares shall receive in exchange
therefor the Company Common Share Merger Consideration (after

  



        
   

  

### 

  

### giving effect any required Tax withholdings as provided in _Section 3.05_
) payable in respect of the Company Common Shares previously represented by
such Certificate or Uncertificated Shares pursuant to the provisions of this
_Article III_ , and any Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be
canceled.  In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Shares
that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment may be
made to a person other than the person in whose name the Certificate so
surrendered (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) is registered, if such
Certificate (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) shall be properly
endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the person
requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other Taxes required by
reason of the payment to a person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or establish to the
satisfaction of Parent that such tax has been paid or is not applicable.
Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 3.04_ , each Certificate
(or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive, upon such surrender,
the Company Common Share Merger Consideration as contemplated by this
_Section 3.04_. No interest shall be paid or accrue on the Company Common
Share Merger Consideration.

  

### (d) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Shares_. As of
the Effective Time, holders of Company Common Shares shall cease to be, and
shall have no rights as, stockholders of the Company other than the right to
receive the Company Common Share Merger Consideration provided under this
_Article III_. The Company Common Share Merger Consideration paid upon the
surrender for exchange of Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof) or in exchange for Uncertificated Shares representing Company Common
Shares in accordance with the terms of this _Article III_ shall be deemed to
have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights and privileges pertaining
to the Company Common Shares exchanged or redeemed theretofore and
represented by such Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or
Uncertificated Shares.

  

### (e) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
which remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Shares for
twelve (12) months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the
Surviving Entity, upon demand, and any holders of shares of Company Common
Shares prior to the Merger (other than Company Common Shares to be cancelled
pursuant to _Section 3.01(b)_ and Dissenting Shares) who have not theretofore
complied with this _Article III_ and the instructions set forth in the
letters of transmittal mailed to such holders after the Effective Time shall,
after such funds have been delivered to the Surviving Entity, look only to
the Surviving Entity (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar
Laws) for payment of the Company Common Share Merger Consideration (after
giving effect to any required tax withholdings as provided in _Section 3.05_
) due upon the surrender of their Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof) or in exchange for their Uncertificated Shares.

  

### (f) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the Paying
Agent, or any employee, officer, director, agent or Affiliate thereof, shall
be liable to any person in respect of any Company Common Share Merger
Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

  

### (g) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest the
cash included in the Exchange Fund, as directed by the Surviving Entity, on a
daily basis; _provided_ , _however_ , that such investments shall only be
in obligations of, or guaranteed by, the United

  



        
   

  



  

### States. Any net profit resulting from, or interest or income produced by,
such investments shall be placed in the Exchange Fund. To the extent that
there are losses with respect to such investments, or the Exchange Fund
diminishes for other reasons below the level required to make prompt payments
of the Company Common Share Merger Consideration as contemplated hereby,
Parent shall promptly replace or restore the portion of the Exchange Fund
lost through investments or other events so as to ensure that the Exchange
Fund is, at all times, maintained at a level sufficient to make such payment.

  

### (h) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate shall
have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that
fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed
and, if required by the Surviving Entity or the Paying Agent, the posting by
such person of a bond in such amount as the Surviving Entity or the Paying
Agent reasonably may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue
a check in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate in an
amount of the Company Common Share Merger Consideration (after giving effect
to any required tax withholdings as provided in _Section 3.05_ ) payable
in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

  

Section 3.05 _Withholding Rights_. The Surviving Entity, Parent or the
Paying Agent, as applicable, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder
of shares of Company Common Shares or Options such amounts as it is required
to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the
Code, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or any provision
of state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are so
withheld by the Surviving Entity, Parent or the Paying Agent, as applicable,
such withheld amounts shall be (i) remitted by the Surviving Entity, Parent
or the Paying Agent as applicable, to the applicable Governmental Authority
and (ii) shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the holder of the Company Common Shares or Options in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving Entity, Parent
or the Paying Agent, as applicable.

with the requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, as the case
may be, each as in effect on the date so filed. At the time filed with the

reference therein) contained, or, in the case of documents filed on or
after the date hereof will contain, in each case subject to the accuracy of
the representations and warranties set forth in _Sections 4.08_ and _5.05_
, any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted, or, in the case
of documents filed on or after the date hereof will omit, in each case
subject to the accuracy of the representations and warranties set forth in
_Sections 4.08_ and _5.05_ , to state a material fact required to be

the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except to the
extent such statements have been modified or superseded by later filings.

Related Entities as of December 31, 2006, including the notes thereto, (ii)
as incurred since December 31, 2006 in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice, or (iii) as would not, individually or in the

Since December 31, 2004, none of the Company, its Subsidiaries or any Related
Entity has been a party to any asset securitization transaction or "off-
balance sheet arrangement" (as defined in Rule 303 of Regulation S-K
promulgated under the Exchange Act).

  

### (c) The management of the Company has (i) implemented and maintains

time of filing or submission of each such certification, such certification
was, to the Knowledge of the Company, true and accurate and complied with
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. To the Knowledge of the Company, there is no reason
to believe that its auditors and its chief executive officer and chief
financial officer will not be able to give the certifications and
attestations required pursuant to the rules and regulations adopted pursuant
to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act when next due.

cause it to fail to comply with the requirements in Section 856(c)(4)(B)(iii)

or participating in discussions or negotiations with, any Person that after
the date hereof makes an unsolicited _bona fide_ Acquisition Proposal
in writing that did not otherwise result from a breach of this _Section 7.04_
, if (i) the Company Board determines in good faith after consulting with
its outside legal counsel and financial advisors of nationally
recognized reputation that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or is
reasonably likely to result in a Superior Proposal and (ii) prior to
furnishing such non-public information to such Person, the Company (A)
provides Parent with the information to be provided to such Person which
Parent has not previously been provided, and (B) receives from such Person an
executed confidentiality and standstill agreement no less favorable to the
Company (i.e., no less restrictive with respect to the conduct of such
Person) than the Confidentiality Agreement, if such Person is not already a
party to such an agreement, it being understood that such confidentiality
agreement need not prohibit the making, or amendment, of an Acquisition
Proposal.

  

### (b) The Company shall provide prompt (but in no event more than forty-
eight (48) hours following receipt thereof) oral and written notice to Parent
of the receipt of any Acquisition Proposal (including the identity of the

recommend, any Acquisition Proposal or (iii) cause or authorize the Company,
any of its Subsidiaries or any of the Related Entities to enter into any
agreement with respect to any Acquisition Proposal (other than a
confidentiality agreement in accordance with _Section 7.04(a)_ ).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to receipt of the Company
Stockholder Approval, (x) if the Company Board determines in good faith after
consulting with its outside legal counsel that the failure to do so would be
inconsistent with its duties to the Companys stockholders under applicable
Law, then the Company Board may withdraw, or modify or change in a manner
adverse to Parent, the Company Board Recommendation (" _Change in
Recommendation_ ") and (y) in the case of any Change in

  



        
   

  



  

### Recommendation being made in response to an unsolicited _bona fide_
written Acquisition Proposal (that did not otherwise result from a breach of
this _Section 7.04_ ) that the Company Board has determined in good faith,
after consultation with its independent financial advisor, is a Superior
Proposal, the Company Board may approve and recommend such Superior Proposal
and exempt the Person submitting such Superior Proposal from the restrictions
contained in any state takeover or similar laws concurrently with terminating
this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.01(h)_ ; _provided_ , _however_ , that
such actions may only be taken at a time that is after (I) the fifth (5th)
Business Day following Parents receipt of written notice from the Company
that the Company Board is prepared to take such action, (II) if at the end of
such period, the Company Board determines in good faith, after taking into
account all amendments or revisions proposed by Parent and after consultation
with its independent financial advisors of national reputation, that such
Acquisition Proposal remains a Superior Proposal (and the Company shall have
negotiated in good faith with Parent during such five (5) Business Day period
with respect to such amendments or revisions proposed by Parent), and (III)
in the case of clause (iii), unless this Agreement shall have been terminated
by the Company in accordance with _Section 9.01(h)_. Any such written
notice shall specify the material terms and conditions of such Acquisition
Proposal, include the most current version of any agreement relating to such
Acquisition Proposal (including any amendments, supplements or modifications
thereto), identify the person making such Acquisition Proposal and state that
the Company Board otherwise intends to make a Change in Recommendation
(subject to compliance with this subsection (c)).  During any such five (5)
Business Day period, Parent shall be entitled to deliver to the Company a
counterproposal to such Acquisition Proposal (a " _Counterproposal_ ") and
Parent and the Company shall and shall cause its financial and legal advisors
to, negotiate in good faith in respect of any such Counterproposal with the
objective of reaching an agreement such that the relevant
Acquisition Proposal is not a Superior Proposal. The parties hereto
acknowledge and agree that any amendment to the financial terms or any other
material amendment to any material term of an Acquisition Proposal which
amendment affects the determination of whether the Acquisition Proposal is a
Superior Proposal to any Counterproposal shall, upon the determination by the
Company Board in its sole discretion, be treated as a new Acquisition
Proposal for the purposes of this _Section 7.04(c)_ (requiring a new written
notice by the Company and a new three (3) Business Day period).

  

### (d) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Company or the
Company Board from taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position
contemplated by Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange
Act or from making any other disclosure to the Companys stockholders
required under applicable Law; _provided that_  neither the Company nor the
Company Board shall be permitted to recommend that the Companys stockholders
tender any securities in connection with any tender or exchange offer (or
otherwise approve, endorse or recommend any related Acquisition Proposal) or
withdraw or modify the Company Board Recommendation unless, in each case,
such tender or exchange offer constitutes a Superior Proposal and, in
connection therewith, effects a change in all or a portion of the Company
Board Recommendation.

  

### (e) Upon execution of this Agreement, the Company shall, and shall cause
its Subsidiaries and the Related Entities to, cease immediately and cause to
be terminated any and all existing activities, discussions or negotiations
with any Person conducted heretofore with respect to an Acquisition Proposal,
use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the return from

  



        
   

  



  

### all such Persons or cause the destruction of all copies of confidential
information provided to such Persons in connection therewith and shall inform
each of the Representatives of its obligations under this _Section 7.04_ and
instruct each of them to act in a manner consistent with such obligations.

so that the disposition by any officer or director of the Company who is a
covered person of the Company for purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange Act
and the rules and regulations thereunder (" _Section 16_ ") of Company Common
Shares pursuant to this Agreement and the Merger shall be an exempt
transaction for purposes of Section 16.

### (a) Without limiting any additional rights that any manager, director,
officer, trustee, employee, agent, or fiduciary may have under any employment

of the Purchaser Parties or the Surviving Entity shall be liable for any
amounts paid in settlement effected without Parents or the Surviving
Entitys prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed) and shall not be obligated to pay the fees and expenses
of more than one counsel (selected by a plurality of the applicable
Indemnified Parties and subject to the consent of Parent, which consent shall
not be unreasonably conditioned, delayed or withheld) for all Indemnified
Parties in any jurisdiction with respect to any single Claim. The
indemnification and advancement obligations of the Purchaser Parties pursuant
to this _Section 7.06(a)_ shall extend to acts or omissions occurring at or
before the Effective Time and

  



        
   

  



  



  

### any Claim relating thereto (including with respect to any acts or
omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement, the
Merger and the consummation of Contemplated Transactions, including the
consideration and approval thereof and the process undertaken in connection
therewith and any Claim relating thereto), and all rights to indemnification
and advancement conferred hereunder shall continue as to a person who has
ceased to be a director, officer, trustee, employee, agent, or fiduciary of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries after the date hereof and shall inure
to the benefit of such persons heirs, executors and personal and legal
representatives. As used in this _Section 7.06(a)_ : ( _x_ ) the term "
_Claim_ " means any threatened, asserted, pending or completed Action, suit
or proceeding or inquiry or investigation, whether instituted by any party
hereto, any Governmental Authority or any other Person, that any Indemnified
Party in good faith believes might lead to the institution of any Action,
suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative, investigative or
other, including any arbitration or other alternative dispute resolution
mechanism, arising out of or pertaining to matters that relate to such
Indemnified Partys duties or service as a manager, director, officer,
trustee, employee, agent or fiduciary of the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries, any of the Related Entities or, to the extent such person is or
was serving at the request or for the benefit of the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries, any of the Related Entities, any other entity or any employee

of the foregoing at or prior to the Effective Time; and ( _y_ ) the term "
_Expenses_ " means reasonable attorneys fees and all other reasonable costs,
expenses and obligations (including experts fees, travel expenses, court

as well as telecommunications, postage and courier charges) paid or incurred

participating in (including on appeal), or preparing to investigate, defend,
be a witness in or participate in, any Claim for which indemnification is
authorized pursuant to this _Section 7.06(a)_ , including any Action relating
to a claim for indemnification or advancement brought by an Indemnified
Party. No Purchaser Party shall settle, compromise or consent to the entry of
any judgment in any actual or threatened Claim in respect of which
indemnification has been sought by such Indemnified Party hereunder unless
such settlement, compromise or judgment includes an unconditional release of
such Indemnified Party from all liability arising out of such Claim, or such
Indemnified Party otherwise consents thereto.

  

### (b) Without limiting the foregoing, the Purchaser Parties agree that all
rights to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time now existing in favor
of the current or former directors, officers, employees, agents or
fiduciaries of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of the Related
Entities as provided in the Organizational Documents and indemnification
agreements of the Company or any of its shall be assumed by the Surviving
Entity in the Merger, without further action, at the Effective Time and shall
survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance
with their terms. For a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, the
Surviving Entity Charter and the Surviving Entity Operating Agreement and the
organizational documents of any applicable Subsidiary of the Company shall
contain provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification and
limitations on liability of directors and officers than are set forth in the
Organizational Documents, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or
otherwise modified for a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time in
any manner that would affect adversely the rights thereunder of individuals
who, at or prior to the Effective Time, were directors, officers, trustees,
employees, agents or fiduciaries of the Company, any of its

shall be required by applicable Law and then only to the minimum extent
required by applicable Law.

Merger), of at least the same coverage and amounts and containing terms and
conditions that are no less favorable to the directors, officers, employees,
agents or fiduciaries of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as the
Companys and its Subsidiaries existing policy or policies, for the benefit
of the current and former directors, officers, employees, agents or
fiduciaries of the Company and each Subsidiary of the Company with a claims
period of six (6) years from the Effective Time with respect to directors
and officers liability insurance for Claims arising from facts or events
that occurred on or prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,
that in no event shall the aggregate premium payable for such
"tail" insurance policy for its entire period exceed $410,000 (such amount

"tail" insurance described in the first sentence of this _Section 7.06(c)_
for an amount equal to or less than the Maximum Premium, the Company shall be
entitled to obtain as much comparable "tail" insurance as possible for an
amount equal to the Maximum Premium. If the Company is unable to purchase such
"tail" insurance contemplated in the two preceding sentences, the Purchaser
Parties shall, at the Companys request, purchase a "tail" insurance of at
least the same coverage and amounts and containing terms and conditions no
less favorable to directors, officers, employees, agents, or fiduciaries of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as the Companys and its Subsidiaries
existing policy or policies for the benefit of the current and former
directors, officers, employees, agents or fiduciaries of the Company or any
Subsidiary of the Company with a claims period of six (6) years from the
Effective Time; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that in no event shall the
Purchaser Parties be required to pay more than the Maximum Premium as the
aggregate premium for such "tail" insurance policies for its entire period,
in which case the Purchaser Parties will obtain as much comparable "tail"
insurance as possible for an amount equal to the Maximum Premium.

  

### (d) If any of the Purchaser Parties or the Surviving Entity or any of
their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges with
or into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving entity,
partnership or other entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii)
liquidates, dissolves or winds-up, or transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in
each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of the Purchaser Parties or Surviving Entity, as applicable, assumes
the obligations set forth in this _Section 7.06_.

  

### (e) Parent shall cause the Surviving Entity to perform all of the
obligations of the Surviving Entity under this _Section 7.06_ and the parties

the Surviving Entitys obligations pursuant to this _Section 7.06_.

  

### (f) The provisions of this _Section 7.06_ are intended to be for the
express benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Person (who
are intended to be third party beneficiaries of this _Section 7.06_ ), his or
her heirs and his or her personal representatives, shall be binding on all
successors and assigns of Parent, the Company and the Surviving Entity and
shall not be amended in a manner that is adverse to the Indemnified Persons
(including their

  



        
   

  



  

### successors, assigns and heirs) without the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Person (including the successors, assigns and heirs) affected
thereby. The exculpation and indemnification provided for by this Section
shall not be deemed to be exclusive of any other rights to which an
Indemnified Person is entitled, whether pursuant to applicable Law, contract
or otherwise.

### (a) The Company shall take or cause to be taken, all appropriate action,
and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary to (i) consummate the

the Closing Date, on terms and conditions described in the Minority Interests
Acquisition Agreements attached to _Item 4.02(c)_ of the Disclosure Letter,
(ii) terminate the BCRA Advisory Agreement, effective as of the Closing Date,
on the terms and conditions described in the BCRA Advisory Agreement, (iii)

the acquisition or restructuring of BCMR Seattle, a Limited Partnership, a
Massachusetts limited partnership or otherwise redeem the interests of BCMR
Inc. in BCMR Seattle, a Limited Partnership, for no consideration and (v)

alter, or agree to amend or alter, any of the Minority Interests Acquisition
Agreements, the BCRA Advisory Agreement or the Management Agreement Documents
without the prior written consent of the Parent.

  

### (b) On the Closing Date, to the extent that the Company provides the
Parent with written notice that ( _x_ ) all of the conditions to closing set
forth in _Section 8.02(d)_ , other than clauses (i) and (ii) of _Section
8.02(d)_ , have been satisfied or irrevocably waived, and that ( _y_ ) the
Company can not satisfy the conditions set forth in clauses (i) and (ii) of 
_Section 8.02(d)_ solely because it has insufficient funds to pay the amounts
required in order for such conditions to be satisfied, then the Merger Sub
shall loan the Company such additional funds as may be required in order for
the conditions set forth in clauses (i) and (ii) of _Section 8.02(d)_  to be
satisfied on the Closing Date. Such loans shall be extinguished as a result
of the Merger and the amount of any extinguished loans shall be deemed to be
additional consideration in connection with the deemed asset sale (but shall
not be treated as additional Merger Consideration to the holders of Company
Common Shares).

  

Section 7.08 _Further Action; Reasonable Efforts._

  



  

### (a) Except as otherwise provided in _Section 7.01_ , upon the terms and
subject to the conditions of this Agreement, each of the parties hereto shall
(i) make promptly its respective filings, and thereafter make any other
required submissions with respect to this Agreement and the Merger, if
required, and (ii) use its commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause
to be taken, all appropriate action, and to do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary,

  



        
   

  



  

### proper or advisable under applicable Laws to consummate and make
effective the Merger and the Contemplated Transactions as soon as
practicable, including using its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
all Permits, consents, approvals, authorizations, qualifications and orders
of Governmental Authorities and parties to contracts with the Company and its
Subsidiaries as are necessary, proper or advisable for the consummation of
the Merger and the Contemplated Transactions and to fulfill the conditions to
the Merger or (ii) required to prevent a Company Material Adverse Effect;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that this _Section 7.08(a)_ shall not require any
party hereto to waive any condition for its benefit or any performance
hereunder by another party.

  

### (b) The parties hereto agree to cooperate and assist one another in
connection with all actions to be taken pursuant to _Section 7.08(a)_ ,
including the preparation and making of the filings referred to therein and,
if requested, amending or furnishing additional information thereunder,
including, subject to applicable Law and the Confidentiality Agreement,
providing copies of all related documents to the non filing party and their
advisors prior to filing, and, to the extent practicable, neither of the
parties will file any such document or have any communication with
any Governmental Authority without prior consultation with the other party.
Each party shall keep the other apprised of the content and status of any
communications with, and communications from, any Governmental Authority with
respect to the Merger and the Contemplated Transactions. To the extent
practicable and permitted by a Governmental Authority, each party hereto
shall permit representatives of the other party to participate in meetings
and calls with such Governmental Authority. None of the parties shall
consent to any voluntary extension of any statutory deadline or waiting
period or to any voluntary delay of the consummation of the Merger
or Contemplated Transactions at the behest of any Governmental Authority
without the consent of the other party, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed.

  

### (c) Each of the parties hereto agrees to cooperate and use its
commercially reasonable efforts to defend through litigation on the merits
any Action, including administrative or judicial Action, asserted by any
party in order to avoid the entry of, or to have vacated, lifted, reversed,

Contemplated Transactions, including, without limitation, by
vigorously pursuing all available avenues of administrative and judicial
appeal.

  

### (d) The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
any third party consents (i) necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the
Merger and the Contemplated Transactions or (ii) required to prevent a
Company Material Adverse Effect from occurring prior to the Effective Time.
In the event that the Company shall fail to obtain any third party consent
described above, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts
and shall take such actions as are reasonably requested by Parent, to
minimize any adverse effect upon the Purchaser Parties and the Company and
their respective businesses resulting, or which would reasonably be expected
to result, after the Effective Time from the failure to obtain such consent.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in connection
with obtaining any approval or consent from any Person (other than a
Governmental Authority) in connection with this Agreement, the Merger or the
Contemplated Transactions (i) unless required by the applicable agreement,
without the prior written consent of Parent which shall not

Person and (ii) none of the Purchaser Parties or their respective Affiliates
shall be required to pay or commit to pay to such Person whose approval or
consent is being solicited any cash or other consideration make

Effective Time, the Surviving Entity shall pay or cause to be paid, without
deduction or withholding from any consideration or amounts payable to holders
of the Company Common Shares and the Options, all Transfer Taxes.

  

Section 7.10 _Public Announcements_. The parties hereto agree that no
public release or announcement concerning the Merger or the Contemplated
Transactions shall be issued by a party without the prior consent of the
other parties (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed), except as such release or announcement may be required by Law or
the rules or regulations of any securities exchange, in which case the party
required to make the release or announcement shall use its reasonable best
efforts to allow the other parties reasonable time to comment on such release
or announcement in advance of such issuance. The parties have agreed upon
the form of a joint press release announcing the Merger and the execution of
this Agreement.

  

Section 7.11 _Refinancing of Existing Mortgages_. The Company acknowledges
that Parent may seek to assume or refinance mortgage indebtedness secured by
one or more Company Properties (collectively, the " _Refinancing_ ").  The

Entities to provide, all commercially reasonable cooperation in connection
with the arrangement of the Refinancing as may be reasonably requested by
Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that none of the Company, its Subsidiaries
or Related Entities shall be required to pay any fees (including commitment
or other similar fees) or incur any other liability in connection with the
Refinancing prior to the Effective Time and none of the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or any of the Related Entities shall be required to take any
such actions prior to thirty (30) days prior to the Closing Date. Parent
shall, promptly upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company for all
reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred by the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or any of the Related Entities in connection with such
cooperation. Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its
Subsidiaries, the Related Entities and their respective Representatives for
and against any and all liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs,
expenses, interest, awards, judgments and penalties suffered or incurred by
them in connection with the arrangement of the Refinancing and
any information utilized in

  



        
   

  



  

connection therewith. All non-public or otherwise confidential information
regarding the Company, its Subsidiaries and the Related Entities obtained by
the Purchaser Parties and their representatives pursuant to this _Section
7.11_ shall be kept confidential in accordance with the Confidentiality
Agreement, except for such information contained in any offering memorandum
consented to by the Company (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed).  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent acknowledges
and agrees that the consummation of the Merger and the Contemplated
Transactions is not conditioned upon the Refinancing.

  

Section 7.12 _Tax Matters_. During the period from the date of this Agreement
to the Effective Time, the Company shall, and shall cause each Subsidiary to,

by the Company or any Subsidiary after the date hereof (" _Post-Signing
Returns_ ") in a manner consistent with past practice, except as otherwise
required by applicable Laws;

  

### (b) timely pay all Taxes due and payable by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries in respect of such Post-Signing Returns that are so filed, other

the Company in accordance with past practice for all projected Taxes payable
by the Company for which no Post-Signing Return is due prior to the Effective
Time; and

  

### (d) promptly notify Parent of any Actions pending against or with respect
to the Company in respect of any Tax and not settle or compromise any such
Action without Parents prior written consent.

  

Section 7.13 _Resignations_. The Company shall use its reasonable
best efforts to obtain and deliver to Parent at the Closing evidence
reasonably satisfactory to Parent of the resignation, effective as of the
Effective Time, of those directors of the Company or any of Subsidiary of the
Company designated by Parent in writing at least five (5) Business Days prior
to the Closing.

  

Section 7.14 _Takeover Statutes_. If any takeover statute is or
becomes applicable to this Agreement, the Merger or the Contemplated
Transactions, each of the parties and their respective boards of directors

necessary action to ensure that the Merger and the Contemplated Transactions
may be consummated as promptly as practicable upon the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in this Agreement and (b) otherwise act to eliminate
or minimize the effects of such takeover statute.

or other communications received by the Purchaser Parties or the Company, as
the case may be, or any of its Subsidiaries, from any third Person and/or
any Governmental Authority with respect to the Merger and the
Contemplated Transactions.

_Article X_ shall survive any such termination and (b) the Guarantee referred

set forth therein; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing herein shall relieve
any party hereto from liability for any fraud or willful breach of any of its

Agreement prior to such termination.

  

Section 9.03 _Fees and Expenses_.

  



  

### (a) Except as otherwise set forth in this  _Section 9.03_ , all expenses
incurred in connection with this Agreement shall be paid by the party

#### (ii) by Parent pursuant to _Section 9.01(g)_ or the Company pursuant to
_Section 9.01(h)_ , then the Company shall pay to Parent the Company

9.01(h)_ , such payment shall be made before or currently with such
termination and shall be a condition to the effectiveness of such
termination).

  

### (c) Except as otherwise specified in _Section 9.03(b)_ , the Company
Termination Fee shall be paid by the Company as directed by Parent in writing
in immediately available funds within four (4) Business Days after the date
of the event giving rise to the obligation to make such payment.

  

### (d) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Company Termination Fee_ " means
an amount equal to $4,000,000.

  

### (e) If this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to _Section
9.01(e)_, Parent shall pay to the Company within four (4) Business Days after
the date of termination all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses,
including the reasonable fees and expenses of lawyers, accountants,

reasonable fees and expenses of lawyers, accountants, consultants, financial
advisors, lenders and investment bankers, incurred by Parent from July 2,
2007 to the date of termination in connection with the entering into this
Agreement and the carrying out of any and all acts contemplated hereunder up
to an aggregate maximum amount of $1,500,000 (the " _Parent Expenses_ ").
 The payment of expenses set forth in this _Section 9.03(e)_ is not an
exclusive remedy, but is in addition to any other rights or
remedies available to the parties hereto (whether at law or in equity), and
in no respect is intended by the parties hereto to constitute liquidated
damages, or be viewed as an indicator of the damages

  



        
   

  



  

### payable, or in any other respect limit or restrict damages available in
case of any breach of this Agreement

contained in this _Section 9.03_ are an integral part of the Merger and the
Contemplated Transactions. In the event that the Company shall fail to pay
the Company Termination Fee or Parent Expenses when due or Parent shall fail
to pay the Company Expenses when due, the Company or Parent, as the case may
be, shall reimburse the other party for all reasonable costs and
expenses actually incurred or accrued by such other party (including
reasonable fees and expenses of counsel) in connection with the collection
under and enforcement of this _Section 9.03_.

  

Section 9.04 _Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the Company,
on the one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, may (a) extend
the time for the performance of any obligation or other act of the other
party, (b) waive any inaccuracy in the representations and warranties of the
other party contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and
(c) waive compliance with any agreement of the other party or any condition
to its own obligations contained herein. Any such extension or waiver shall be
valid if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by the Company or
Parent (on behalf of Parent and Merger Sub). The failure of any party to
assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not
constitute a waiver of those rights.

Section 10.03 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of
this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any
rule of law, or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this
Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the
economic or legal substance of the Merger or the Contemplated Transactions is
not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such
determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith
to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties
as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the
Merger or the Contemplated Transactions be consummated as originally
contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

  



        
   

  



  

Section 10.04 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the
parties hereto at any time prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, after the Company Stockholder Approval, no amendment may be
made without further stockholder approval which, by Law, requires further
approval by such stockholders. This Agreement may not be amended except by
an instrument in writing signed by the parties hereto.

  

Section 10.05 _Entire Agreement; Assignment_. This Agreement, the Disclosure
Letter, the Guarantee and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire
agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and
supersede all prior agreements and undertakings, both written and oral, among
the parties, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof. This
Agreement shall not be assigned (whether pursuant to a merger, by operation
of law or otherwise), except that Parent and Merger Sub may assign this
Agreement to any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent but no
such assignment shall relieve the assigning party of its obligations
hereunder if the assignee does not perform its obligations.

  

Section 10.06 _Remedies; Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree
that irreparable damage would occur in the event any provision of this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with the terms hereof and that the
parties shall be entitled to specific performance of the terms hereof, in
addition to any other remedy at law or equity.

  

Section 10.07 _Parties in Interest_. This Agreement shall be binding upon
and inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto, and nothing in this
Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other
person any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by
reason of this Agreement, other than the right of the holders of Company
Common Shares and Options to receive the consideration described in _Article
III_.

  

Section 10.08 _Governing Law; Forum_. This Agreement shall be governed by,
and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Maryland
applicable to contracts executed in and to be performed in that State. All
actions and proceedings arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be
heard and determined exclusively in any Maryland state or federal court. The
parties hereto hereby (a) submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of any
Maryland state or federal court for the purpose of any Action arising out of
or relating to this Agreement brought by any party hereto, and (b)
irrevocably waive, and agree not to assert by way of motion, defense, or
otherwise, in any such Action, any claim that it is not subject personally to
the jurisdiction of the above-named courts, that its property is exempt or
immune from attachment or execution, that the Action is brought in
an inconvenient forum, that the venue of the Action is improper, or that
this Agreement, the Merger and the Contemplated Transactions may not be
enforced in or by any of the above named courts.

  

Section 10.09 _Headings_. The descriptive headings contained in
this Agreement are included for convenience of reference only and shall
not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

  

Section 10.10 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed and
delivered (including by facsimile transmission) in two or more counterparts,
and by the different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which
when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken
together shall constitute one and the same agreement.

  



        
   

  



  

Section 10.11 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. Each of the parties hereto hereby
waives to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law any right it may
have to a trial by jury with respect to any litigation directly or indirectly
arising out of, under or in connection with this Agreement, the Merger or the
Contemplated Transactions. Each of the parties hereto (a) certifies that no
representative, agent or attorney of any other party has
represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other party would not, in the
event of litigation, seek to enforce that foregoing waiver and (b)
acknowledges that it and the other hereto have been induced to enter into
this Agreement, the Merger and the Contemplated Transactions, as applicable,
by, among other things, the mutual waivers and certifications in this
_Section 10.11_.
