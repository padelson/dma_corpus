2 ARTICLE II

 

EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK OF THE CONSTITUENT CORPORATIONS

 

Section 2.01 CONVERSION AND EXCHANGE OF SHARES OF COMPANY COMMON STOCK. At
the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part
of the Company, Parent, Silk USA, Merger Sub or any holder of any shares
of Company Common Stock or any shares of capital stock of Parent, Silk USA or
Merger Sub:

(a) Conversion of Merger Sub Stock. Each share of capital stock of Merger Sub
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into and become one (1) validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable
share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation, which shares at such time
shall comprise the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving
Corporation.

(b) Cancellation of Company-Owned Stock and Parent-Owned Stock. Each share of
Company Common Stock held by the Company or any wholly owned Subsidiary of the
Company (or held in the Companys treasury) or held by Parent, Silk USA or
Merger Sub, in each case, immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, without payment of any
consideration therefor.

 

(c) Conversion of Company Common Stock. Except as provided in _Section
2.01(b)_ and subject to _Section 2.02_, each share of Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any
Dissenting Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive $112.00 in
cash, without interest (the " _Per Share Merger Price_ "), payable to the
holder thereof upon surrender of such shares of Company Common Stock in the
manner provided in _Section 2.03_.

 

Section 2.02 ADJUSTMENT TO PER SHARE MERGER PRICE. If at any time during the
period between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time there shall
be any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any
dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Company Common
Stock), cash dividend (other than any regular quarterly cash dividends with
respect to the Company Common Stock in an amount not to exceed $0.35 per share
per quarter (collectively, " _Regular Cash Dividends_ ")), reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other
like change with respect to Company Common Stock, the Per Share Merger Price
shall be appropriately adjusted by the Parties to reflect the effect thereof.

Section 2.03 SURRENDER OF COMPANY STOCK CERTIFICATES.

(a) Paying Agent _._ Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall enter into, or
cause Silk USA to enter into, an agreement in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to the Company with the Companys transfer agent or a bank or trust
company that is reasonably satisfactory to the Company to act as paying agent
(the " _Paying Agent_ ") for the payment of the Merger

 



3  Consideration in accordance with this _Article II_. At or prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause Silk USA as sole stockholder of
Merger Sub to deposit, with the Paying Agent in trust, for the benefit of the
holders of shares of Company Common Stock, cash in an amount sufficient to pay
the aggregate Merger Consideration. Any funds deposited with the Paying Agent
pursuant to this  _Section 2.03(a)_ shall be referred to in this Agreement
as the " _Exchange Fund_."

(b) Company Stock Certificate Exchange Procedures. As soon as reasonably
practicable after the Effective Time (and in any case within three (3)
Business Days), Parent (or Silk USA) shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to
each holder of record of a valid certificate previously representing any
shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time (a " _Company Stock Certificate_ ") or shares of Company Common Stock
represented by book entry (" _Book Entry Shares_ ") whose shares of Company
Common Stock were converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration: (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Company Stock
Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Company Stock
Certificates to the Paying Agent and which shall otherwise be in customary
form (including customary provisions with respect to delivery of an
"agents message" with respect to Book Entry Shares)); and (ii) customary
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Company Stock
Certificates, or in the case of Book Entry Shares, the surrender of such
shares, in exchange for payment of the applicable Merger Consideration. Each
holder of record of a Company Stock Certificate or Book Entry Share shall,
upon surrender to the Paying Agent of such Company Stock Certificate or Book
Entry Share, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and
such other customary documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying
Agent pursuant to such instructions, be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor the amount of cash which the number of shares of Company Common
Stock previously represented by such Company Stock Certificate or Book Entry
Share shall have been converted into the right to receive pursuant to _Section
2.01(c)_, and the Company Stock Certificate or Book Entry Share
so surrendered shall be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of
Company Common Stock which is not registered in the transfer records of the
Company, payment of the Merger Consideration may be made to a person other
than the person in whose name the Company Stock Certificate so surrendered is
registered if such Company Stock Certificate shall be properly endorsed or
otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the person requesting such
payment shall pay any transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason of
the payment of the Merger Consideration to a person other than the registered
holder of such Company Stock Certificate or establish to the reasonable
satisfaction of Parent that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable.
Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 2.03(b)_, each Company
Stock Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the
Merger Consideration. No interest shall be paid or will accrue on any cash
payable to holders of Company Stock Certificates or Book Entry Shares pursuant
to the provisions of this _Article II_.

 

(c) No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock; Transfer Books. At
and after the Effective Time, holders of Company Stock Certificates (or, in
the case of uncertificated shares, Book Entry Shares) shall cease to have any
rights as stockholders of the Company, except for the right to receive the
Merger Consideration or as otherwise provided in this Agreement or
by applicable Law. Any cash paid upon the surrender of Company Stock

 



4  Certificates or Book Entry Shares in accordance with this _Article II_
shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly evidenced by such
Company Stock Certificates or Book Entry Shares. At the Effective Time, the
stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and no transfer of shares
of Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall thereafter be made. If, after the Effective Time, subject
to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Company Stock Certificates or
Book Entry Shares formerly evidencing shares of Company Common Stock
are presented to the Paying Agent or the Surviving Corporation, they shall be
canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration in accordance with this
_Article II_.

 

(d) Termination of the Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of Company Stock Certificates or Book
Entry Shares on the date that is one (1) year after the Effective Time shall
be delivered to Parent or Silk USA, upon demand by Parent, and any holders of
Company Stock Certificates or Book Entry Shares who have not theretofore
complied with this _Article II_ shall thereafter look only to Parent, Silk
USA and/or the Surviving Corporation for, and Parent, Silk USA and the
Surviving Corporation shall remain liable for, payment of such
holders claims for the Merger Consideration pursuant to the provisions of
this _Article II_.

(e) No Liability. Neither Parent, Silk USA, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation nor the Paying Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of
any cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official in compliance
with any applicable state, federal or other abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law. If any Company Stock Certificate or Book Entry Shares shall not
have been surrendered prior to the date on which the related Merger
Consideration would escheat to or become the property of any
Governmental Authority, any such Merger Consideration shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, immediately prior to such time become the
property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of any person
previously entitled thereto.

 

(f) Investment of Exchange Fund. The Paying Agent shall invest the cash in the
Exchange Fund as directed by Parent (or Silk USA);  _provided_ , _however_ ,
that (i) no such investment or losses thereon shall affect the Merger
Consideration payable to the holders of shares of Company Common Stock and
following any losses Parent shall (or shall cause Silk USA to) promptly
provide additional funds to the Paying Agent for the benefit of the
stockholders of the Company in the amount of any such losses and (ii) such
investments shall only be in short-term obligations of or guaranteed by the
United States of America with maturities of no more than thirty (30) days and
backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of America. Any
interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid solely
to Parent (or Silk USA).

 

(g) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. If any Company Stock Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the person claiming such Company Stock Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent or the Paying Agent, the
posting by such person of a bond in such reasonable and customary amount as
Parent or the Paying Agent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may
be made against it with respect to such Company Stock Certificate, the Paying
Agent shall deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Company
Stock Certificate the applicable Merger Consideration.

 



5 (h) Withholding Rights. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the amount otherwise payable to
any person pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as Parent, the Company, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as applicable, is required to
deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code
or any provision of federal, state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent
such amounts are so deducted or withheld and timely paid over to the
appropriate Governmental Authority by Parent, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the person in
respect of whom such deduction or withholding was made.

Section 2.04 COMPANY EQUITY AWARDS.

(a) At the Effective Time, each option to purchase shares of Company Common
Stock (each, a " _Company Stock Option_ ") and each stock appreciation right
in respect of Company Common Stock (each, a " _Company SAR_ "), in each case,
granted under any Company Stock Plan that is outstanding and unexercised as of
the Effective Time (whether vested or unvested) shall become fully vested (to
the extent not vested) and be canceled, and the holder thereof shall be
entitled to receive a payment in cash, without interest, equal to the product
of (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company
Stock Option or Company SAR and (ii) the excess, if any, of the Per Share
Merger Price over the exercise price per share of such Company Stock Option or
Company SAR; _provided_ , _however_ , that to the extent the exercise price
of any Company Stock Option or Company SAR is equal to or greater than the Per
Share Merger Price at the Effective Time, such Company Stock Option or Company
SAR shall be automatically canceled and no consideration will be paid or
delivered in exchange therefor. Parent shall (or shall cause either Silk USA
or the Surviving Corporation to) pay the holders of Company Stock Options and
Company SARs the cash payments described in this  _Section 2.04(a)_ as soon
as reasonably practicable following the Effective Time (and in any case within
three (3) Business Days following the Closing).

 

(b) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, (i) each then-outstanding
restricted stock unit award in respect of shares of Company Common Stock
(each, a " _Company RSU_ ") that vests solely based on the passage of time
granted under any Company Stock Plan shall become fully earned and vested with
respect to the maximum number of shares of Company Common Stock
underlying each such Company RSU as set forth in the terms of the award
agreement applicable to such Company RSU; and (ii) each then-outstanding
Company RSU granted under any Company Stock Plan that vests in whole or in
part based on performance conditions and for which the applicable performance
period is not complete as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
vest to the extent provided for in the award agreement applicable to such
Company RSU, with any portion of such performance-based Company RSUs that
remains unvested at the Effective Time following the acceleration of vesting
provided for in this sentence being automatically canceled for no
consideration as of the Effective Time. Parent shall (or shall cause either
Silk USA or the Surviving Corporation to) pay to each holder of each Company
RSU that vests in accordance with this _Section 2.04(b)_, as soon as
reasonably practicable following the 

 



6  Effective Time (and in any case within three (3) Business Days following the
Closing), an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the Per Share Merger
Price for each such fully vested share of Company Common Stock underlying
such Company RSU (together with any accrued but unpaid dividend equivalents
related to such Company RSU).

 

(c) For the avoidance of doubt, the payment of all Equity Award Amounts
hereunder shall be subject to appropriate withholding for Taxes in accordance
with _Section 2.03(h)_.

Section 2.05 DISSENTING SHARES.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
shares of Company Common Stock that are outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and held by a holder who is entitled to demand and properly
demands an appraisal of such shares in accordance with, and who complies in
all respects with, Section 262 of the DGCL (any such shares being referred to
as " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into or represent the
right to receive Merger Consideration in accordance with _Section 2.01(c)_
and the holders thereof shall be entitled only to such rights as are granted
by Section 262 of the DGCL to a holder of Dissenting Shares. At the Effective
Time, the Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist.

 

(b) If any Dissenting Shares shall lose their status as such (through failure
to perfect, waiver by the holder or otherwise), then, as of the later of the
Effective Time or the date of loss of such status, such shares shall
automatically be converted into and shall represent only the right to receive
the Merger Consideration in accordance with _Section 2.01(c)_, without
interest thereon, upon surrender of each Company Stock Certificate
representing such shares.

(c) The Company shall give Parent prompt written notice of (i) any demand for

Section 5.02 SOLICITATION; TAKEOVER PROPOSALS; CHANGE OF COMPANY BOARD
RECOMMENDATION.

(a) No Solicitation. From the date of this Agreement until the Effective
Time, or, if earlier, the termination of this Agreement in accordance with
_Section 8.01_: (i) the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries, and
shall direct its or their respective Representatives to, (A) immediately

Company, its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives

endorse or 

 



37  recommend any Acquisition Proposal or any Acquisition Agreement or other
agreement requiring the Company to abandon or terminate its obligations under
this Agreement, or (E) resolve, propose or agree to do any of the foregoing.
Without limiting the foregoing, the Company agrees that any material breach of
the restrictions on the Company set forth in this _Section 5.02_ by any
Subsidiary or any Representative of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
shall be deemed a material breach of this _Section 5.02_ by the Company. So
long as the Company is not in material breach of this _Section 5.02_,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein pertaining to the
Companys ability to enter into, continue or participate in any discussions
with any person regarding any Acquisition Proposal, the Company may in good
faith seek _bona fide_ clarifications of the terms and conditions of a _bona
fide_ unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal to determine whether such
Acquisition Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a
Superior Proposal, such request to be made to the person (or its or
their Representatives) making such Acquisition Proposal.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if
at any time following the date of this Agreement and prior to the receipt of
the Company Stockholder Approval, but not after: (i) the Company receives a
_bona fide_ unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal that has not resulted
from a material breach of _Section 5.02(a)_; and (ii) the Company Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal advisor
and its financial advisors, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes, or
would reasonably be expected to constitute, result in, or lead to, a Superior
Proposal, then the Company may, upon a good faith determination by the Company
Board (after consultation with its outside legal advisor) that failure to do
so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, and
subject to compliance with _Section 5.02(c)_: (A) furnish non-public
information with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the person
making such Acquisition Proposal pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement and in accordance with the following restrictions related to the
provision of information; (1) the Company shall, substantially concurrently
with providing any non-public information to any person making such
Acquisition Proposal, provide to Parent copies of all non-public information
concerning the Company or its Subsidiaries that is provided to any such person
to the extent that such information was not previously provided to Parent,
and (2) to the extent the Company reasonably believes it is appropriate to do
so based on the identity of such person, the Company shall provide, pursuant
to customary "clean-room" or other appropriate procedures, such portions
of documents or information to the extent so provided to Parent; and (B)
contact and engage in discussions or negotiations with the person making such
Acquisition Proposal or such persons Representatives.

 

(c) In addition to the obligations set forth in _Section 5.02(b)_, the
Company shall promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours (or,
if later, one (1) Business Day) (unless the Company seeks any clarifications
of the terms and conditions of any Acquisition Proposal as permitted by the
last sentence of _Section 5.02(a)_, in which case, within twenty-four (24)
hours)) notify Parent of the receipt of any Acquisition Proposal. Such notice
to Parent shall indicate the identity of the person making the Acquisition
Proposal and the material terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal,
including unredacted copies of any written Acquisition Proposal (including
copies of any material amendments thereto). The Company shall thereafter keep
Parent reasonably informed as promptly as practicable of any material
developments affecting the terms and conditions of any such Acquisition
Proposal. Without limiting the foregoing, the Company shall promptly (and in
any event within twenty-four (24) hours after any

 



38  determination) advise Parent in writing if the Company Board determines to
begin providing information or engaging in discussions or negotiations
concerning an Acquisition Proposal pursuant to  _Section 5.02(b)_.

(d) Except as set forth in _Section 5.02(e)_, neither the Company Board nor
any committee thereof shall: (i) fail to include the Company Board
Recommendation in the Proxy Statement when disseminated to the Companys
stockholders (and at all times thereafter prior to receipt of the Company
Stockholder Approval); (ii) withhold, withdraw, amend, qualify or modify or
publicly propose to withhold, withdraw, amend, qualify or modify, in each
case, in a manner adverse to Parent, Silk USA or Merger Sub the Company Board
Recommendation; (iii) adopt, authorize, approve or recommend the adoption or
approval of any Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Agreement (other than
those relating to the Merger); (iv) if a tender offer or exchange offer for
the Company Common Stock that constitutes an Acquisition Proposal
is commenced, fail to recommend against acceptance of such tender offer or
exchange offer by the Companys stockholders within ten (10) Business Days
after commencement; (v) resolve, agree or publicly propose to take any such
actions (each such foregoing action or failure to act in clauses _(i)_
through _(v)_ being referred to herein as a " _Change in Company Board
Recommendation_ ").

 

(e) Notwithstanding any provision of _Section 5.02(d)_, at any time prior to
the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, but not after, the Company
Board may, subject to compliance with the other provisions of this _Section
5.02_: (i) make a Change in Company Board Recommendation under clauses _(i)_
, _(ii)_ or (to the extent related to clauses _(i)_ or _(ii)_ ) _(v)_ of
the definition thereof in connection with an Intervening Event (but not in
connection with a Superior Proposal), if the Company Board determines in good
faith, after consultation with its outside legal advisor, that failure to do
so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations under applicable Law;
_provided_ , _however_ , that prior to making such Change in Company Board
Recommendation, (A) the Company provides Parent with written notice of its
intention to take such action at least four (4) Business Days in advance of
taking such action, specifying the reasons for the Company Boards intention,
(B) the Company shall and shall direct its Representatives to negotiate in
good faith with Parent during such four (4) Business Day period, to the extent
Parent wishes to negotiate, to enable Parent to propose revisions or
modifications to the terms of this Agreement such that it would permit the
Company Board not to make a Change in Company Board Recommendation pursuant to
_Section 5.02(e)(i)_ and (C) at the end of such four (4) Business Day period,
the Company Board considers in good faith any revisions or modifications to
the terms of this Agreement proposed in writing by Parent, and determines in
good faith, after consultation with its outside legal advisor, that the
Company Boards failure to make a Change in Company Board Recommendation
under clauses _(i)_ , _(ii)_ , or (to the extent related to clauses _(i)_
or _(ii)_ ) _(v)_ of the definition thereof would continue to be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; or (ii) if the Company
receives an Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a material breach of
_Section 5.02(a)_ and that the Company Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with its outside legal advisor and its financial advisors)
constitutes a Superior Proposal, either (A) terminate this Agreement pursuant
to _Section 8.01(f)_, _provided_ that prior to or concurrently with such
termination, the Company shall pay or cause to be paid to Parent the Company
Termination Fee required to be paid pursuant to _Section 8.03(b)_ in
connection with such termination, or (B) make a Change in Company Board
Recommendation, _provided_ , _however_ , that prior to making a Change
in Company Board

 



39  Recommendation or prior to terminating this Agreement, in each case,
pursuant to this clause _(ii)_ , (1) the Company provides Parent with written
notice of its intention to take such action at least four (4) Business Days
in advance of taking such action, and provides to Parent a summary of the
material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal and an unredacted copy
of any and all Acquisition Agreements related to such Superior Proposal (and
any financing commitments related thereto), (2) the Company shall and shall
direct its Representatives to negotiate in good faith with Parent during such
four (4) Business Day period, to the extent Parent wishes to negotiate, to
enable Parent to propose revisions or modifications to the terms of this
Agreement such that it would cause such Superior Proposal to no longer
constitute a Superior Proposal, (3) at the end of such four (4) Business Day
period, the Company Board considers in good faith any revisions or
modifications to the terms of this Agreement proposed in writing by Parent,
and determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal
advisor and its financial advisors, that the Superior Proposal would continue
to constitute a Superior Proposal, even if the revisions agreed to in writing
by Parent were to be given effect, and (4) in the event of any material change
in any of the financial terms (including the amount and form of payment of
any consideration) or any other material terms of such Superior Proposal, the
Company shall, in each case, deliver to Parent an additional notice consistent
with that described in clause _(1)_ of this proviso and a new notice period
under clause _(1)_ of this proviso shall commence (except that the four (4)
Business Day notice period referred to in clause _(1)_ of this proviso shall
instead be equal to the longer of (x) two (2) Business Days, and (y) the
period remaining under the notice period under clause _(1)_ of this proviso
immediately prior to the delivery of such additional notice under this clause
_(4)_ ) during which time the Company shall be required to comply with the
requirements of this _Section 5.02(e)(ii)_ anew with respect to such
additional notice (including clauses _(2)_ through _(4)_ of this proviso).
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, neither the Company nor any
Subsidiary of the Company shall enter into any Acquisition Agreement unless
this Agreement has been or is prior to or concurrently terminated in
accordance with its terms.

(f) The Company shall enforce, and shall not release or permit the release by
its Subsidiaries of any person from, or amend, waive, terminate or modify,
and shall not permit the amendment, waiver, termination (other than any
expiration based on the passage of time or otherwise in accordance with its
terms) or modification by its Subsidiaries of, any provision of, any
confidentiality, "standstill" or similar agreement or provision, in each case
relating to an Acquisition Proposal, to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party or under which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
has any rights, unless the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel, that taking or failing to take
such action, as the case may be, would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
obligations under applicable Law. The Company shall not, and shall not permit
any of its Subsidiaries or direct or any of its or their Representatives on
the Companys or its Subsidiaries behalf to, enter into any confidentiality
agreement subsequent to the date of this Agreement that prohibits the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries from providing to Parent the information
specifically required to be provided to Parent pursuant to this _Section
5.02_.

 

(g) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.02_ shall prohibit the Company or
the Company Board or any committee thereof from: (i) taking and disclosing to
the stockholders of the Company a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a)
promulgated under the Exchange Act or making a statement contemplated by Item
1012(a) of Regulation M-A or Rule 14d-9 

 



40  promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar communication to
stockholders in connection with the making or amendment of a tender offer or
exchange offer); (ii) making any disclosure to the stockholders of the
Company if the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with
its outside legal advisor, that failure to do so would be inconsistent with
its fiduciary obligations under applicable Law; or (iii) making any "stop-
look-and-listen" communication to its stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f)
promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar communications to its
stockholders); _provided_ , _however_ , that any public disclosure (other
than any "stop, look and listen" statement made under Rule 14d-9(f) under the
Exchange Act) by the Company or the Company Board (or any committee thereof)
pursuant to clause _(i)_ of this  _Section 5.02(g)_ shall be deemed to be a
Change in Company Board Recommendation unless the Company Board expressly and
publicly reaffirms the Company Board Recommendation in such disclosure.

 

Section 5.03 NO CONTROL OF OTHER PARTYS BUSINESS. Nothing contained in this
Agreement shall give Parent, directly or indirectly, the right to control or
direct the Companys or its Subsidiaries operations prior to the Effective
Time, and nothing contained in this Agreement shall give the Company, directly
or indirectly, the right to control or direct Parents or its Subsidiaries
operations prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, each of
Parent and the Company shall exercise, consistent with the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over its and

(a) Preparation of Proxy Statement. As soon as practicable after the date of
this Agreement (and in any event, within twenty (20) Business Days hereof,
assuming the Company has received all required information from Parent), the
Company shall prepare and shall cause to be filed with the SEC in preliminary
form a proxy statement relating to the Stockholders Meeting (together with
any amendments thereof or supplements thereto, the " _Proxy Statement_ ").
Except as expressly contemplated by _Section 5.02(e)_, the Proxy Statement

Companys stockholders, to comply as to form in all material respects with the
provisions of the Exchange Act. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company
shall not file the Proxy Statement, or any amendment or supplement thereto,
without providing Parent, Silk USA, Merger Sub or their counsel a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment thereon (and such comments shall be
reasonably considered by the Company); _provided_ , that in connection with an
Acquisition Proposal, a Superior Proposal, a Change in Company Board
Recommendation, or an Intervening Event, so long as the only
information contained therein with respect to Parent, Silk USA or Merger Sub
relates to this Agreement or the transactions

 



41  contemplated hereby or any other Acquisition Proposal made by Parent, Silk
USA or Merger Sub, the Companys only obligation shall be to provide to Parent
a copy of such filing, or amendment or supplement thereto, in advance of
filing. The Company shall promptly notify Parent of the receipt of any written
or oral comments or substantive inquires received by the Company from the SEC
or the staff thereof related to the Proxy Statement or any request for
additional information. The Company shall promptly provide Parent with copies
of all written correspondence between the Company and its Representatives, on
the one hand, and the SEC or the staff thereof, on the other hand, with
respect to the Proxy Statement, shall provide Parent, Silk USA, Merger Sub and
their counsel with copies of any written responses to be submitted by the
Company in response to any comments or substantive inquiries from the SEC
or the staff thereof and shall provide Parent, Silk USA and Merger Sub and
their counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon (and such
comments shall be reasonably considered by the Company); _provided_ , that in
connection with an Acquisition Proposal, a Superior Proposal, a Change in
Company Board Recommendation, or an Intervening Event, so long as the only
information contained therein with respect to Parent, Silk USA or Merger Sub

other Acquisition Proposal made by Parent, Silk USA or Merger Sub, the
Companys only obligation shall be to provide to Parent a copy of such written
response in advance of submission to the SEC or the staff thereof. The

efforts in resolving, all SEC comments with respect to the Proxy Statement
as promptly as practicable after receipt thereof and to cause the Proxy
Statement in definitive form to be cleared by the SEC as promptly as
reasonably practicable following the filing thereof.

 

(b) Covenants of the Parties with Respect to the Proxy Statement. Each Party
will cause the information relating to such Party supplied by it for
inclusion in the Proxy Statement, at the time of the mailing of the Proxy
Statement or any amendments thereof or supplements thereto, and at the time of
the Stockholders Meeting, not to contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that: (i) no representation or warranty is made by Parent, Silk
USA or Merger Sub with respect to information supplied by or on behalf of the
Company for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement;
and (ii) no representation or warranty is made by the Company with respect to
information supplied by or on behalf of Parent, Silk USA or Merger Sub for
inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement.

 

(c) Mailing of Proxy Statement; Stockholders Meeting. The Company shall, in
accordance with applicable Law and the Company Charter Documents, (i) as
promptly as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement, establish
a record date for and give notice of a meeting of its stockholders, for the
purpose of voting upon the adoption of this Agreement (the " _Stockholders 
Meeting_"), and (ii) as promptly as reasonably practicable after the Company
learns that the Proxy Statement will not be reviewed or that neither the SEC
nor the staff thereof has any further comments thereon, (A) mail to the
holders of Company Common Stock as of the record date established for the
Stockholders Meeting the Proxy Statement and (B) in accordance with NYSE
rules, duly call, convene and hold the Stockholders Meeting, subject to the
Companys ability as provided herein to postpone or adjourn the Stockholders

 



42  Meeting; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall such meeting be
held later than forty-five (45) calendar days following the date the Proxy
Statement is first mailed to the Companys stockholders, subject to the
immediately following sentence. Notwithstanding the foregoing, once the
Stockholders Meeting has been noticed and called, any postponement or
adjournment of the Stockholders Meeting shall require the prior written
consent of Parent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed)
other than in the event that (i) such postponement or adjournment is advisable
(in the Companys good faith judgment) to allow reasonable additional time
for the filing and mailing of any supplemental or amended disclosure which the
Company and its counsel reasonably determine is necessary under applicable Law
and for such supplemental or amended disclosure to be disseminated
and reviewed by the Companys stockholders prior to the Stockholders
Meeting; (ii) such postponement or adjournment is required to obtain the
Company Stockholder Approval (including to allow additional time to solicit
additional proxies); or (iii) the Company Board concludes in good faith,
after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to take
such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable
Law; _provided_ , that if the Stockholders Meeting is postponed or adjourned
pursuant to clause _(i)_ , _(ii)_ , or _(iii)_ of this sentence to a date
that is later than three (3) Business Days prior to the Outside Date, then the

date to which the Stockholders Meeting has been postponed or adjourned.
Unless a Change in Company Board Recommendation has occurred pursuant to
_Section 5.02_ or this Agreement has been terminated pursuant to _Section
8.01_, the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to solicit proxies in
favor of the adoption of this Agreement and shall ensure that all proxies
solicited in connection with the Stockholders Meeting are solicited in
material compliance with applicable Law. Unless this Agreement is validly
terminated in accordance with _Section 8.01_, the Company shall submit this
Agreement to its stockholders at the Stockholders Meeting even if the
Company Board shall have effected a Change in Company Board Recommendation or
proposed or announced any intention to do so. Prior to the date of the
Stockholders Meeting, the Company shall, upon the reasonable request of
Parent, direct the proxy solicitor or other agent of the Company to advise
Parent, once a day for each of the seven (7) Business Days prior to the
Stockholders Meeting, as to the aggregate tally of proxies received by the
Company with respect to the Company Stockholder Approval; _provided_ , that
this sentence shall not apply in the event that an Acquisition Proposal shall
have been publicly announced or publicly made known to the stockholders of
the Company and not publicly withdrawn, or there shall have been a Change in
Company Board Recommendation that has not been publicly withdrawn.

 

(d) Amendments to Proxy Statement. If at any time prior to the Effective Time
any event or circumstance relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
or its or their respective officers or directors, or Parent or any of its
Affiliates or its or their respective officers or directors, should be
discovered by the Company or Parent which, pursuant to the Securities Act or
the Exchange Act, should be set forth in an amendment or a supplement to the
Proxy Statement, the Company or Parent, as applicable, shall promptly inform
Parent or the Company, respectively. Each of Parent, Silk USA, Merger Sub and
the Company agree to use reasonable best efforts to correct as promptly as
practicable any material information provided by it for use in the Proxy
Statement which shall have become false or misleading.

 

Section 6.02 ACCESS TO INFORMATION; CONFIDENTIALITY. During the period from
the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time or the earlier termination
of this Agreement

 



43  pursuant to _Section 8.01_, the Company shall (and the Company shall cause
its Subsidiaries to) afford to Parent, and to Parents officers, employees,
accountants, counsel, consultants, financial advisors and other
Representatives, reasonable access, during normal business hours and upon
reasonable prior notice to the Company, to all of the Companys and its
Subsidiaries properties, personnel, Contracts, books and records as Parent
may from time to time reasonably request. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this _Section 6.02_, any such investigation or consultation shall
be conducted in such a manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the
business or operations of the Company or its Subsidiaries or otherwise result
in any significant interference with the prompt and timely discharge by their
respective employees of their normal duties, and none of Parent or any of its
Representatives shall conduct any "phase II" or similar environmental site
assessment or conduct any sampling of soil, sediment, surface water, ground
water or building material at, on, under or within any facility or property
of the Company or its Subsidiaries. The Parties acknowledge that all
information provided by or on behalf of the Company or any of its
Representatives in connection with this Agreement to Parent, Silk USA, Merger
Sub or any of their respective Representatives shall be "Confidential
Information" under the letter agreement, by and between Samsung Semiconductor
Incorporated and the Company, dated as of September 8, 2016 (together with the
further letter agreement dated as of September 29, 2016 between such parties,
collectively, the " _Confidentiality Agreements_ ", which Confidentiality
Agreements shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their
terms (as such terms may have been amended)). Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this _Section 6.02_, the Company shall not be required to provide
Parent or its Representatives with access to or to disclose information (i)
that is subject to the terms of a confidentiality agreement with a third
party entered into prior to the date of this Agreement or entered into after
the date of this Agreement in the Ordinary Course of Business, (ii) the
disclosure of which would violate any Law or duty, (iii) that is subject to
any attorney-client, attorney work product or other legal privilege or (iv)
that in the reasonable, good faith judgment of the Company is competitively
sensitive; _provided_ , in the case of clauses _(i)_  _(iv)_ , that the
Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to make alternative
arrangements to afford such access or furnish such information without
creating the issues described in such clauses.

 

Section 6.03 BEST EFFORTS; APPROVALS; TRANSACTION LITIGATION.

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
each of the Parties agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist
and cooperate with the other Parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate, as promptly as practicable, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including: (i) using reasonable
best efforts to take all actions necessary to cause (A) in the case of the
Company, the conditions to the Closing set forth in _Section 7.01_ and
_Section 7.02_ to be satisfied, or (B) in the case of Parent, Silk USA and
Merger Sub, the conditions to the Closing set forth in _Section 7.01_ and
_Section 7.03_ to be satisfied, in each case, as promptly as practicable;
(ii) using reasonable best efforts to obtain all necessary Orders and

Foreign Merger Control Laws_ "); (iii) making all necessary registrations,
declarations and filings with, and provide all necessary notices to, any U.S.
Governmental Authority (including pursuant to the HSR Act) or any Governmental

necessary to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement; and (v) vigorously defending and contesting any Proceeding
(other than Transaction Litigation, which is governed by _Section 6.03(h)_
and _Section 5.01(b)(xiii)_) that would otherwise prevent or materially
impede, interfere with, hinder or delay the consummation of the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing or anything contained herein to the contrary, no Party hereto shall
make any filings or seek any Governmental Authorizations in respect of the
Merger other than under the HSR Act and the Specified Foreign Merger Control
Laws. Additionally, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, no
Party shall, directly or indirectly, take any action after the date of
this Agreement (including with respect to any acquisition, by merger,
consolidation, stock or asset purchase or otherwise, or the entry into any
agreement with respect thereto) that would reasonably be expected to delay the
obtaining of, or result in not obtaining, any Orders and Governmental
Authorizations necessary to be obtained in order to satisfy the conditions set
forth in _Section 7.01_.

 

(b) In connection with the efforts referenced in _Section 6.03(a)_ to obtain
all necessary Orders and Governmental Authorizations of any Governmental

contained in _Section 6.03(a)_ and  _Section 6.03(b)_, if any objections
are asserted with respect to the transactions

 



45  contemplated hereby in connection with any necessary Orders and Governmental
Authorizations of any Governmental Authority required pursuant to any
Antitrust Law or if any suit is instituted (or threatened to be instituted)
by the FTC, the DOJ or any other applicable Governmental Authority or any
private party challenging any of the transactions contemplated hereby as
violative of any Antitrust Law or which would otherwise prevent, materially
impede or materially delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby, each of Parent, Silk USA, Merger Sub and the Company shall take all
such further action to resolve any such objections or suits, and otherwise to
obtain all necessary Orders and Governmental Authorizations of any
Governmental Authority required pursuant to any Antitrust Law so as to permit
consummation of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement to occur expeditiously and in no event later than the Outside Date,
including that Parent, Silk USA and Merger Sub shall be required to take any
actions required or requested by any Governmental Authority that limit or
could be expected to limit the right of Parent to own or operate all or any
portion of the businesses, product lines, or assets of the Company or the
Subsidiaries of the Company, including: (i) by executing or carrying out
agreements, submitting to orders, writs, rulings, judgments, consent

_provided_ , that neither Parent nor the Company shall be required to agree to
any term or take any action pursuant to this _Section 6.03(c)_ that (A) is
not conditioned upon consummation of the Merger or (B) would constitute a
Burdensome Condition. All such efforts by Parent, Silk USA and/or Merger Sub
shall be unconditional, subject to this _Section 6.03_, and no actions taken
pursuant to this _Section 6.03(c)_ (or the Effects therefrom) shall be
considered for purposes of determining whether a Company Material Adverse
Effect has occurred.

 

(d) If any objections are asserted with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby under any Antitrust Law, or if any suit or
Proceeding, whether judicial or administrative, is instituted by any
Governmental Authority or any private party challenging any of the
transactions contemplated hereby as violating any Antitrust Law, each Party
shall use its reasonable best efforts to: (i) oppose or defend against any
action to prevent or enjoin consummation of the Merger (and the transactions
contemplated hereby); and (ii) take such action as reasonably necessary to
overturn any regulatory action by any Governmental Authority to block
consummation of this Agreement (and the transactions contemplated hereby),
including by defending any Proceeding brought by any Governmental Authority in
order to avoid entry of, or to have vacated, overturned or
terminated, including by appeal if necessary, in order to resolve any such
objections or challenge as such Governmental Authority or private party may
have to such transactions under any Antitrust Law so as to permit consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as expeditiously as
possible; _provided_ that Parent and the Company shall cooperate with one
another in connection with all Proceedings related to the foregoing.

 



46 (e) The Parties shall file a notice pursuant to Exon-Florio and each of the
Parties shall take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to
be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other Parties in doing, all
things necessary, proper or advisable to satisfy the CFIUS Condition,
including: (i) within fifteen (15) Business Days after the date of this

the pre-notice consultation process with CFIUS; (ii) following such pre-
notice consultation, as promptly as practicable and, in any event, within five
(5) Business Days of CFIUS providing comments on the draft filing, file with
CFIUS a voluntary notice as contemplated by 31 C.F.R. § 800.401(a) and in the
case of Parent, Silk USA and Merger Sub the personal identifier information

to the non-filing Parties prior to filing and considering all reasonable
additions, deletions or changes suggested in connection therewith) and in
connection with resolving any investigation or other inquiry of any
Governmental Authority under Exon-Florio with respect to any such filing or
any such transaction. Each Party shall use reasonable best efforts to furnish
to each other Party all information required for any application or other
filing to be made pursuant to any applicable Law in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. To the extent permitted by
applicable Law, each Party shall promptly inform the other Parties of any oral
communication with, and provide copies of written communications with, any
Governmental Authority regarding any such filings or any such transaction. No
Party shall independently participate in any formal meeting with any
Governmental Authority in respect of any such filings, investigation or other
inquiry without giving the other Parties sufficient prior notice of the
meeting and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Authority, the
opportunity to attend and/or participate in such meeting. Subject to
applicable Law, the Parties will consult and cooperate with one another in
connection with any analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs,
arguments, opinions and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any
Party relating to Proceedings under Exon-Florio. Without limiting the
foregoing, each of Parent and the Company shall take any and all such actions
and agree to such requirements or conditions to mitigate any national security
concerns as may be requested or required by CFIUS in connection with, or as a
condition of, the satisfaction of the CFIUS Condition; _provided_ , _however_
, that neither Parent nor the Company shall be required to agree to any term
or take any action in connection with the satisfaction of the CFIUS Condition
that is not conditioned upon consummation of the Merger or that would
constitute a Burdensome Condition. All such efforts by Parent, Silk USA and/or
Merger Sub shall be unconditional, and no actions taken pursuant to this
_Section 6.03(e)_ (or the Effects therefrom) shall be considered for
purposes of determining whether a Company Material Adverse Effect has
occurred.

(f) Subject to its obligations under this _Section 6.03_ (including
_Sections 6.03(a)_, _6.03(c)_ and _6.03(e)_ ), with respect to the matters
covered in (and subject to the terms of) this

 



47   _Section 6.03_, Parent shall, after consulting with the Company and
considering and incorporating the Companys views in good faith, take the lead
in developing strategy for obtaining the Orders and Governmental
Authorizations of Governmental Authorities required hereunder and responding
to any investigation or other inquiry by any Governmental Authority.

 

(g) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall (at Parents sole expense)
use its commercially reasonable efforts to seek any approval or consent
required from the other party thereto as a result of the Merger under any
Material Contract reasonably requested by Parent; _provided_ , that (i) the
Company shall not be required to pay any money to any such other party
or otherwise in connection with obtaining any such approval or consent (and
Parent shall promptly reimburse the Company for any out-of-pocket fees, costs
and expenses incurred in connection with complying with its obligations under
this  _Section 6.03(g)_), and (ii) the failure to obtain any such approval
or consent shall not in any case be taken into account as to whether any of
the conditions set forth in _Article VII_ have been satisfied.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be required to agree to
any term or take any action in connection with its obligations pursuant to
this _Section 6.03(g)_ that is not conditioned upon consummation of the
Merger.

 

(h) Prior to the earlier of the Effective Time and the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.01_, the Company shall promptly advise
Parent of any Transaction Litigation, shall keep Parent reasonably informed
regarding any such Transaction Litigation, and shall permit Parent and its
Representatives to participate in (but not control) the defense, negotiation
or settlement of any Transaction Litigation, and shall give consideration to
Parents reasonable advice with respect to such Transaction Litigation. With
respect to any settlement in connection with any Transaction Litigation which
is proposed to be settled solely for monetary damages not entirely paid for
with proceeds of insurance (other than the deductible under any insurance
policy(ies) in effect), no such settlement shall be agreed to without Parents
prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed.

(i) Each of the Parties shall reasonably cooperate with the others in taking,
or causing to be taken, all actions and doing, or causing to be done, all
things reasonably necessary under applicable Laws and rules and policies of
the NYSE to cause the delisting of the Company and of the Company Common Stock
from the NYSE as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time and the
deregistration of the Company Common Stock under the Exchange Act as promptly
as practicable after such delisting; _provided_ (A) that any such delisting or
deregistration shall be conditional upon and shall occur after the Effective
Time; and (B) Parent shall pay any out of pocket costs, fees and expenses
incurred by the Company in connection with the cooperation, deregistration
and/or delisting contemplated by this _Section 6.03(i)_.

Section 6.04 STATE TAKEOVER LAWS. Assuming the accuracy of the
representations and warranties of Parent, Silk USA and Merger Sub set forth in
_Section 4.07_, if any Takeover Law becomes or is deemed to be applicable to
Parent, Silk USA, Merger Sub, the Company, this Agreement, the Merger, or any
other transaction contemplated by this Agreement, then the Company and the
Company Board, as applicable, shall take all action reasonably necessary to
ensure that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated herein and therein and otherwise act to eliminate, or, if not
possible, minimize to the maximum extent possible, the

 



48  effects of such Takeover Law on this Agreement, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Nothing in this _Section 6.04_
shall be construed to permit Parent, Silk USA or Merger Sub to do any act
that would constitute a violation or breach of, or as a waiver of any of the
Companys rights under, any other provision of this Agreement. No Change in
Company Board Recommendation shall change the approval of the Company Board
for purposes of causing any Takeover Law to be inapplicable to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

Section 6.05 DIRECTOR AND OFFICER INSURANCE.

 

(a) For six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the
Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries,
as the case may be, in each case to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
the Company Charter Documents or comparable organizational documents of the
Companys Subsidiaries, as applicable, to: (i) indemnify and hold harmless,
against any costs or expenses (including attorneys fees and expenses and
disbursements), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities
incurred in connection with any Proceeding (whether formal or informal), and
provide advancement of expenses to, all past and present directors and
officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries and, solely to the extent
permitted by applicable Company Charter Documents or comparable organizational
documents of the Companys Subsidiaries, employees (in all of their
capacities, including in connection with such persons serving as an officer,
director, employee or other fiduciary of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, of any benefit plan or of any other person if such service was
at the request or for the benefit of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries)
(the " _Covered Persons_ "); and (ii) include and cause to be maintained in
effect in the Companys or the Surviving Corporations (or any successors),
and each of the Companys Subsidiaries, as the case may be, articles and
bylaws (or comparable organizational documents) for a period of six (6) years
after the Effective Time, provisions regarding elimination of liability,
indemnification, and advancement of expenses of and to the Covered Persons
that are at least as favorable as those contained in the Company Charter
Documents (or comparable organizational documents of the
Companys Subsidiaries, as applicable). If the Company or the Surviving
Corporation, as the case may be, or any of their respective successors or
assigns shall: (x) consolidate with or merge into any other corporation or
entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger; or (y) transfer all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any individual, corporation or other entity, then and
in each such case, to the extent necessary, proper provisions shall be made
so that the successors and assigns of the Company or the Surviving
Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume all of the obligations set forth
in this _Section 6.05_.

 

(b) The Company shall be permitted to, at or prior to the Effective Time (and
if the Company does not, then Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, effective as of the Effective Time), purchase a six (6) year
"tail" prepaid policy on the same terms and conditions as the existing
directors and officers liability (and fiduciary) insurance maintained by
the Company, for the benefit of the Covered Persons from insurance carriers
with comparable credit ratings, covering, without limitation, the Merger, and
Parent shall and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain such
prepaid policy for the duration thereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
cost of such "tail" policy shall in no event exceed three hundred percent
(300%) of the amount of the last annual premium paid by the Company for such
existing 

 



49  directors and officers liability (and fiduciary) insurance. If, but for
the proviso to the immediately preceding sentence, the Surviving Corporation
would be required to expend more than three hundred percent (300%) of current
annual premiums, the Surviving Corporation will obtain the maximum amount of
that insurance obtainable by payment of annual premiums equal to three hundred
percent (300%) of current annual premiums.

(c) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall
release, waive or impair any rights to directors and officers insurance
claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any of their respective directors,
officers or other employees, it being understood and agreed that the
indemnification provided for in this _Section 6.05_ is not prior to or in
substitution for any such claims under such policies.

 

(d) This covenant is intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, each of the Covered Persons and their respective heirs and
legal representatives. The rights to indemnification and advancement and the
other rights provided for herein shall not be deemed exclusive of any other
rights to which any past and present director or officer of the Company and
its Subsidiaries (in all of their capacities) is entitled, whether pursuant
to law, contract or otherwise, all of which shall survive the Merger and shall
continue in full force and effect. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, if any Covered Person notifies Parent on or prior to the sixth
(6th) anniversary of the Effective Time of a matter in respect of which such
person may seek indemnification or insurance pursuant to this _Section 6.05_,
the provisions of this  _Section 6.05_ shall continue in effect with respect
to such matter until the final disposition of all Proceedings relating
thereto. In the event of any breach by Parent or the Surviving Corporation of
this _Section 6.05_, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to, pay all reasonable expenses, including attorneys fees, that may be
incurred by Covered Persons in enforcing the indemnity and other obligations
provided in this _Section 6.05_ as such fees are incurred upon the written
request of such Covered Person.

Section 6.06 PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENTS. The initial press release with respect to
the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby shall be a joint press release to be
reasonably agreed upon by Parent and the Company. Parent and the Company (a)
shall consult with each other before issuing, and, to the extent practicable,
give each other the reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon, any
press release or other public statements (including any material filings with
the SEC related to the Merger) with respect to the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby, and shall consider in good faith the views
of the other Party, and (b) shall not issue any such press release or make
any such public statement without the other Partys prior written consent,
except in the case of each of clause _(a)_ and clause _(b)_ as may be
required by applicable Law (including, in the case of the Company, by the
Company Boards fiduciary duties, it being expressly understood that nothing
herein shall be construed as a modification or limitation of _Section 5.02_),
court process or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with or
rules of any applicable securities exchange or trading market, in which case
the Party required to make the release or announcement shall use reasonable
best efforts to allow the other Party reasonable time to comment on
such release or announcement in advance of such issuance (it being understood
that the final determination of the disclosure requirements under applicable
Law shall be made by the disclosing Party after consultation with its outside
legal counsel);  _provided_ , that in connection

 



50  with an Acquisition Proposal, Superior Proposal, Change in Company Board
Recommendation or Intervening Event, so long as the only information contained
therein with respect to Parent, Silk USA or Merger Sub relates to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or any other Acquisition
Proposal made by Parent, Silk USA or Merger Sub, the Companys only obligation
shall be to inform Parent in advance of the intention to issue any such
release or announcement; _provided_ , _further_ , that each Party may make
statements that are not inconsistent with previous press releases, public
disclosures or public statements made by Parent and the Company in compliance
with this _Section 6.06_.

Section 6.07 SECTION 16 MATTERS. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall take all reasonable steps as may be required to cause any dispositions
of Company equity securities (including derivative securities) resulting from
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who is
a director or officer of the Company subject to the reporting requirements of
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated
under the Exchange Act to the extent permitted by applicable Law.

 

Section 6.08 MERGER SUB AND SURVIVING CORPORATION. Parent shall take all
action necessary to cause Silk USA and Merger Sub, and after the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation, to perform their respective obligations under
this Agreement.

 

Section 6.09 DELISTING OF NOTES; CREDIT FACILITY.

 

(a) Delisting and Deregistration of Notes. The Company shall reasonably
cooperate with Parent (upon Parents written request) in connection with the
Closing to (i) delist the 2.000% Notes from trading on the NYSE and (ii) to
the extent permitted by the Exchange Act, deregister the 2.000% Notes and the
4.150% Notes from the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act;  _provided_
, _however_ (A) that any such delisting or deregistration shall be conditional
upon and shall occur after the Effective Time and (B) Parent shall pay any out
of pocket costs, fees and expenses incurred by the Company in connection with
the cooperation, deregistration and/or delisting contemplated by this _Section
6.09(a)_.

(b) Credit Facility. The Company shall reasonably cooperate with Parent (upon
Parents written request) to obtain a waiver (which waiver shall not become
effective prior to, and shall be conditioned on the occurrence of, the
Effective Time) in accordance with the terms of the Existing Revolver such
that all amounts outstanding under the Existing Revolver as of the Closing
Date will remain outstanding and the Existing Revolver will continue in effect
unchanged (except for such changes as may be requested or consented to by
Parent in connection with seeking such waiver) as a result of the Merger;
_provided_ that Parent shall pay any out of pocket costs, fees and expenses
incurred by the Company in connection with the cooperation and/or waiver
contemplated by this _Section 6.09(b)_. For the avoidance of doubt,
successfully obtaining the waiver contemplated by this _Section 6.09(b)_
shall not be a condition to Closing.

 

Section 6.10 EMPLOYEE MATTERS.

 

(a) During the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the later
of the first (1st) anniversary of the Closing Date and June 30, 2018 (the "
_Continuation Period_ "), Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation (or its
Subsidiaries, as appropriate) to provide to

 



51  each employee of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries (other than
any employee represented by a labor organization or covered by any Collective
Bargaining Agreement, whose compensation and benefits shall be governed by
the applicable Collective Bargaining Agreement) as of the Effective Time (each
such an employee, a " _Covered Employee_ "), for so long as such Covered
Employee continues to be employed during the Continuation Period by the
Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries, with (i) a base salary or
base wage rate, short-term incentive compensation opportunities, and long-term
incentive compensation opportunities, in each case, that are no less
favorable than the base salary or base wage rate, short-term incentive
compensation opportunities, and long-term incentive compensation opportunities
provided to such Covered Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time (it
being expressly understood that no equity-based compensation will be required
to be provided to the Covered Employees after the Effective Time), and (ii)
other compensation and employee benefits that are, in the aggregate, no less
favorable than those provided to such Covered Employee immediately prior to
the Effective Time. Without limiting the immediately preceding sentence,
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation (or its Subsidiaries, as
appropriate) to provide to each Covered Employee whose employment is
terminated during the Continuation Period with severance benefits that are no
less than the severance benefits for which such Covered Employee was eligible
immediately prior to the Closing under the applicable Company Benefit Plan or
Foreign Benefit Plan, determined (1) without taking into account any reduction
after the Closing in compensation paid to such Covered Employee and (2) taking
into account each Covered Employees service with the Company and its
Subsidiaries (and any predecessor entities) and, after the Closing, Parent and
its Affiliates.

(b) Effective as of the Effective Time and thereafter, Parent shall, and
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, (i) ensure that no eligibility
waiting periods, actively-at-work requirements or pre-existing condition
limitations or exclusions shall apply with respect to the Covered Employees
under the applicable health and welfare benefits plan of Parent or any of its
Affiliates (except to the extent applicable under a comparable Company Benefit
Plan or Foreign Benefit Plan in which such Covered Employees participated, as
applicable, immediately prior to the Effective Time), (ii) waive any and all
evidence of insurability requirements with respect to the Covered Employees to
the extent such evidence of insurability requirements were not applicable to
the Covered Employees under a comparable Company Benefit Plan or Foreign
Benefit Plan in which such Covered Employees participated, as applicable,
immediately prior to the Effective Time, (iii) credit each Covered
Employee with all deductible payments, out-of-pocket or other co-payments
paid by such employee under a comparable Company Benefit Plan and Foreign
Benefit Plan in which such Covered Employees participated immediately prior to
the Closing Date during the year in which the Closing occurs for the purpose
of determining the extent to which any such employee has satisfied his or her
deductible and whether he or she has reached the out-of-pocket maximum under
any health benefit plan of Parent or any of its Affiliates, and (iv)
recognize all service of each Covered Employee with the Company and its
Subsidiaries for all purposes in any employee benefit plan of Parent and its
Affiliates in which such Covered Employee is eligible to participate to the
same extent that such service was taken into account under a comparable
Company Benefit Plan and Foreign Benefit Plan prior to the Effective Time;
_provided_ that the foregoing service recognition shall not apply to the
extent it would result in duplication of benefits for the same period of
services or in retroactive benefit accrual with respect to any defined benefit
pension plan.

 



52 (c) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, honor all of
the Company Benefit Plans and Foreign Benefit Plans in accordance with their
terms as in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date, it being understood
that the foregoing shall not be construed as a limitation on the right of
Parent or the Surviving Corporation to amend such terms to the extent
permitted by the terms of the applicable Company Benefit Plan or Foreign
Benefit Plan. Unless prohibited by applicable Laws or expressly provided
otherwise in any applicable Company Benefit Plan or Foreign Benefit Plan,
Parent hereby acknowledges that a "change in control" (or similar phrase)
within the meaning of the Company Benefit Plans and Foreign Benefit Plans
containing such a term (or similar phrase) will occur at the Effective Time.

 

(d) The provisions of this _Section 6.10_ are for the sole benefit of the
Parties and nothing herein, express or implied, is intended or shall be
construed to confer upon or give to any person (including, for the avoidance
of doubt, any current, former, or retired employee, officer, non-employee
director, independent contractor, consultant, or other service provider
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, Parent or any of its Affiliates,
or on or after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation or any of its
Subsidiaries), other than the Parties and their respective permitted
successors and assigns, any legal or equitable or other rights or remedies
(with respect to the matters provided for in this _Section 6.10_) under or by
reason of any provision of this Agreement, including any rights to continued
employment or service with Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 6.10_ to the
contrary, nothing contained herein, whether express or implied, shall be
treated as an amendment or other modification of any Company Benefit Plan or
Foreign Benefit Plan maintained by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or
any employee benefit plan maintained by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, or
on or after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation or any of its
Subsidiaries, or shall limit the right of Parent to amend, terminate or
otherwise modify any Company Benefit Plan or Foreign Benefit Plan or any
employee benefit plan maintained by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any
of their Subsidiaries following the Effective Time. Nothing contained herein
shall be construed as requiring, and the Company and its Subsidiaries shall
take no action that would have the effect of requiring, Parent or the
Surviving Corporation to adopt or continue any specific employee benefit
plans or to continue the employment of any specific person.

suffered as a result of this Agreement, the failure of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated or for a breach or failure

contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto; or (c) subject

subject matter of this Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreements.

Section 10.05 NO THIRD-PARTY BENEFICIARIES. Except (i) for the provisions of
_Section 6.05_, (ii) the right of the Company, on behalf of its stockholders,
to pursue damages in the event of Parents, Silk USAs or Merger Subs
Willful Breach of this Agreement, which shall be deemed in such event to be
damages of the Company, and (iii) following the Effective Time,

 



75  the rights of the Companys stockholders and holders of Company Equity
Awards to receive the Merger Consideration and other payments pursuant to
_Article II_, neither this Agreement nor any other agreement contemplated
hereby is intended to or shall confer upon any person (including any Company
Related Party or Parent Related Party) other than the Parties hereto and
thereto any legal or equitable rights or remedies. The representations and
warranties in this Agreement are the product of negotiations among the Parties
and are for the sole benefit of the Parties. Any inaccuracies in such
representations and warranties are subject to waiver by the Parties
in accordance with _Section 8.05_ without notice or liability to any other
person. The representations and warranties in this Agreement may represent an
allocation among the Parties of risks associated with particular matters.

 

Section 10.06 ASSIGNMENT. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by
operation of law or otherwise by any of the Parties without the prior written
consent of each of the other Parties, and any assignment without such consent
shall be null and void; _provided_ , _however_ , that, prior to the Closing,
(i) Parent, Silk USA and Merger Sub may assign this Agreement (in whole but
not in part) to any of Parents direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiaries
(only to the extent any such Subsidiary (each a " _Qualifying Subsidiary_ ")
(A) remains a direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Silk and (B) is
organized and tax resident in either the Republic of Korea or the United
States), and (ii) Silk USA may transfer to Parent, or any of Parents
Qualifying Subsidiaries (so long as such Subsidiary remains a Qualifying
Subsidiary) the beneficial ownership of capital stock of Merger Sub, in each
case after providing written notice thereof to the Company at least five (5)
Business Days prior to such assignment or transfer. No such assignment or
transfer by any Party shall relieve such Party of any of its obligations
hereunder. Subject to the immediately preceding sentences, this Agreement will
be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the Parties
and their respective successors and assigns.

 

Section 10.07 CONSENT TO JURISDICTION; VENUE; GOVERNING LAW. This Agreement
and all claims or causes of action (whether in tort, contract or otherwise)
that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement or the
negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement (including any claim
or cause of action based upon, arising out of or related to any representation
or warranty made in or in connection with this Agreement) shall be governed by
and construed in accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware, without
giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of
the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the
application of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.
Each of the Parties hereto irrevocably agrees that any legal Proceeding with
respect to this Agreement and the rights and obligations arising hereunder, or
for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in respect of this Agreement
and the rights and obligations arising hereunder brought by the other Party
hereto or its successors or assigns, shall be brought and determined
exclusively in the Delaware Court of Chancery, or, if the Delaware Court of
Chancery declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any
federal court within the State of Delaware, or, if both the Delaware Court of
Chancery and the federal courts within the State of Delaware decline to accept
jurisdiction over a particular matter, any other state court within the State
of Delaware, and, in each case, any appellate court therefrom (all such courts
referred to in this sentence, the " _Delaware Courts_ "). Each of the Parties
hereto hereby irrevocably submits with regard to any such legal Proceeding
for itself and in respect of its property, generally and unconditionally, to
the personal jurisdiction of the Delaware Courts and

 



76  agrees that it will not bring any Proceeding relating to this Agreement or
any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any court other than
the Delaware Courts. Each of the Parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives,
and agrees not to assert as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any
Proceeding with respect to this Agreement: (a) any claim that it is not
personally subject to the jurisdiction of the Delaware Courts for any reason
other than the failure to serve in accordance with this _Section 10.07_; (b)
any claim that it or its property is exempt or immune from the jurisdiction of
any Delaware Court or from any legal process commenced in such courts
(whether through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment
in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise); and (c)
to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable Law, any claim that (i)
the Proceeding in such court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (ii) the
venue of such Proceeding is improper or (iii) this Agreement, or the subject
matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by such courts. Each of the Parties
hereto agrees that service of process upon such Party in any such Proceeding
shall be effective if such process is given as a notice in accordance with
_Section 10.03_. Parent agrees that if the Company obtains a judgment against
Parent in any Delaware Court arising out of or relating to this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby, the Company may bring any Proceeding
with respect to the recognition and enforcement thereof in a court in any
jurisdiction whatsoever, including in the Republic of Korea, and Parent
hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as a
defense, counterclaim or otherwise, any contention that such judgment of any
of the Delaware Courts may not be recognized and/or enforced in whole or in
part.

Section 10.08 WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. Each Party acknowledges and agrees that
any controversy which may arise under this Agreement is likely to involve
complicated and difficult issues, and therefore each such Party hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally waives any right such Party may have to
a trial by jury in any Proceeding directly or indirectly based upon, relating
to or arising out of this Agreement or any transaction contemplated hereby or
the negotiation, execution or performance hereof or thereof. Each Party
certifies and acknowledges that (a) no Representative of any other Party has
represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other Party would not, in the
event of any Proceeding, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver, (b) each Party
understands and has considered the implication of this waiver, (c) each Party
makes this waiver voluntarily, and (d) each Party has been induced to enter
into this Agreement by, among other things, the mutual waivers and
certifications in this  _Section 10.08_.

Section 10.09 SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE; REMEDIES. The Parties agree that
irreparable injury for which monetary damages, even if available, would not be
an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that any of the Parties hereto
does not perform any of the provisions of this Agreement (including
failing to take such actions as are required of it hereunder to consummate
this Agreement) in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach
such provisions. Accordingly, the Parties acknowledge and agree that each of
the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction, specific performance and
other equitable relief to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches
of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof
and thereof, in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at
law or in equity. Each of the Parties agrees that it will not oppose the
granting of an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief on
the basis that any other Party has an adequate remedy at law or that
any award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason
at law or in equity. Any Party seeking an injunction to prevent breaches of
this Agreement and to

 



77  enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in any court
having jurisdiction related to this Agreement as provided in _Section 10.07_
shall be entitled to such an injunction without the necessity of
demonstrating damages or posting a bond or other security in connection with
any such injunction. To the extent any Party brings a Proceeding to enforce
specifically the performance of the terms and provisions of this Agreement
(other than an action to specifically enforce only provision(s) that expressly
survive termination of this Agreement) when available to such party pursuant
to this _Section 10.09_, the Outside Date shall automatically be extended to
the later of: (i) the twentieth (20th) Business Day following the resolution
of such Proceeding, or (ii) such other time period established by the court
presiding over such Proceeding. Each of Parent, Silk USA and Merger Sub, on
the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, hereby agrees not to raise
any objections to the availability of the equitable remedy of specific
performance to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this
Agreement by Parent, Silk USA or Merger Sub, or the Company, as applicable,
and to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement to
prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the
covenants and obligations of Parent, Silk USA or Merger Sub, or the Company,
as applicable, under this Agreement.

Section 10.10 SEVERABILITY. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
manner materially adverse to any Party. Upon such determination that any term
or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect
the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable Law in an acceptable manner to the end that
the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent possible.

Section 10.11 COUNTERPARTS; FACSIMILE AND ELECTRONIC SIGNATURES. This
Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, all of which shall be
considered one and the same agreement and shall become effective when one or
more counterparts have been signed by each of the Parties and delivered to the
other Parties. This Agreement or any counterpart may be executed and delivered
by facsimile copies or delivered by electronic communications by PDF, each of
which shall be deemed an original.
