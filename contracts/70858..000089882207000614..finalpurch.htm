REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SELLER

 

 Except as disclosed in the Disclosure Schedule (it being agreed that disclosure in any Section of the Disclosure Schedule shall apply only to the indicated Section of this Agreement, except to the extent that it is reasonably apparent on the face of the disclosure that such disclosure is relevant to another Section of this Agreement), Seller represents and warrants to Purchaser that the following is true and correct:

 

 3.1. _Corporate Organization_.

 

(a) The Seller has been duly incorporated and is validly existing as a public
company with limited liability under the laws of The Netherlands. The Company
is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under
the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization. Each of Seller and the
Company has the corporate or other organizational power and authority to own
or lease all of its properties and assets and to carry on its business as it
is now being conducted, and is duly licensed or qualified to do business in
each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the
character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased by it makes
such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so
licensed or qualified would not reasonably be expected to, individually or in
the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect. The Company is duly registered
as a bank holding company under the BHCA and is a financial holding company
pursuant to Section 4(l) of the BHCA and meets in all material respects the
applicable requirements for qualification as such. True and complete copies of
the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, as in effect as of the date of

The Company is not in violation in any material respect of any of the
provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws.

 

(b) Section 3.1(b) of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth a complete and
correct list as of the date hereof of all the Subsidiaries of the Company
(each a " _Company Subsidiary_" and collectively the " _Company Subsidiaries_
"). The shares of Company Preferred Stock held by Persons other than the
Company and its Subsidiaries have a liquidation preference of no more than
$200,000,000. All of the outstanding shares of capital stock or other
securities evidencing ownership of, or an equity ownership in, the Company
Subsidiaries are validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and such shares
or other securities are owned entirely by the Company or a wholly owned
Company Subsidiary, free and clear of any Lien with respect thereto. There are
no outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants, puts, calls, rights,
exchangeable or convertible securities or other commitments or agreements of
any character relating to the issued or unissued capital stock or other
securities or ownership or equity interests of any Company Subsidiary, or
otherwise obligating any Company Subsidiary to issue, transfer, sell,
purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any such stock, securities or interests.
Each Company Subsidiary (i) is a duly organized and validly existing
corporation, partnership or limited liability company or other legal entity
under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization, (ii) is duly qualified to
do business and is in good standing in all jurisdictions (whether federal,
state, local or foreign) where its ownership or leasing of property or the
conduct of its business requires it to be so qualified (except for
jurisdictions in which the failure to be so qualified

  would not reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, have a
Material Adverse Effect) and (iii) has all requisite corporate or other legal
entity power and authority to own or lease its properties and assets and to
carry on its business as now conducted. Except for its interests in the
Company Subsidiaries, the Company does not own, directly or indirectly, any
capital stock, membership interest, partnership interest, joint venture
interest or other equity interest with a fair market value as of the date of
this Agreement in excess of $25 million in any Person other than in the
ordinary course of business.

All of the Company Common Stock is owned by Seller, free and clear of any Liens. Except as set forth above, no shares of capital stock or other voting securities, equity securities or other ownership or equity interests of the Company are issued, reserved for issuance or outstanding. There are no outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants, puts, calls, rights, exchangeable or convertible securities or other commitments or agreements of any character relating to the issued or unissued capital stock or other securities or ownership or equity interests of the Company, or otherwise obligating the Company to issue, transfer, sell, purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any such stock, securities or interests.

their respective properties, assets or business activities may be bound or
affected, except (in the case of clause (ii)(y) above) for such violations,

such plan.

Benefit Plans which are subject to ERISA, any trusts created thereunder or any
trustee or administrator thereof, has engaged in a "prohibited transaction"

the accelerated vesting, funding or delivery of, or increase the amount or
value of, any payment or benefit to any employee, officer or director of
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or result in any limitation on the right
of Company or any of its Subsidiaries to amend, merge, terminate or receive a
reversion of assets from any Company Benefit Plan or related trust. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, except as would not have a Material
Adverse Effect, no amount paid or payable (whether in cash, in property, or in
the form of benefits) in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby
(either solely as a result thereof or as a result of such transactions in
conjunction with any other event) will be an "excess parachute payment" within

 5.3. _No Solicitation_.

 

(a) _Non-Solicit._ Except as expressly provided in Section 5.3(b), Seller
shall, shall cause its Affiliates to and shall use all reasonable efforts to
cause its Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated any
discussion or negotiation with any Person conducted theretofore by Seller or
any of its Affiliates or Representatives with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal and, to the extent it is entitled to do so, under the applicable
confidentiality obligation cause to be returned or destroyed all confidential
information provided by or made available to such Person on behalf of Seller
or any of its Affiliates. Except as expressly provided in Section 5.3(b), from
the date hereof until the earlier of the Closing and the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with its terms, Seller shall not, shall cause its
Affiliates not to and shall use all reasonable efforts to cause its
Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate,
knowingly encourage or accept the submission of any proposal or offer relating
to any Acquisition Proposal, or (ii) participate in any discussions or
negotiations (and each of the foregoing shall immediately cease any
discussions or negotiations that are ongoing) regarding, furnish any
information with respect to, assist or knowingly participate in any effort or
attempt by any third party to do or seek any of the foregoing. For purposes of
this Agreement, " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means any offer or proposal, or any
indication of interest in making an offer or proposal, made by a Person or
group at any time which is structured to permit such Person or group to
acquire, directly or indirectly, beneficial ownership of the Business pursuant
to a merger, consolidation or other business combination, sale of shares of
capital stock, sale of assets, tender offer or exchange offer or similar
transaction, including any single or multi-step transaction or series of
related transactions, in each case other than the Sale, any transaction
expressly permitted under Section 5.2 and any transaction involving a
combination with or acquisition of Seller and its Affiliates substantially as
a whole (but, in such latter case, would preserve the rights and obligations
under this Agreement).

 

(b) _Solicitation Period._

 

(i) Notwithstanding Section 5.3(a), during the period beginning on the date of
this Agreement and continuing until 11:59 p.m., New York time, on the

  date that is 14 days after the date of this Agreement (the " _Solicitation
Period_ "), Seller and its Representatives shall have the right to directly or
indirectly: (i) initiate, solicit and encourage Acquisition Proposals from any
Qualified Purchaser relating to the purchase of the Business, including by way
of providing access to non-public information pursuant to one or more
Conforming Confidentiality Agreements; _provided_ that Seller shall promptly
provide or make available to Purchaser any material non-public information
concerning the Business, the Company or any Company Subsidiary that is
provided or made available to any Person given such access that was not
previously provided or made available to Purchaser; and (ii) enter into and
maintain discussions or negotiations with respect to Acquisition Proposals or
otherwise cooperate with or assist or participate in, or facilitate any such
discussions or negotiations. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Qualified
Purchaser_ " means any U.S. or foreign bank or bank holding company that is
reasonably capable of entering into, within the Solicitation Period, a
definitive agreement meeting the terms of an Alternative Acquisition
Agreement.

 

(ii) If Seller receives an Acquisition Proposal from any Qualified Purchaser
prior to the end of the Solicitation Period that Seller concludes in good
faith constitutes a Superior Proposal, Seller may at any time prior to the end
of the Solicitation Period enter into a definitive agreement with respect to
such Superior Proposal, except that such agreement must be conditioned upon
Purchaser not exercising its rights set forth in clause (iii) below and, if
such right is not exercised, Purchaser receiving the payment of the
Termination Fee pursuant to Section 8.1(f), and must provide for its automatic
termination (without any cost, liability or obligation to the Company,
Purchaser or their respective Subsidiaries) upon any such exercise (together
with any related schedules, exhibits or other documentation, the "
_Alternative Acquisition_ _Agreement_ "). Promptly upon entering into an
Alternative Acquisition Agreement (and in any event within twenty-four hours
thereof), Seller shall provide a true and complete copy thereof to Purchaser.
For purposes of this Agreement, " _Superior Proposal_ " means any _bona fide_
Acquisition Proposal made in writing that (x) is on terms that Seller
determines in its good faith judgment (after taking into account all legal,
financial, regulatory and other aspects of the proposal, including likelihood
of consummation) is superior from a financial point of view to this Agreement
for the Sellers shareholders and (y) is for cash and is not subject to any
financing condition.

 

(iii) Upon receipt by Purchaser of the Alternative Acquisition Agreement and
for a period of five Business Days thereafter (the " _Matching Period_"),
Seller shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, during the Matching
Period, negotiate with Purchaser in good faith (to the extent Purchaser
desires to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of
this Agreement so that the Acquisition Proposal provided for in the
Alternative Acquisition Agreement ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal. In
the event that Purchaser agrees to make adjustments in the terms and
conditions of this Agreement such that Seller concludes that the Acquisition
Proposal provided for

  in the Alternative Acquisition Agreement no longer constitutes a Superior
Proposal, the Alternative Acquisition Agreement shall automatically terminate
(without any cost, liability or obligation to the Company, Purchaser or their
respective Subsidiaries). In the event that Purchaser does not so agree during
the Matching Period, the Alternative Acquisition Agreement shall become final
and binding upon Seller upon the payment by Seller of the Termination Fee
pursuant to Section 8.1(f) .

 

ARTICLE VI

 

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

 

 6.1. _Regulatory Matters_.

 

(a) Each of Purchaser and Seller shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to,
take, or cause to be taken, all commercially reasonable actions necessary or
advisable to (i) comply promptly with all legal requirements which may be
imposed on such party or its relevant Subsidiaries with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby, including in connection with obtaining any
third-party consent that may be required to be obtained in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and, subject to the conditions
set forth in Article VII hereof, to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby (including, for purposes of this Section 6.1, required in order to
continue any contract or agreement with Company or its Subsidiaries following
Closing or to avoid any penalty or other fee under such contracts and
agreements, in each case arising in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby) and (ii) obtain (and cooperate with the other party to
obtain) any consent, authorization, order or approval of, or any exemption by,
any Governmental Entity which is required or advisable to be obtained by
Seller or Purchaser, respectively, or any of their respective Subsidiaries in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (it being
understood and agreed that it shall be deemed commercially reasonable for
Purchaser to take all action other than those that would not be required
pursuant to the last sentence of this Section 6.1(a)) . The parties hereto
shall cooperate with each other and promptly prepare and file all necessary
documentation, and to effect all applications, notices, petitions and filings
(including, if required, notification under the HSR Act), to obtain as
promptly as practicable all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of
all third parties and Governmental Entities which are necessary or advisable
to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Purchaser and
Seller shall have the right to review in advance and, to the extent
practicable, each will consult the other on, in each case subject to
applicable laws relating to confidentiality or the exchange of information,
all the information relating to Seller, Company or Purchaser, as the case may
be, and any of their respective Subsidiaries, which appear in any filing made
with, or written materials submitted to, any third party or any Governmental
Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In
exercising the foregoing right, each of the parties hereto shall act
reasonably and as promptly as practicable. The parties hereto agree that they
will consult with each other with respect to the obtaining of all permits,
consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties and Governmental
Entities necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and each party will keep the other apprised of the status of
matters relating to completion of the transactions contemplated herein.

  Each of Purchaser and Seller shall take all commercially reasonable actions to
resolve any objections that may be asserted by any Governmental Entity with
respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in this Agreement shall be
deemed to require Purchaser to take to any action, or commit to take any
action, or agree to any condition or restrictions, in connection with
obtaining the foregoing permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of
Governmental Entities or third parties that would reasonably be expected to
have a material adverse effect on the business, results of operations or
financial condition of the Business, the Company or Purchaser (measured on a
scale relative to the Business) following the Effective Time (a " _Materially
Burdensome_ _Regulatory Condition_ "); _provided_ that the parties agree that
any actions required to be taken by or conditions or restrictions imposed on
Purchaser in order to obtain such permits, consents, approvals or
authorizations of any Governmental Entity or third party shall not be
considered a Materially Burdensome Regulatory Condition to the extent such
actions, conditions or restrictions relate to Purchasers compliance with the
conditions in Section 3(d)(2) of the BHCA or in the Bank Merger Act relating
to the nationwide deposit cap and to any applicable state deposit caps.

 

(b) Purchaser and Seller shall, upon request, furnish each other with all
information concerning Purchaser, Seller, Company and their respective
Subsidiaries, directors, officers and shareholders and such other matters as
may be reasonably necessary in connection with any statement, filing, notice
or application made by or on behalf of Purchaser, Seller, Company or any of
their respective Subsidiaries to any Governmental Entity in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(c) Purchaser and Seller shall promptly advise each other upon receiving any
communication from any Governmental Entity or third party whose consent or
approval is required for consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement which causes such party to believe that there is a reasonable
likelihood that any Requisite Regulatory Approval or other consent or approval
will not be obtained or that the receipt of any such approval will be
materially delayed.

 

 6.2. _Access to Information_.

 

(a) Subject to the Confidentiality Agreement, Seller agrees to provide
Purchaser and Purchasers officers, directors, employees, accountants,
counsel, financial advisors, agents and other representatives (collectively,
the " _Purchaser Representatives_ "), from time to time prior to the Closing
Date or the termination of this Agreement, such information as Purchaser shall
reasonably request with respect to the Business, the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries and their respective businesses, financial conditions and
operations and such access to the properties and personnel of the Business,
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as Purchaser shall reasonably
request, which access shall occur during normal business hours and shall be
conducted in such manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the conduct of
the Business. Except as required by law, Purchaser will hold, and will cause
its officers, employees, accountants, counsel, financial advisors and other
representatives and Affiliates to hold, any nonpublic information of Seller
received from Seller or the Company, directly or indirectly, in accordance
with the Confidentiality Agreement.

  (b) Seller and Company shall not be required to provide access to or to
disclose information where such access or disclosure would violate or
prejudice the rights of customers, jeopardize the attorney-client or other
legal privilege of the institution in possession or control of such
information or contravene any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment, decree,
fiduciary duty or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of this
Agreement. The parties hereto will make appropriate substitute disclosure
arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding
sentence apply.

 

 6.3. _Public Disclosure_. Seller and Purchaser shall consult with each other before issuing any press release or otherwise making any public statement or making any other public (or non-confidential) disclosure (whether or not in response to an inquiry) regarding the terms of this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, and neither shall issue any such press release or make any such statement or disclosure without the prior approval of the other (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), except as may be required by law or the rules of any market or exchange on which the shares of Seller or Purchaser may be listed for trading, in which case the party proposing to issue such press release or make such public statement or disclosure shall consult with the other party before issuing such press release or making such public statement or disclosure.

 

 6.4. _Employees; Employee Benefit Matters_.

 

(a) Following the Closing Date, Purchaser shall maintain or cause to be
maintained employee benefit plans for the benefit of employees who are
actively employed by the Company and its Subsidiaries on the Closing Date ("
_Covered Employees_ ") which, in the aggregate, are generally substantially
comparable to those employee benefit plans that are made available to
similarly situated employees of Purchaser or its Subsidiaries (other than the
Company and its Subsidiaries), as applicable; provided, that in no event shall
any Covered Employee be eligible to participate in any closed or frozen plan
of Purchaser or its Subsidiaries; provided, further, that until such time as
Purchaser shall cause Covered Employees to participate in the benefit plans
that are made available to similarly situated employees of Purchaser or its
Subsidiaries (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries), a Covered
Employees continued participation in employee benefit plans of the Company
and its Subsidiaries shall be deemed to satisfy the foregoing provisions of
this sentence (it being understood that participation in the Purchaser plans
may commence at different times with respect to each Purchaser Plan).

 

(b) For purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting and benefit accruals
(except benefit accrual under any final average pay defined benefit pension
plan) under the employee benefit plans of Purchaser and its Subsidiaries
providing benefits to any Covered Employees after the Closing Date (the " _New
Plans_ "), each Covered Employee shall be credited with his or her years of
service with the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective
predecessors before the Closing Date, to the same extent as such Covered
Employee was entitled, before the Closing Date, to credit for such service
under any parallel Company Benefit Plan in which such Covered Employee
participated immediately prior to the Closing Date; provided that the
foregoing shall not apply to the extent that its application would result in a
duplication of benefits with respect to the same period of service or with
respect to any closed or frozen plan. In addition, for purposes of each New
Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any
Covered Employee, Purchaser shall use reasonable

  best efforts to cause all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-
work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such employee and his or
her covered dependents, unless such conditions would not have been waived
under the comparable Company Benefit Plan in which such employee participated
immediately prior to the Closing Date and Purchaser shall cause any eligible
expenses incurred by such employee and his or her covered dependents during
the portion of the plan year of the Company Benefit Plan ending on the date
such employees participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be taken
into account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible,
coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such employee
and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such
amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan.

 

(c) Prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall take all action necessary to
ensure that effective as of the Closing Date, (i) any employee or other
service provider who is employed by the Company or its Subsidiaries as of
immediately prior to the Closing Date but who primarily provides services to
or with respect to the business of (A) an Excluded Business or (B) Seller or
any of its Affiliates other than the Company and its Subsidiaries
(collectively, the " _Excluded Employees_ ") is transferred from the Company
and its Subsidiaries without any liability to the Company or its Subsidiaries
and (ii) any employee or other service provider who is employed by the Seller
or its Subsidiaries (other than the Company or its Subsidiaries) as of
immediately prior to the Closing Date but who primarily provides services to
or with respect to the Business is transferred to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. From the date hereof through the Closing Date, Seller will not
make any employment transfers that would result in a modification to whether a
particular service provider is classified as primarily providing services to
the Business.

 

(d) Pursuant to the terms of the Transition Services Agreement, the Company or
Purchaser, as applicable, will, at Sellers expense (and at cost), administer
the payroll and all HR administrative systems for Excluded Employees and all
other employees of Seller and its Affiliates who are located in the United
States or Canada and who participate in the employee benefit plans that are
administered through the Companys and its Subsidiaries payrolls and HR
administrative systems prior to the Closing Date (collectively " _Transitional
Participants_ ") and will, at Sellers expense (and at cost), provide employee
benefits coverage to Transitional Participants (for Transitional Participants
who are located in Canada, only payroll and HR administrative systems
services) that is consistent with such coverage provided to Covered Employees
under Section 6.4(a). Seller shall use reasonable best efforts to ensure that
the provision of such transitional services ends on or promptly following the
Closing Date, it being understood that to the extent that such services
continue following the Closing Date, such services will terminate no later
than the 60thday following the Closing Date and in no event shall any
Transitional Participants participate in any employee benefit plans of the
Company and its Subsidiaries following the Closing Date other than health and
welfare plans. Prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall take all actions
necessary, including the adoption of plan amendments to ensure that effective
as of the Closing Date, the participation of (i) the Excluded Employees and
(ii) any former employees or service providers who would be Excluded Employees
but for the fact that their employment or services were previously terminated
(the " _Former_ _Excluded Employees_") in any Company-Only Plans terminates
and all liabilities under such Plans in respect of the Excluded Employees and
the Former Excluded Employees shall be transferred to, and be the sole
responsibility of, Seller and its Affiliates (other than the Company and its

  Subsidiaries); provided that this sentence shall not apply to (i)
participation in respect of benefits accrued by Excluded Employees or Former
Excluded Employees in Company-Only Plans that are "qualified" under Section
401 of the Code and (ii) liabilities under Company-Only Plans that are
healthcare plans incurred by Excluded Employees prior to the Closing Date to
the extent fully accrued on the Closing Balance Sheet. For purposes of clause
(ii) a medical, dental, vision and/or prescription drug benefit shall be
considered incurred on the date when the services are rendered, the supplies
are provided or medication is prescribed, and not when the condition arose.

 

(e) For purposes of determining cash severance payments under the Buyer
severance plan applicable to Covered Employees whose employment terminates
prior to the first anniversary of the Closing Date, the cash severance
payments payable to such Covered Employees shall be determined in accordance
with the applicable cash severance formula used under the severance plan
applicable to the Company or the Subsidiary employing such Covered Employee
immediately prior to the Closing Date (which Company or Subsidiary severance
plan is set forth on Section 3.11(a) of the Disclosure Schedules and a copy of
which has been provided to Buyer).

 

(f) Prior to the Closing Date, the parties will mutually develop and agree to
the performance criteria to replace Company ROEC (return on economic capital)
currently used to measure payment entitlement under the Companys Long Term
Incentive Plan. Such replacement criteria shall preserve, to the extent
possible, the degree of incentive currently inhering in open performance
periods under the current practices of such plan. The Seller will use good
faith efforts to cause outstanding equity-based awards held by Covered
Employees to fully vest on the Closing Date.

 

(g) Nothing in this Section 6.4 shall be construed to limit the right of
Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries (including, following the Closing Date,
the Company and its Subsidiaries) to amend or terminate any Company Benefit
Plan or other employee benefit plan, to the extent such amendment or
termination is permitted by the terms of the applicable plan, nor shall
anything in this Section 6.4 be construed to require the Purchaser or any of
its Subsidiaries (including, following the Closing Date, the Company and its
Subsidiaries) to retain the employment of any particular Covered Employee for
any fixed period of time following the Closing Date.

 

(h) Without limiting the generality of Section 10.9, the provisions of this
Section 6.4 are solely for the benefit of the parties to this Agreement, and
no current or former employee, director or independent contractor or any other
individual associated therewith shall be regarded for any purpose as a third-
party beneficiary of the Agreement, and nothing herein shall be construed as
an amendment to any Company Benefit Plan or other employee benefit plan for
any purpose.

 

 6.5. _Nonsolicit of Employees_. Seller agrees that, commencing as of the date of this Agreement until the first anniversary of the Closing Date, without the prior written consent of Purchaser, neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates will (or will assist or encourage others to), directly or indirectly, solicit to hire (or cause or seek to cause to leave the employ of the Company or any Company Subsidiary or any of their successors) any officer or employee of the 

  Company or any Company Subsidiary as of the Closing Date; _provided_ that
Seller and its Affiliates shall not be in breach of this provision where an
employee is solicited by way of any general solicitation or advertisement not
targeted at employees of the Company, the Company Subsidiaries or the
Business; _provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing, in no
event during such three-year period shall Seller or any of its Affiliates hire
any Key Employee unless such person has not been an employee of the Company or
its Affiliates for at least six months. As used herein, " _Key Employee_ "
means any executive officer of the Company, any of the Companys department
heads.

 

 6.6. _Additional Agreements_. In case at any time after the Closing Date any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, the proper officers and directors of each party to this Agreement and their respective Subsidiaries shall take all such necessary action as may be reasonably requested by, and at the sole expense of, the requesting party.

 

 6.7. _Transition Services Agreement_. At the request of Purchaser or Seller, the parties will cooperate, including by entering into a customary transition services agreement, with respect to Seller or its applicable Affiliates providing or causing to be provided to the Company and its Subsidiaries or the Company and its Subsidiaries providing or causing to be provided to Seller and its Affiliates (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries) such transitional services for a transition period of 12-18 months as may be reasonable under the circumstances (other than payroll, employee benefit or other HR administrative services which shall be governed by the provisions of Section 6.4(d)) . Such services will be provided in a manner consistent with past practice and on commercially reasonable pricing terms; any incremental out-of-pocket costs or expenses of the party providing such services shall be borne by the party receiving the services.

 

 6.8. _Additional Agreements Regarding Tax Matters_.

 

(a) _Preparation and Filing of Tax Returns_.

 

(i) Purchaser will be responsible for preparing and filing (or causing the
preparation and filing of) all Tax Returns required to be filed after the
Closing. In the case of returns due for Pre-Closing Periods and Interim
Periods, Seller agrees to cooperate with Purchaser, in accordance with
Purchasers reasonable requests, in the preparation and filing of such Tax
Returns. Purchaser shall deliver drafts of any Income Tax Returns for any Pre-
Closing Period and any Interim Period, to the extent such Tax Returns reflect
a liability for Covered Taxes, together with supporting factual information
and workpapers to Seller no later than 30 days before the statutory deadlines
for filing the applicable Tax Return (as extended).

 

(ii) Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, all decisions relating to
the preparation of Tax Returns shall be made in the sole discretion of
Purchaser.

 

(b) _Payment of Taxes_. From and after the Closing Date:

 

(i) Purchaser will pay or cause to be paid all Taxes with respect to Tax
Returns which Purchaser is obligated to prepare and file or cause to be
prepared and filed pursuant to Section 6.8(a); _provided_ , _however_ , that
Seller hereby assumes and

  agrees to pay directly to or at the direction of Purchaser, at least three
days prior to the date payment (including estimated payment) thereof is due,
the amount, if any, of Covered Taxes reflected in such Tax Return.

 

(c) _Seller s Contest Rights Regarding Taxes_. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, Seller shall have the right (but
not the obligation) to control, defend, settle, compromise or prosecute in any
manner any audit, examination, investigation, hearing or other proceeding
(collectively, " _Tax Proceeding_ ") with respect to any Tax Return of the
Company and its Subsidiaries involving solely any Excluded Business or the
Specified Transfers; _provided_ , _however_ , Seller, without the consent of
Purchaser (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), shall
not settle, compromise or abandon any Tax Proceeding with respect to any
Excluded Business or the Specified Transfers if such action would reasonably
be expected to materially adversely affect the Purchaser, its Affiliates, or,
following the Closing Date, the Company or its Subsidiaries. In addition, (i)
Seller shall keep Purchaser duly informed of any such Tax Proceedings relating
to any Excluded Business or the Specified Transfers and (ii) Purchaser shall
be entitled to receive copies of all correspondence and documents relating to
such Tax Proceedings (other than any confidential or proprietary information
pertaining to Seller or any Excluded Business). If the Seller elects, in its
sole discretion, not to control and conduct any such Tax Proceeding, the
Seller shall, within 30 days of receipt of a written notice of the assertion
of any tax claim, notify the Purchaser in writing of its intention not to
control and conduct the Tax Proceeding in connection with such tax claim. In
such event, the Purchaser may control, or cause its designee to control, and
conduct such Tax Proceedings in such manner as it may deem appropriate.

 

(d) _Purchaser s Contest Rights Regarding Taxes_. Except as expressly
provided otherwise in Section 6.8(c), Purchaser shall have the sole right (but
not the obligation) to control, defend, settle, compromise, or prosecute in
any manner a Tax Proceeding with respect to any Tax Return of the Company and
its Subsidiaries; _provided_ , _however_ , Purchaser, without the consent of
Seller (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), shall not
settle, compromise or abandon any Tax Proceeding that could reasonably be
expected to give rise to a material claim by Purchaser for indemnification
under Section 9.4(a). In addition, (i) Purchaser shall keep Seller duly
informed of any Tax Proceeding related to any Excluded Business or the
Specified Transfers and (ii) Seller shall be entitled to receive copies of all
correspondence and documents relating to such Tax Proceeding (but, for these
purposes, excluding access to any financial and other confidential or
proprietary information pertaining to any member of Purchasers consolidated
group other than Company and its Subsidiaries).

 

(e) _Tax Sharing Agreements_. On the Closing Date, all Tax sharing agreements
and arrangements between (a) any of the Company and its Subsidiaries, on the
one hand, and (b) Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than any of the
Company and its Subsidiaries), on the other hand, will be terminated and have
no further effect for any taxable year or period (whether a past, present or
future year or period), and except as provided in Section 6.12(a) no
additional payments will be made thereunder on or after the Closing Date in
respect of a redetermination of Tax liabilities or otherwise.

 

(f) _Notification Requirements_. Purchaser shall, and shall cause Company to,
promptly (but in all events within 20 Business Days of receipt thereof)
forward to Seller all

  written notifications and other written communications from any Tax authority
received by Purchaser or the Company relating to any Excluded Business or the
Specified Transfers, and, subject to the provisions of Section 6.8(c),
Purchaser shall, and shall cause Company to, take such reasonable actions as
requested by Seller to enable Seller to take any action Seller deems
appropriate with respect to any proceedings relating thereto.

 

(g) _Cooperation_. Purchaser, Seller and Company shall each at their own
expense cooperate with each other and make available to each other such Tax
data and other information as may be reasonably required in connection with
(i) the preparation or filing of any Tax Return, election, consent or
certification, or any claim for refund, (ii) any determinations of liability
for Taxes, or (iii) any Tax Proceeding (" _Tax Data_ "). Such cooperation
shall include, without limitation, making their respective employees and
independent auditors reasonably available on a mutually convenient basis for
all reasonable purposes, including, without limitation, to sign Tax forms and
consents, to provide explanations and background information and to permit the
copying of books, records, schedules, workpapers, notices, revenue agent
reports, settlement or closing agreements and other documents containing the
Tax Data (" _T_ _ax_ _Documentation_ "). The Tax Data and the Tax
Documentation shall be retained until one year after the expiration of all
applicable statutes of limitations (including extensions thereof); _provided_
, _however_ , that in the event an audit, examination, investigation or other
proceeding has been instituted prior to the expiration of an applicable
statute of limitations, the Tax Data and Tax Documentation relating thereto
shall be retained until there is a final determination thereof (and the time
for any appeal has expired).

 

(h) _Carryforwards and Carrybacks; Amended Returns_. Purchaser will cause each
of the Company and its Subsidiaries to elect, where permitted by law, to carry
forward any net operating loss, net capital loss, charitable contribution or
other item arising after the Closing Date that could, in the absence of such
an election, be carried back to a taxable period of any of the Company and its
Subsidiaries ending on or before the Closing Date. To the extent such action
could reasonably be expected to adversely affect Sellers liability under
Section 9.4(a), neither Purchaser, the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
shall amend, or take any similar action with respect to any Tax Return filed
for any Pre-Closing Period or Interim Period without the prior written consent
of the Seller (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

 

(i) _Refunds_. Except as otherwise provided in the following sentence, Seller
will be entitled to retain, or receive prompt payment from Purchaser or any of
its Affiliates (including Company and its Subsidiaries) of any refund or
credit of Covered Taxes actually received by Purchaser. Provided Purchaser
complies with its obligation under Section 6.8(h), Purchaser will be entitled
to retain or receive any refund or credit of Taxes of the Company and its
Subsidiaries attributable to the carryback of any Tax attribute arising in a
taxable period that begins after the Closing Date to a taxable period that
ends on or before the Closing Date. Purchaser and the Company and its
Subsidiaries will be entitled to retain, or receive prompt payment from Seller
of, any refund or credit with respect to Taxes of the Company and its
Subsidiaries other than Covered Taxes. The amount of any refund or credit that
Purchaser or Seller is entitled to retain or receive pursuant to this Section
6.8(i) shall be reduced to take account of any Taxes incurred upon the receipt
of such refund or credit. All payments required

  to be made pursuant to this Section 6.8(i) shall be made within thirty days
after receipt or entitlement to the refund or credit by Seller, Purchaser, the
Company or its Subsidiaries.

 

(j) _Transfer Taxes_. All applicable sales and transfer Taxes and filing,
recording, registration, stamp, documentary and other similar Taxes and fees
imposed on the purchase and sale of the Company Common Stock pursuant to this
Agreement will be shared equally between Seller and Purchaser. The parties
shall cooperate in the preparation and filing of all Tax Returns relating to
such transfer taxes.

 

 6.9. _Post-Closing Confidentiality_.

 

(a) Following the Closing, the confidentiality obligations of Purchaser under
the Confidentiality Agreement with respect to information relating to the
Company, the Company Subsidiaries and the Business shall terminate.

 

(b) Following the Closing, Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates and
its and their officers, directors, employees, consultants, agents and advisors
to, keep confidential and not use for its benefit or for the benefit of any
other Person, any and all Company Confidential Information. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if Seller or its Affiliates or any of their respective
officers, directors, employees, consultants, agents or advisors (collectively,
" _Disclosing Party_ ") is requested or required (by oral questions,
interrogatories, requests for information or documents, subpoena, civil
investigative demand or similar process) to disclose any such information, the
Disclosing Party will provide Purchaser with notice of such request or
requirement as promptly as practicable (unless not permitted by applicable
law) so that such Purchaser may seek a protective order or other appropriate
remedy and/or waive compliance with the foregoing provisions of this
Agreement. The Disclosing Party will cooperate reasonably with Purchaser in
connection with Purchasers efforts to seek such an order or remedy. If
Purchaser does not obtain such protective order or other remedy, or Purchaser
waives the Disclosing Partys compliance with the provisions of this Section
6.9, the Disclosing Party will furnish only that portion of the applicable
confidential information that is legally required, and will exercise
reasonable efforts to obtain assurance that confidential treatment will be
accorded such disclosed information.

 

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company Confidential Information shall
not include information that (i) is or becomes generally available to the
public other than as a result of a disclosure by Seller or any of its
Affiliates or such other Persons in breach of this Agreement, or (ii) becomes
available to Seller after the Closing Date on a non-confidential basis from a
source other than the Company or a Company Subsidiary; _provided_ that such
source is not, after reasonable inquiry, known to be bound by a
confidentiality agreement or other contractual, legal or fiduciary obligation
with respect to such information.

 

(d) Seller acknowledges and agrees that due to the unique nature of the
Company Confidential Information, there can be no adequate remedy at law for
any breach of its obligations hereunder, that any such breach or threatened
breach may allow Seller, its Affiliates or third parties to unfairly compete
with the Purchaser or its Affiliates, resulting in irreparable harm to
Purchaser and its Affiliates, and therefore, that upon any such breach or any
threat thereof, Purchaser will be entitled to appropriate equitable and
injunctive relief from a court of

  competent jurisdiction without the necessity of proving actual loss, in
addition to whatever remedies either of them might have at law or equity.

 

 6.10. _Cooperation_. Following the Closing, each party agrees to cooperate in good faith to provide information to the other party that is reasonably necessary in connection with regulatory, legal, accounting and similar matters of Seller and its Affiliates on the one hand and Company and its Affiliates on the other (and not relating to any dispute, litigation or arbitration between the parties hereto or their Affiliates). The parties agree that any information provided pursuant to this provision shall be kept confidential and shall not be used for any purpose except for the reason given in the request.

 

 6.11. _Use of Name_.

 

(a) As soon as practicable and in any event no later than 30 days after the
Closing Date, Purchaser shall cause the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
to file amendments to their certificates of incorporation, articles of
association or other organizational documents with the applicable Governmental
Entities changing the names of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to
names that do not include the words "ABN AMRO" or any name confusingly or
misleadingly similar thereto. For the avoidance of doubt, Purchaser and its
Affiliates (including after the Closing, the Company and its Subsidiaries) may
use the name "ABN AMRO" and all other trademarks or tradenames owned or
licensed by Seller or its Affiliates (excluding the Company and its
Subsidiaries) and used in connection with the Business, the Company or any
Company Subsidiary as of the Closing on any materials distributed or available
to customers until the earlier of (i) six months after the Closing Date and
(ii) the exhaustion of inventory in existence as of the Closing Date, subject
to applicable law, in each case, in a mutually agreed transitional manner (it
being understood and agreed that the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not
actively market using such trademarks and tradenames). Thereafter, Purchaser
shall not, and shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries not to, use such
trademarks or tradenames, other than (i) in a neutral, non-trademark sense to
discuss the history of the Business, the Company or the Company Subsidiaries
or (ii) as required by applicable law.

 

(b) For the avoidance of doubt, from and after the Closing Date, Seller and
its Subsidiaries shall cease using and shall have no right in, to and under
the name "LaSalle" and any other Intellectual Property exclusively used by the
Business. The parties agree that any and all such rights shall be rights of
the Company and its Subsidiaries from and after the Closing Date. The parties
agree to cooperate and discuss in good faith appropriate arrangements relating
to the shared use, after Closing, of any Intellectual Property that is
currently used by both the Company and its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and
by Seller or its other Affiliates, on the other hand (such arrangements to be
on terms consistent with past practice).

 

 6.12. _Settlement of Intercompany Accounts; Termination of Intercompany Agreements;_ _Conversion of Certain Company Debt into Equity; Funding Subsidiaries_.

 

(a) Prior to the Closing, Seller shall cause $6.148 billion of intercompany
debt owed by the Company to Seller and/or any of its Affiliates (other than
the Company and its Subsidiaries) to be converted into Company Common Stock
(and Seller shall be entitled to take

  necessary actions in connection therewith, including amending its Certificate
of Incorporation), which shall be part of the shares of Company Common Stock
to be purchased by Purchaser pursuant to Article II.

 

(b) Between the date hereof and Closing, Seller and Purchaser shall discuss in
good faith and implement appropriate arrangements, on mutually acceptable
terms, to effect the repayment in full at Closing of all other intercompany
debt owed by the Company and/or its Subsidiaries to Seller and/or any of its
Affiliates (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries) as of the Closing;
_provided_ that if requested by Purchaser, Seller shall agree to delay the
repayment date of all or a portion of such debt for a reasonable period of
time not to exceed 180 days following the Closing Date (it being understood
and agreed that interest and other payments thereunder shall continue to
accrue and be payable in accordance with the terms thereof during such delay
period).

 

(c) Between the date hereof and Closing, Seller and Purchaser shall (i)
cooperate with one another to identify all derivative contracts outstanding
between Seller and/or any of its Affiliates (other than the Company and its
Subsidiaries), on the one hand, and the Company and/or its Subsidiaries, on
the other hand, and (ii) discuss in good faith and implement appropriate
arrangements, on mutually acceptable terms, to unwind such derivative
contracts at Closing, including any cash settlement associated with "mark to
market" in connection therewith. In addition, to the extent Seller and its
Affiliates (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries) are party to a "back
to back" derivative contract with third parties with respect to any such
derivative contract, at Purchasers request, Seller shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to assign, or cause to be assigned, such "back to back"
derivative contract to the Company.

 

(d) Seller and Purchaser shall cooperate in good faith to effect the transfer
to the Company or a Subsidiary thereof on mutually acceptable terms
immediately prior to the Closing, and as it relates to the portion owned by
the Business, without any net economic impact on the Company and without
triggering any gain or loss to the Company or its Subsidiaries, the ownership
interest in the real estate located at 135 South LaSalle, Chicago and at 540
West Madison, Chicago (The Plaza) currently held by Seller and/or any of its
Affiliates (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries).

 

(e) On or prior to the Closing Date and effective immediately prior to the
Closing, all other intercompany accounts between Seller and/or any of its
Affiliates (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries), on the one hand, and
the Company and/or its Subsidiaries, on the other hand, including intercompany
accounts arising by reason of any tax sharing agreement, shall be settled.
Intercompany accounts solely between and among the Company and its
Subsidiaries (other than any Excluded Business) shall not be affected by this
provision. Seller shall provide to Purchaser on the date hereof the details of
the intercompany subordinated notes between Seller and/or any of its
Affiliates (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries), on the one hand, and
the Company and/or its Subsidiaries, on the other hand. No later than two
weeks from the date hereof, Seller shall provide to Purchaser the details of
all other material intercompany accounts as of the date hereof between Seller
and/or any of its Affiliates (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries), on
the one hand, and the Company and/or its Subsidiaries, on the other hand.

  (f) Effective immediately prior to the Closing, all other contracts,
agreements and arrangements, including all obligations to provide goods,
services or other benefits, between Seller and/or any of its Subsidiaries
(other than the Company and its Subsidiaries), on the one hand, and the
Company and/or its Subsidiaries, on the other hand, shall be terminated
without any party having any continuing obligation to the other, except for
(i) this Agreement and (ii) any Transition Services Agreement.

 

(g) Seller and Purchaser shall cooperate with one another between the date
hereof and Closing (i) to identify any Funding Subsidiaries of Seller whose
purpose is to provide capital to the Company and its Subsidiaries and to
discuss in good faith and implement appropriate arrangements, on mutually
acceptable terms, to transfer such Funding Subsidiaries to the Company at
Closing and (ii) to identify any Funding Subsidiaries of the Company whose
purpose is to provide capital to the Seller and/or any of its Affiliates
(other than the Company and its Subsidiaries) and to discuss in good faith and
implement appropriate arrangements, on mutually acceptable terms, to transfer
such Funding Subsidiaries to Seller or an Affiliate thereof (other than the
Company and its Subsidiaries) at Closing. " _Funding Subsidiary_ " means, with
respect to an entity, a direct or indirect special purpose Subsidiary of that
entity that issues securities for capital purposes or an entity relating to
that capital structure.

 

(h) Seller shall take any actions as may be necessary to ensure that any
shares of preferred stock issued by the Company or its Subsidiaries
outstanding as of the Closing Date shall have no voting rights for a director
or otherwise (except for customary protective rights in the applicable
certificate of designations relating to dividend arrearages or adverse changes
in the terms to the preferred stock) and shall not become entitled to vote or
consent by reason of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.
In connection with the foregoing, notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, Seller shall be permitted to cause the Company to refinance, redeem
or defease all or a portion of such preferred stock, amend the terms of such
preferred stock (including any agreements on instruments relating thereto) or
take such other actions as are necessary or advisable; _provided_ that (i)
Seller shall hold the Company harmless for the effects of any less favorable
economic terms of any such refinancing and (ii) any such refinancing shall be
prepayable or redeemable at the option of the issuer within 90 days of Closing
without penalty

 

 6.13. _Specified Transfers_. Prior to the Closing, Seller shall effectuate the distribution of ABN AMRO WCS Holding Company by the Company to Seller or an Affiliate thereof (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries) (the " _Specified Transfers_ "). At the time of the distribution, ABN AMRO WCS Holding Company will directly or indirectly hold the remainder of the Excluded Business.

 

 6.14. _No Additional Representations_. Purchaser acknowledges that neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates is making any representation or warranty, express or implied, as to any financial or other matter with respect to Seller, Company or their respective Subsidiaries, except for the representations and warranties expressly set forth in Article III. Seller acknowledges that neither Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates is making any representation or warranty, express or implied, as to any financial or other matter with respect to Purchaser or its Subsidiaries, except for the representations and warranties expressly set forth in Article IV.

  6.15. _Director and Officer Indemnification_.

 

(a) Purchaser shall cause Company to indemnify, defend and hold harmless, the
present and former officers and directors of Company and each of Companys
Subsidiaries in their capacities as such (each a " _Company Indemnified Party_
") in accordance with the Certificate of Incorporation and bylaws, or other
charter documents, of Company and the respective Company Subsidiaries and any
agreements or plans maintained by Company and the respective Company
Subsidiary, to the fullest extent permitted thereunder and not prohibited by
law after the Closing Date against all losses, expenses, claims, damages and
liabilities arising out of actions or omissions occurring on or prior to the
Closing Date (other than the transactions contemplated hereby, and other than
any liability arising directly or indirectly out of the pending investigation
of Seller and its Subsidiaries by the U.S. Department of Justice or any U.S.
Attorneys Office, which liabilities shall be retained by Seller); _provided_
that in no event shall a "Company Indemnified Party" include any Person who is
or was employed or retained primarily by Seller or an Affiliate of Seller
(other than Company and its Subsidiaries) and not primarily employed or
retained by Company or its Subsidiaries, and Seller agrees that it shall
indemnify, defend and hold harmless such individuals to the same extent that
Purchaser is agreeing with respect to the Company Indemnified Parties.

 

(b) In the event following the Closing Purchaser or any of its successors or
assigns or Company or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with
or merges into any other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or
conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any person,
then, and in each such case, to the extent necessary, proper provision shall
be made so that the successors and assigns of Purchaser or Company, as
applicable, assume the obligations set forth in this section.

 

(c) The provisions of this Section 6.15 are intended to be for the benefit of,
and shall be enforceable by, each Company Indemnified Party and his or her
heirs and representatives.

TERMINATION AND AMENDMENT

 

 8.1. _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Closing Date:

 

(a) by mutual written consent of Seller and Purchaser;

 

(b) by either Seller or Purchaser, if the Closing shall not have occurred on
or before May 1, 2008 (the "Termination Date") ( _provided_ that the right to
terminate this Agreement under this Section 8.1(b) shall not be available to
any party whose action or failure to act has been the cause of or resulted in
the failure of the Closing to occur on or before such date and such action or
failure to act constitutes a breach of this Agreement);

 

(c) by either Seller or Purchaser, if any Requisite Regulatory Approval
required to be obtained pursuant to Section 7.1(a) has been denied by the
relevant Governmental Entity and such denial has become final and
nonappealable or any Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction shall have
issued a final, nonappealable injunction permanently enjoining or otherwise
prohibiting the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement;

 

(d) by Seller, if Purchaser has breached or is in breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of Purchaser
contained in this Agreement in any respect (disregarding for such purpose any
limitation or qualification as to materiality or Purchaser Material Adverse
Effect), which breach would, individually or together with all such other then
uncured breaches by Purchaser, constitute grounds for the condition set forth
in Section 7.3(a) or 7.3(b) not to be satisfied at the Closing Date and
Purchaser does not promptly use all commercially reasonable efforts to cure
such breach after written notice thereof to Purchaser or such breach would not
reasonably be expected to be covered prior to the Termination Date;

  (e) by Purchaser, if Seller has breached or is in breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of Seller
contained in this Agreement in any respect (disregarding for such purpose any
limitation or qualification as to materiality or Material Adverse Effect),
which breach would, individually or together with all such other then uncured
breaches by Seller, constitute grounds for the condition set forth in Section
7.2(a) or 7.2(b) not to be satisfied at the Closing Date and Seller does not
promptly use all commercially reasonable efforts to cure such breach after
written notice thereof to Seller or such breach would not reasonably be
expected to be cured prior to the Termination Date; or

 

(f) by Seller, at the end of the Matching Period set forth in Section
5.3(b)(iii) if the Alternative Acquisition Agreement has not terminated in
accordance with Section 5.3 and has not otherwise terminated; _provided_ that
the Seller shall, simultaneously with such termination, pay the Termination
Fee to Purchaser. " _Termination Fee_ " means an amount in cash equal to
U.S.$200,000,000 (two hundred million dollars), which shall be paid (when due
and owing) by wire transfer of immediately available funds denominated in U.S.
dollars to the account or accounts designated by the recipient. Seller
acknowledges that the agreement to pay the Termination Fee in the
circumstances set forth in this Section 8.1(f) is an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and that, without this Agreement,
Purchaser would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if Seller fails to
pay when due the Termination Fee, Purchaser shall be entitled to interest on
the Termination Fee at a rate per annum equal to the Prime Rate as published
in the _Wall Street Journal_ , Eastern Edition, in effect from time to time
during the period from the date that the such payment was required to be made
pursuant to this Agreement to the date of payment.

 

 8.2. _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this Agreement pursuant to this Article VIII, no party to this Agreement shall have any liability or further obligation hereunder to the other party hereto, except that (i) the last sentence of Section 6.2(a) (Access to Information), and Section 6.3 (Public Disclosure), Section 8.1 (Termination), Section 8.2 (Effect of Termination), Section 10.1 (Expenses), Section 10.2 (Notices) and Section 10.6 (Governing Law) shall survive any termination of this Agreement and (ii) notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, termination will not relieve a breaching party from liability for any willful and material breach of any provision of this Agreement.

 

 8.3. _Amendment_. Subject to compliance with applicable law, this Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto.

Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such party, but such extension or waiver or failure to insist on strict compliance with an obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure.

indemnify, defend and hold harmless the other party will terminate 30 days
after the expiration of all applicable statutes of limitations (giving effect
to any extensions thereof); _provided_ , _however_ , that such obligations to
indemnify, defend and hold harmless will not terminate with respect to any
individual item as to which an Indemnified Party shall have, before the
expiration of the applicable period, previously made a claim by delivering a
notice (stating in reasonable detail the basis of such claim) to the
applicable Indemnifying Party.

 

 9.5. _Indemnification Procedure_.

 

(a) Promptly after the incurrence of any Damages by the party seeking
indemnification hereunder (the " _Indemnified Party_ "), including any claim
by a third party described in Section 9.5(d) hereof, which might give rise to
indemnification hereunder or the discovery of any facts or circumstances that
the Indemnified Party reasonably believes may result in an indemnification
claim hereunder, the Indemnified Party shall deliver to the party from which
indemnification is sought (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") a certificate (the "
_Claim Certificate_ "), which Claim Certificate shall:

 

(i) state that the Indemnified Party has paid or properly accrued Damages, or
anticipates that it shall incur liability for Damages for which such
Indemnified Party may be entitled to indemnification pursuant to this
Agreement; and

  (ii) specify in reasonable detail each individual item of Damages included in
the amount so stated to the extent known, the date such item was paid or
properly accrued (if applicable), the basis for any anticipated liability and
the nature of the claim to which each such item is related and the computation
of the amount, if reasonably capable of computation, to which such Indemnified
Party claims to be entitled hereunder;

 

 _provided_ , _however_ , that the failure to deliver such Claim Certificate
shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder except
to the extent such failure shall have materially prejudiced the Indemnifying
Party.

 

(b) In case the Indemnifying Party shall object to the indemnification of an
Indemnified Party in respect of any claim or claims specified in any Claim
Certificate, the Indemnifying Party shall, within 20 Business Days after
receipt by the Indemnifying Party of such Claim Certificate, deliver to the
Indemnified Party a written notice to such effect and the Indemnifying Party
and the Indemnified Party shall, within the 20 Business Day period beginning
on the date of receipt by the Indemnified Party of such written objection,
attempt in good faith to agree upon the rights of the respective parties with
respect to each of such claims to which the Indemnifying Party shall have so
objected. If the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall succeed in
reaching agreement on their respective rights with respect to any of such
claims, the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall promptly
prepare and sign a memorandum setting forth such agreement. If the Indemnified
Party and the Indemnifying Party are unable to agree as to any particular item
or items or amount or amounts, then such disagreement shall be resolved
pursuant to judicial process set forth in Section 10.6.

 

(c) Claims for Damages specified in any Claim Certificate to which an
Indemnifying Party shall not object in writing within 20 Business Days of
receipt of such Claim Certificate, claims for Damages covered by a memorandum
of agreement of the nature described in Section 9.5(b) and claims for Damages
the validity and amount of which have been the subject of a judicial
determination pursuant to Section 10.6, are hereinafter referred to,
collectively, as " _Agreed Claims_." Within 15 Business Days of the
determination of the amount of any Agreed Claims, subject to the limitations
of this Article IX, the Indemnifying Party shall pay to the Indemnified Party
an amount equal to the Agreed Claim by cashiers check or wire transfer to the
bank account or accounts designated in writing by the Indemnified Party not
less than one Business Day prior to such payment.

 

(d) Promptly after the assertion by any third party of any claim against any
Indemnified Party that in the reasonable judgment of such Indemnified Party
may result in the incurrence by such Indemnified Party of Damages for which
such Indemnified Party would be entitled to indemnification pursuant to this
Agreement, such Indemnified Party shall deliver to the Indemnifying Party a
written notice describing in reasonable detail (to the extent known) such
claim and such Indemnifying Party may, at its option, assume the defense of
the Indemnified Party against such claim (including the employment of counsel,
who shall be reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Party) at such
Indemnifying Partys expense. Any failure on the part of the Indemnified Party
to provide prompt notice shall not limit any of the obligations of the
Indemnifying Party, except to the extent such failure materially prejudices
the defense of such claim. Any Indemnified Party shall have the right to
employ separate counsel in

  any such action or claim and to participate in the defense thereof, but the
fees and expenses of such counsel shall not be at the expense of the
Indemnifying Party; _provided_ that the Indemnifying Party shall be
responsible for the fees and expenses of the Indemnified Partys counsel in
any such action or claim if (i) the named parties to any such action
(including any impleaded parties) include both such Indemnified Party and the
Indemnifying Party and such Indemnified Party shall have been advised by
counsel that there may be one or more legal defenses available to the
Indemnified Party which are not available to, or the assertion of which would
be adverse to the interests of, the Indemnified Party or (ii) the Indemnified
Party shall have been advised in writing by counsel that the assumption of
such defense by the Indemnifying Party would be inappropriate due to an actual
or potential conflict of interest ( _provided_ that in the case of clause (i)
and (ii) the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for the fees and expenses
of more than one firm of counsel for all Indemnified Parties, other than local
counsel). In addition, the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to assume
control of the defense of any claim, and shall be responsible for the fees and
expenses of the Indemnified Partys counsel if the Indemnified Party shall
have failed, within 15 Business Days after having been notified by the
Indemnified Party of the existence of such claim as provided above, to assume
the defense of such claim or to notify the Indemnified Party in writing that
it shall assume the defense of such claim. No Indemnifying Party shall be
liable to indemnify any Indemnified Party for any settlement of any such
action or claim effected without the consent of the Indemnifying Party (not to
be unreasonably withheld), but if settled with the written consent of the
Indemnifying Party, or if there be a judgment for the plaintiff in any such
action, the Indemnifying Party shall indemnify and hold harmless each
Indemnified Party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such
settlement or judgment, subject to the limitations set forth in this Article
IX. If the Indemnifying Party shall assume the defense of any claim in
accordance with the provisions of this Section 9.5(d), the Indemnifying Party
shall obtain the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party before
entering into any settlement of such claim (not to be unreasonably withheld),
unless the settlement releases the Indemnified Party from all liabilities and
obligations with respect to such claim and does not impose injunctive or other
equitable relief against the Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Party and the
Indemnifying Party each agrees to fully cooperate in all matters covered by
this Section 9.5(d), including, as required, the furnishing of books and
records, personnel and witnesses and the execution of documents, in each case
as necessary for any defense of such third party claim and at no cost to the
other party (provided that any reasonable out-of-pockets expenses of the
Indemnified Party incurred in connection with the foregoing shall be
considered part of Damages hereunder). Anything in this Section 9.5(d) to the
contrary notwithstanding, the control of any Tax Proceeding and the procedures
related thereto shall be governed exclusively by Sections 6.8(c), 6.8(d) and
6.8(f) .

 

 9.6. _Certain Offsets; Tax Treatment of Payments_. For purposes of this Article IX, "Damages" shall be net of any insurance or other recoveries (net of any related deductible or expenses incurred in securing such recovery) actually received by the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates as a result of the liability or loss giving rise to the right of indemnification. In addition, any indemnification payment made pursuant to this Article IX shall be (i) reduced by the amount of any net Tax benefit actually realized by the Indemnified Party and (ii) increased by the amount of any Tax cost actually realized by the Indemnified Party solely as a result of the receipt or accrual of the indemnification payment. The parties agree to treat any payment 

  pursuant to this Article IX (other than any portion treated as interest) as an
adjustment to the purchase price for tax purposes.

 

 9.7. _Exclusive Remedy_. After the Closing Date, this Article IX shall provide the exclusive remedy for any of the matters addressed herein or other claims arising out of this Agreement, except in the case of common law fraud or with respect to matters for which the remedy of specific performance, injunctive relief or other non-monetary equitable remedies are available.

the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement or the
inclusion of any specific item in the Disclosure Schedule is not intended to
imply that such amounts or higher or lower amounts, or the items so included
or other items, are or are not material, and neither party shall use the fact

 10.4. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become effective when counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and delivered to the other parties, it being understood that all parties need not sign the same counterpart.

 

 10.5. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the Disclosure Schedules and other documents and the instruments referred to herein) constitutes the entire agreement and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof other than the Confidentiality Agreement.

 

 10.6. _Governing Law and Venue; Waiver of Jury Trial_.

 

(a) THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE DEEMED TO BE MADE IN, AND IN ALL RESPECTS SHALL BE
INTERPRETED, CONSTRUED AND GOVERNED BY AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAW OF, THE
STATE OF NEW YORK WITHOUT REGARD TO THE CONFLICT OF LAW PRINCIPLES THEREOF.

 

(b) The parties hereby (i) irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of
the Federal Courts of the United States of America located in the State of New
York (the " _Federal Courts_ "), or, if jurisdiction in the Federal Courts is
not available, the courts of the State of New York (the " _New York Courts_
"), in respect of any claim, dispute or controversy relating to or arising out
of the negotiation, interpretation or enforcement of this Agreement or any of
the documents referred to in this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby (any such claim being a " _Covered Claim_ "); (ii)
irrevocably agree to request that the Federal Courts (or, if jurisdiction in
the Federal Courts is not available, the New York Courts) adjudicate any
Covered Claim on an expedited basis and to cooperate with each other to assure
that an expedited resolution of any such dispute is achieved; (iii) waive, and
agree not to assert, as a defense in any action, suit or proceeding raising a
Covered Claim that any of the parties hereto is not subject to the personal
jurisdiction of the New York Courts or the Federal Courts or that such action,
suit or proceeding may not be brought or is not maintainable in said Courts or
that the venue thereof may be inappropriate or inconvenient or that this
Agreement or any such document may not be enforced in or by such Courts; and
(iv) irrevocably agree to abide by the

  rules of procedure applied by the Federal Courts or the New York Courts, as
the case may be, (including the procedures for expedited pre-trial discovery)
and waive any objection to any such procedure on the ground that such
procedure would not be permitted in the courts of some other jurisdiction or
would be contrary to the laws of some other jurisdiction. The parties further
agree that any Covered Claim has a significant connection with the United
States and the State of New York, and will not contend otherwise in any
proceeding in any court of any other jurisdiction. Each party represents that
it has agreed to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts and the New York
Courts in respect of Covered Claims after being fully and adequately advised
by legal counsel of its own choice concerning the procedures and law applied
in the Federal Courts and the New York Courts and has not relied on any
representation by any other party or its Affiliates, representatives or
advisors as to the content, scope, or effect of such procedures and law, and
will not contend otherwise in any proceeding in any court of any jurisdiction.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement shall limit the right
of Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates to commence or prosecute
any legal action against Seller or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates in
any court of competent jurisdiction in The Netherlands or elsewhere to enforce
the judgments and orders of the Federal Courts or the New York Courts.

 

(c) Each party hereby irrevocably agrees that it will not oppose, on any
ground, the recognition, enforcement, or exequatur in a Dutch or other court
of any judgment (including but not limited to a judgment requiring specific
performance) rendered by a Federal Court or New York Court in respect of a
Covered Claim.

 

(d) Seller hereby irrevocably designates the Corporation Trust Company (in
such capacity the " _Process Agent_ "), with an office at 1209 Orange Street,
City of Wilmington, county of Newcastle, Delaware 19801, as its designee,
appointee and agent to receive, for and on its behalf service of process in
such jurisdiction in any legal action or proceedings with respect to this
Agreement or any other agreement executed in connection with this Agreement,
and such service shall be deemed complete upon delivery thereof to the Process
Agent; _provided_ that, in the case of any such service upon the Process
Agent, the party effecting such service shall also deliver a copy thereof to
Seller. Seller shall take all such action as may be necessary to continue said
appointment in full force and effect or to appoint another agent so that
Seller will at all times have an agent for service of process for the above
purposes in New York, New York. In the event of the transfer of all or
substantially all of the assets and business of the Process Agent to any other
person or entity by consolidation, merger, sale of assets or otherwise, such
other person or entity shall be substituted hereunder for the Process Agent
with the same effect as if named herein in place of such Process Agent. Seller
further irrevocably consents to the service of process out of any of the
aforementioned courts in any such action or proceeding by the mailing of
copies thereof by registered airmail, postage prepaid, to such party at its
address set forth in this Agreement, such service of process to be effective
upon acknowledgment of receipt of such registered mail. Nothing herein shall
affect the right of any party to serve process in any other manner permitted
by applicable law. Seller expressly acknowledges that the foregoing waiver is
intended to be irrevocable under the laws of the State of New York and of the
United States of America.

 

(e) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES,
AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH

  PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY
HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
BY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT: (i) NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER; (ii) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS
AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER; (iii) EACH PARTY MAKES
THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY; AND (iv) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO
THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS
IN THIS SECTION 10.6.

 

 10.7. _Specific Performance_. The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any party fails to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and that the parties shall be entitled to specific performance in such event, in addition to any other remedy at law or in equity.

 

 10.8. _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement which is invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement in any other jurisdiction. If any provision of this Agreement is so broad as to be unenforceable, the provision shall be interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable.

 

 10.9. _Assignment; Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations shall be assigned by any of the parties hereto (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other parties; _provided_ , _however_ , that Purchaser may assign any of its rights under this Agreement to a wholly owned Subsidiary of Purchaser; _provided_ , _further_ , that no such assignment shall release Purchaser from any liability or obligation under this Agreement. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by and against the parties and their respective successors and assigns. Except for Section 6.15 which is for the benefit of the persons specified in Section 6.15(c) this Agreement (including the documents and instruments referred to herein) is not intended to confer upon any person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder.

 The U.S. Department of Justice or any U.S. Attorneys Office shall not, in
connection with the pending investigation of Seller or its Affiliates, have
taken any action against or entered into any settlement with Seller or any of
its Affiliates that shall impose any material restriction, condition or burden
on the Business, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or, after the Closing,
Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries. _EXHIBIT B_ : 
 SELLER KNOWLEDGE

Robert J. Moore

 

Larry D. Richman    _EXHIBIT C_ : 
 PURCHASE PRICE ADJUSTMENT 
--- 
 

 

  (1) No later than three Business Days prior to the date on which the
Closing is scheduled to occur, Seller shall deliver to Purchaser a good faith
estimate (the " _Estimated Net Income_ ") of the sum of (a) the net income
(loss) of the Company and its Subsidiaries, as adjusted as set forth in the
definition of Closing Net Income below, for the period commencing on April 1,
2007 and concluding at the close of business on the earlier to occur of the
Closing Date and December 31, 2007 (the " _Measurement Period_ "), and (b)
actual net income recorded for the three month period ended March 31, 2007.
Seller shall also deliver to Purchaser copies of all workpapers and other
documents used in the calculation of Estimated Net Income.

 

  (2) If Estimated Net Income is equal to or greater than the Income
Threshold, the Purchase Price shall not be adjusted. If Estimated Net Income
is less than the Income Threshold, the Purchase Price shall be decreased by
the amount of the shortfall. " _Income Threshold_ " means at any time the
amount equal to the sum of (a) the product of (x) $600 million and (y) a
fraction, the numerator of which is the number of calendar days that have
elapsed during the Measurement Period and the denominator of which is 274 and
(b) $270 million.

 

  (3) Seller shall engage Ernst and Young LLP ("EandY") to prepare and
deliver, and shall use reasonable efforts to cause EandY to prepare and deliver
as promptly as practicable, but not later than 90 days, after the Closing
Date, to the Seller an audited consolidated income statement of the Company
and its Subsidiaries for the period commencing on January 1, 2007 and ending
on the earlier of the Closing Date and December 31, 2007 prepared in
accordance with the accounting principles, policies, practices and
methodologies used in connection with the preparation of the Balance Sheet
(the " _Closing Income Statement_ "). All of the costs and expenses of such
audit shall be born in full by Purchaser. " _Closing Net Income_ " means the
net income (loss) of the Company and its Subsidiaries as shown on the Closing
Income Statement, as adjusted to exclude (a) any costs incurred by the Company
and its Subsidiaries pursuant to this Agreement ( _provided_ , _however_ ,
that all costs and expenses of the financial, legal and other advisors of the
Company and its Affiliates incurred by the Company or its Subsidiaries in
connection with this Agreement shall be included in the calculation of
Closing Net Income), and (b) any costs that are required to be indemnified
pursuant to Sections 9.2 or 9.4(a) (to avoid any duplication), and determined
as set forth in this Exhibit, but subject to the following clauses (4) and
(5). Seller shall upon receipt promptly provide a copy of the Closing Income
Statement and Seller's calculation of the Closing Net Income to Purchaser.

 

  (4) If Purchaser disagrees with Seller's calculation of Closing Net
Income, Purchaser may, within 30 days after Seller's delivery of the Closing
Income Statement, deliver a notice to Seller disagreeing with Seller's
calculation of Closing Net Income and which specifies Purchaser's calculation
of Closing Net Income and, in reasonable detail, Purchaser's grounds for such
disagreement. Any such notice of disagreement shall specify those items or
amounts as to which Purchaser disagrees, and Purchaser shall be deemed to have
agreed with all other items and amounts contained in the Closing Income
Statement and Seller's calculation of Closing Net Income.   (5) If a notice of disagreement shall be duly delivered pursuant to
clause (4) of this Exhibit, Purchaser and Seller shall, during the 15 days
following such delivery, use their reasonable best efforts to reach agreement
on the disputed items or amounts in order to determine Closing Net Income,
which amount shall not be less than the amount thereof shown in Seller's
calculation delivered pursuant to clause (3) of this Exhibit nor greater than
the amount thereof shown in Purchaser's calculation delivered pursuant to
clause (4) of this Exhibit. If Purchaser and Seller are unable to reach such
agreement during such period, they shall promptly thereafter cause an
agreed upon firm of independent accountants of nationally recognized standing
in the United States reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser and Seller (which
accountants shall not have any material relationship with Purchaser or
Seller), promptly to review this Agreement and the disputed items or amounts
for the purpose of calculating Closing Net Income. In making such calculation,
such independent accountants shall consider only those items or amounts in the
Closing Income Statement to which Seller has disagreed and that have not been
previously resolved by mutual agreement of Purchaser and Seller. Such
independent accountants shall deliver to Purchaser and Seller, as promptly as
practicable, a report setting forth such calculation. Such report shall be
final and binding upon Purchaser and Seller. The cost of such review and
report shall be shared equally by Purchaser and Seller.

 

  (6) Purchaser and Seller agree that they will, and agree to cause their
respective independent accountants and each of the Company and its
Subsidiaries to, cooperate and assist in the preparation of the Closing
Income Statement and in the conduct of the audits and reviews referred to in
this Exhibit, including the making available to the extent necessary of books,
records, work papers and personnel.

 

  (7) If Final Net Income is greater than the Income Threshold, and
Estimated Net Income is equal to or greater than the Income Threshold, no
payment shall be made. If Final Net Income is greater than the Income
Threshold and Estimated Net Income was less than the Income Threshold, Seller
shall be entitled to receive a payment from Purchaser equal to the difference
between the Income Threshold and Estimated Net Income. If Final Net Income is
less than the Income Threshold and Estimated Net Income is equal to or
greater than the Income Threshold, Purchaser shall be entitled to receive a
payment from Seller equal to the amount by which the Income Threshold exceeds
the Final Net Income. If Final Net Income is less than the Income Threshold
and Estimated Net Income is less than the Income Threshold, then (i) if Final
Net Income exceeds Estimated Net Income, Seller shall be entitled to receive a
payment from Purchaser equal to such excess and (ii) if Estimated Net Income
exceeds Final Net Income, Purchaser shall be entitled to payment from Seller
equal to such excess. " _Final Net Income_ " means the Closing Net Income (i)
as shown in Seller's calculation delivered pursuant to clause (3) of this
Exhibit, if no notice of disagreement with respect thereto is duly delivered
pursuant to clause (4) of this Exhibit; or (ii) if such a notice
of disagreement is delivered, (A) as agreed by Purchaser and Seller pursuant
to clause (5) of this Exhibit or (B), in the absence of such agreement, as
shown in the independent accountant's report setting forth the final and
binding calculation pursuant to clause (5) of this Exhibit; _provided_ that
in no event shall Final Net Income be greater than Seller's calculation of
Closing Net Income delivered pursuant to clause (3) of this Exhibit or less
than Purchaser's calculation of Closing Net Income delivered pursuant to
clause (4) of this Exhibit, plus, in each case, actual net income recorded for
the three month period ended March 31, 2007.   (8) Any payment pursuant to clause (7) of this Exhibit shall be made at
a mutually convenient time and place within 10 days after Final Net Income has
been determined by wire transfer of immediately available funds. Any payment
shall be made by wire transfer of same day funds to the account designated by
the party entitled to such payment, and shall be accompanied by interest on
such amount from and including the Closing Date to but excluding the date of
payment at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Effective Rate in effect from
time to time during the period from the Closing Date to the date of payment.
