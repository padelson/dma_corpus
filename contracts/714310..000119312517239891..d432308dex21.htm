2 THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of July 26, 2017 (this "
_Agreement_ "), is between Valley National Bancorp, a New Jersey corporation
and registered bank holding company (" _Valley_ "), and USAmeriBancorp, Inc.,
a Florida corporation and registered financial holding company (" _Bancorp_
").

RECITALS

 

Valley desires to acquire Bancorp, and Bancorps Board of Directors has
determined, based upon the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth, that
the acquisition is in the best interests of Bancorp and its shareholders. The
acquisition will be accomplished by merging Bancorp into Valley with Valley as
the surviving corporation and, at the same time, merging USAmeriBank, a
Florida state-chartered commercial bank (" _USAB_ ") and wholly owned
subsidiary of Bancorp, into Valley National Bank, a national banking
association (" _VNB_ ") and wholly owned subsidiary of Valley, with VNB as
the surviving bank, and Bancorp shareholders receiving the consideration
hereinafter set forth. It is the intention of the parties that the Merger (as
hereinafter defined), for federal income tax purposes, shall qualify as
a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ ").

 

As of the date hereof, the directors of Bancorp have entered into Voting
Agreements (the " _Voting Agreements_ ") in the form attached hereto as
_Exhibit B_.

NOW, THEREFORE, intending to be legally bound, the parties hereto agree as
follows:

ARTICLE I. - THE MERGER

 

1.1 The Merger. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at
the Effective Time (as hereafter defined), Bancorp shall be merged with and
into Valley (the " _Merger_ ") in accordance with the New Jersey Business
Corporation Act (the " _NJBCA_ ") and the Florida Business Corporation Act
(the " _FBCA_ ") and Valley shall be the surviving corporation (the "
_Surviving Corporation_ "). Immediately following the Effective Time, USAB
shall be merged with and into VNB as provided in Section 1.7 hereof.

1.2 Effect of the Merger. The Merger shall have the effects as set forth
in the NJBCA and the FBCA.

1.3 Certificate of Incorporation. The certificate of incorporation of
Valley as it exists immediately prior to the Effective Time shall not be
amended by the Merger, but shall continue as the certificate of incorporation
of the Surviving Corporation until otherwise amended as provided by law.

1.4 Bylaws. The bylaws of Valley as they exist immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall continue as the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until
otherwise amended as provided by law. 1.5 Directors and Officers. Subject to Section 5.20, the directors and
officers of Valley as of the Effective Time shall continue as the directors
and officers of the Surviving Corporation.

 

1.6 Closing Date, Closing and Effective Time. Unless a different date,
time and/or place are agreed to by the parties hereto, the closing of the
Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place at 10:00 a.m., at the offices of
Valley, 1455 Valley Road, Wayne, New Jersey, on a date (the " _Closing Date_
") which is the last day of the month which is five business days following
the last to occur of the receipt of all necessary regulatory and governmental
approvals and consents and the expiration of all statutory waiting periods
in respect thereof and the satisfaction or waiver of all of the conditions to
the consummation of the Merger specified in Article VI hereof (other than the
delivery of certificates, opinions and other instruments and documents to be
delivered at the Closing). Simultaneous with the Closing, Valley and Bancorp
shall cause to be filed a certificate of merger, in form and substance
satisfactory to Valley and Bancorp, with the Department of Treasury of the
State of New Jersey and the Florida Secretary of State (the " _Certificate of
Merger_ "). The Certificate of Merger shall specify as the " _Effective Time_
" of the Merger a date and time following the Closing agreed to by Valley and
Bancorp (which date and time the parties agree will be at 12:01 am on the
date following the Closing Date); provided, however, that the Effective Time
shall not occur prior to January 1, 2018.

 

1.7 The Bank Merger. Immediately following the Effective Time, USAB shall
be merged with and into VNB (the " _Bank Merger_ ") in accordance with the
provisions of the National Bank Act and, to the extent applicable, the
relevant banking statutes of the State of Florida (the " _Banking Law_ ") and
the regulations of the Florida Office of Financial Regulation (the " _OFR_ "),
and VNB shall be the surviving bank. The Bank Merger shall have the effects as
set forth in the National Bank Act and the Banking Law. Bancorp and Valley
shall cause the Boards of Directors of USAB and VNB, respectively, to approve
a separate merger agreement (the " _Bank Merger Agreement_ ") in substantially
the form of _Exhibit A_ , annexed hereto, and cause the Bank Merger Agreement
to be executed and delivered as soon as practicable following the date of
execution of this Agreement.

ARTICLE II. - CONVERSION OF BANCORP COMMON STOCK AND OPTIONS

2.1 Conversion of Bancorp Common Stock; Exchange Ratio; Cash in Lieu of
Fractional Shares; Bancorp Series C Preferred Stock.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, subject to the other provisions of this
Section 2.1 and Section 2.2, each share of common stock, $0.01 par value per
share, of Bancorp (" _Bancorp Common Stock_ ") issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Excluded Shares (as
hereinafter defined) and including all unvested restricted stock awards),
shall by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Bancorp,
Valley or the holder thereof, cease to be outstanding and shall be converted
into and become the right to receive that number of shares of common stock,
no par value, of Valley (" _Valley Common Stock_ ") equal to the Exchange
Ratio (as hereinafter defined) and the cash consideration which may be payable
under Section 2.1(b). No fractional shares of Valley Common Stock will be
issued, and in lieu thereof, each holder of Bancorp Common Stock who would
otherwise be entitled to a fractional interest of Valley Common Stock will
receive an amount in cash determined by multiplying such 

 



2  fractional interest by the Average Closing Price as defined below. For
purposes of this Section 2.1, the following terms shall have the following
meanings:

 

(A) " _Average Closing Price_ " shall mean the volume-weighted
average closing price of a share of Valley Common Stock on the New York Stock
Exchange for the thirty (30) consecutive Trading Days immediately preceding
the date which is five (5) Trading Days prior to the Closing Date, using
volume and closing price information as reported by Bloomberg Financial
Markets, or any successor thereto.

 

(B) " _Exchange Ratio_ " shall mean the following:

 

(1) If the Average Closing Price is between $11.50 and $13.00, the
Exchange Ratio shall be equal to 6.100;

(2) If the Average Closing Price is less than $11.50 but equal to
or greater than $11.00 the Exchange Ratio shall be $69.00 divided by the
Average Closing Price, rounded to three decimal places;

 

(3) If the Average Closing Price is greater than $13.00 but equal to or
less than $13.50 the Exchange Ratio shall be $79.30 divided by the Average
Closing Price, rounded to three decimal places;

 

(4) Subject to Section 7.1(k), if the Average Closing Price is less than
$11.00, the Exchange Ratio shall be $69.00 divided by the Average Closing
Price, rounded to three decimal places;

 

(5) Subject to Section 2.1(a)(B)(6) and Section 7.1(k), if the Average
Closing Price is greater than $13.50, the Exchange Ratio shall be $79.30
divided by the Average Closing Price, rounded to three decimal places;

 

(6) Subject to Section 7.1(k), in the event that at any time after the
date of this Agreement Valley has entered into a definitive acquisition
agreement whereby it has agreed to be acquired by a third party (a " _Valley
Acquisition Agreement_ ") and the Average Closing Price is in excess of
$13.50, the Exchange Ratio shall equal 5.874.

(C) " _Trading Day_ " shall mean a day for which a closing price of a
share of Valley Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange is reported by
Bloomberg Financial Markets, or any successor thereto.

 

(b) If Valley does not exercise its option to terminate the Agreement
under Section 7.1(k), and if the Average Closing Price is less than $11.50,
Valley shall have the right, in its sole discretion, in lieu of increasing the
Exchange Ratio, to pay cash for each share of Bancorp Common Stock in an
amount equal to the difference between (A) $69.00 and (B) the product of the
Average Closing Price times 6.100. In the event that Valley chooses this
option, the Exchange Ratio shall equal 6.100, provided, however, that Valley
shall not pay cash to the extent that such payment (together with any other
cash in lieu of fractional shares paid pursuant to this Section 2.1) would
result in the Merger failing to satisfy the continuity of interest requirement
applicable to reorganizations under Treas. Reg. Section 1.368-1(e) (using 40%
as

 



3  the minimum value of the proprietary interest in Bancorp that must be
preserved in the reorganization). In the event of any such reduced cash
payment, the Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted accordingly.

(c) At the Effective Time, all shares of Bancorp Common Stock held
by Bancorp in its treasury or owned by Valley or by any of Valleys
Subsidiaries (other than Dissenters Shares (as hereinafter defined) shares
held as trustee or in a fiduciary capacity and shares held as collateral on or
in lieu of a debt previously contracted) (" _Excluded Shares_ ") shall be
canceled and shall cease to exist and no Merger Consideration (as hereinafter
defined) shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

 

(d) On and after the Effective Time, holders of certificates which
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of
Bancorp Common Stock (the " _Certificates_ ") shall cease to have any rights
as shareholders of Bancorp, except the right to receive the consideration set
forth in this Section 2.1 for each such share held by them. The (i) Valley
Common Stock, (ii) the cash a Bancorp shareholder may receive under Section
2.1(b), and (iii) cash in lieu of fractional shares, which any one Bancorp
shareholder may receive pursuant to this Section 2.1 is referred to herein as
the " _Merger Consideration_ " and the total number of shares of Valley Common
Stock, plus any cash in lieu of fractional shares which all of
Bancorp shareholders are entitled to receive pursuant to this Section 2.1 is
referred to herein as the " _Aggregate Merger Consideration_ ".

 

(e) Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, if, during the
period from the date hereof to the Effective Time, the shares of Valley
Common Stock shall be changed into a different number or class of shares by
reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, split-up, combination,
exchange of shares or readjustment, or a stock dividend thereon shall be
declared with a record date within said period, appropriate adjustments shall
be made to the Exchange Ratio to provide the Bancorp shareholders with the
equivalent value of the Merger Consideration set forth in Section 2.1.

(f) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Valley
shall not pay for any shares of Bancorp Common Stock, the holders of which
have exercised their rights under FBCA Sections 607.1302-607.1333 ("
_Dissenters  Shares_"), and the holders thereof shall not be entitled
to receive any Merger Consideration; provided, that if appraisal rights under
FBCA Sections 607.1302-607.1333 with respect to any Dissenters Shares shall
have been effectively withdrawn or lost, such shares will thereupon cease to
be treated as Dissenters Shares and shall be converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Article II.

 

(g) At the Effective Time, subject to the delivery of the notice pursuant
to Section 5.12 hereof, Valley will either (i) convert each share of
outstanding Series C preferred stock, $0.01 per share par value, of Bancorp ("
_Bancorp Series C Preferred Stock_ ") to shares of preferred stock of Valley
having rights and preferences identical to the Bancorp Series C Preferred
Stock, or (ii) redeem the Bancorp Series C Preferred Stock in accordance with
its terms; provided, however, that the Registration Statement on Form S-4 to
be filed by Valley shall register the shares of Valley preferred stock that
may be exchanged for the shares of Bancorp Series C Preferred Stock.

 



4 2.2 Exchange of Shares.

 

(a) Bancorp and Valley hereby appoint American Stock Transfer and Trust
Company as the exchange agent (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") for purposes of
effecting the conversion of Bancorp Common Stock. Not later than five (5)
business days after the Effective Time, Valley shall cause the Exchange
Agent to mail to each holder of record of Bancorp Common Stock (other than
holders of Dissenters Shares) as of the Effective Time (a " _Record Holder_
") a letter of transmittal in a form mutually agreed upon by Valley and
Bancorp (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss
and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates to the Exchange Agent), and instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration as
provided in Section 2.1 hereof.

 

(b) Upon surrender of Certificates for exchange and cancellation to the
Exchange Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and
executed, the Record Holder shall be entitled to promptly receive in exchange
for such Certificates the Merger Consideration which such Record Holder has
the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.1 hereof. Certificates so
surrendered shall be canceled. As soon as practicable, but no later than five
(5) business days following receipt of the properly completed letter of
transmittal and any necessary accompanying documentation, Valley shall cause
the Exchange Agent to distribute the Merger Consideration. The Exchange Agent
shall not be obligated to deliver or cause to be delivered to any Record
Holder the consideration to which such Record Holder would otherwise be
entitled until such Record Holder surrenders the Certificates for exchange or,
in default thereof, an appropriate Affidavit of Loss and Indemnity Agreement
and bond in such reasonable amount as may be required in each case by
Valley. Notwithstanding the time of surrender of the Certificates, Record
Holders shall be deemed shareholders of Valley for all purposes from the
Effective Time, except that Valley shall withhold the payment of dividends
from any Record Holder until such Record Holder effects the exchange of
Certificates for Valley Common Stock. Such Record Holder shall receive such
withheld dividends, without interest, upon effecting the share exchange.

 

(c) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of Bancorp of the shares of Bancorp Common Stock or Bancorp
Preferred Stock which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
and, if any Certificates representing such shares are presented for transfer,
they shall be canceled and exchanged for the consideration as provided in
Section 2.1 hereof.

(d) If payment of the consideration pursuant to Section 2.1 hereof is to
be made in a name other than that in which the Certificates surrendered in
exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a condition of such payment that
the Certificates so surrendered shall be properly endorsed (or accompanied by
an appropriate instrument of transfer) and otherwise in proper form for
transfer, and that the person requesting such payment shall pay to the
Exchange Agent in advance any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of
the payment to a person other than that of the registered holder of the
Certificates surrendered, or required for any other reason, or shall establish
to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is
not payable.

 



5 (e) Valley and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to rely upon
Bancorps stock transfer books to establish the identity of those persons
entitled to receive the Merger Consideration, which books shall be conclusive
with respect thereto. In the event of a dispute with respect to ownership of
stock represented by any Certificate, Valley and the Exchange Agent shall be
entitled to deposit any Merger Consideration or dividends or distributions
thereon represented thereby in escrow with an independent third party and
thereafter be relieved with respect to any claims thereto.

(f) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, Valley shall deposit, or
shall cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent for the benefit of the
holders of Bancorp Common Stock, for exchange in accordance with this Section
2.2, certificates (or other electronic evidence) representing the shares of
Valley Common Stock to be issued to Bancorp shareholders as part of the
Aggregate Merger Consideration plus the cash in lieu of fractional shares of
Valley Common Stock.

 

2.3 Treatment of Bancorp Stock Options, Warrants and Restricted Stock
Units.  

(a) All options which may be exercised for issuance of Bancorp Common
Stock (each, a " _Bancorp Stock Option_ " and collectively the " _Bancorp
Stock Options_ ") are described in the _Bancorp Disclosure Schedule_ and are
issued and outstanding pursuant to the Bancorp stock plans described in the
_Bancorp Disclosure Schedule_ (collectively, the " _Bancorp Stock Plans_ ")
and the forms of agreements pursuant to which such Bancorp Stock Options were
granted (each, an " _Option Grant Agreement_ ").

(b) All warrants which may be exercised for issuance of Bancorp Common
Stock (each, a " _Bancorp Warrant_ " and collectively the " _Bancorp Warrants_
") are described in the _Bancorp Disclosure Schedule_ and are issued and
outstanding pursuant to the Bancorp warrant agreements described in the
_Bancorp Disclosure Schedule_ (collectively, the " _Bancorp Warrant
Agreements_ ").

 

(c) At the Effective Time, Valley shall assume and adopt each of the
Bancorp Stock Plans and all of the rights, powers, discretions, obligations
and duties of Bancorp thereunder, and each outstanding Bancorp Stock Option
granted to an eligible individual under any Bancorp Stock Plan shall vest only
to the extent set forth in the relevant Bancorp Stock Plan and Option Grant
Agreement, and be converted into an option to purchase Valley Common Stock (a
" _Valley Stock Option_ "), wherein (x) the number of shares of Valley Common
Stock subject to the Valley Stock Option shall be equal to the number of
shares of Bancorp Common Stock subject to the Bancorp Stock Option multiplied
by the Exchange Ratio (rounded down to the next whole share), and (y) the
exercise price per share of Valley Common Stock subject to the Valley Stock
Option shall be equal to the option exercise price per share of Bancorp Common
Stock subject to the Bancorp Stock Option that is being converted divided by
the Exchange Ratio (rounded up to the next whole cent) and (z) in all other
respects the Bancorp Stock Option shall be subject to the terms and conditions
of the applicable Bancorp Stock Plan and any stock option agreement or other
grant instrument evidencing such Bancorp Stock Option as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time and for any options which are
"incentive stock options" (as defined in Section 422 of the Code, the
adjustments shall be and are intended 

 



6  to be effected in a manner which is consistent with Section 424(a) of the
Code. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that Valley elects to pay
cash consideration pursuant to Section 2.1(b), for purposes of this Section
2.3(c), the Exchange Ratio shall be based on the total Merger Consideration so
that the Bancorp Stock Options are converted on economically equivalent terms
and in accordance with and to preserve the status of such Bancorp Stock
Options under Sections 409A, 422 and 424 of the Code as may be applicable.
Shares of Valley Common Stock issuable upon exercise of Stock Options shall be
covered by an effective registration statement on Form S-8 (or, to the extent
that Form S-8 is not available for such purpose, an effective registration
statement on Form S-3 or another available form), and Valley shall file a
registration statement on Form S-8 (or other available form) covering such
shares as soon as practicable, and in any event within five (5) business days,
after the Effective Time. Concurrently with, or as soon as practicable
following, the execution of this Agreement, Valley shall reserve, from its
authorized but unissued or treasury shares, a sufficient number of shares of
Valley Common Stock to provide for the shares issuable upon exercise of the
Valley Stock Options.

 

(d) At the Effective Time, Valley shall assume and adopt each of the
Bancorp Warrant Agreements and all of the rights, powers, discretions,
obligations and duties of Bancorp thereunder, and each outstanding Bancorp
Warrant shall be converted into a warrant to purchase Valley Common Stock (a "
_Valley Warrant_ "), wherein (x) the number of shares of Valley Common Stock
subject to the Valley Warrant shall be equal to the number of shares of
Bancorp Common Stock subject to the Bancorp Warrant multiplied by the Exchange
Ratio (rounded down to the next whole share) and (y) the exercise price per
share of Valley Common Stock subject to the Valley Warrant shall be equal to
the exercise price per share of Bancorp Common Stock subject to the Bancorp
Warrant that is being converted divided by the Exchange Ratio (rounded up to
the next whole cent) and (z) in all other respects the warrant shall be
subject to the terms and conditions of the applicable Bancorp Warrant.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that Valley elects to pay cash
consideration pursuant to Section 2.1(b), for purposes of this Section 2.3(d),
the Exchange Ratio shall be based on the total Merger Consideration so that
the Bancorp Warrants are converted on economically equivalent
terms. Concurrently with, or as soon as practicable following, the execution
of this Agreement, Valley shall reserve, from its authorized but unissued or
treasury shares, a sufficient number of shares of Valley Common Stock to
provide for the shares issuable upon exercise of the Valley Warrants.

(e) At or prior to the Effective Time, each unit (" _Bancorp Restricted
Stock Unit_ ") representing the right to receive a share of Bancorp Common
Stock under a Bancorp Stock Plan which is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time, shall, by virtue of this Agreement and without any action on
the part of the holder thereof, become vested only to the extent set forth
under the relevant Bancorp Stock Plan and award agreement for such Bancorp
Restricted Stock Unit and shall be converted into the right to receive, at
the Effective Time, and without duplication, the same consideration as holders
of Bancorp Common Stock are receiving in the Merger, provided, however, that
with respect to any Bancorp Restricted Stock Unit that constitutes
"deferred compensation" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code, such
conversion and settlement shall occur on the date that it would otherwise
occur under the applicable award agreement absent the application of this
Section 2.3(e) to the extent necessary to avoid the imposition of any penalty
or other Taxes under Section 409A of the Code. Any Bancorp Restricted Stock
Unit that does not so vest shall remain outstanding, subject to 

 



7  adjustment as provided under the relevant Bancorp Stock Plan and award
agreement for such Bancorp Restricted Stock Unit.

 

(f) At or prior to the Effective Time, Bancorp, the Bancorp Board of
Directors and the compensation committee of such board, as applicable, shall
adopt any resolutions and take any actions (including obtaining any employee
consents) that may be necessary to effectuate the provisions of this Section
2.3.

 

2.4 Valley Shares. The shares of Valley Common Stock outstanding at the
Effective Time shall not be affected by the Merger, but along with the
additional shares of Valley Common Stock to be issued as provided in Section
2.1 hereof, shall become the outstanding common stock of the Surviving
Corporation.

 

2.5 Tax Consequences. It is intended that the Merger shall constitute
a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and that
this Agreement shall constitute a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning
of Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-2(g).

organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State
of Florida. Bancorp has the corporate power and authority to own or lease all
of its properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being
conducted and is duly licensed or qualified to do business and in good
standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by
it or the character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased
by it makes such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the
failure to be so licensed or qualified or in good standing would not have, or
would not reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Bancorp. Bancorp is registered as a
financial holding company under The Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as
amended (the " _BHCA_ ").

 

(b) All of the Subsidiaries of Bancorp are listed in the _Bancorp

its business as it is now being conducted and is duly licensed or qualified to
do business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business
conducted by it or the character or location of the properties and assets
owned or leased by it makes such licensing or qualification necessary, except
where the failure of each of the foregoing would not have a Material Adverse
Effect on Bancorp. The _Bancorp Disclosure Schedule_ sets forth true and
complete copies of the certificate of incorporation, articles of association,
bylaws or other comparable formation and governing documents (together the "
_Bancorp Charter Documents_ ") of Bancorp, USAB and each Bancorp Significant
Subsidiary as in effect on the date hereof. Except as set forth in the
_Bancorp Disclosure Schedule_ , Bancorp does not own or control, directly or
indirectly, any equity interest in any corporation, company, association,

Furthermore, the IRS has issued a favorable determination or opinion

Reconciliation Act and (to the extent it mandates currently applicable
requirements) subsequent legislation, with respect to each of the Bancorp

could lead to the disqualification of any such plan).

 

(e) To Bancorps knowledge, except as disclosed on the _Bancorp

meaning of Section 4975 of the Code or Section 406 of ERISA, has occurred with

respect to each Bancorp Pension Plan and Bancorp Welfare Plan that is funded
wholly or partially through an insurance policy, there will be no liability of
Bancorp or any Bancorp Subsidiary under any such insurance policy
or ancillary agreement with respect to such insurance policy for any
retroactive rate adjustment, loss sharing arrangement or other actual or
contingent contractual liability arising wholly or partially out of events
occurring prior to or at the Effective Time.

(k) Except as may hereafter be expressly agreed to by Valley in writing
or as disclosed on the _Bancorp Disclosure Schedule_ , the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement in accordance with its terms will
not (i) entitle any current or former employee of Bancorp or any
Bancorp Subsidiary to severance pay, unemployment compensation or any similar
payment, or (ii) accelerate the time of payment, accelerate the vesting, or
increase the amount, of any compensation or benefits due to any current
employee or former employee under any Bancorp Pension Plan, Bancorp Welfare

(l) Except for the Bancorp Pension Plans and the Bancorp Welfare Plans,
and except as set forth on the _Bancorp Disclosure Schedule_ , Bancorp has no
deferred compensation agreements, understandings or obligations for payments

respect to the payment, funding or assignment of such policy. Such life
insurance policies comply, in all material respects, with state and federal
law, including, without limitation, ERISA, and the rules and regulations of
all applicable Governmental Entities. To Bancorps knowledge, neither Bancorp

group insurance policies issued by an insurer which has been found to be
insolvent or is in rehabilitation pursuant to a state proceeding.

 



18 (n) Except as set forth in the _Bancorp Disclosure Schedule_ , Bancorp
does not maintain any retirement plan for directors. The _Bancorp Disclosure

beneficiary or (ii) has agreed to reimburse or indemnify any employee, former
employee, director, former director or beneficiary for any of the interest
and Tax penalties specified in Section 409A of the Code that may be currently
due or payable in the future.

 

(p) Except as disclosed in the _Bancorp Disclosure Schedule_ or as would
not have a Material Adverse Effect on Bancorp, since January 1, 2014, neither
Bancorp nor any of its Subsidiaries have made any payments to employees which

Merger and the Bank Merger will not cause any payments to employees to not be
deductible thereunder.

 

(q) Other than as identified on the _Bancorp Disclosure Schedule_ ,
Bancorp maintains no split dollar life insurance for the benefit of any
executive. The _Bancorp Disclosure Schedule_ contains a copy of each split
dollar life insurance policy and the relevant releases for each person
previously a beneficiary or owner of all or a portion of such policies.

3.10 Reports. Except as set forth in the _Bancorp Disclosure Schedule_ ,
USAB has, since January 1, 2014, duly filed with the OFR and the FRB, and
Bancorp has duly filed with the FRB, in correct form all documentation
required to be filed under applicable laws and regulations, and if requested
by Valley, Bancorp promptly will deliver or make available to Valley accurate
and complete copies of such documentation. The _Bancorp Disclosure Schedule_
lists all examinations of USAB conducted by the OFR and the FRB, and all
examinations of Bancorp conducted by the FRB, since January 1, 2014 and the
dates of any responses thereto submitted by USAB and Bancorp, respectively.

shall require Bancorp to provide Valley with any confidential regulatory
supervisory information of Bancorp or USAB.

(a) Except as set forth in the _Bancorp Disclosure Schedule_ , each of
Bancorp and the Bancorp Subsidiaries (i) holds all licenses, franchises,
permits and authorizations necessary for the lawful conduct of its business,
except where the failure to hold such license, franchise, permit or
authorization would not, individually or in the aggregate, result in a
Material Adverse Effect on Bancorp, and (ii) has complied with and is not in
default in any respect under any, applicable law, statute, order, rule,
regulation, policy and/or guideline of any Governmental Entity relating to
Bancorp or any of its Subsidiaries, including, without limitation, consumer,
community and fair lending laws, other than where any non-compliance or
default would not reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate,
result in a Material Adverse Effect

 



19  on Bancorp and neither Bancorp nor any of the Bancorp Subsidiaries, since
January 1, 2014, has received written notice of such violation of any of the
above that has not been cured.

 

(b) Without limiting the foregoing, (i) USAB has complied in all material
respects with the Community Reinvestment Act (" _CRA_ ") and (ii) to

forth on the _Bancorp Disclosure Schedule_ , since January 1, 2014, no person
or group has adversely commented upon USABs CRA performance.

 

(c) To the knowledge of Bancorp, there is no reason why the granting of
any of the necessary permits, consents, approvals and authorizations by the
governmental bodies necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement would be denied or unduly delayed.

consistent with past practice). Each contract, arrangement, commitment or
understanding of the type described in this Section 3.12(a) or set forth in
the _Bancorp Disclosure Schedule_ , is referred to herein as a "
_Bancorp Contract_."

(b) Except as set forth in the _Bancorp Disclosure Schedule_ , (i) each
Bancorp Contract is valid and binding on Bancorp or its applicable Subsidiary
and in full force and effect, and, to the knowledge of Bancorp, is valid and
binding on the other parties thereto, (ii) Bancorp 

 



20  and each of its Subsidiaries and, to the knowledge of Bancorp, each of the
other parties thereto, has in all material respects performed all obligations
required to be performed by such party to date under each Bancorp Contract,
and (iii) no event or condition exists which constitutes or, after notice or
lapse of time or both, would constitute a material breach or default on the
part of Bancorp or any of its Subsidiaries or, to the knowledge of Bancorp,
any other party thereto, under any such Bancorp Contract, except, in each
case, where such invalidity, failure to be binding, failure to so perform or
breach or default, individually or in the aggregate, would not have
or reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Bancorp.

(c) The  _Bancorp Disclosure Schedule_ contains a schedule showing the
present value of the monetary amounts payable as of the date specified in such
schedule, whether individually or in the aggregate (including good faith
estimates of all amounts not subject to precise quantification as of the date
of this Agreement, such as Tax indemnification payments in respect of income

individually or in the aggregate) under Section 3.12(c) shall not constitute a
breach thereof.

3.13 Properties and Insurance.

 

(a) The _Bancorp Disclosure Schedule_ contains a complete list of all
real property owned (" _Bancorp Owned Real Property_ ") or leased by Bancorp
or any of its Subsidiaries, as other real estate owned (" _OREO_ ") or

pursuant to which Bancorp or any Bancorp Subsidiary occupies any real

Subsidiary under any of the Bancorp Leases.

improvements thereon are free from any material interior or exterior
structural defects. Neither Bancorp nor its Subsidiaries have received written

Bancorp Owned Real Property are in violation, in any material respect, of any
applicable laws. To Bancorps knowledge, the buildings, structures, fixtures
and improvements on each parcel of Bancorp Owned Real Property lie entirely
within the boundaries of such parcel of Bancorp Owned Real Property. Neither
Bancorp nor its Subsidiaries have received written notice that any portion of
Bancorp Properties or any building, structure, fixture or improvement thereon
is the subject of, or affected by, any condemnation, eminent domain or
inverse condemnation proceeding currently instituted or pending, and to the
knowledge of Bancorp, none of the foregoing are, or have been threatened to
be, the subject of, or affected by, any such proceeding. There are no persons
other than Bancorp and its Subsidiaries, or, to Bancorps knowledge as to
leased real property, the landlord (to the extent provided for in the relevant
Bancorp Lease), entitled to possession of the Bancorp Owned Real Property. To
Bancorps knowledge, all of the Bancorp Properties, and Bancorps and its

requirements of representations (x) and (y) above. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, with respect to periods prior to the acquisition of the

(a) Except as set forth on the _Valley Disclosure Schedule_ , each of
Valley and the Valley Subsidiaries (i) holds all licenses, franchises,

Except as set forth on the Valley Disclosure Schedule, since January 1, 2015,

(c) To the knowledge of Valley, there is no reason why the granting of

use of the Valley Properties.

4.16 SEC Documents; Other Reports; Internal and Disclosure Controls.

 

(a) Valley has filed all reports, schedules, registration statements and
other documents, together with amendments thereto, required to be filed with
the SEC since December 31, 2014 (the " _Valley SEC Reports_ "). As of their
respective dates of filing with the SEC (or, if amended or superseded by a
subsequent filing prior to the date hereof, as of the date of such subsequent
filing), the Valley SEC Reports complied, and each such Valley SEC Report
filed subsequent to the date hereof will comply, in all material respects with
the applicable requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "
_Securities Act_ "), the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank
Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and did not or will not, as the
case may be, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state
a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. There are no outstanding comments from, or unresolved issues
raised by, the SEC with respect to any of the Valley SEC Reports. None of
Valleys Significant Subsidiaries is required to file periodic reports with
the SEC pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act. No executive
officer of Valley has failed in any respect to make the certifications
required of him or her under Sections 302 or 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and

criticism or exception by any Governmental Entity with respect to any report,
registration or statement filed by, or relating to any examinations by any
such Governmental Entity of, Valley or any of its Subsidiaries.

 

(c) Valley and its Subsidiaries have devised and maintain a system of
internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
Valleys financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP.
Valley (A) has designed disclosure controls and procedures (within the
meaning of Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to ensure that
material information relating to Valley and its Subsidiaries is made known to
the management of Valley by others within those entities as appropriate to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the
certifications required by the Exchange Act with respect to the Valley SEC
Reports, and (B) has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation prior to
the date hereof, to Valleys auditors and the audit committee of Valleys
Board of Directors (1) any significant deficiencies in the design or operation
of internal controls which could adversely affect in any 

 



39  material respect Valleys ability to record, process, summarize and report
financial data and have identified for Valleys auditors any material
weaknesses in internal controls and (2) any fraud, whether or not material,
that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in
Valleys internal controls. Valleys management has completed an assessment of
the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting in
compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for
the year ended December 31, 2016, and such assessment concluded that such
controls were effective.

or claim, regarding the accounting or auditing practices, procedures,
methodologies or methods of Valley or any of its Subsidiaries or their
respective internal accounting controls including any material complaint,
allegation, assertion or claim that Valley or any of its Subsidiaries has
engaged in questionable accounting or auditing practices, and no attorney
representing Valley or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not employed by
Valley or any of its Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a material
violation of securities laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation by
Valley or any of its officers, directors, employees or agents to any member of

or both, would constitute a material breach or default on the part of Valley
or any of its Significant Subsidiaries or, to the knowledge of Valley, any
other party thereto, under any such Valley Contract, except, in each case,
where such invalidity, failure to be binding, failure to so perform or breach
or default, individually or in the aggregate, would not have or reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Valley.

(a) Except as set forth in the _Valley Disclosure Schedule_ , each
outstanding loan (including loans held for resale to investors but excluding

of the applicable investors) and with all applicable requirements of federal,
state and local laws, regulations and rules, except for such exceptions as

party (e.g., in connection with a merger or other acquisition) shall be made
only to the knowledge of Valley.

compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, except for such
exceptions as would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Valley.

of such date. Such schedule is accurate and complete in all material
respects.

the agreements pursuant to which Valley or any of its Significant Subsidiaries
has sold loans or pools of loans or participations in loans or pools of loans

on account of a payment default by the obligor on any such loan.

 

(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing representations or any other
representation contained in this Agreement, Valley makes no representation or
warranty as to the collectability of any of the Valley Loans as a result of

46 5.3 No Solicitation. (a) Except as expressly permitted by this Section
5.3, Bancorp and its Subsidiaries shall not, and Bancorp and its Subsidiaries
shall use their best efforts to cause their respective representatives not to
initiate, solicit or knowingly encourage or facilitate inquiries or proposals
with respect to, or engage in any negotiations concerning, or provide any
confidential or nonpublic information or data to, or have any discussions
with, any person relating to, any Acquisition Proposal (as hereinafter
defined); provided that in the event, prior to the time the approval of
Bancorps shareholders (" _Bancorp Shareholder Approval_ ") is obtained but
not after, (1) Bancorp receives, after the execution of this Agreement, an
unsolicited bona fide Acquisition Proposal from a person other than Valley,
and (2) the Bancorp Board of Directors concludes in good faith (A) that, after
consulting with its financial advisor, such Acquisition Proposal constitutes
a Superior Proposal (as hereinafter defined) or would reasonably be likely to
result in a Superior Proposal and (B) that, after considering the advice of
outside counsel, failure to take such actions would be inconsistent with
its fiduciary duties to Bancorps shareholders under applicable law, Bancorp
may, and may permit its Subsidiaries and its Subsidiaries representatives to,
furnish or cause to be furnished nonpublic information or data and participate
in negotiations or discussions with respect to such Acquisition Proposal;
provided, that prior to providing any nonpublic information permitted to be
provided pursuant to the foregoing proviso, it shall have entered into an
agreement with such third party on terms substantially similar to and no more
favorable to such third party than those contained in the Confidentiality
Agreement between Valley and Bancorp dated April 26, 2017 (the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ "), and any non-public information provided to
any person given access to nonpublic information shall have previously been
provided to Valley or shall be provided to Valley prior to or concurrently
with the time it is provided to such person. Bancorp will (A) immediately
cease and cause to be terminated any activities, discussions or negotiations
conducted before the date of this Agreement with any persons other than Valley
with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, (B) not terminate, waive, amend,
release or modify any provision of any confidentiality or standstill agreement
relating to any Acquisition Proposal to which it or any of its affiliates or
representatives is a party and (C) use its commercially reasonable efforts to
enforce any confidentiality or similar agreement relating to any Acquisition
Proposal.

 

(b) Neither the Bancorp Board of Directors nor any committee thereof
shall (i) (A) withdraw (or modify or qualify in any manner adverse to Valley)
or refuse to make the Bancorp Recommendation or (B) adopt, approve, recommend,
endorse or otherwise declare advisable the adoption of any Acquisition
Proposal, or (ii) cause or permit Bancorp or any of its Subsidiaries to enter
into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in
principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement, option agreement, joint
venture agreement, partnership agreement or other agreement constituting or
related to, or which is intended to or is reasonably likely to lead to, any
Acquisition Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement permitted by the
terms of Section 5.3(a) of this Agreement). Notwithstanding the foregoing,
prior to the date of the Bancorp Shareholders Meeting, the Bancorp Board of
Directors may take any of the actions specified in items (i) and (ii) of the
preceding sentence (a " _Bancorp Subsequent Determination_ ") after the
second (2nd) business day following Valleys receipt of a written notice (the
" _Notice of Superior Proposal_ ") from Bancorp (A) advising that the Bancorp
Board of Directors has decided that a bona fide unsolicited written
Acquisition Proposal that it received (that did not result from a breach of
this Section 5.3 or from an action by a representative of Bancorp or its
Subsidiaries that would have been such a breach if committed by Bancorp or
its Subsidiaries) constitutes a Superior Proposal (it being understood that
Bancorp

 



47  shall be required to deliver a new Notice of Superior Proposal in respect of
any revised Superior Proposal from such third party or its affiliates that
Bancorp proposes to accept), (B) specifying the material terms and conditions
of, and the identity of the party making, such Superior Proposal, and (C)
containing an unredacted copy of the relevant transactions agreements with the
party making such Superior Proposal, if, but only if, (X) Valley does not
make, after being provided with reasonable opportunity to negotiate with
Bancorp, within two (2) business days of receipt of a Notice of Superior
Proposal, a written offer that the Board of Directors of Bancorp determines,
in good faith after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial
advisors, results in the applicable Acquisition Proposal no longer being a
Superior Proposal, and (Y) the Bancorp Board of Directors
reasonably determines in good faith, after consultation with and having
considered the advice of outside legal counsel and its financial advisor, that
the failure to take such actions would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties to Bancorps shareholders under applicable law and that such
Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal and such Superior Proposal has
been made and has not been withdrawn and continues to be a Superior Proposal
after taking into account all adjustments to the terms of this Agreement that
are committed to in writing by Valley pursuant to this Section 5.3(b).

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the changing, qualifying or modifying of the
Bancorp Recommendation or the making of a Bancorp Subsequent Determination by
the Bancorp Board of Directors shall not change the approval of the Bancorp
Board of Directors for purposes of causing any takeover laws to be
inapplicable to this Agreement and the Voting Agreements and the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby, including the Merger.

 

(c) In addition to the obligations of Bancorp set forth in Sections
5.3(a) and (b) of this Agreement, in the event Bancorp or any of its
Subsidiaries or representatives receives (i) any Acquisition Proposal or (ii)
any request for non-public information or to engage in negotiations that the
Bancorp directors believe is reasonably likely to lead to or that
contemplates an Acquisition Proposal, Bancorp promptly (and in any event
within two business days of receipt) shall advise Valley in writing of the
existence of the matters described in this clause (i) or (ii), together with
the material terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal or request and
the identity of the person making any such Acquisition Proposal or request.
Bancorp shall keep Valley reasonably well informed in all material respects
of the status (including after the occurrence of any material amendment or
modification) of any such Acquisition Proposal or request. Without limiting
any of the foregoing, Bancorp shall promptly (and in any event within
two business days) notify Valley in writing if it determines to begin
providing non-public information or to engage in negotiations concerning an
Acquisition Proposal pursuant to Sections 5.3(a) or (b) of this Agreement and
shall in no event begin providing such information or engaging in such
discussions or negotiations prior to providing such notice.

 

(d) For purposes of this Agreement:

 

(i) " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means, other than the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, a tender or exchange offer to acquire 25% or
more of the voting power in Bancorp or any of its Subsidiaries, a proposal for
a merger, consolidation, or other business combination involving Bancorp or
any of its Subsidiaries or any other proposal or offer to acquire in any
manner 25% or more of the voting power in, or 25% or more of the business,
assets or deposits of, Bancorp or any of its Subsidiaries.

 



48 (ii) " _Superior Proposal_ " means an unsolicited bona fide written
Acquisition Proposal (with the percentages set forth in the definition of such
term changed from 25% to 50%) that the Bancorp Board of Directors concludes in
good faith to be more favorable from a financial point of view to its
shareholders than the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby
(including taking into account any adjustment to the terms and conditions
proposed by Valley in response to such proposal pursuant to Section 5.3(b) of
this Agreement or otherwise), (1) after receiving the advice of its financial
advisor (which shall be a nationally recognized investment banking firm), (2)
after taking into account the likelihood of consummation of such transaction
on the terms set forth therein (as compared to, and with due regard for, the
terms herein), and (3) after taking into account all legal (with the advice of
outside counsel), financial (including the financing terms of any such
proposal), regulatory and other aspects of such proposal and any other
relevant factors permitted under applicable law.

 

(e) Other than in connection with an Acquisition Proposal (which shall be
subject to Section 5.3(a) and 5.3(b), and shall not be subject to this
Section 5.3(e)), nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit or restrict
Bancorps Board of Directors from, prior to the receipt of the Bancorp
Shareholder Approval, effecting a Bancorp Subsequent Determination if
Bancorps Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with
Bancorps outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that the
failure of Bancorps Board of Directors to effect a Bancorp Subsequent
Determination would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable
law.

 

5.4 Current Information. During the period from the date of this
Agreement to the Effective Time, Bancorp will cause one or more of its
designated representatives to confer on a monthly or more frequent basis with
representatives of Valley regarding Bancorps business, operations,
properties, assets and financial condition and matters relating to the
completion of the transactions contemplated herein. Without limiting the
foregoing, Bancorp shall provide Valley, on a monthly basis, with (i)
financial statements, (ii) a list of securities purchased, (iii) monthly
advances, and (iv) a schedule of all new loans, leases, extensions of credit,
and renewal loans, leases and extensions of credit in excess of $1,000,000, or
any increase by $1,000,000 or more in any customers aggregate credit
outstanding or lease commitment (whether or not subject to prior approval
under Section 5.2(a)), and provide Valley with a copy of, and the opportunity
to discuss, the relevant documentation for any such loan, extension of credit,
lease, or renewal upon request. Notwithstanding any other provision contained
in this Agreement, neither Valley nor any Valley Subsidiary shall under any
circumstance be permitted to exercise control of Bancorp or any Bancorp
Subsidiary prior to the Effective Time. As soon as reasonably available, but
in no event more than forty-five (45) days after the end of each fiscal
quarter ending after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective
Time, Bancorp will deliver to Valley USABs call reports filed with the OFR
and the FRB.

5.5 Access to Properties and Records; Confidentiality.

(a) On reasonable advance notice, Bancorp and USAB shall permit Valley
and its representatives, and Valley and VNB shall permit Bancorp and its
representatives, accompanied by an officer of the respective party, reasonable
access during normal business hours to their respective properties, and shall
make available to Valley and its representatives or

 



49  Bancorp and its representatives as the case may be, all books, papers and
records relating to their respective assets, stock ownership, properties,
operations, obligations and liabilities, including, but not limited to, all
books of account (including the general ledger), Tax records, minute books of
directors and shareholders meetings, charter documents, material contracts
and agreements, filings with any regulatory authority, independent auditors
work papers (subject to the receipt by such auditors of a standard access
representation letter), litigation files, plans affecting employees, and any
other business activities or prospects in which Valley and its
representatives or Bancorp and its representatives may have a reasonable
interest. Neither party shall be required to provide access to or to disclose
information where such access or disclosure would violate or prejudice the
rights of any customer, violate the terms of any contract, jeopardize
attorney-client privilege or contravene any law, rule, regulation, order or
judgment. The parties will make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements
under circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding sentence
apply. Bancorp acknowledges that Valley may be involved in discussions
concerning potential acquisitions of banks and other entities and Valley shall
not be obligated to disclose such information to Bancorp except as such
information is publicly disclosed by Valley.

(b) Each party will hold any information that is confidential,
proprietary or otherwise non-public in accordance with the Confidentiality
Agreement.

 

5.6 Regulatory Matters.

Valley Shareholders Meeting (each as defined in Section 5.7) and qualifying

Proxy Statement-Prospectus_ " and the various documents to be filed by Valley
under the Securities Act with the SEC to register the Valley Common Stock for

at any time prior to the Effective Time, any information provided by such
party in the Joint Proxy Statement-Prospectus or Registration Statement
becomes incorrect or incomplete in any material respect and promptly to
provide the information needed to correct such inaccuracy or omission. Each
party shall promptly furnish to the other party such supplemental information
as

 



50  may be necessary in order to cause the Joint Proxy Statement-Prospectus or
Registration Statement to comply with Section 5.6(a) hereof. The information
relating to a party to be provided for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in the Joint Proxy Statement-Prospectus or Registration Statement,
any filing pursuant to Rule 165 or Rule 425 under the Securities Act, or in
any other document filed with any other Governmental Entity in connection
herewith, will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances in which they are made, not misleading.

 

(c) Valley shall as promptly as practicable make such filings, if any, as
are necessary in connection with the offering of the Valley Common Stock with
applicable state securities agencies and shall use all reasonable efforts to
qualify the offering of such stock under applicable state securities laws at

such information regarding Bancorp shareholders as Valley requires to enable
it to determine what filings are required hereunder. Bancorp authorizes Valley

Statement-Prospectus. Valley shall furnish Bancorps counsel with copies of
all such filings and keep Bancorp advised of the status thereof. Valley shall
promptly notify Bancorp of all communications, oral or written, with the SEC
concerning the Registration Statement and the Joint Proxy Statement-
Prospectus.

 

(d) Valley shall cause the Valley Common Stock issuable pursuant to the
Merger (including shares of Valley Common Stock to be reserved for issuance

(e) The parties hereto will cooperate with each other and use all
reasonable efforts to prepare all necessary documentation, to effect all
necessary filings and to obtain all necessary permits, consents, approvals and
authorizations of all third parties and governmental bodies necessary to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as soon as
possible, including, without limitation, those required by the OCC, the FRB,
the OFR and the Florida Department of State. The parties shall each have the
right to review in advance and comment on all information relating to the
other, as the case may be, which appears in any filing made with, or written
material submitted to, any third party or governmental body in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Valley and VNB shall use
their best efforts to cause their applications to the OCC and the FRB to be
filed within sixty (60) days of the date of this Agreement. Bancorp shall
cooperate with Valley to provide all information requested in writing by
Valley to complete such application within ten (10) days of request from
Valley. Valley shall provide to Bancorp drafts of all filings and applications
referred to in this Section 5.6(e) and shall give Bancorp the opportunity to
comment thereon prior to their filing.

(f) Each of the parties will promptly furnish each other with copies
of written communications received by them or any of their respective
Subsidiaries from, or delivered by any of the foregoing to, any Governmental
Entity in respect of the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

(g) Between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, Bancorp
shall cooperate with Valley to reasonably conform Bancorps policies and
procedures regarding

 



51  applicable regulatory matters, to those of Valley as Valley may reasonably
identify to Bancorp from time to time.

 

(h) Bancorp acknowledges that Valley intends to engage in a public
offering of its securities shortly after the date of this Agreement. Bancorp
agrees to (i) provide Valley with certain financial and other information
reasonably requested by Valley in order to fulfill Valleys disclosure
obligations in connection with such public offering, and (ii) cause its
accountants, at Valleys sole cost and expense, to reasonably cooperate in
connection with such public offering, including, without limitation, the
delivery of a "cold comfort" letter to Valleys underwriters.

5.7 Approval of Shareholders.

 

(a) The Bancorp Board of Directors will, subject to the qualification set
forth in Section 5.3(b) hereof, take all steps necessary to duly call, give
notice of, convene and hold a meeting of the shareholders of Bancorp (such
meeting or any adjournment thereof, the " _Bancorp Shareholders Meeting_ ")
for the purpose of securing the approval of the shareholders of Bancorp of
the Merger and this Agreement and use its commercially reasonable best efforts
to obtain, as promptly as practicable, such approval. Bancorp and Valley will
cooperate with respect to each of the foregoing matters. Contemporaneously
with the execution of this Agreement, Bancorp shall cause each of the
directors of Bancorp in their capacity as shareholders to execute and deliver
to Valley a Voting Agreement.

 

(b) The Valley Board of Directors shall (i) take all steps necessary to
duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of the shareholders of
Valley (such meeting or any adjournment thereof, the " _Valley Shareholders
Meeting_ ") for the purpose of securing the approval of the shareholders of
Valley of the issuance of shares of Valley Common Stock in connection with
the Merger and this Agreement and use its commercially reasonable best efforts
to obtain, as promptly as practicable, such approval and (ii) recommend to the
shareholders of Valley the approval of such stock issuance. Bancorp and
Valley will cooperate with respect to each of the foregoing matters.

 

5.8 Further Assurances. Subject to the terms and conditions herein
provided, each of the parties hereto agrees to use its commercially
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do,
or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under
applicable laws and regulations to satisfy the conditions to the Closing and
to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including, without limitation, using reasonable efforts to lift or
rescind any injunction or restraining order or other order
adversely affecting the ability of the parties to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and using its best efforts to prevent the
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of such party
contained or referred to in this Agreement and to promptly remedy the same.
In case at any time after the Effective Time any further action is necessary
or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, the proper officers
and directors of each party to this Agreement shall take all such necessary
action. Nothing in this section shall be construed to require any party to
participate in any threatened or actual legal, administrative or other
proceedings (other than proceedings, actions or investigations to which it
is otherwise a party or subject or threatened to be made a party or

 



52  subject) in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement unless such party shall consent in advance and
in writing to such participation and the other party agrees to reimburse and
indemnify such party for and against any and all costs and damages related
thereto.

 

5.9 Public Announcements. Bancorp and Valley will consult with each other
before issuing, and will cooperate with each other in the development and
distribution of, all press releases and any other public disclosure with
respect to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby and
will not issue any press release or written statement for general circulation
relating to the transactions contemplated hereby or make any such public
statements without the prior consent of the other party, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld; _provided, however_ , that a party may, without
the prior consent of the other party (but after consultation with the other
party), issue such press release or public statements as may be required by
applicable law or the rules and regulations of any stock exchange.

5.10 Failure to Fulfill Conditions. In the event that Valley or
Bancorp determines that a material condition to its obligation to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby cannot be fulfilled on or prior to June
30, 2018 (the " _Cutoff Date_ ") and that it will not waive that condition,
it will promptly notify the other party. Bancorp and Valley will promptly
inform the other of any facts applicable to Bancorp or Valley, respectively,
or their respective directors or officers, that would be likely to prevent or
materially delay approval of the Merger by any Governmental Entity or which
would otherwise prevent or materially delay completion of the Merger.

 

5.11 Disclosure Delivery and Disclosure Supplements. From time to time
prior to the Effective Time, each party hereto will promptly supplement or
amend (by written notice to the other) its respective disclosure schedules
delivered pursuant hereto with respect to any matter hereafter arising which,
if existing, occurring or known at the date of this Agreement, would have
been required to be set forth or described in such schedules or which is
necessary to correct any information in such schedules which has been rendered
materially inaccurate thereby. If the disclosure contained in any such
supplement (i) relates to events occurring before the execution of this
Agreement or (ii) alone or together with other supplements or amendments
materially adversely affects the representation to which the amendment or
supplement relates, the party receiving the amendment or supplement may
determine not to accept it as a modification of the relevant representation.
Notice of such determination, if made, shall be given by the receiving party
to the other party not later than ten (10) days after it received the
disclosure in question. If such notice is not timely given, or if the
disclosure in question did not contain any matter of the nature specified in
clause (i) or (ii) of the second preceding sentence, the relevant
representation shall be deemed modified by the disclosure in the amendment or
supplement with the same effect as though that disclosure had been included in
the relevant disclosure schedule as furnished prior to execution of this
Agreement.

5.12 Series C Preferred Stock. If requested by Valley, Bancorp
shall provide notice of the redemption of the Bancorp Series C Preferred
Stock as a result of the Merger to each holder thereof in accordance with the
terms and conditions of the Bancorp Charter Documents to permit Valley to
redeem the Series C Preferred Stock on the day of the Effective Time.

 



53 5.13 Indemnification.

 

(a) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, to the fullest
extent permitted by law, Valley shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless
each person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date hereof or
who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director or officer of Bancorp or
its Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Bancorp Indemnitees_ ") against any
and all claims, damages, liabilities, losses, costs, charges, expenses
(including, without limitation, reasonable costs of investigation, and the
reasonable fees and disbursements of legal counsel and other advisers and
experts as incurred), judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid in
settlement, asserted against, incurred by or imposed upon any Bancorp
Indemnitee (" _Costs_ ") by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a
director or officer of Bancorp or its Subsidiaries, acted as a director or
officer of a third party at the request of Bancorp or its Subsidiaries or
acted as a benefits plan fiduciary, in connection with, arising out of or
relating to any threatened, pending or completed claim, action, suit or
proceeding (whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative) (each a
" _Claim_ " and collectively, " _Claims_ "), including without limitation any
Claim which is based upon, arises out of or in any way relates to the Merger,
this Agreement, any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the
Bancorp Indemnitees service as a member of the Board of Directors of Bancorp
or any of its Subsidiaries or any committee thereof, the events leading up to
the execution of this Agreement, any statement, announcement, recommendation
or solicitation made in connection therewith or related thereto and any breach
of any duty in connection with any of the foregoing, in each case to the
fullest extent which Bancorp or any of its Subsidiaries, as applicable, would
have been permitted under any applicable law and the Bancorp Charter Documents
had the Merger not occurred (and Valley shall also advance expenses as
incurred to the fullest extent so permitted); _provided, however_ , that all
rights to indemnification in respect of any Claim asserted or made within such
six year period shall continue until the final disposition of such Claim.

(b) From and after the Effective Time, Valley shall assume and honor any
obligation of Bancorp immediately prior to the Effective Time with respect to
the indemnification of the Bancorp Indemnitees arising out of the Bancorp
Charter Documents of Bancorp or arising out of any written indemnification
agreements between Bancorp and such persons disclosed in the _Bancorp
Disclosure Schedule_ , as if such obligations were pursuant to a contract or
arrangement between Valley and such Bancorp Indemnitees.

 

(c) In the event Valley or any of its successors or assigns (i)
reorganizes or consolidates with or merges into or enters into another
business combination transaction with any other person or entity and is not
the resulting, continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation, merger or transaction, or (ii) liquidates, dissolves or
transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any person
or entity, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that
the successors and assigns of Valley assume the obligations set forth in this
Section 5.13.

(d) Valley shall cause Bancorps and USABs officers and directors to be
covered, for a period of six years after the Effective Time, at Valleys
option, under (i) Valleys then current officers and directors liability
insurance policy (providing substantially similar coverage to Bancorps and
USABs officers and directors as such officers and directors had under
Bancorps existing policy), or (ii) an extension of Bancorps existing
officers and directors liability insurance

 



54  policy. However, Valley shall only be required to insure such persons upon
terms and for coverages substantially similar to Bancorps existing officers
and directors liability insurance, and if such coverage over a six year
period would in the aggregate cost more than 300% of the annual premium
currently paid by Bancorp for such coverage, then Valley shall be required
only to obtain such coverage as may be obtained by an expenditure equal to
300% of the annual premium currently paid by Bancorp for such coverage.

 

(e) Any Bancorp Indemnitee wishing to claim indemnification under this
Section 5.13 shall promptly notify Valley upon learning of any Claim, but the
failure to so notify shall not relieve Valley of any liability it may have to
such Bancorp Indemnitee if such failure does not materially prejudice Valley.

 

5.14 Employment and Director Matters; Other Post-Closing Items.

 

(a) Except as otherwise set forth in the _Bancorp Disclosure Schedule_ ,
Valley and VNB hereby expressly agree to honor, effective from and after the
Effective Time, each of the agreements entered into by Bancorps executives on
the date hereof and identified on the _Bancorp Disclosure Schedule_ and each
of the Bancorp Pension Plans, Bancorp Welfare Plans and Bancorp Benefit Plans
as in effect as of the Effective Time, each in accordance with their
respective terms.

 

(b) Before or following consummation of the Merger, Valley will decide
whether to continue each of the Bancorp Pension Plans and/or the Bancorp
Welfare Plans for the benefit of employees of USAB and Bancorp, or to have
such employees become covered under a Valley pension and/or welfare plan in
accordance with the terms of the relevant Valley pension and/or welfare
plans. Subject to the foregoing, within two (2) years following consummation
of the Merger, Valley shall make available to all employees and officers of
Bancorp who become employed by VNB coverage under the benefit plans generally
available to VNBs employees and officers (including pension and health and
hospitalization) on the terms and conditions available to VNBs employees and
officers in Valley or VNB medical and dental plans for Bancorp employees and
their dependents. No prior existing condition limitation not currently imposed
by Bancorp or USAB medical or dental plans shall be imposed with respect to
Valleys or VNBs medical and dental plans on Bancorp or USAB employees.
Bancorp and USAB employees shall receive credit for any deductibles paid under
Bancorps and USABs existing medical and dental plans. Bancorp employees will
be given credit for eligibility and vesting purposes (but not for benefit
accrual purposes) under Valleys or VNBs medical, life, vacation, sick leave,
disability and other welfare plans for prior service with Bancorp, and
Bancorps and USABs employees will be granted credit for such prior service
with Bancorp, solely for purposes of eligibility and vesting under Valleys or
VNBs 401(k) plan. No Bancorp employee will be given credit for prior service
under Valleys or VNBs Pension Plan for any purpose.

 

(c) Valley will use reasonable efforts to retain Bancorp and USAB
employees following the Effective Time.

(d) Except for Bancorp and USAB employees who have individual severance
or similar contractual agreement, following the consummation of the Merger and
for one year thereafter, VNB shall pay severance to Bancorp and USAB employees
who are involuntarily

 



55  terminated by Valley or VNB for reasons other than cause in accordance with
the severance policy set forth on the _Bancorp Disclosure Schedule_.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Valley and VNB expressly agree to honor the
CIC Severance Plan and the participation agreements thereunder, and pay any
severance or other amounts due to covered individuals in accordance with the
terms of the CIC Severance Plan.

 

(e) Within two weeks of the date of this Agreement, Valley, VNB, Bancorp
and USAB shall cooperate to develop, implement and communicate to key
employees of Bancorp and USAB identified as such by the Chief Executive
Officer of Bancorp together with the President and Chief Executive Officer of
Valley, a retention program, as described on the _Bancorp Disclosure
Schedule_ , designed to retain the services of such key employees through the
Effective Time and thereafter until one hundred and eighty (180) days
following the Closing Date or such earlier or later time as Valley and VNB
may determine consistent with their respective business needs.

(f) Valley and VNB may, in their discretion within thirty (30) days
prior to the Effective Time, direct Bancorp and USAB to terminate any or all
nonqualified deferred compensation plans, programs and arrangements sponsored
by them in a manner that does not materially adversely affect the rights of
participants to benefits earned through the effective date of the change in
control of Bancorp provided that such action shall not be required to be
irrevocably taken until immediately prior to, and conditioned upon the
Effective Time. Upon receipt of such a direction Bancorp and USAB shall take
all requisite action to implement it.

 

(g) As of the date hereof, Valley has entered into employment agreements
with the individuals set forth on the _Valley Disclosure Schedule_ (the "
_Employee Agreements_ ").

 

5.15 Tax-Free Reorganization Treatment.

 

(a) The parties intend that the Merger qualify as a reorganization within
the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and that this Agreement constitute
a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of Section 1.368-2(g) of the
income Tax regulations promulgated under the Code. From and after the date of
this Agreement and until the Effective Time, each of Bancorp and Valley shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Merger to qualify as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and will not
knowingly take any action, cause any action to be taken, fail to take any
action or cause any action to fail to be taken which action or failure to act
could prevent the Merger from qualifying as a reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. Following the Effective Time, neither
Valley nor any affiliate shall knowingly take any action, cause any action to
be taken, fail to take any action, or cause any action to fail to be taken,
which action or failure to act could prevent the Merger from qualifying as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

 

(b) As of the date hereof, Bancorp does not know of any reason why it
would not be able to deliver to counsel to Valley and counsel to Bancorp
certificates substantially in compliance with IRS published advance ruling
guidelines, with reasonable or customary exceptions and modifications thereto
(the " _IRS Guidelines_ "), to enable counsel to Valley and counsel to
Bancorp to deliver the legal opinions contemplated by Section 6.1(d), and
Bancorp

 



56  hereby agrees to deliver such certificates effective as of the date of such
opinions to counsel to Valley and counsel to Bancorp.

 

(c) As of the date hereof, Valley does not know of any reason why it
would not be able to deliver to counsel to Valley and counsel to Bancorp
certificates substantially in compliance with the IRS Guidelines, with
reasonable or customary exceptions and modifications thereto, to enable
counsel to Valley and counsel to Bancorp to deliver the legal opinions
contemplated by Section 6.1(d), and Valley hereby agrees to deliver such
certificates effective as of the date of such opinions to counsel to Valley
and counsel to Bancorp.

 

5.16 Bank Policies and Bank Mergers. Notwithstanding that Bancorp believes
that it has established all reserves and taken all provisions for possible
loan losses required by GAAP and applicable laws, rules and regulations,
Bancorp recognizes that Valley may have adopted different loan, accrual and
reserve policies (including loan classifications and levels of reserves for
possible loan losses). From and after the date of this Agreement to the
Effective Time and in order to formulate the plan of integration for the Bank
Merger, Bancorp and Valley shall consult and cooperate with each other with
respect to (i) conforming to the extent appropriate, based upon such
consultation, Bancorps loan, accrual and reserve policies and Bancorps other
policies and procedures regarding applicable regulatory matters, including
without limitation FRB, Bank Secrecy Act and FDIC matters, to those policies
of Valley as Valley may reasonably identify to Bancorp from time to time, (ii)
conforming, based upon such consultation, the composition of the
investment portfolio and overall asset/liability management position of
Bancorp and USAB to the extent appropriate, and (iii) developing a plan for
the conversion of Bancorps systems and processes to those of Valleys so that
such conversion can be implemented as soon as practicable following the
Effective Time; _provided_ that any required change in Bancorps practices in
connection with the matters described above need not be effected (A) more than
five days prior to the Effective Time and (B) unless and until all necessary
regulatory, governmental and shareholder approvals and consents have been
received, all statutory waiting periods in respect thereof have expired and
Valley agrees in writing that all conditions precedent to the Closing have
occurred (other than the delivery of certificates, opinions and other
instruments and documents to be delivered at the Closing). No accrual or
reserve made by Bancorp or any Bancorp Subsidiary pursuant to this
subsection, or any litigation or regulatory proceeding arising out of any such
accrual or reserve, shall constitute or be deemed to be a breach or violation
of any representation, warranty, covenant, condition or other provision of
this Agreement or to constitute a termination event within the meaning of
Section 7.1(e) or Section 7.1(f) hereof.

 

5.17 Section 16 Matters. Prior to the Effective Time, the parties will each
take such steps as may be reasonably necessary or appropriate to cause any
disposition of shares of Bancorp Common Stock or conversion of any derivative
securities in respect of shares of Bancorp Common Stock in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be exempt
under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act.

 

5.18 Shareholder Litigation. Bancorp shall give Valley the opportunity to
participate at its own expense in the defense or settlement of any
shareholder litigation against Bancorp and/or its directors or other
affiliates relating to the transactions contemplated by this

 



57  Agreement, and no such settlement shall be agreed to without Valleys prior
written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed).

 

5.19 Transaction Expenses of Bancorp.

 

(a) For planning purposes, Bancorp shall, within 30 days from the date
hereof, provide Valley with its estimated budget of transaction-related
expenses reasonably anticipated to be payable by Bancorp in connection with
this transaction based on facts and circumstances currently known, including
the fees and expenses of counsel, accountants, investment bankers and other
professionals. Bancorp shall promptly notify Valley if or when it determines
that it will expect to exceed its budget. Prior to signing this Agreement,
Bancorp has disclosed to Valley the method by which the fees of its
investment bankers, accountants and counsel in connection with this
transaction are to be determined, and has disclosed to Valley the expected
fees of Sandler and Bancorps accountants and counsel in connection with
this transaction.

(b) Promptly, but in any event within 30 days after the execution
of this Agreement, Bancorp shall ask all of its attorneys and other
professionals to render current and correct invoices for all unbilled time and
disbursements. Bancorp shall accrue and/or pay all of such amounts as soon as
possible.

 

(c) Bancorp shall cause its professionals to render monthly invoices
within 30 days after the end of each month. Bancorp shall notify Valley
monthly of all out-of-pocket expenses which Bancorp has incurred in connection
with this transaction.

 

(d) Valley, in reasonable consultation with Bancorp, shall make all
arrangements with respect to the printing and mailing of the Proxy Statement-
Prospectus.

5.20 Representation on Valley Board and VNB Board. Prior to the Closing,
the Board of Directors of Valley and the Board of Directors of VNB each shall
increase by one (1) the number of directors constituting the entire Boards of
Directors of Valley and VNB, respectively, effective as of and contingent
upon the occurrence of the Effective Time, and shall duly elect Jennifer
Steans, or, if Jennifer Steans is unwilling or unable to serve, another
designee to be selected by the Board of Directors of Valley from the current
Bancorp Board of Directors (the " _Director Designee_ "), to become a director
of Valley and VNB, effective as of and contingent upon the occurrence of the
Effective Time. Jennifer Steans or the Director Designee shall be subject to
Valleys customary background screening and evaluation procedures for
potential directors and must meet all criteria set forth in Valleys
governance principles with respect to qualifications for directors and
shall qualify as an independent director under NYSE rules.

5.21 Dividends. After the date of this Agreement, subject to the receipt
of any required regulatory approvals, Bancorp shall have the right to pay its
shareholders a dividend equivalent to the amount of Valleys most recently
declared dividend using an assumed exchange ratio of 6.100. Each of Valley
and Bancorp shall coordinate with the other regarding the declaration of any
dividends in respect of Valley Common Stock and Bancorp Common Stock and the
record dates and payment dates relating thereto, it being the intention of
the parties hereto that holders of Bancorp Common Stock shall not receive two
dividends, or fail to receive

 



58  one dividend, in any quarter with respect to their shares of Bancorp Common
Stock and any shares of Valley Common Stock any such holder receives in
exchange therefor in the Merger.

 

ARTICLE VI. - CLOSING CONDITIONS

required to be satisfied prior to the Effective Time by the terms of such

obtain other substantial monetary or other relief against one or more parties,
VNB or USAB in connection with this Agreement or the Bank Merger Agreement and
which Valley or Bancorp determines in good faith, based upon the advice
of their respective counsel, makes it inadvisable to proceed with the Merger

electing not to proceed of any of the material benefits to it of the Merger.

(d) _Tax Opinions_. Valley shall have received a written opinion from

not had a Material Adverse Effect on Bancorp (it being understood that, for
purposes of determining the accuracy of such representations and warranties,
all materiality and "Material Adverse Effect" qualifications and exceptions
contained in such representations and warranties shall be disregarded),
provided, however, that Bancorps representations, warranties and covenants
contained in this Agreement shall not be deemed to be untrue or breached for

Effective Time, whether before or after approval of the matters presented in
connection with the Merger by the shareholders of Bancorp:

 

(a) by mutual consent of Bancorp and Valley;

 

(b) by either Valley or Bancorp upon written notice to the other party if
the approval of any Governmental Entity required for consummation of the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement is denied by
final, non-appealable action of such Governmental Entity; provided, however,
that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(b)
shall not be available to any party whose failure to comply with any provision
of this Agreement has been the cause of, or materially contributed to, such
action;

 

(c) by either Valley or Bancorp, if the Merger shall not have been
consummated on or before the Cutoff Date (or such later date as shall have
been agreed to in writing by Valley and Bancorp), provided, however, that no
party may terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(c) if the
failure of the Closing to have occurred on or before the Cutoff Date was due
to such partys material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement contained herein;

 

(d) by either Valley or Bancorp if (i) the approval of the shareholders
of Bancorp required for the consummation of the Merger shall not have been
obtained by reason of the failure to obtain the required vote at a duly held
meeting of such shareholders or at any adjournment or postponement thereof, or
(ii) the approval of the shareholders of Valley required for the consummation
of the Merger shall not have been obtained by reason of the failure to obtain
the required vote at a duly held meeting of such shareholders or at any
adjournment or postponement thereof;

 

(e) by either Valley or Bancorp (provided that the terminating party is
not then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
other agreement contained

 



61  herein), if there shall have been a breach of any of the representations or
warranties set forth in this Agreement on the part of the other party, which
breach is not cured within thirty (30) days following written notice to the
party committing such breach, or which breach, by its nature, cannot be cured
prior to the Cutoff Date, and which breach of a representation or warranty,
would, individually or in the aggregate with other breaches, (i) result in a
Material Adverse Effect with respect to the party committing such breach, or
(ii) result in one or more of the conditions set forth in Sections 6.1, 6.2
(in case of a termination by Valley) or 6.3 (in case of termination by
Bancorp) not to be satisfied or not capable of being satisfied by the Cutoff
Date;

 

(f) by either Valley or Bancorp (provided that the terminating party is
not then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
other agreement contained herein), if there shall have been a breach of any of
the covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement on the part of the
other party, which breach is not cured within thirty (30) days following
written notice to the party committing such breach, or which breach, by its
nature, cannot be cured prior to the Cutoff Date, and which breach of a
representation, warranty or covenant, would, individually or in the aggregate
with other breaches, (i) result in a Material Adverse Effect with respect to
the party committing such breach, or (ii) result in one or more of the
conditions set forth in Sections 6.1, 6.2 (in case of a termination by
Valley) or 6.3 (in case of termination by Bancorp) not to be satisfied or not

any committee thereof) has (A) effected a Bancorp Subsequent Determination or
approved, adopted, endorsed or recommended any Acquisition Proposal, (B)
failed to recommend the Merger and the approval of this Agreement by the
shareholders of Bancorp or failed to publicly re-affirm its recommendation of
the Merger within five days after receipt from Valley of a written request to
do so, (C) breached the terms of Section 5.3 in any material respect adverse
to Valley, or (D) in response to the commencement (other than by Valley or a
Subsidiary thereof) of a tender offer or exchange offer for 10% or more of the
outstanding shares of Bancorp Common Stock, recommended that the shareholders
of Bancorp tender their shares in such tender or exchange offer or otherwise
failed to recommend that such shareholders reject such tender offer or
exchange offer promptly upon written request of Valley, or (II) any other
event occurs that gives rise to the payment of a Termination Fee (as hereafter
defined) and Termination Expenses (as hereafter defined) pursuant to Section
7.3 of this Agreement;

 

(h) by Bancorp if, prior to receiving Bancorp Shareholder Approval, (i)
Bancorp has received a Superior Proposal, and in accordance with Section 5.3
of this Agreement, has entered into an acquisition agreement with respect to
the Superior Proposal, or (ii) if Bancorps Board of Directors determines in
good faith, after consultation with Bancorps outside financial advisors and
outside legal counsel, that the failure of Bancorps Board of Directors to
effect a Bancorp Subsequent Determination would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable law, but only if prior to terminating this
Agreement, Bancorp (A) pays to Valley the Termination Fee and Termination
Expenses and (B) delivers to Valley a release signed by the parties to such
acquisition agreement and any entity that controls such parties, which
release shall be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Valley and
shall irrevocably waive any right the releasing parties may have to challenge
the payment to Valley of the Termination Fee and the payment to Valley of the
Termination Expenses;

 



62 (i) by Valley if one or more of the conditions set forth in Sections 6.1
and 6.2 are not satisfied and are not capable of being satisfied by the Cutoff
Date;

 

(j) by Bancorp if one or more of the conditions set forth in Sections 6.1
and 6.3 are not satisfied and are not capable of being satisfied by the
Cutoff Date; or

(k) (A) by Valley or Bancorp if the Average Closing Price is below
$11.00 or (B) by Bancorp if the Average Closing Price is above $13.50. For the
avoidance of doubt, any termination pursuant to this 7.1(k) shall not give
rise to the payment of the Termination Expenses or Termination Fee and the
party terminating shall not be liable for damages to the other party as a
result of such termination.

 

7.2 Effect of Termination. In the event of termination of this Agreement
by either Valley or Bancorp as provided in Section 7.1, this Agreement shall
forthwith become void and have no effect except that (i) Sections 5.5(b), 5.9,
Articles VII and VIII and the Confidentiality Agreement shall survive any
termination of this Agreement, and (ii) notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, in the event that either of the parties
shall willfully default in its obligations hereunder, the non-defaulting party
may pursue any remedy available at law or in equity to enforce its rights and
shall be paid by the willfully defaulting party for all damages, costs and
expenses, including without limitation legal, accounting, investment banking
and printing expenses, incurred or suffered by the non-defaulting party in
connection herewith or in the enforcement of its rights hereunder.

disclosed or otherwise communicated or made known to senior management of
Bancorp or Bancorp Board of Directors and (B) this Agreement is thereafter
terminated (x) by Bancorp or Valley pursuant to Section 7.1(c) or Section
7.1(d)(i) (but only if, in the case of a termination pursuant to Section
7.1(d)(i), the Registration Statement shall have been declared effective no
later than sixty (60) days prior to the Cutoff Date), or (y) by Valley
pursuant to Section 7.1(e) or Section 7.1(f), then, (I) Bancorp shall pay to
Valley, immediately upon such termination, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds, the Termination Expenses, and, (II) if within 12 months after
such termination, Bancorp or any of its Subsidiaries enters into a definitive
agreement with respect to, or consummates a transaction contemplated by, any
Acquisition Proposal (which, in each case, need not be

 



63  the same Acquisition Proposal that shall have been made, publicly disclosed
or communicated prior to termination hereof), then Bancorp shall pay Valley,
on the earlier of the date of such execution or consummation, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds, a fee of $30 million (the "
_Termination Fee_ "); or

 

(ii) this Agreement is terminated by Valley pursuant to Section

Valley, immediately upon such termination, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds, the Termination Fee and Termination Expenses.

8.3 Parties in Interest. This Agreement shall be binding upon and shall
inure to the benefit of Valley and Bancorp, and their respective successors.
Nothing in this Agreement is intended to confer, expressly or by implication,
upon any other person any rights or remedies under or by reason of this
Agreement, except for the rights conferred upon Bancorp Indemnitees pursuant
to Section 5.13 hereof.

 

8.4 Entire Agreement. This Agreement, the Bancorp Disclosure Schedule,
the Valley Disclosure Schedule and the other documents, agreements and
instruments executed and delivered pursuant to or in connection with this
Agreement, contain the entire agreement among the parties hereto with respect
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and supersede all prior
negotiations, arrangements or understandings, written or oral, with respect

 



65  thereto, other than the Confidentiality Agreement, which will survive the
execution and delivery of this Agreement.

 

8.5 No Third Party Beneficiaries.

 

(a) Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or
shall confer upon any person other than Valley and Bancorp any legal or
equitable right, benefit or remedy of any nature under or by reason of this
Agreement. The representations and warranties in this Agreement are the
product of negotiations among the parties hereto and are for the sole benefit
of the parties. In some instances, the representations and warranties in this
Agreement may represent an allocation among the parties hereto of risks
associated with particular matters regardless of the knowledge of any of the
parties hereto. Consequently, persons other than the parties may not rely upon
the representations and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of
actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any
other date.

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing clause, following the Effective Time
(but not unless and until the Effective Time occurs), the provisions of
Section 5.13 shall be enforceable by each Bancorp Indemnitee described
therein.

 

8.6 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement or the application
thereof to any person (including the officers and directors of Bancorp or
Valley) or circumstance is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to
be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remaining provisions, or the
application of such provision to persons or circumstances other than those as
to which it has been held invalid or unenforceable, will remain in full force
and effect and will in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated thereby, so
long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated
hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party hereto.
Upon such determination, the parties hereto will negotiate in good faith in an
effort to agree upon a suitable and equitable substitute provision to effect
the original intent of the parties hereto.

8.7 Counterparts; PDF Signatures. This Agreement may be executed in one
or more counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same
agreement and each of which shall be deemed an original. This Agreement may be
executed and accepted by portable data file (pdf) signature and any such
signature shall be of the same force and effect as an original signature.

 

8.8 Governing Law; Jurisdiction. This Agreement shall be governed by the
laws of the State of New Jersey, without giving effect to the principles of
conflicts of laws thereof. Any suit, action or proceeding seeking to enforce
any provision of, or based on any matter arising out of or in connection with,
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby shall be
brought exclusively in the United States District Court for the District of
New Jersey or any New Jersey state court sitting in Passaic County, and each
of the parties hereby consents to the jurisdiction of such courts (and of the
appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any such suit, action or proceeding
and irrevocable waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection
which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such
suit, action or proceeding in any such court or that any such suit, action or
proceeding

 



66  which is brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient
forum. The consent to jurisdiction set forth in this Section 8.8 shall not
constitute a general consent to service of process in the State of New Jersey
and shall have no effect for any purpose except as provided in this Section
8.8. The parties hereto agree that final judgment in any suit, action or
proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by
suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by applicable law.

 

8.9 Descriptive Headings. The descriptive headings of this
Agreement are for convenience only and shall not control or affect the
meaning or construction of any provision of this Agreement.

 

8.10 Survival. All representations, warranties and agreements and
covenants shall terminate as of the Effective Time except for those covenants
and agreements included herein which by their terms apply in whole or in part
after the Effective Time. The provisions of Section 5.5(b), Articles VII and
VIII and the Confidentiality Agreement, shall survive the termination of this
Agreement.
