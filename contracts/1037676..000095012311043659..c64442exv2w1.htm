I. THE OFFER AND MERGER 

   

 Section 1.1 _The Offer_. 

  

 (a) Provided that this Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance with _Section 8.1_ , as promptly as practicable (and in any event within 10 Business Days) after the date hereof, Merger Sub shall (and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to) commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the " _Exchange Act_ ")) the Offer to purchase for cash all Shares at the Offer Price; _provided_ , that Merger Sub shall not be required to commence, or cause to be commenced, the Offer prior to the date on which the Company is prepared to filed the Schedule 14D-9. 

   

 (b) The obligation of Merger Sub to accept for payment and pay for any Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer shall be subject to: (i) there being validly tendered in the Offer and not withdrawn prior to any then scheduled Expiration Time that number of Shares which, together with the Shares then beneficially owned by Parent or Merger Sub (if any), represents at least a majority of the Shares then outstanding (determined on a fully diluted basis, which assumes conversion or exercise of all derivative securities regardless of the conversion or exercise price, the vesting schedule or other terms and conditions thereof; _provided_ ,  _however_ , it will not include the Companys 2012 Notes or the 2017 Notes) (the " _Minimum Condition_ "); and (ii) the satisfaction, or waiver by Parent or Merger Sub, of the HSR Condition and the other conditions set forth in _Annex I_ (together with the Minimum Condition, the " _Offer Conditions_ "). Subject to the prior satisfaction of the Minimum Condition and the satisfaction, or waiver by Parent or Merger Sub, of the other Offer Conditions, Merger Sub shall (and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to) consummate the Offer in accordance with its terms and accept for payment and pay for all Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer as promptly as possible after Merger Sub is legally permitted to do so after the Expiration Time. The Offer Price payable in respect of each Share validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer shall be paid net to the seller in cash, without interest, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and the Offer. The acceptance for payment of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to and subject to the Offer Conditions and otherwise on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement is referred to herein as the " _Offer Closing_ ," and the date on which the Offer Closing occurs is referred to herein as the " _Offer Closing Date_." 

   

 (c) The Offer shall be made by means of an offer to purchase (the " _Offer to Purchase_ ") that contains the terms set forth in this Agreement and the Offer Conditions. Parent and Merger Sub expressly reserve the right (in their sole discretion) to increase the Offer Price or to make any other changes in the terms and conditions of the Offer, or to waive, in whole or in part, any of the Offer Conditions; _provided_ , _however_ , that unless otherwise provided by this Agreement or as previously approved in writing by the Company, Merger Sub shall not (i) decrease the Offer Price, (ii) change the form of consideration payable in the Offer, (iii) reduce the number of Shares to be purchased in the Offer, (iv) amend or modify any of the Offer Conditions or impose conditions to the Offer that are different than or in addition to the Offer Conditions, (v) 

       ##### 

  

    

amend or waive the Minimum Condition, (vi) amend or modify any of the terms of
the Offer in a manner that is, or could reasonably be expected to be, adverse
to the holders of Shares, or (vii) extend or otherwise change the Expiration
Time in a manner other than pursuant to and in accordance with this
Agreement. 

   

 (d) Unless extended pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the Offer shall expire at midnight (New York City time) on the date that is 20 Business Days following the commencement (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) of the Offer (the " _Initial Expiration Time_ ") or, in the event the Initial Expiration Time has been extended pursuant to and in accordance with this Agreement, the date to which the Offer has been so extended (the Initial Expiration Time, or such later time to which the Initial Expiration Time has been extended pursuant to and in accordance with this Agreement, is referred to as the " _Expiration Time_ "). 

   

 (e) The Offer shall be extended from time to time as follows: 

   

 (i) _Offer Conditions Not Satisfied_. If on or prior to any then scheduled Expiration Time, the Offer Conditions shall not have been satisfied, or waived by Parent or Merger Sub if permitted hereunder, Merger Sub shall (and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to) extend the Offer for successive periods of up to five Business Days (or such longer period as the parties hereto may agree) each until the Offer Conditions are satisfied or waived; 

   

 (ii) _Required by Applicable Law or the NYSE_. Merger Sub shall extend the Offer for any period or periods required by applicable Law, including any rule, regulation, interpretation or position of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") (or its staff) or the New York Stock Exchange (the " _NYSE_ "); 

   

 (iii) _Marketing Period_. If the Marketing Period has not ended on the last Business Day prior to the expiration of the Offer, Merger Sub shall extend the Offer until the earliest to occur of (x) any Business Day before or during the Marketing Period as may be specified by Parent on no less than two Business Days prior notice to the Company, and (y) the first Business Day after the final day of the Marketing Period; and 

   

 (iv) _Extension at Request of Company_. If on or prior to any then scheduled Expiration Date, the Offer Conditions shall have been satisfied, or waived by Parent or Merger Sub if permitted hereunder, and Merger Sub has failed to accept for payment and pay for Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer in accordance with this _Section 1.1_, if requested by the Company, Merger Sub shall (and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to) extend the Offer for successive periods of up to five Business Days (or such longer period as the parties hereto may agree) each until the Offer Conditions are satisfied or waived; 

  

 _provided_ , _however_ , that Merger Sub shall not be required pursuant to
this clause (e) to extend the Offer beyond the Outside Date. Notwithstanding
any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, (y) if, at any then-
scheduled expiration of the Offer, each Offer Condition (other than the
Minimum Condition) shall have been satisfied or waived and the
Minimum Condition shall not have been satisfied, then Merger Sub may and,
if 

       ##### 

  

    

requested by the Company, Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub
to, extend the Offer by increments of five Business Days; provided, however,
that (i) the maximum number of days that the Offer may be extended pursuant
to this sentence shall be twenty Business Days and (z) none of the clauses of
this _Section 1.1(e)_ shall be deemed to impair, limit or otherwise restrict
in any manner the right of the parties to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 8.1_. 

   

 (f) If upon the acceptance for payment of, and payment for, all Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer, Parent and Merger Sub collectively do not beneficially own at least 90% of the Shares then outstanding assuming exercise in full of the Top-Up Option, Merger Sub may (but shall not be required to), and the Offer shall reserve the right to, provide for a "subsequent offering period" (and one or more extensions thereof) in accordance with Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act of up to 20 Business Days, as determined by Merger Sub in consultation with the Company, in accordance with Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Offer, Merger Sub shall (and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to) immediately accept for payment, and pay for, all Shares that are validly tendered pursuant to the Offer during such "subsequent offering period." The Offer Documents will provide for the possibility of a "subsequent offering period" in a manner consistent with the terms of this  _Section 1.1(f)_. 

   

 (g) Merger Sub shall not terminate the Offer prior to any scheduled Expiration Time without the prior written consent of the Company, except in the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 8.1_. In the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to  _Section 8.1_ prior to any scheduled Expiration Time, Merger Sub shall (and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to) promptly (and in any event within 24 hours of such termination), irrevocably and unconditionally terminate the Offer. If the Offer is terminated or withdrawn by Merger Sub, or this Agreement is terminated prior to the purchase of Shares in the Offer, Merger Sub shall promptly return, and shall cause any depository acting on behalf of Merger Sub to return, all tendered Shares to the registered holders thereof. 

   

 (h) As soon as practicable on the date of the commencement of the Offer (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act), Parent and Merger Sub shall file with the SEC, pursuant to Regulation M-A under the Exchange Act (" _Regulation M-A_"), a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with respect to the Offer (together with all amendments, supplements and exhibits thereto, the " _Schedule TO_"). The Schedule TO shall include, as exhibits, the Offer to Purchase and a form of letter of transmittal and summary advertisement (such Schedule TO and the documents attached as exhibits thereto, together with any amendments and supplements thereto, the " _Offer Documents_ "). The Company shall promptly furnish to Parent and Merger Sub all information concerning the Company or any of its Representatives requested by Parent or Merger Sub and required by the Exchange Act to be set forth in the Offer Documents. Parent and Merger Sub agree to take all steps necessary to cause the Offer Documents to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by the Exchange Act. Parent and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, agree to promptly correct or 

       ##### 

  

    

supplement any information provided by it for use in the Offer Documents if
and to the extent that it shall have become false or misleading in any
material respect or as otherwise required by applicable Law. Parent and
Merger Sub further agree to take all steps necessary to cause the
Offer Documents, as so corrected or supplemented (if applicable), to be filed
with the SEC and disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case to the
extent required by the Exchange Act. The Company and its counsel shall be
given a reasonable opportunity to review the Offer Documents before they are
filed with the SEC, and Parent and Merger Sub shall give due consideration to
all the reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by the
Company and its counsel. In addition, Parent and Merger Sub shall provide the
Company and its counsel with copies of any written comments, and shall inform
them of any oral comments, that Parent, Merger Sub or their counsel may
receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer
Documents promptly after receipt of such comments, and any written or oral
responses thereto. The Company and its counsel shall be given a reasonable
opportunity to review any such written responses and Parent and Merger Sub
shall give due consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions or
changes suggested thereto by the Company and its counsel.

 (a) As promptly as practicable on the date of the filing of the Schedule TO, the Company shall, in a manner that complies with Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act, file with the SEC a Tender Offer Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 with respect to the Offer (together with all amendments, supplements and exhibits thereto, the " _Schedule 14D-9_") that shall, subject to the provisions of _Section 5.2_, contain the Company Recommendation. The Company agrees to take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9 to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by the Exchange Act. The Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, agree to promptly correct or supplement any information provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that it shall have become false or misleading in any material respect or as otherwise required by applicable Law. The Company further agrees to take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9, as so corrected or supplemented (if applicable), to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by the Exchange Act. Unless the Board of Directors of the Company has effected a Company Adverse Recommendation Change, Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel shall be given a 

       ##### 

  

    

reasonable opportunity to review the Schedule 14D-9 before it is filed with
the SEC and the Company shall give due consideration to all reasonable
additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by Parent, Merger Sub and
their counsel. In addition, the Company shall provide Parent, Merger Sub and
their counsel with copies of any written comments, and shall inform them of
any oral comments, that the Company or its counsel may receive from time to
time from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly
after the Companys receipt of such comments, and any written or oral
responses thereto. Unless the Board of Directors of the Company has effected
a Company Adverse Recommendation Change, Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel
shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review any such written responses
and the Company shall give due consideration to all reasonable additions,
deletions or changes suggested thereto by Parent, Merger Sub and their

 (b) In connection with the Offer, the Company shall promptly (and in any event within five Business Days following the date of this Agreement) furnish or cause to be furnished to Merger Sub mailing labels, security position listings and any available listing or computer files containing the names and addresses of the record and beneficial holders of the Shares as of the most recent practicable date, and shall promptly furnish Merger Sub with such information and assistance (including, but not limited to, lists of record and beneficial holders of the Shares, updated from time to time upon Merger Subs request, and their addresses, mailing labels and lists of security positions) as Merger Sub or its agent may reasonably request for the purpose of communicating the Offer to the record and beneficial holders of the Shares. Except for such steps as are necessary to disseminate the Offer Documents and any other documents necessary to consummate the Offer, the Merger and the other Transactions, Parent and Merger Sub shall hold in confidence the information contained in any such labels, listings and files, shall use such information only in connection with the Offer and the Merger and, if this Agreement shall be terminated, shall promptly deliver (and shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to cause their agents and Representatives to deliver) to the Company all copies and any extract or summaries of such information. In addition, in connection with the Offer, the Company shall cooperate with Parent and Merger Sub to disseminate the Offer Documents to holders of Shares held in or subject to any Company Stock Plan or other Company Benefit Plan and to permit such holders of Shares to tender Shares in the Offer. 

   

 Section 1.3 _Directors_. 

  

 (a) Provided that the Minimum Condition is satisfied, promptly after Merger Sub accepts for payment and pays for any Shares tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer (the " _Appointment Time_ "), and at all times thereafter, Merger Sub shall be entitled to elect or designate such number of directors, rounded up to the next whole number, on the Board of Directors of the Company as is equal to the product of the total number of directors on the Board of Directors of the Company (giving effect to 

       ##### 

  

    

the directors elected or designated by Merger Sub pursuant to this sentence)
multiplied by the percentage that the aggregate number of Shares beneficially
owned by Parent and Merger Sub bears to the total number of Shares then
outstanding; provided, however, that, subject to applicable Law and the rules
of the NYSE, Merger Sub shall be entitled to designate at least a majority of
the directors on the Board of Directors of the Company at all times following
the Appointment Time. Upon Merger Subs request at any time following the
Appointment Time, the Company shall take such actions, including but not
limited to filling vacancies or newly created directorships on the Board of
Directors of the Company, increasing the size of the Board of Directors of
the Company (including by amending the Bylaws of the Company if necessary so
as to increase the size of the Board of Directors of the Company) and/or
requesting and accepting the resignations of such number of its incumbent
directors, as is reasonably necessary to enable Merger Subs designees to be
so elected or designated to the Board of Directors of the Company, and
shall cause Merger Subs designees to be so elected or designated at such
time. The Company shall, upon Merger Subs request following the Appointment
Time, also cause Persons elected or designated by Merger Sub to constitute at
least the same percentage (rounded up to the next whole number) as is on the
Board of Directors of the Company of (i) each committee of the Board of
Directors of the Company, (ii) each board of directors (or similar body) of
each Company Subsidiary, and (iii) each committee (or similar body) of each
such board, in each case to the extent permitted by applicable Law and the
rules of the NYSE. The Companys obligations under this _Section 1.3(a)_
shall be subject to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1
promulgated thereunder. The Company shall promptly upon execution of this
Agreement take all actions required pursuant to Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1
in order to fulfill its obligations under this _Section 1.3(a)_,
including mailing to stockholders (together with the Schedule 14D-9, unless
otherwise requested by Parent) the information required by Section 14(f) and
Rule 14f-1 as is necessary to enable Merger Subs designees to be elected or
designated to the Board of Directors of the Company. Merger Sub shall supply
the Company with, and solely be responsible for, information with respect to
Merger Subs designees and Parents and Merger Subs respective officers,
directors and affiliates to the extent required by Section 14(f) and Rule
14f-1. The provisions of this _Section 1.3(a)_ are in addition to and shall
not limit any rights that any of Merger Sub, Parent or any of
their respective affiliates may have as a record holder or beneficial owner
of Shares as a matter of applicable Law with respect to the election of
directors or otherwise. 

   

 (b) In the event that Merger Subs designees are elected or designated to the Board of Directors of the Company pursuant to _Section 1.3(a)_, then, until the Effective Time, the Company shall cause the Board of Directors of the Company to maintain three directors who are members of the Board of Directors of the Company on the date hereof, each of whom shall be "independent" for purposes of Rule 10A-3 of the Exchange Act and also eligible to serve on the Companys audit committee under the Exchange Act and NYSE rules and at least one of whom shall be an "audit committee financial expert" as defined in Item 407(d)(5)(ii) of Regulation S-K and the instructions thereto (the " _Continuing Directors_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that if any Continuing Director is unable to serve due to death, disability or resignation, the Company shall take all necessary action (including creating a committee of the Board of Directors of the 

       ##### 

  

    

Company) so that the Continuing Director(s) shall be entitled to elect or
designate another person (or persons) to fill such vacancy, and such person
(or persons) shall be deemed to be a Continuing Director for purposes of this
Agreement. If no Continuing Director then remains, the other directors shall
designate three persons who shall each qualify as "independent" for
purposes of Rule 10A-3 of the Exchange Act and eligible to serve on the
Companys audit committee under the Exchange Act and NYSE rules and at least
one of whom shall be an "audit committee financial expert" as defined in Item
407(d)(5)(ii) of Regulation S-K and the instructions thereto, to fill
such vacancies and such persons shall be deemed Continuing Directors for all
purposes of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, if any of Merger Subs designees have been elected or appointed to
the Board of Directors of the Company after the Appointment Time and prior to
the Effective Time, then the affirmative vote of a majority of the Continuing
Directors shall (in addition to the approval rights of the stockholders of
the Company as may be required by the governing documents of the Company or
applicable Law) be required (and upon such vote the Company will be deemed
authorized without any further vote of the Board of Directors) for
the Company (i) to amend or terminate this Agreement, (ii) to extend the time
of performance of, or waive, any of the obligations or other acts of Parent
or Merger Sub under this Agreement, or to exercise or waive any of the
Companys rights, benefits or remedies hereunder, (iii) except as provided
herein, to amend the governing documents of the Company, or (iv) to take any
other action or make any other determination of the Board of Directors of the
Company under or in connection with this Agreement if such action would
reasonably be expected to adversely affect the holders of Shares (other than
Parent or Merger Sub). The Continuing Directors shall have, and Parent
shall cause the Continuing Directors to have, the authority to retain such
counsel (which may include current counsel to the Company or the Board of
Directors of the Company) and other advisors at the expense of the Company as
determined by the Continuing Directors, and the authority to institute any
action on behalf of the Company to enforce performance of this Agreement.

The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") will take place at a time and on a date to be specified by the parties hereto, which is to be no later than the second Business Day after satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted by applicable Law) of the conditions (excluding conditions that, by their terms, cannot be satisfied until the Closing Date, but subject to the fulfillment or (to the extent permitted by applicable Law) waiver of those conditions) set forth in _Article VII_, unless another time or date is agreed to by the parties hereto.

Merger Sub may pay the Company the aggregate price required to be paid for the Top-Up Shares either (i) entirely in cash or (ii) at Merger Subs election, by (x) paying in cash an amount equal to not less than the aggregate par value of the Top-Up Shares and (y) executing and delivering to the Company a promissory note having a principal amount equal to the balance of the aggregate purchase price pursuant to the Top-Up Option less the amount paid in cash pursuant to the preceding clause (x) (a " _Promissory Note_ "). Any such Promissory Note shall be full recourse against Parent and Merger Sub and (i) shall bear interest at the rate of nine percent per annum, (ii) shall mature on the first anniversary of the date of execution and delivery of such Promissory Note, and (iii) may be prepaid, in whole or in part, without premium or penalty. In the event that the Top-Up Option is exercised and this Agreement is then terminated in accordance with its terms, the Promissory Note will become immediately due and payable. 

   

 (b) Provided that no applicable Law, order, injunction or other legal impediment shall prohibit the exercise of the Top-Up Option or the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares pursuant thereto, or otherwise make such exercise or issuance illegal, Merger Sub may exercise (subject to the restrictions contained in _Section 1.12_(a)) the Top-Up Option on one occasion, in whole and not in part, after the Appointment Time and prior to the earlier to occur of (i) the later of (A) the Expiration Time and (B) the expiration of any "subsequent offering period"; and (ii) the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms. 

   

 (c) In order to exercise the Top-Up Option, Merger Sub shall send to the Company a written notice (a " _Top-Up Exercise Notice_ ," the date of which notice is referred to herein as the " _Top-Up Notice Date_ ") specifying the denominations of the certificate or certificates evidencing the Top-Up Option Shares which Merger Sub 

       ##### 

  

    

wishes to receive, and the place, time and date for the closing of the
purchase and sale pursuant to the Top-Up Option (the " _Top-Up Closing_ ").
The Company shall, promptly after receipt of the Top-Up Exercise Notice,
deliver a written notice to Merger Sub confirming the number of Top-Up Option
Shares and the aggregate purchase price therefor (the " _Top-Up Notice
Receipt_ "). At the Top-Up Closing, Merger Sub shall pay the Company the
aggregate price required to be paid for the Top-Up Option Shares, by delivery
of cash and a Promissory Note in an aggregate principal amount equal to that
specified in the Top-Up Notice Receipt, and the Company shall cause to be
issued and delivered to Merger Sub a certificate or certificates representing
the Top-Up Option Shares or, if the Company does not then have certificated
Shares, the applicable number of Book-Entry Shares. Such certificates or
Book-Entry Shares may include any legends that are required by federal
or state securities Laws. 

   

 (d) Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge that the Top-Up Shares which Merger Sub may acquire upon exercise of the Top-Up Option shall not be registered under the Securities Act and shall be issued in reliance upon an exemption from registration under the Securities Act for transactions not involving a public offering. Parent and Merger Sub represent and warrant to the Company that Merger Sub is, or shall be upon any purchase of Top-Up Shares, an "accredited investor", as defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D under the Securities Act. Merger Sub agrees that the Top-Up Option, and the Top-Up Shares to be acquired upon exercise of the Top-Up Option, if any, are being and shall be acquired by Merger Sub for the purpose of investment and not with a view to, or for resale in connection with, any distribution thereof (within the meaning of the Securities Act). 

   

 (e) Without the prior written consent of the Company, the right to exercise the Top-Up Option granted pursuant to this Agreement shall not be assigned by Merger Sub other than to Parent or a direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent, including by operation of Law or otherwise, and any attempted assignment in violation of this  _Section 1.12(e)_ shall be null and void. 

   

II. EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK OF THE CONSTITUENT
CORPORATIONS 

   

 Section 2.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any holder of any shares of capital stock of the Company: 

  

 (a) _Merger Sub s Common Stock_. Each share of Merger Subs common stock, par value $0.01 per share, outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be converted into and become one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation. 

   

 (b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent Owned Stock_. Each share of Company Common Stock, that is owned by Parent or Merger Sub and any Company Common Stock held in the treasury of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time will automatically be canceled and retired and will cease to exist, and no consideration will be paid in respect of such shares. 

       ##### 

  

     

 (c) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Subject to _Section 2.1_(b), each issued and outstanding share of Company Common Stock, other than shares of Company Common Stock to be canceled in accordance with _Section 2.1_(b) and Dissenting Shares, will be converted into the right to receive cash in an amount per share equal to the Offer Price (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing, each share of Company Common Stock that is owned by any direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (other than Merger Sub) or the Company shall remain outstanding following the Merger. 

   

 (d) _Cancellation of Shares of Company Common Stock_. As of the Effective Time, all shares of Company Common Stock will no longer be outstanding and will automatically be canceled and retired and will cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate formerly representing any shares of Company Common Stock (a " _Company Certificate_ ") or book entry shares (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") will cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration without interest upon the surrender of such Company Certificate or Book-Entry Shares, in each case, in accordance with this Article II or, as to Dissenting Shares, the rights set forth in _Section 2.4_. 

   

 Section 2.2 _Treatment of Company Stock Plan_. (a) Company Stock Options. Each option to purchase shares granted under the Companys Amended and Restated 2005 Equity and Performance Incentive Plan (the " _Company Stock Plan_ " and each such option, a " _Company Stock Option_ ") that is outstanding and unexercised as of the Appointment Time (whether vested or unvested) will be adjusted by the applicable Company Stock Plan committee and converted into the right of the holder to receive from the Company or the Surviving Corporation an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock previously subject to such Company Stock Option and (ii) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share set forth in such Company Stock Option, less any required withholding Taxes (the " _Option Cash Payment_ "). With respect to any Company Stock Option that has an exercise price equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration, the Company will cancel such Company Stock Option without the payment of any consideration or payment in respect thereof. As of the Appointment Time, each holder of a Company Stock Option will cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Option Cash Payment, if any. The Option Cash Payment will be made promptly (and in any event within 15 Business Days) following the Appointment Time. 

  

 (b) _Restricted Shares; Restricted Share Units_. Each award of a right under the Company Stock Plan (other than awards of Company Stock Options) entitling the holder thereof to shares of Company Common Stock or cash equal to or based on the value of shares of Company Common Stock (including, for the avoidance of doubt, each share of restricted Company Common Stock issued under the Company Stock Plan (each, a " _Restricted Share_ ") and each Restricted Share Unit issued under the Company Stock Plan (each, a " _Restricted Share Unit_ ")) that is outstanding or payable as of the Appointment Time (whether vested or unvested) (all such rights, collectively the " _Share Units_ ") will be adjusted by the applicable Company Stock Plan committee 

     ##### 

  

  

and converted into the right of the holder to receive from the Company or the
Surviving Corporation an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the total
number of shares of Company Common Stock underlying such Share Units and (ii)
the Merger Consideration, less any required withholding Taxes (the " _Share
Unit Payment_ "). As of the Appointment Time, each holder of a Share Unit
will cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to
receive the applicable Share Unit Payment. All Share Unit Payments will be
made promptly (and in any case within 15 Business Days) following the
Appointment Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, all amounts payable in respect of a Restricted Share
Unit will be paid in accordance with the terms of the Company Stock Plan and
the applicable award agreement, except as may be (A) necessary to avoid the
imposition of any additional Taxes or penalties in respect thereof pursuant
to Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "
_Code_ "), or (B) required under a payment election made by an individual
award holder in respect of the applicable Restricted Share Unit. 

   

 (c) _Rule 16b-3(e)_. Prior to the Appointment Time, the Company will take all such lawful action as may be necessary (which includes satisfying the requirements of Rule 16b-3(e) of the Exchange Act), without incurring any liability in connection therewith, to provide for and give effect to the transactions contemplated by this _Section 2.2_. 

   

 (d) _Tax Withholding_. For the avoidance of doubt, all amounts payable pursuant to this _Section 2.2_ will be subject to any required withholding of Taxes and will be paid without interest. 

   

 Section 2.3 _Payment of Merger Consideration; Surrender of Certificates_. (a)  _Payment Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent will designate the Companys transfer agent or another national bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as agent of Parent for purposes of, among other things, mailing and receiving transmittal letters and distributing the Merger Consideration to the Companys stockholders (the " _Payment Agent_ "). At the Effective Time, Parent or Merger Sub will deposit, or cause to be deposited, in trust with the Payment Agent in a separate account for the benefit of holders of Company Common Stock (the " _Payment Fund_ ") the aggregate consideration to which such holders will be entitled at the Effective Time in accordance with this Article II. If for any reason the cash in the Payment Fund is insufficient to fully satisfy all of the payment obligations to be made in cash by the Payment Agent hereunder, Parent will promptly deposit cash into the Payment Fund in an amount which is equal to the deficiency in the amount of cash required to fully satisfy such cash payment obligations. 

  

 (b) _Payment Procedures_. (i) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, but in no event later than three Business Days after the Effective Time, Parent will cause the Payment Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Company Certificate whose shares of Company Common Stock were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration (A) a letter of transmittal (which will specify that delivery will be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Company Certificates will pass, only upon proper delivery of the Company Certificates to the Payment Agent or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares, upon adherence to the procedures set forth in the letter 

   ##### 

   

 

of transmittal, and such letter of transmittal will be in such form and have
such other provisions as Parent may specify consistent with this Agreement)
and (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Company
Certificates or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares, the surrender of such
Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration. 

   

 (ii) After the Effective Time, and upon surrender in accordance with _Section 2.3(b)(i)_ of a Company Certificate or Book-Entry Shares for cancellation to the Payment Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Payment Agent, the holder of such Company Certificate or Book-Entry Shares will be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of this _Article II_ and the Company Certificate or Book-Entry Shares so surrendered will be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of Company Common Stock that are not registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment may be issued to a person other than the person in whose name the Company Certificate or Book-Entry Shares so surrendered is registered (the " _Transferee_ ") if such Company Certificate or Book-Entry Share is properly endorsed or otherwise in proper form for transfer and the Transferee pays any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of such payment to a person other than the registered holder of such Company Certificate or Book-Entry Shares or establishes to the satisfaction of the Payment Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this  _Section 2.3(b)_, each Company Certificate and each Book-Entry Share will be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive, upon such surrender, the Merger Consideration that the holder thereof has the right to receive in respect of such Company Certificate or Book-Entry Shares pursuant to the provisions of this _Article II_,  _subject_ , _however_ , to the Surviving Corporations obligation to pay all dividends that may have been declared by the Company (solely as permitted by _Section 5.1_) and that remain unpaid at the Effective Time. No interest will be paid or will accrue on any Merger Consideration payable to holders of Company Certificates or Book-Entry Shares pursuant to the provisions of this _Article II_. 

   

 (c) _Closing of Company Stock Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company will be closed and there will not be any further registrations of transfers of any shares of the Companys capital stock thereafter on the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Company Certificates and Book-Entry Shares will cease to have any rights with respect to any Shares, except as otherwise provided for in this Agreement or by applicable Law. If after the Effective Time, Company Certificates or Book-Entry Shares (other than those representing Dissenting Shares, held by Parent or any subsidiary of Parent and shares held in the treasury of the Company) are presented to Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Payment Agent for any reason, they will be canceled and exchanged as provided in this  _Article II_. No interest will be paid or will accrue on any Merger Consideration payable to holders of Company Certificates or Book-Entry Shares pursuant to the provisions of this _Article II_. 

          ##### 

  

     

 (d) _Termination of Payment Fund_. Any portion of the Payment Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of the Company Certificates or Book-Entry Shares 12 months after the Effective Time will be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any holders of Company Certificates or Book-Entry Shares who have not theretofore complied with this _Article II_ may thereafter look only to Parent for payment of their claim for Merger Consideration. 

   

 (e) _No Liability_. None of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Payment Agent will be liable to any person in respect of any cash from the Payment Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Company Certificate or Book-Entry Share has not been surrendered immediately prior to the date on which the Merger Consideration would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity, any such cash distributions in respect of such Company Certificate or Book-Entry Share will, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto. 

   

 (f) _Investment of Payment Fund_. The Payment Agent will invest the cash in the Payment Fund as directed by Parent, on a daily basis. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments will be paid to Parent. Nothing contained herein and no investment losses resulting from investment of the Payment Fund will diminish the rights of any holder of Company Certificates or Book-Entry Shares to receive the applicable Merger Consideration. 

   

 (g) _Lost Certificates_. If any Company Certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Company Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, the posting by such person of a bond in such reasonable amount as Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Company Certificate, the Payment Agent will issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Company Certificate, the Merger Consideration due to such person pursuant to this Agreement. 

   

 Section 2.4 _Dissenters  Rights_. (a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by any Company stockholder who has neither voted in favor of the Merger nor consented thereto in writing and who has demanded properly in writing appraisal for such Company Common Stock in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (collectively, the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") will not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in  _Section 2.1(c)_, but rather, the holders of Dissenting Shares will be entitled only to payment of the appraised value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL (and, at the Effective Time, such Dissenting Shares will no longer be outstanding and will automatically be cancelled and will cease to exist, and such holders will cease to have any right with respect thereto, except the right to receive the appraised value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL);  _provided_ , _however_ , that if any such holder fails 

   ##### 

  

 

to perfect or otherwise waives, withdraws or loses the right to appraisal
under the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL, then the right of such
holder to be paid the appraised value of such holders Dissenting Shares will
cease and such Dissenting Shares will be deemed to have been converted as of
the Effective Time into, and to have become exchangeable solely for, the right
to receive the Merger Consideration, without interest, as provided in
_Section 2.1(c)_. 

   

 (b) The Company will notify Parent as promptly as reasonably practicable of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of any Company Common Stock, withdrawals thereof and any other instruments delivered to the Company pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL, and Parent will have the right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company will not, without the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing. Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Payment Agent pursuant to _Section 2.3_ to pay for Dissenting Shares will be returned to Parent upon demand; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent will remain liable to pay, or cause the Surviving Corporation to pay, the Merger Consideration with respect to any Company Common Stock covered by the proviso of _Section 2.4(a)_. 

   

 (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company acknowledges and agrees that in any appraisal proceeding under Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to Dissenting Shares and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall assert that the Top-Up Option, the Top-Up Option Shares or any cash or Promissory Note delivered by Merger Sub to the Company as payment for any Top-Up Option Shares should be considered in connection with the determination of the fair value of the Dissenting Shares in accordance with Section 262(h) of the DGCL. 

   

 Section 2.5 _Certain Adjustments_. If, after the date of this Agreement and at or prior to the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock are changed into a different number of shares by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, split-up, stock split, subdivision, combination or exchange of shares, or any dividend payable in stock or other securities is declared thereon or rights issued in respect thereof with a record date within such period, or any similar event occurs (any such action, an " _Adjustment Event_ "), the Merger Consideration will be adjusted accordingly to provide to the holders of Company Common Stock and the holders of Company Stock Options and other Share Unit awards granted under the Company Stock Plan (including Restricted Shares and Restricted Share Units) the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such Adjustment Event; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this _Section 2.5_ will be construed as permitting the Company to take any action or enter into any transaction otherwise prohibited by this Agreement. 

  

 Section 2.6 _Further Assurances_. At and after the Effective Time, the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation will be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company or Merger Sub, any deeds, bills of sale, 

   ##### 

  

 

assignments or assurances and to take and do, in the name and on behalf of the
Company or Merger Sub, any other actions and things to vest, perfect or
confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation any and all
right, title and interest in, to and under any of the rights, properties or
assets acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result of,
or in connection with, the Merger. 

   

 Section 2.7 _Withholding Rights_. The Surviving Corporation, Parent, Merger Sub or the Payment Agent, as the case may be, will be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any person such amounts, if any, as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and remitted to the appropriate taxing authority by the Surviving Corporation, Parent, Merger Sub or the Payment Agent, as the case may be, such amounts withheld will be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to such person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation, Parent, Merger Sub or the Payment Agent, as the case may be. 

  

III. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY 

   

 The Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub that, except as (i) set forth in the applicable section of the disclosure letter delivered by the Company to Parent in connection with the execution of this Agreement (the " _Company Disclosure Letter_ ") with specific reference to the section or subsection of the Company Disclosure Letter to which the information relates (it being understood that any information set forth in one section or subsection of the Company Disclosure Letter shall be deemed to apply to and qualify the representation or warranty set forth in this Agreement to which it corresponds in number and each other representation or warranty set forth in this Agreement to the extent that it is reasonably apparent on its face that such information is relevant to such other representation or warranty) or (ii) to the extent disclosed in, and reasonably apparent from, any report, schedule, form or other document filed with, or furnished to the SEC by the Company since January 1, 2009 and publicly available prior to the date of this Agreement (other than any forward-looking disclosures set forth in any risk factor section, any disclosures in any section relating to forward looking statements and any other similar disclosures included therein to the extent that they are predictive or forward-looking in nature):

The Company and each of the Company Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed to do business and is in good standing (with respect to jurisdictions that recognize such concept) in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the ownership, leasing or operation of its properties and other assets makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except for those jurisdictions 

    ##### 

 

   

where the failure to be so qualified or licensed or to be in good standing,
has not resulted and would not reasonably be expected to result, individually
or in the aggregate, in a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. The Company
has made available to Parent prior to the execution of this Agreement
complete and correct copies of the Company Charter and the bylaws of the
Company, and the comparable organizational documents of each Company
Subsidiary, each as amended to date. The Company Charter and the bylaws

Except for The Sycamore Group, LLC (" _Sycamore_ "), which is a joint venture owned 50% by a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, all outstanding shares of capital stock (or equivalent equity interests of entities other than corporations) of each of the Company Subsidiaries are beneficially owned, directly or indirectly, by the Company.

Except as otherwise provided in this _Section 3.3_ and except with respect to the Companys 9.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2012 (the " _2012 Notes_ ") and 4.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2017 (the " _2017 Notes_ "), there are not issued, reserved for issuance or outstanding (i) any shares of capital stock or other voting securities of the Company or

The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company and the consummation by the Company of the Transactions contemplated herein have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Company, subject, in the case of the Merger, to the Company Stockholder Approval, if applicable. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by Parent and Merger Sub, constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, except as the enforcement thereof may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar Laws generally affecting the rights of creditors and subject to general equity principles.

There is no default under any such Company Material Contract by the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or, to the Knowledge of the Company, by any other party thereto, and no event has occurred that with the lapse of time or the giving of notice or both would constitute a default thereunder by the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or, to the Knowledge of the Company, by any other party 

       #####

 Section 3.17 _Affiliate Transactions_.

Other than compensation and benefits received in the ordinary course of business as an employee or director of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries, no director, officer or other affiliate (as hereinafter defined) of the Company or any "associate" (as hereinafter defined) of any director, officer or other affiliate of the Company, directly or indirectly, has any interest in: (a) any contract, arrangement or understanding with, or relating to the business or operations of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, (b) any loan, arrangement, understanding, agreement or contract for or relating to indebtedness of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, or (c) any property (real, personal or mixed), tangible, or intangible, used or currently intended to be used in, the business or operations of the Company or any Company Subsidiary. Any contract, agreement, arrangement or understanding of any kind between any affiliate of the Company (other than any wholly owned Company Subsidiary), on the one hand, and the Company or any Company Subsidiary, on the other hand, is on terms no less favorable to the Company or to such Company Subsidiary than would be obtained with an unaffiliated third party on an arms-length basis. For purposes of this _Section 3.17_, the terms " _affiliate_ " and " _associate_ " have the meanings set forth in Rule 12b-2 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act; _provided_ , _however_ , that for purposes of this _Section 3.17_ , the term "associate" shall be deemed to include any corporation or organization of which any person is a beneficial owner of five percent or more of any class of securities of such corporation or organization.

The Company has made available to Parent copies of all such insurance policies and contracts. All such insurance policies, contracts, or programs of self-insurance are in full force and effect and are valid and enforceable and, in the reasonable judgment of senior management of the Company, cover against the risks normally insured against by entities in the same or similar lines of business. All premiums due thereunder have been paid. Neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries has received notice of cancellation of any such insurance policies, contracts and programs of self-insurance. 

  

 Section 3.19 _Voting Requirement_. The affirmative vote at the Company Stockholders Meeting of at least a majority of the votes entitled to be cast by the holders 

   ##### 

  

 

of outstanding shares of Company Common Stock is the only vote of the holders
of any class or series of the Companys capital stock necessary to adopt and
approve this Agreement and consummate the Merger and the other Transactions
contemplated herein if Section 253 of the DGCL will not permit the
consummation of the Merger without a meeting of the stockholders of the
Company (collectively, the " _Company Stockholder Approval_ "). 

   

 Section 3.20 _State Takeover Statutes_. The Board of Directors of the Company has taken all necessary action so that no "fair price," "moratorium," "control share acquisition" or other anti-takeover Law (each, a " _Takeover Statute_ ") (including the interested stockholder provisions codified in Section 203 of the DGCL) or any anti-takeover provision in the Company Charter or the Companys bylaws is applicable to this Agreement, the Tender and Voting Agreement, the Merger and the Transactions. No other Takeover Statute is applicable to this Agreement, the Merger or the other Transactions. 

  

 Section 3.21 _Opinion of Financial Advisor_. The Company has received the opinion of UBS Securities LLC, dated the date of this Agreement, to the effect that, as of such date, and based upon and subject to the assumptions, qualifications and limitations set forth in the opinion, the Offer Price is fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of shares of Company Common Stock, a signed copy of which opinion has been or will be provided to Parent for informational purposes only.

Except for UBS Securities LLC, no broker, investment banker, financial advisor or other person is entitled to any brokers, finders, financial advisors or other similar fee or commission in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of the Company. The Company has furnished to Parent true and complete copies of all agreements between the Company and UBS Securities LLC, or the Company and any other person, under which any such fees, commissions or expenses are payable and all indemnification and other agreements related to the engagement of the persons to whom such fees, commissions or expenses are payable. 

  

 Section 3.23 _Questionable Payments_. Except as would not be material to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries (nor, to the Knowledge of the Company, any of its or their respective Representatives) (a) has used or is using any corporate funds for any direct or indirect unlawful payments to any foreign or domestic government officials or employees, (b) has violated or is violating any provision of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, (c) has established or maintained, or is maintaining, any unlawful fund of corporate monies or other properties, or (d) has made any bribe, unlawful rebate, payoff, influence payment, kickback or other unlawful payment of any nature. 

  

 Section 3.24 _No Other Representations or Warranties_. Except for the representations and warranties contained in this Article III or in any certificates delivered by the Company in connection with the Closing, each of Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges that neither the Company nor any person on behalf of the Company 

    ##### 

 

  

makes any other express or implied representation or warranty with respect to
the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or with respect to any other
information provided or made available to Parent and Merger Sub in connection
with the Transactions. Neither the Company nor any other person will have or
be subject to any liability or indemnification obligation to Parent or
Merger Sub (or any of their financing sources) or any other person resulting
from the distribution to Parent or Merger Sub (or any of their financing
sources), or Parents or Merger Subs (or such financing sources) use of,
any such information, including any information, documents, projections,
forecasts or other material made available to Parent or Merger Sub in certain
"data rooms" or management presentations in expectation of the Transactions,
unless and then only to the extent that any such information is expressly
included in a representation or warranty contained in this _Article III_ or
in a certificate delivered by the Company in connection with the
Closing. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this
Agreement or otherwise, nothing herein will relieve the Company or any other
person from liability for fraud.

Each of Parent and Merger Sub is duly qualified or licensed to do business and is in good standing (with respect to jurisdictions that recognize such concept) in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the ownership, leasing or operation of its properties and other assets makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except for those jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or licensed or to be in good standing has not resulted and would not reasonably be 

   ##### 

  

 

expected to result, individually or in the aggregate, in a Material Adverse
Effect on Parent. Parent has made available to the Company prior to the

 (b) The execution and delivery by Parent and Merger Sub of this Agreement does not, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and compliance with the provisions of this Agreement will not, (i) conflict with or violate the certificate of incorporation or bylaws (or comparable organizational documents) of Parent or Merger Sub, (ii) result in any breach, violation, default or change of control rights (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise to a right of termination, modification, cancellation or creation or acceleration of any obligation or fee or right of a third party or loss of a benefit under, or result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the properties or assets of Parent or Merger Sub under any contract, loan or credit agreement, note, bond, mortgage, indenture, lease, sublease, license, easement, right of way or similar agreement granting rights in, over, or under any real property, or other agreement, instrument, permit, concession, franchise, license or similar authorization applicable to Parent, Merger Sub or their respective properties or assets, or (iii) subject to the governmental filings and other matters referred to in _Section 4.3(c),_ conflict with or violate any judgment, order, decree, writ, injunction, award, settlement, stipulation or Law applicable to Parent, Merger Sub or their respective properties or assets, other than, in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii),

As of the date of this Agreement, no action, demand, requirement or investigation by any Governmental Entity and no suit, action or proceeding by any person, in each case, with respect to Parent or any of its subsidiaries, or any of their respective properties, is pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened that would prohibit Parent or Merger Sub from entering into,

executing and complying with their obligations under this Agreement or from
consummating the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

   

 Section 4.6 _Funds_. The financing of (i) the Transactions, (ii) the payment of any indebtedness required to be repaid, redeemed, retired, canceled, terminated or otherwise satisfied in connection with the Transactions (including all indebtedness of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries required to be repaid, redeemed, retired, canceled, terminated or otherwise satisfied in connection with the Merger), and (iii) all fees and expenses reasonably expected to be incurred in connection therewith and all other amounts necessary to consummate the Transactions contemplated hereunder, will consist of debt financing provided to Parent (or loaned directly to the Company or one of the Company Subsidiaries) (such financing, together with any Alternative Financing, the " _Financing_ ").

The Financing Commitment has not been amended, waived, rescinded, withdrawn, supplemented or otherwise modified in any respect, except, in each case, as permitted by _Section 6.8 (a)_. As of the date of this Agreement, no event has occurred that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a default or breach on the part of any of Parent or Merger Sub, or to the Knowledge of Parent or Merger Sub, any other party thereto, under the Financing Commitment. As of the date of this Agreement, assuming the satisfaction of the Offer Conditions and the conditions set forth in _Section 7.1,_ the accuracy of the representations and warranties set forth in Article III and the compliance by the Company of its covenants and agreements hereunder, (i) none of Parent or Merger Sub has any reason to believe that it or any of the other parties to the Financing Commitment will be unable to satisfy on a timely basis any term or condition of the Financing Commitment required to be satisfied by it and (ii) none of Parent or Merger Sub has any reason to believe, as of the date of this Agreement, that any portion of the Financing to be made thereunder will otherwise not be available on or before the Business Day next succeeding the last day of the Marketing Period to consummate the Merger and the other Transactions contemplated hereby. Parent has fully paid any and all commitment fees or other fees required by the Financing Commitment to be paid by it on or prior to the date of this Agreement and shall in the future pay any such fees as 

   #####

and the Surviving Corporation with funds sufficient to satisfy all of their
obligations under this Agreement, including the payment of the Offer Price in
respect of each share of Company Common Stock validly tendered and accepted
for payment in the Offer, the aggregate Merger Consideration and all
associated costs and expenses. The obligations of the lenders to fund the
full amount of the Financing to Parent, Merger Sub or the
Surviving Corporation pursuant to the terms of the Financing Commitment are
not subject to any conditions other than the conditions set forth in the
Financing Commitment. There are no side contracts or understandings related
to the Financing other than as expressly set forth in the
Financing Commitment. As of the Offer Closing and the Closing, Parent and
Merger Sub will have readily available funds that are sufficient to effect
the Offer Closing and the Closing, as applicable, on the terms contemplated
hereby.

Incorporated, no broker, investment banker, financial advisor or other person is entitled to any brokers, finders, financial advisors or other similar fee or commission in connection with the Transactions based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of Parent. 

  

 Section 4.9 _Solvency_.

 Section 4.10 _No Other Representations or Warranties_. Except for the representations and warranties contained in this _Article IV_ or in any certificates delivered by Parent or Merger Sub in connection with the Closing, the Company acknowledges that neither Parent nor Merger Sub nor any person on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub makes any other express or implied representation or warranty with respect to Parent or any of Parents subsidiaries or with respect to any other information provided or made available to the Company in connection with the Transactions. No Parent Entity nor any other person will have or be subject to any liability or indemnification obligation to the Company or any other person resulting from the 

   ##### 

  

 

distribution to the Company, or the Companys use of, any such information,
including any information, documents, projections, forecasts or other
material made available to the Company in certain "data rooms" or management
presentations in expectation of the Transactions, unless and then only to the
extent that any such information is expressly included in a representation
or warranty contained in this _Article IV_ or in a certificate delivered by
Parent in connection with the Closing. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any
other provision of this Agreement or otherwise, nothing herein will relieve
Parent or Merger Sub or any other person from liability for fraud.

parties conducted heretofore with respect to, or that could reasonably be
expected to lead to, any Company Takeover Proposal, terminate all physical
and electronic dataroom access previously granted to any such parties and
their representatives and request the prompt return or destruction of all
confidential information previously furnished in connection therewith. From
and after the date of this Agreement, the Company will not, nor will it
permit any of the Company Subsidiaries to, nor will it authorize or permit
any of the Company Representatives to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit,
initiate or knowingly encourage, or knowingly take any other action designed

Appointment Time, in response to an unsolicited bona fide written Company
Takeover Proposal that the Board of Directors of the Company determines in
good faith (after consultation with the legal and financial advisors to the
Company) constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior
Proposal, and which Company Takeover Proposal was made after the date hereof
and did not otherwise result from a material breach of this  _Section 5.2_,
the Company may, if and to the extent that its Board of Directors
determines in good faith (after consulting with the legal and financial
advisors to the Company) that it is required to do so in order to comply with
its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company under the DGCL, and
subject to compliance with _Section 5.2(c)_, (i) furnish information
with respect to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to the person making
such Company Takeover Proposal (and its representatives) pursuant to a
confidentiality agreement that the Company determines in good faith is not
less restrictive of such person than the Confidentiality Agreement; 
_provided_ , _however_ , that all such information has previously been
provided to Parent or is provided to Parent prior to or substantially
concurrent with the time it is provided to such person, and (ii) participate
in discussions or negotiations with the person making such Company Takeover
Proposal (and its representatives) regarding such Company Takeover Proposal. 

   

 (b) _Definitions_. As used herein: 

   

 (i) " _Superior Proposal_ " means a bona fide written proposal from any person or group to acquire, directly or indirectly, including pursuant to a tender offer, exchange offer, merger, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction, for consideration consisting of cash and/or securities, a majority of the combined voting power of the Company then outstanding or a majority of the assets of the Company that the Board of Directors of the Company 

       ##### 

  

    

determines in its good faith judgment after consulting with its legal and
financial advisors would be more favorable from a financial point of view to
the stockholders of the Company than the Transactions (including any changes
proposed by Parent to the terms of this Agreement) and is reasonably likely
to receive all required governmental approvals on a timely basis and is
otherwise reasonably capable of being consummated on the terms proposed. 

   

 (ii) " _Company Takeover Proposal_ " means any inquiry, proposal or offer from any person relating to any (A) direct or indirect acquisition or purchase of a business that constitutes 25% or more of the net revenues, net income or the assets of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (B) direct or indirect acquisition or purchase of 25% or more of any class of equity securities of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, (C) any tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would result in any person beneficially owning 25% or more of any class of equity securities of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, or (D) any merger, consolidation, business combination, asset purchase, recapitalization or similar transaction involving the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, other than the Transactions. 

   

 (c) _Actions by the Company_. Neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof will (i) (A) withdraw or qualify (or modify in a manner adverse to Parent), or publicly propose to withdraw or qualify (or modify in a manner adverse to Parent), the approval, recommendation or declaration of advisability by such Board of Directors or any such committee thereof of this Agreement, the Merger or the other Transactions, (B) recommend, adopt or approve, or propose publicly to recommend, adopt or approve, or fail to reject, any Company Takeover Proposal, or (C) make any other public statement in connection with the Company Stockholders Meeting inconsistent with the Company Recommendation (any action described in this clause (i) being referred to as a " _Company Adverse Recommendation Change_ ") or (ii) approve or recommend, or propose to approve or recommend, or allow the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries to execute or enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or other similar agreement constituting or related to, or that is intended to or would reasonably be expected to lead to, any Company Takeover Proposal or requiring the Company to abandon, terminate, delay or fail to consummate, or that would otherwise impede, interfere with or be inconsistent with, the Merger or any of the other Transactions, or requiring the Company to fail to comply with this Agreement (an " _Acquisition Agreement_ ") (other than a confidentiality agreement referred to in  _Section 5.2(a)_). Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to the Appointment Time, if the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) that failure to do so could result in a breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, the Board of Directors of the Company may, (i) terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)(ii)_ and cause the Company to enter into an Acquisition Agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal (which was made after the date hereof and did not otherwise result from a breach of this _Section 5.2_) or (ii) in 

       ##### 

  

    

response to an Intervening Event or a Company Takeover Proposal that
constitutes a Superior Proposal, make a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change, if: (A) the Company provides written notice (a " _Notice of Adverse
Recommendation_ ") advising Parent that the Board of Directors of the
Company intends to take such action and specifying the reasons therefor and
including, as applicable, the most current version of any proposed agreement
reflecting the terms and conditions of any Superior Proposal that is the
basis of the proposed action by the Board of Directors (or a detailed
summary of such terms and conditions if no agreement exists) (it being
understood and agreed that any amendment to the financial terms or any other
material term of such Superior Proposal requires a new Notice of Adverse
Recommendation) or a detailed description of the Intervening Event if
the Company intends to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change in
response to an Intervening Event, (B) for a period of three Business Days
following Parents receipt of a Notice of Adverse Recommendation the Company
negotiates with Parent in good faith to make such adjustments to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement as would enable the Company to proceed with
its recommendation of this Agreement and the Transactions and not make such
Company Adverse Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 8.1(d)(ii)_, and (C) at the end of such three Business Day period,
the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith (after
consultation with outside counsel and a financial advisor of
nationally recognized reputation) that the Company Takeover Proposal giving
rise to the Notice of Adverse Recommendation constitutes a Superior Proposal
or determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel) that
failure to effect a Company Adverse Recommendation could result in a
breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law in light of the
Intervening Event giving rise to the Notice of Adverse Recommendation (after
taking into account such adjustments to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement proposed by Parent). No Company Adverse Recommendation Change
will change the approval of the Board of Directors of the Company for
purposes of causing any state takeover Law (including Section 203 of the
DGCL) or other state Law to be inapplicable to the Merger and the other
Transactions. 

   

 (d) _Notice of Company Takeover Proposal_. From and after the date of this Agreement, the Company will as promptly as practicable (but in any event within 24 hours of receipt) advise Parent and Merger Sub in writing of the receipt, directly or indirectly, of any inquiries, requests, discussions, negotiations or proposals relating to a Company Takeover Proposal, or any request for nonpublic information relating to any of the Company Entities by any person that informs the Company or any Company Representative that such person is considering making, or has made, a Company Takeover Proposal, or an inquiry from a person seeking to have discussions or negotiations relating to a possible Company Takeover Proposal. Such notice will be made orally and confirmed in writing, will indicate the material terms and conditions thereof and will include a copy of any such written inquiry, request or proposal and copies of any information provided to or by any third party relating thereto. The Company agrees that it will keep Parent promptly informed in all material respects of the status and details (including amendments or proposed amendments) of any such request, Company Takeover Proposal or inquiry and keep Parent promptly informed as to the details of any information requested of or provided by the Company and as to the details of all discussions or negotiations with respect to any such request, Company 

        ##### 

  

    

Takeover Proposal or inquiry, including by providing Parent a copy of all
material documentation or correspondence relating thereto as soon as
practicable (but in any event within 24 hours of receipt). 

   

 (e) _Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9, Item 1012(a) and Other Applicable Law_. Nothing contained in this _Section 5.2_ will prohibit the Company from (i) taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act ( _provided_ , that the Board of Directors of the Company expressly publicly reaffirms the Company Recommendation) or (ii) making any disclosure of facts to the stockholders of the Company if, in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors (after consultation with outside counsel), such disclosure of facts is required by applicable Law;  _provided_ , _however_ , that compliance with such rules and Laws will not in any way limit or modify the effect that any action taken pursuant to such rules and Laws has under any other provision of this Agreement, including that such compliance could result in a Company Adverse Recommendation Change. 

   

VI. ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS 

   

 Section 6.1 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_. To the extent permitted by applicable Law and subject to the agreement, dated February 25, 2011, between the Company and Parent, as supplemented by the March 15, 2011 letter agreement between the Company and Parent (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), the Company will, and will cause the Company Subsidiaries to, afford to Parent, Parents subsidiaries and its and their Representatives (collectively, the " _Parent Representatives_ ") reasonable access, during normal business hours during the period prior to the Effective Time, to all of the Company Entities properties, books, contracts, commitments, personnel and records and all other information concerning their business, properties and personnel as Parent or Merger Sub may reasonably request (including consultation with appropriate Company Representatives with respect to material litigation matters). Parent and Merger Sub will hold, and will cause their respective affiliates and the Parent Representatives to hold, any nonpublic information in accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries will not be required to provide access to or disclose information where such entity reasonably determines that such access or disclosure would jeopardize the attorney-client privilege or contravene any Law or any agreement to which it is a party; _provided_ , that such entity will use its reasonable best efforts to obtain any required consents and take such other action (such as the entry into a joint defense agreement or other arrangement to avoid loss of attorney-client privilege) to permit such access or disclosure. 

  

 Section 6.2 _Reasonable Best Efforts; Cooperation_. (a) _Reasonable Best Efforts_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, including Section 6.2(c), each of the parties agrees to use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, as promptly as reasonably practicable, the Merger and the other Transactions and to obtain satisfaction or waiver of the Offer Conditions 

   ##### 

  

 

and the conditions precedent to the Merger, including (i) the obtaining of all
necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents and approvals from
Governmental Entities and the making of all necessary registrations and
filings and the taking of all steps as may be necessary to obtain an approval
or waiver from, or to avoid an action or proceeding by, any Governmental
Entity, (ii) the obtaining of all necessary consents, approvals or waivers
from third parties, and (iii) the execution and delivery of any additional
instruments necessary to consummate the Transactions contemplated by, and to
fully carry out the purposes of, this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt,

separate or otherwise dispose of or conduct the business of the Company,
Parent and/or any of their respective affiliates in a manner which would

otherwise dispose of or conduct the business of the Company, Parent and/or any
of their respective affiliates in a manner which would resolve such

respective affiliates or the execution of any agreement or order to do so, and

respective affiliates in a manner which would resolve such objections or
suits; _provided_ , _however_ , that no party shall be required pursuant to
this _Section 6.2_ to commit to or effect any action that (i) is not
conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger or (ii) would, individually or
in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
Effect with respect to the Company or Parent (measured in relation to the
size of Parent as of the date of this Agreement and without giving effect to
the consummation of the Merger). In furtherance and not in limitation of the
foregoing, each of Parent and the Company agrees to make an appropriate filing
under the HSR Act with respect to the Transactions contemplated herein as
promptly as practicable and to supply as promptly as practicable any
additional information and documentary material that may be requested
pursuant to the HSR Act and, subject to the proviso in the immediately
preceding sentence, to take all other actions necessary to cause the
expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act
as soon as practicable. 

   

 (b) _No Takeover Statutes Apply_. In connection with and without limiting the foregoing, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub will (i) take all action necessary to ensure that no Takeover Statute or similar Law is or becomes applicable to the Merger, this Agreement or any of the other Transactions contemplated herein and (ii) if any Takeover Statute or similar Law becomes applicable to the Merger, this Agreement or any of the other Transactions contemplated herein, take all action necessary to ensure that the Merger and the other Transactions contemplated herein may be consummated as promptly as reasonably practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such Law on the Merger and the other Transactions. 

   

 (c) _Information Cooperation_. In connection with the efforts referenced in  _Section 6.2(a)_ to obtain all requisite approvals and authorizations for the Transactions under the HSR Act, and to obtain all such approvals and authorizations under any other applicable Antitrust Law, each of Parent and the Company will use its reasonable best efforts to (i) cooperate in all respects with each other in connection with any filing or 

       ##### 

  

    

submission and in connection with any investigation or other inquiry,
including any proceeding initiated by a private party, (ii) keep the other
party informed in all material respects of any material communication
received by such party from, or given by such party to, the Federal
Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice or any
other Governmental Entity and of any material communication received or given
in connection with any proceeding by a private party, in each case regarding
any of the Transactions contemplated herein, and (iii) permit the other party
to review any material communication given by it to, and consult with each
other in advance of any meeting or conference with, any such Governmental
Entity or in connection with any proceeding by a private party. Subject to
the Confidentiality Agreement and any attorney-client, work product or other
privilege, each of the parties hereto will coordinate and cooperate
fully with the other parties hereto in exchanging such information and
providing such assistance as such other parties may reasonably request in
connection with the foregoing and in seeking early termination of any
applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act. Any competitively
sensitive information that is disclosed pursuant to this _Section 6.2 (c)_
will be limited to each of Parents and the Companys respective counsel
pursuant to a separate customary confidentiality agreement. For purposes of

arising out of any act or failure to act by any Indemnified Party in respect
of any event or circumstance involving the Company, any Company Subsidiary or
their respective business, whether or not identified on the Company
Disclosure Letter, from and after the Appointment Time, each of Parent and
the Surviving Corporation, on behalf of themselves and their respective
subsidiaries, will indemnify to the fullest extent permitted by law and also
hold harmless, any Indemnified Party against any losses, claims, damages,

capacity as a member of any committee of the Board of Directors of the
Company), officer, employee or agent of the Company, any Company Subsidiaries
or any of their respective predecessors, a fiduciary with respect to any
employee benefit plan maintained by any of the foregoing, prior to the

Existing Litigation, or the events giving rise thereto, unless such
Indemnified Party otherwise consents, in its sole discretion, in writing to

indemnification hereunder. Parents and the Surviving Corporations
indemnification obligations under this _Section 6.3_ related to claims
already asserted and/or threatened and asserted hereafter shall continue until
the final disposition of any such Claim. 

   

 (c) _Successors and Assigns of Surviving Corporation_. In the event that the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or 

     #####

 (d) _Continuing Coverage_. For six years after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will maintain in effect directors and officers liability insurance covering acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time with respect to Indemnified Parties providing such coverage to the Indemnified Parties as "insureds" on terms with respect to such coverage and amount no less favorable than those of such current insurance coverage; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) in no event will Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required to expend in any one year an amount in excess of 350% of the annual premiums currently paid by the Company for such insurance, (ii) if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, Parent will be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding such amount, and (iii) at Parents option in lieu of the foregoing insurance coverage, the Surviving Corporation may purchase "tail" insurance coverage that provides similar coverage in all material respects to the coverage described above. The Surviving Corporation will cooperate with the Indemnified Parties, at the sole expense of Parent and the Surviving Corporation, in pursuing recoveries under any such insurance for the benefit of the Indemnified Parties, including if determined to be appropriate by an Indemnified Party, commencing litigation to recover under any such policy of insurance. 

   

 (e) _Intended Beneficiaries_. The provisions of this _Section 6.3_ (and any applicable general provision in _Section 6.5_) are (i) intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, his or her heirs and his, her or its representatives and (ii) in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such person may have by contract or otherwise. This Section 6.3 has been agreed to by the parties pursuant to Section 145(f) of the DGCL. 

   

 Section 6.4 _Public Announcements_. Parent and the Company will consult with each other before holding any press conferences, analyst calls or other public meetings or discussions and before publishing any press release or other public announcements with respect to the Transactions, including the Offer and the Merger, in each case other than any employee communications;  _provided_ that such communications do not specifically address Parents post-Closing obligations under _Section 6.7_. The parties will provide each other the opportunity to review and comment upon any press release or other public announcement or statement with respect to the Transactions, including the Offer and the Merger, and will not issue any such press release or other public announcement or statement prior to such consultation, except as may be required by applicable Law, court process or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities exchange. The parties agree that the initial press release or releases to be issued with respect to the Transactions contemplated by this Agreement will be mutually agreed upon prior to the issuance thereof. 

   ##### 

   

  

 Section 6.5 _Transaction Litigation_. The parties to this Agreement will cooperate and consult with one another, to the fullest extent possible, in connection with any stockholder litigation against any of them or any of their respective directors or officers with respect to the Transactions and the Company shall permit Parent to participate in the defense or settlement of any such litigation. In furtherance of and without in any way limiting the foregoing, each of the parties will use its respective reasonable best efforts consistent with the respective fiduciary duties of each parties board of directors to defend such litigation so as to permit the consummation of the Transactions in the manner contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company agrees that it will not compromise or settle any litigation commenced against it or its directors or officers relating to this Agreement or the Transactions contemplated herein (including the Merger) without Parents prior written consent, which will not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. 

  

 Section 6.6 _Section 16(b)_. Parent and the Company will take all steps reasonably necessary to cause the Transactions contemplated herein and any other dispositions of equity securities of the Company (including derivative securities) in connection with this Agreement by each individual who is a director or officer of the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act. 

  

 Section 6.7 _Employee Benefit Matters_. (a) _Company Employees_. Until December 31, 2011, Parent will, or will cause the Surviving Corporation to, provide, or cause to be provided, compensation and benefits to the employees and former employees of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries (the " _Company Employees_ ") that are no less favorable, in the aggregate, than the compensation and benefits provided to such Company Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time. For a period beginning on January 1, 2012 through June 30, 2013, Parent will, or will cause the Surviving Corporation to, provide, or cause to be provided, compensation and benefits to the Company Employees that are substantially similar in the aggregate to the compensation and benefits provided to similarly situated employees of Parent as of January 1, 2012. Nothing herein is intended to prevent Parent or the Surviving Corporation from terminating the employment of any Company Employee; _provided_ that Parent and the Surviving Corporation comply with the terms of any severance arrangements applicable to such Company Employee. 

  

 (b) _Benefit Plans_. Parent will, and will cause the Surviving Corporation to, honor in accordance with their terms all Company Benefit Plans, including any rights or benefits arising as a result of the Transactions contemplated by this Agreement (either alone or in combination with any other event) and the parties will take all actions necessary to effectuate the provisions set forth in _Section 6.7(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that Parent or the Surviving Corporation may amend, modify or terminate any individual plan or arrangement in accordance with its terms and applicable Law (including obtaining the consent of the other parties to and beneficiaries of such plan or arrangement to the extent required thereunder); _provided_ , _further_ , that with respect to any Company Benefit Plan that provides post-retirement medical benefits to Company Employees at any Company location prior to the Closing Date, Parent may, or may cause the Surviving Corporation to, provide such coverage to 

       ##### 

   

    

those employees, either under the Company Benefit Plan or a program maintained
by Parent for similarly situated employees (the applicable plan, a " _Retiree
Medical Plan_ "). Parent hereby acknowledges that the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement constitute a change of control or
change in control, as the case may be, for all purposes under each
Company Benefit Plan. 

   

 (c) _Credit for Service_. Parent will, and will cause its affiliates to, provide credit for each Company Employees length of service with the Company and its affiliates (as well as service with any predecessor employer of the Company or any of its affiliates, to the extent that service with the predecessor employer is recognized by the Company or such affiliate) for all purposes (including eligibility, vesting and benefit level, but not for purposes of any benefit accrual under any cash balance or defined benefit plan) under each plan, program, policy or arrangement of Parent and its affiliates (including vacation, paid time-off and severance arrangements) to the same extent that such service was recognized under a similar plan, program, policy or arrangement of the Company or any of its affiliates, except that no such prior service credit will be required or provided to the extent that (i) it results in a duplication of benefits; or (ii) it might be deemed to allow any Company Employee to participate in any Retiree Medical Plan of Parent or the Surviving Corporation that ceased to allow new participants on a date prior to the Closing Date (except to the extent that Parent elects to allow such participation to a Company Employee who was participating in a Retiree Medical Plan of the Company prior to the Closing Date, as contemplated by the second proviso of _Section 6.7(b)_). 

   

 (d) _Welfare Plans_. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, Parent will cause each benefit plan of Parent and its affiliates in which any Company Employee participates that is a health or welfare benefit plan (collectively, the " _Parent Welfare Plans_ ") to (i) waive all limitations as to preexisting conditions, exclusions and service conditions (other than any Retiree Medical Plans) with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to Company Employees, other than limitations that were in effect with respect to such Company Employees as of the Closing Date under the corresponding Company Benefit Plan or to the extent that such pre-existing condition limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and waiting periods would not have been satisfied or waived under the comparable Company Benefit Plan immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) honor any payments, charges and expenses of such Company Employees (and their eligible dependents) that were applied toward the deductible and out-of-pocket maximums under the corresponding Company Benefit Plan in satisfying any applicable deductibles, out-of-pocket maximums or co-payments under a corresponding Parent Welfare Plan during the calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs, and (iii) with respect to any medical plan (other than any Retiree Medical Plan), waive any waiting period limitation or evidence of insurability requirement that would otherwise be applicable to a Company Employee following the Closing Date to the extent such employee had satisfied any similar limitation under the corresponding Company Benefit Plan or to the extent that such pre-existing condition limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and waiting periods would not have been satisfied or waived under the comparable Company Benefit Plan immediately prior to the Effective Time. In addition, to the extent that any Company Employee has begun a 

       ##### 

   

    

course of treatment with a physician or other service provider who is
considered "in network" under a Company Benefit Plan and such course of
treatment is not completed prior to the Closing, Parent will use its
reasonable best efforts to arrange for transition care, whereby such
Company Employee may complete the applicable course of treatment with the
pre-Closing physician or other service provider at "in network" rates;
_provided_ that the treatment is completed during the calendar year in which
the Effective Time occurs. 

   

 (e) _Annual Bonus Program_. Within 15 calendar days following the Closing Date, Parent will, or will cause the Surviving Corporation to, make a payment to each participant in the Companys 2011 annual bonus program (the " _Annual Bonus Program_ ") in an amount equal to the greater of (i) the actual amount due to such employee under the terms of the Annual Bonus Program based on performance through the Closing Date, assuming (A) full achievement of all individual performance goals, (B) full payment in respect of the discretionary component of such bonus, (C) without regard to any negative discretion under the Annual Bonus Program to adjust the bonus amount, and (D) without regard to any charges relating to, or arising from, the Transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (ii) the participants target bonus amount under the Annual Bonus Program (the " _2011 Annual Bonus Amount_ "). The 2011 Annual Bonus Amount will be pro rated (determined by the number of days between January 1, 2011 and the Closing Date over 365). _Section 6.7(e)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter provides information regarding the number of participants in the Companys Annual Bonus Program and the estimated aggregate target bonus amount. Within 15 calendar days following the date of this Agreement, the Company will provide to Parent a list that sets forth the name of each participant in the Annual Bonus Program and such participants target bonus amount under the Annual Bonus Program. 

   

 (f) _No Third-Party Beneficiaries._ Nothing in this _Section 6.7_ will (i) confer any rights upon any person, including any Company Employee or former employees of the Company, other than the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns, (ii) constitute or create an employment agreement, or (iii) constitute or be treated as the amendment, modification or adoption of any employee benefit plan of Parent, the Company of any of their affiliates. 

   

 Section 6.8 _Financing_. (a) Parent shall use, and shall cause its affiliates to use, reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to keep the financing commitment in full force and effect and to arrange the Financing on the terms and conditions described in the Financing Commitment, including using reasonable best efforts (i) to negotiate and enter into, and keep in effect, the definitive agreements with respect thereto on the terms and conditions contained in the Financing Commitment (or on other terms acceptable to Parent, _provided_ such terms do not contain any conditions to funding on the Offer Closing Date and the Closing Date that are not set forth in the Financing Commitment and would not otherwise reasonably be expected to impair or delay the consummation of the Financing), (ii) to satisfy (or cause its affiliates to satisfy) on a timely basis all conditions applicable to Parent and its subsidiaries to obtaining the 

   ##### 

   

 

Financing set forth in the Financing Commitment that are within their control
and to otherwise comply with all of their obligations under the Financing
Commitments, and (iii) to consummate the Financing contemplated by the
Commitment Letter at or prior to the Offer Closing and the Closing, as
applicable, including using its reasonable best efforts to cause the lenders
and the other persons providing such Financing to fund the Financing required
to consummate the Offer at the Offer Closing and the Merger at the Closing
(including seeking specific performance to cause the Financing to be
consummated in accordance with the Financing Commitments). Parent and Merger
Sub shall keep the Financing Commitment in full force and effect and not
modify, amend, waive, supplement or otherwise alter the Financing Commitment
or the definitive agreements with respect thereto or any of the terms
thereof, except that Parent shall have the right from time to time to amend,
replace, supplement or otherwise modify, or waive any of their rights under,
the Financing Commitment or the definitive agreements with respect thereto,
and/or substitute other debt or equity financing for all or any portion of
the Financing Commitment from the same and/or alternative financing sources;
_provided_ , that any such amendment, replacement, supplement or other
modification to or waiver of any provision of the Financing Commitment or such
definitive agreements that amends the Financing Commitment and/or
substitution of all or any portion of the Financing shall not (A) expand upon
the conditions precedent to the Financing as set forth in the Financing
Commitment or (B) prevent, impede or delay the consummation of the Offer and
the Merger and the other Transactions. Parent shall be permitted to reduce
the amount of Financing under the Financing Commitment or the definitive
agreements with respect thereto in its reasonable discretion; _provided_ ,
that Parent shall not reduce the Financing to an amount committed below the
amount that is required to consummate the Offer and the Merger and the
other Transactions; and _provided_ _further_ that such reduction shall not
(I) expand upon the conditions precedent to the Financing as set forth in the
Financing Commitment or (II) prevent, impede or delay the consummation of the
Offer and the Merger and the other Transactions. In the event that any
portion of the Financing becomes unavailable or Parent becomes aware of any
event or circumstance that makes any portion of the Financing unavailable, in
each case, on the terms and conditions set forth in the Financing Commitment
and such portion is reasonably required, together with the financial
resources of Parent, including cash on hand, marketable securities and
the proceeds of loans under existing revolving credit facilities of Parent or
its subsidiaries, to consummate the Offer and the Merger and the other
Transactions, Parent shall notify the Company within 24 hours, and Parent
shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain, as promptly as practicable
following the occurrence of such event, any such portion from alternative
sources (" _Alternative Financing_ ") on terms that will still enable Parent
to consummate the Transactions;  _provided_ , that without the prior written
approval of the Company, no such alternative financing shall be on terms and
conditions (including any "flex" provisions and conditions to funding) that
are not, in the aggregate, at least as favorable to Parent and the Company
(as determined in the reasonable judgment of Parent) as those in the
Financing Commitment and otherwise in compliance with this Agreement. Parent
shall deliver to the Company true and complete copies of all agreements
related to such Alternative Financing (excluding fee letters and engagement
letters, except to the extent that such documents contain any conditions to
funding or "flex" provisions (excluding provisions 

    

-57- 

      

* * *

 

##### 

 

  

related solely to fees and economic terms agreed to by the parties)). Parent
shall refrain (and shall cause its affiliates to refrain) from taking,
directly or indirectly, any action that would reasonably be expected to
result in a failure of any of the conditions contained in the Financing
Commitment or in any definitive agreement related to the Financing. Parent
shall keep the Company reasonably informed on a current basis of the status
of its efforts to obtain the Financing, promptly provide the Company copies
of all documents related to the Financing (excluding fee letters and
engagement letters, except to the extent that such documents contain any
conditions to funding, "flex" provisions or other substantive provisions
(excluding provisions related solely to fees and economic terms agreed to by
the parties)) or regarding the terms and conditions of the Financing and give
the Company notice of any material breach by any party to the
Financing Commitment of which Parent becomes aware or any termination of the
Financing Commitment, such notice to be given within 24 hours after Parent
becomes so aware.

none of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries shall be required to
pay any commitment or other fee, provide any security or incur any other

Subsidiaries (including disclosures incorporated by reference in the Debt
Offers) that is judicially determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to
have contained a material misstatement or omission. 

   

 (c) Parent acknowledges and agrees that neither the pendency nor the consummation of any Debt Offer, redemption, satisfaction, discharge or defeasance with respect to the Notes is a condition to Parents obligations to consummate the Merger and the other Transactions. 

   

 Section 6.10 _State Takeover Laws_. If any "control share acquisition," "fair price" or other anti-takeover laws or regulations enacted under state or federal Laws becomes or is deemed to become applicable to the Company, the Offer, the acquisition of Shares pursuant to the Offer, the Merger or any other Transaction, then the Board of Directors of the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to, including taking all necessary actions and granting such necessary approvals so as to, render such statute (or the relevant provisions thereof) inapplicable to the foregoing so that the Offer, the Merger and the other Transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated herein. 

  

 Section 6.11 _Rule 14d-10(d) Matters_. Prior to the Appointment Time, the Company (acting through the compensation committee of the Board of Directors of the Company) will take all such steps as may be required (a) to cause each agreement, arrangement or understanding entered into by the Company or the Company Subsidiaries on or after the date hereof with any of its officers, directors or employees pursuant to which consideration is paid to such officer, director or employee to be approved as an "employment compensation, severance or other employee benefit arrangement" within the meaning of Rule 14d-10(d)(1) of the Exchange Act (including amendments to existing change in control agreements entered into by the Company and certain of the Companys executive officers and other employees, in each case in connection with the Transactions) and (b) to satisfy the requirements of the non-exclusive safe harbor set forth in Rule 14d-10(d)(2) of the Exchange Act.

EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE EITHER OF SUCH WAIVERS, (II) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVERS, (III) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVERS VOLUNTARILY, AND (IV) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS  _SECTION 9.8_ (b). 

   

 Section 9.9 _Specific Enforcement_. The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not 

   ##### 

  

 

performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached.
The parties accordingly agree that the parties will be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in any
federal court located in the State of Delaware or a Delaware state court, this
being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in
equity. 

   

 Section 9.10 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties at any time before or after the Company Stockholder Approval, if applicable; _provided_ , _however_ , that, after such approval, there is not to be made any amendment that by Law requires further approval by the stockholders of the Company or the stockholders of Parent, as applicable, without further approval of such stockholders. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties. 

  

 Section 9.11 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, a party may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other party, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other party contained in this Agreement or in any document delivered pursuant to this Agreement, or (c) subject to the proviso of _Section 9.10_, waive compliance by the other parties with any of the agreements or conditions contained in this Agreement. Any agreement on the part of a party to any such extension or waiver will be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. The failure of any party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise will not constitute a waiver of such rights. 

  

 Section 9.12 _Severability_. If any term or provision of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or Governmental Entity to be invalid, void or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction, such holding shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions of this Agreement or the validity or enforceability or application of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision in any other situation or in any other jurisdiction. If a final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable, the parties hereto agree that the court making such determination shall have the power to limit such term or provision, to delete specific words or phrases or to replace such term or provision with a suitable and equitable term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this Agreement shall be valid and enforceable as so modified. In the event such court does not exercise the power granted to it in the prior sentence, the parties hereto agree to replace such invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a valid and enforceable term or provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of such invalid or unenforceable term or provision.

 SIXTH. A director of the Corporation shall not be liable to the Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except to the extent such exemption from liability or limitation thereof is not permitted under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware as the same exists or may hereafter be amended. Any amendment, modification or repeal of the foregoing sentence shall not adversely affect any right or protection of a director of the corporation hereunder in respect of any act or omission occurring prior to the time of such amendment, modification or repeal. 

   ##### 

  

  

 SEVENTH. (a) The Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law as it presently exists or may hereafter be amended, any person (a "Covered Person") who was or is made or is threatened to be made a party or is otherwise involved in any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (a "proceeding"), by reason of the fact that he or she, or a person for whom he or she is the legal representative, is or was a director or officer of the Corporation or, while a director or officer of the Corporation, is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another Corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust, enterprise or nonprofit entity, including service with respect to employee benefit plans, against all liability and loss suffered and expenses (including attorneys fees) reasonably incurred by such Covered Person. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c) of this Article Seventh, the Corporation shall be required to indemnify a Covered Person in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) commenced by such Covered Person only if the commencement of such proceeding (or part thereof) by the Covered Person was authorized in the specific case by the Board of Directors of the Corporation. 

  

 (b) The Corporation shall to the fullest extent not prohibited by applicable law pay the expenses (including attorneys fees) incurred by a Covered Person in defending any proceeding in advance of its final disposition, provided, however, that, to the extent required by law, such payment of expenses in advance of the final disposition of the proceeding shall be made only upon receipt of an undertaking by the Covered Person to repay all amounts advanced if it should be ultimately determined that the Covered Person is not entitled to be indemnified under this Article Seventh or otherwise. 

  

 (c) If a claim for indemnification (following the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding) or advancement of expenses under this Article Seventh is not paid in full within thirty days after a written claim therefor by the Covered Person has been received by the Corporation, the Covered Person may file suit to recover the unpaid amount of such claim and, if successful in whole or in part, shall be entitled to be paid the expense of prosecuting such claim to the fullest extent permitted by law. In any such action the Corporation shall have the burden of proving that the Covered Person is not entitled to the requested indemnification or advancement of expenses under applicable law. 

  

 (d) The rights conferred on any Covered Person by this Article Seventh shall not be exclusive of any other rights which such Covered Person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of the certificate of incorporation, these bylaws, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise. 

  

 (e) The Corporations obligation, if any, to indemnify or to advance expenses to any Covered Person who was or is serving at its request as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, enterprise or nonprofit entity shall be reduced by any amount such Covered Person may collect as indemnification or advancement of expenses from such other corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, enterprise or non-profit enterprise. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (f) Any repeal or modification of the foregoing provisions of this Article Seventh shall not adversely affect any right or protection hereunder of any Covered Person in respect of any act or omission occurring prior to the time of such repeal or modification.

        |   | ANNEX I 
 Conditions to Offer  
---|---|--- 
   

  

 Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Offer, but subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Agreement and any applicable rules and regulations of the SEC, including Rule 14e-l(c) under the Exchange Act, Merger Sub shall not be required to accept for payment, and shall not be obligated to pay for any validly tendered Shares if (a) the Minimum Condition shall not have been satisfied at any then scheduled Expiration Time, (b) any waiting period (including any extension thereof) applicable to the consummation of the Transactions under the HSR Act shall not have expired or been terminated at or prior to any then scheduled Expiration Time (the " _HSR Condition_ "), or (c) any of the following conditions exist or have occurred and shall be continuing at the scheduled Expiration Time: 

  

 (i) any judgment, order, decree or Law shall have been entered, enacted, promulgated, enforced or issued by any court or other Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction or other legal restraint or prohibition shall be in effect enjoining or otherwise preventing the making of the Offer, the acceptance for payment of any Shares by Parent, Merger Sub or any other affiliate of Parent, the consummation of the Top-Up Option, the consummation of the Merger, Parent or Merger Subs full rights of ownership and voting of the Shares or Parent or Merger Subs ownership or operation of the Company, other than the application of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act; 

  

 (ii) any of the representations and warranties of the Company contained in _Section 3.1_ (Organization, Standing and Corporate Power), _Section 3.4_ (Authority; Noncontravention),  _Section 3.19_ (Voting Requirement), _Section 3.20_ (State Takeover Statutes) and _Section 3.22_ (Brokers) shall not be true and correct, in all material respects, as of the date of this Agreement and as of the scheduled Expiration Time as though made at such time (except to the extent such representations and warranties expressly relate to an earlier date, in which case as of such earlier date), (ii) the representations and warranties of the Company contained in _Section 3.3_ (Capital Structure) shall not be true and correct in all but de minimis respects as of the date of this Agreement and as of the scheduled Expiration Time as though made at such time (except to the extent such representations and warranties expressly relate to an earlier date, in which case as of such earlier date), (iii) the representations and warranties of the Company contained in the first sentence of _Section 3.6_ (Absence of Certain Changes) shall not be true and correct in all respects as of the date of this Agreement and as of the scheduled Expiration Time as though made at such time (except to the extent such representations and warranties expressly relate to an earlier date, in which case as of such earlier date) and (iv) all other representations and warranties of the Company set forth in Article III herein shall not be true and correct in all respects (without giving effect to any materiality or material adverse effect qualifications contained therein) both when made and as of the scheduled Expiration Time, as if made at and as of such time (except to the extent expressly made as of an earlier date, in which case as of such date), except where the failure of such other representations and warranties to not be so true and correct would not reasonably be expected to result, individually or in the aggregate, in a Material Adverse Effect on the Company; 

   ##### 

  

  

 (iii) the Company shall not have performed in all material respects all of its obligations required to be performed by it under this Agreement at or prior to the then scheduled Expiration Time; 

  

 (iv) there shall have occurred any change, effect, event, circumstance, state of facts, occurrence or development that, individually or taken together, has had or would reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect on the Company following the date of this Agreement; 

  

 (v) the Company shall have failed to deliver to Parent a certificate dated the Offer Closing Date signed on its behalf by its Chief Financial Officer or Chief Executive Officer to the effect that none of the conditions set forth in clauses (ii), (iii) and (iv) above shall have occurred and be continuing as of the expiration of the Offer; or 

  

 (vi) this Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its terms. 

  

 Notwithstanding anything in this _Annex I_ or this Agreement to the contrary, if the Marketing Period has not ended at the time of the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in this _Annex I_ (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Offer Closing), then the Offer Closing shall occur instead on the date following the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions that is the earliest to occur of (a) any Business Day before or during the Marketing Period as may be specified by Parent on no less than two Business Days prior notice to the Company and (b) the first Business Day after the final day of the Marketing Period. For the avoidance of doubt, this paragraph shall be deemed to constitute an Offer Condition. 

  

 The foregoing conditions (including those set forth in the initial paragraph) are for the benefit of Parent and Merger Sub and may be asserted by Parent or Merger Sub regardless of the circumstances giving rise to any such conditions and may be waived by Parent or Merger Sub (other than the Minimum Condition or the HSR Condition with respect to which such waiver will only be effective with the written agreement of the Company) in whole or in part at any time and from time to time in its reasonable discretion, in each case, subject to the terms of this Agreement and applicable Law. The failure by Parent or Merger Sub at any time to exercise any of the foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any such right and each such right shall be deemed an ongoing right which may be asserted at any time and from time to time.
