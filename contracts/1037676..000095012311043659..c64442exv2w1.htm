in any situation in any jurisdiction, such holding shall not affect the validity or
enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions of this Agreement or the validity or
enforceability or application of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision in any other
situation or in any other jurisdiction. If a final judgment of a court of competent
jurisdiction declares that any term or provision of this Agreement is invalid or
unenforceable, the parties hereto agree that the court making such determination shall have
the power to limit such term or provision, to delete specific words or phrases or to replace
such term or provision with a suitable and equitable term or provision that is valid and

event such court does not exercise the power granted to it in the prior sentence, the parties
hereto agree to replace such invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a valid and
enforceable term or provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the economic,
business and other purposes of such invalid or unenforceable term or provision.
