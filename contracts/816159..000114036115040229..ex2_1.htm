7.3(d)(i)(D)_.

  

  

(iv) Upon delivery by the Equityholders to the Purchaser of the duly executed
Assignment and Assumption Agreement, the Purchaser shall pay, by wire transfer
of immediately available funds to the accounts designated by each Equityholder
as set forth on _Exhibit A_ (as may be updated from time to time by written

 _Section 2.4_ _Working Capital Adjustment_.

  

  

(a) Not later than five Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company
shall have caused to be prepared and delivered to the Purchaser (i) a
statement (the "Estimated Net Working Capital Statement") setting forth the
Company's reasonable and good faith estimate of the Closing Date Net Working
Capital and the components and calculations thereof (including all material
back-up documents and working papers used to prepare the Estimated Net Working
Capital Statement) as of 11:59 p.m., Mountain standard time on the day
immediately preceding the Closing Date and (ii) a statement (the "Estimated
Net Working Capital Adjustment Statement") setting forth the calculation of
the amount by which the estimated Closing Date Net Working Capital as shown on
the Estimated Net Working Capital Statement (the "Estimated Net Working
Capital") either (A) exceeds the Target Net Working Capital or (B) is less
than the Target Net Working Capital. After delivery of the Estimated Net
Working Capital Statement and the Estimated Net Working Capital Adjustment
Statement to the Purchaser, the Purchaser will have the opportunity to review
each of the Estimated Net Working Capital Statement and the Estimated Net
Working Capital Adjustment Statement, and the Equityholder Representative and
the Purchaser shall work together in good faith to address any reasonable
requests for adjustments to the Estimated Net Working Capital Statement and
the Estimated Net Working Capital Adjustment Statement made by the Purchaser
on or prior to the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , if the Purchaser and
the Equityholder Representative are unable to resolve any disagreement
relating to the Estimated Net Working Capital Statement or the Estimated Net
Working Capital Adjustment Statement prior to the Closing, the Estimated Net
Working Capital Statement and the Estimated Net Working Capital Adjustment
Statement delivered to the Purchaser shall be used for purposes of the
estimate of the Closing Date Net Working Capital.

  

  

 

14  

  

(b) Within 90 calendar days following the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall
cause to be prepared and delivered to the Equityholder Representative (i) a
statement (the "Net Working Capital Statement") setting forth the Closing Date
Net Working Capital and the components and calculations thereof (which shall
be in a substantially similar form as the Estimated Net Working Capital
Statement, and shall include the same type and level of back-up documents and
working papers that were used to prepare the Estimated Net Working Capital
Statement) as of 11:59 p.m., Mountain standard time on the day immediately
preceding the Closing Date and (ii) a statement (the "Net Working Capital
Adjustment Statement") setting forth the calculation of the amount by which
the Closing Date Net Working Capital as shown on the Net Working Capital
Statement either (A) exceeds the Estimated Net Working Capital (as such amount
may be adjusted pursuant to this _Section 2.4_ , the "Net Working Capital
Excess Amount") or (B) is less than the Estimated Net Working Capital (as such
amount may be adjusted pursuant to this _Section 2.4_ , the "Net Working
Capital Deficiency Amount").

  

  

(c) After receipt of the Net Working Capital Statement and the Net Working
Capital Adjustment Statement, the Equityholder Representative shall have 30
calendar days to review the Net Working Capital Statement and the Net Working
Capital Adjustment Statement. The Purchaser shall give, or cause to be given,
to the Equityholder Representative and its Representatives reasonable access
to all documents, records and the employees of the Company and the Purchaser
used in the preparation of the Net Working Capital Statement and the Net
Working Capital Adjustment Statement, to the extent such employees are
employed by the Company or the Purchaser at such time. Each of the Parties
shall, following the Closing through the date that the Net Working Capital
Statement and Net Working Capital Adjustment Statement become final, binding
and conclusive in accordance with this _Section 2.4_ , take all actions
necessary or desirable to maintain and preserve all accounting books, records,
policies and procedures on which the Estimated Net Working Capital Statement,
and the Net Working Capital Adjustment Statement are to be based, so as not to
impede or delay the determination of the Net Working Capital Statement or the
Net Working Capital Adjustment Statement. Not later than 30 calendar days
following the date of receipt of the Net Working Capital Statement and the Net
Working Capital Adjustment Statement, the Equityholder Representative may
provide the Purchaser with a written notice (a "Working Capital Dispute
Notice") listing those items, if any, to which the Equityholder Representative
takes exception, which notice shall also (i) specifically identify, and
provide a reasonably detailed explanation, of the basis upon which the
Equityholder Representative has delivered such list, (ii) set forth the amount
of Closing Date Net Working Capital that the Equityholder Representative has
calculated based on the information contained in the Net Working Capital
Statement and (iii) specifically identify the Equityholder Representative's
proposed adjustment(s). Unless the Equityholder Representative delivers the
Working Capital Dispute Notice to the Purchaser setting forth the specific
items disputed by the Equityholder Representative on or prior to the 30th
calendar day following the Equityholder Representative's receipt of the Net
Working Capital Statement and the Net Working Capital Adjustment Statement,
the Equityholder Representative shall be deemed to have accepted and agreed to
the Net Working Capital Statement and the Net Working Capital Adjustment
Statement and such statements (and the calculations contained therein) shall
be final, binding and conclusive. If the Equityholder Representative timely
provides the Purchaser with a Working Capital Dispute Notice, the Equityholder
Representative and the Purchaser shall, within 15 calendar days following
receipt of such Working Capital Dispute Notice by the Purchaser (the "WC
Resolution Period"), negotiate in good faith to resolve their differences with
respect to the items specified in the Working Capital Dispute Notice (the "WC
Disputed Items"), and all other undisputed items (and all calculations
relating thereto) shall be final, binding and conclusive. Any written
resolution by the Equityholder Representative and the Purchaser during the WC
Resolution Period as to any WC Disputed Items shall be final, binding and
conclusive.

  

  

 

15  

  

(d) If the Equityholder Representative and the Purchaser, notwithstanding such
good faith effort, fail to resolve all WC Disputed Items by the end of the WC
Resolution Period, then within 15 calendar days following the expiration of
the WC Resolution Period the Equityholder Representative and the Purchaser
jointly shall engage the Neutral Arbitrator to resolve all WC Disputed Items
remaining in dispute. The Neutral Arbitrator shall act as an arbitrator (and
not an auditor) to determine only those WC Disputed Items remaining in
dispute, consistent with this _Section 2.4_ , and shall request a statement
from each of the Equityholder Representative and the Purchaser regarding such
remaining WC Disputed Items, which will set forth each Party's calculations
relating to such WC Disputed Items. The Neutral Arbitrator shall consider only
those WC Disputed Items that the Equityholder Representative, on the one hand,
and the Purchaser, on the other hand, are unable to resolve. In resolving any
disputed item, the Neutral Arbitrator may not assign a value to any item
greater than the greatest value for such item claimed by any Party or less
than the smallest value for such item claimed by any Party. The scope of the
disputes to be arbitrated by the Neutral Arbitrator is limited to whether the
preparation of the Net Working Capital Statement and the Net Working Capital
Adjustment Statement were done in accordance with this Agreement, and whether
there were mathematical errors in the preparation of the Net Working Capital
Statement and the Net Working Capital Adjustment Statement, and the Neutral
Arbitrator is not to make any other determination. All fees and expenses
relating to the work, if any, to be performed by the Neutral Arbitrator shall
be borne by the Party or Parties whose aggregate estimate of the WC Disputed
Items differs most greatly from the determination of the Neutral Arbitrator.
In addition, the Parties shall give the Neutral Arbitrator access to all
documents, records and employees, to the extent such employees are employed by
the Company and/or its Subsidiaries at such time, as reasonably necessary to
perform its function as arbitrator. The Neutral Arbitrator shall deliver to
the Equityholder Representative and the Purchaser a written determination
(such determination to include a work sheet setting forth all material
calculations used in arriving at such determination and to be based solely on
information provided to the Neutral Arbitrator by the Equityholder
Representative and the Purchaser) of the WC Disputed Items submitted to the
Neutral Arbitrator within 30 calendar days following receipt of such WC
Disputed Items (or as soon thereafter as practicable), which determination
shall be final, binding and conclusive.

  

  

 

16  

  

(e) The final, binding and conclusive Net Working Capital Statement and Net
Working Capital Adjustment Statement, in each case, based either upon
agreement by the Equityholder Representative and the Purchaser, the written
determination delivered by the Neutral Arbitrator in accordance with this
_Section 2.4_ or the Equityholder Representative's failure to notify the
Purchaser, in accordance with this _Section 2.4_ , of its objections to either
the Net Working Capital Statement or the Net Working Capital Adjustment
Statement (or any calculations contained therein) shall be the "Conclusive Net
Working Capital Statement" and the "Conclusive Net Working Capital Adjustment
Statement", respectively. If either the Equityholder Representative or the
Purchaser fails to submit a statement regarding any WC Disputed Items to the
Neutral Arbitrator within the time determined by the Neutral Arbitrator or
otherwise fails to give the Neutral Arbitrator access as reasonably requested,
then the Neutral Arbitrator shall render a decision based solely on the
evidence timely submitted and the access afforded to the Neutral Arbitrator by
the Equityholder Representative and the Purchaser.

  

  

(f) (i) The Purchaser shall pay an aggregate amount, if any, equal to the Net
Working Capital Excess Amount, if any, set forth on the Conclusive Net Working
Capital Adjustment Statement, which amounts shall be paid by the Purchaser to
the Equityholders in accordance with each Equityholder's Pro Rata Portion by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts designated by
each Equityholder as set forth on _Exhibit A_ (as may be updated from time to
time by written notice to the Purchaser) or (ii) the Purchaser and the
Equityholder Representative shall, within two Business Days following the
determination of the Conclusive Net Working Capital Statement, direct the
Escrow Agent to pay from the Working Capital Escrow Amount (and, if necessary,
from the General Indemnity Escrow Amount in accordance with and pursuant to
_Section 2.6(a)(ii)_ ) the Net Working Capital Deficiency Amount, if any, set
forth on the Conclusive Net Working Capital Adjustment Statement to the
Purchaser by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
designated by the Purchaser, and each Equityholder shall be deemed to have
contributed its Pro Rata Portion of the Working Capital Deficiency Amount to
Purchaser from its respective allocated portion of the Working Capital Escrow
Amount. Any required payment pursuant to this _Section 2.4(f)_ shall be paid
on the fifth Business Day following the determination of the Conclusive Net
Working Capital Statement in immediately available funds by check or wire
transfer. For purposes of this Agreement, any Net Working Capital Excess
Amount shall be deemed to be an increase in the Initial Consideration and any
Net Working Capital Deficiency Amount shall be deemed to be a decrease in the
Initial Consideration.

  

  

(g) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the dispute resolution
mechanism contained in this _Section 2.4_ shall be the exclusive mechanism for
resolving disputes regarding the subject matter of this _Section 2.4._

  

  

 _Section 2.5_ _Withholding Rights_. The Purchaser shall be entitled to deduct
and withhold from the Sale Consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect
to the making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of United
States federal, state or local, or any non-U.S., Tax law. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld or paid over to or deposited with the relevant
Governmental Authority by the Purchaser, such amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the applicable holder of
Units in respect of which the Purchaser made such deduction and withholding.

  

  

 

17  

  

 _Section 2.6_ _Escrow_.

  

  

(a) The Escrow Amount shall be held and invested by the Escrow Agent in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement. The
"Escrow Amount" shall be comprised of:

  

  

(i) the General Indemnity Escrow Amount, _plus_ any interest or other amounts
earned thereon, for the primary purpose of providing funds to satisfy the
indemnification or payment obligations expressly provided for in this
Agreement; _plus_

  

  

(ii) the Working Capital Escrow Amount, _plus_ any interest or other amounts
earned thereon, for the purpose of providing funds to satisfy the Net Working
Capital Deficiency Amount, if any, pursuant to _Section 2.4(f)_ ; _provided_ ,
_however_ , if the Net Working Capital Deficiency Amount exceeds the Working
Capital Escrow Amount (such excess being referred to as the "NWC Shortfall")
(i) Blake A. Stamper shall, within five Business Days, pay such NWC Shortfall
to the Purchaser by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
designated by the Purchaser or (ii) if Blake A. Stamper shall not have paid
such NWC Shortfall to the Purchaser within such five Business Day period, (A)
the Purchaser shall be entitled to solely direct the Escrow Agent to use the
General Indemnity Escrow Amount to satisfy the NWC Shortfall and (B) Blake A.
Stamper shall, within five Business Days following the use of the General
Indemnity Escrow Amount to satisfy the NWC Shortfall, deposit with the Escrow
Agent, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, an amount equal to the
NWC Shortfall; _plus_

  

  

(iii) the Determined Escrow Amount, _plus_ any interest or other amounts
earned thereon, for the primary purpose of providing funds to satisfy the
Equityholders' indemnification obligations relating to the matters set forth
on _Schedule 8.2(a)(v)_.

  

  

(b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, if,
pursuant to _Section 2.4_ hereof, there is (i) a zero dollar adjustment to the
Net Working Capital Amount, (ii) a Net Working Capital Excess Amount or (iii)
a Net Working Capital Deficiency Amount (A) that is less than the Working
Capital Escrow Amount and (B) the Purchaser has received payment from the
Escrow Agent pursuant to _Section 2.4(f)(ii)_ , the Purchaser and the
Equityholder Representative shall, within five Business Days of either the
Equityholders or the Purchaser receiving the payments contemplated by _Section
2.4(f)_ , direct the Escrow Agent to pay to the Equityholders the remaining
portion of the Working Capital Escrow Amount, _plus_ any interest or other
amounts earned thereon.

  

  

(c) Subject to the terms of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, on the 18
month anniversary of the Closing Date, the General Indemnity Escrow Amount (
_less_ the aggregate of any amounts released pursuant to _Section 8.4(b)_ ,
the amount of any indemnification claims resolved but remaining unpaid as of
such date and any amounts with respect to other indemnification claims by the
Purchaser then pending) shall be released to the Equityholders in accordance
with each Equityholder's Pro Rata Portion. The amounts of any such
indemnification obligations of the Equityholders resolved but remaining unpaid
shall be released in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the
Escrow Agreement, and the amounts of any such other indemnification claims
against the Equityholders then pending, shall be released to the Equityholders
or the Purchaser, upon resolution of such claims, in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement.

  

  

 

18  

  

(d) Subject to the terms of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, pursuant
to the terms of _Schedule 8.2(a)(v)_ , the Determined Escrow Amount shall be
released to the Equityholders in accordance with each Equityholder's Pro Rata
Portion.

  

  

 _Section 2.7_ _Equityholder Representative_.

  

  

(a) _Appointment_. As used in this Agreement, the term "Equityholder
Representative" means Blake A. Stamper, or any Person appointed as a successor
Equityholder Representative. Blake A. Stamper hereby accepts his appointment
as the initial Equityholder Representative. Effective upon Closing, without
any further action by any other Person, the Equityholder Representative shall
be appointed and constituted in respect of each Equityholder, as his, her or
its agent, to act in his, her or its name, place and stead, as such
Equityholder's attorney-in-fact, as more fully set forth in _Section 2.7(b)_.
In the event a successor Equityholder Representative is required, for whatever
reason, such successor shall be appointed by mutual agreement of the
Equityholders; if such successor has not been appointed within five Business
Days of written notice from the Purchaser to all Equityholders requesting such
Equityholders appoint a successor Equityholder Representative, the Purchaser
shall have the right to appoint an Equityholder Representative to fill any
such vacancy, and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to advise all
Equityholders of such appointment by written notice.

  

  

(b) _Authority_. The Equityholder Representative shall be authorized, on
behalf of the Equityholders (i) to discuss, negotiate, resolve and fully and
finally settle on behalf of the Equityholders any claims for indemnification
by the Purchaser under _Article VIII_ hereof, including the authorization to
comply with orders of courts with respect to any such claim for
indemnification, (ii) to review the Net Working Capital Statement and Net
Working Capital Adjustment Statement or a Working Capital Dispute Notice and
discuss, negotiate, resolve and fully and finally settle on behalf of the

litigating, defending or enforcing any actions, and to make, deliver and sign
any certificate, notice, consent or instrument required or permitted to be
made or delivered under this Agreement or any Ancillary Document (an
"Instrument") which the Equityholder Representative determines in his, her or
its discretion to be necessary, appropriate or desirable, and, in connection
therewith (provided, however, if any individual Equityholder is named in such
litigation, the Equityholder shall have the right to tender defense), (iv) to
hire or retain, at the sole expense of the Equityholders, such counsel,
accountants, Representatives and other professional advisors as he or she
determines in his or her sole and absolute discretion to be necessary,
advisable or appropriate in order to carry out and perform his or her rights
and obligations hereunder and (v) to receive all documents, certificates and
notices and make all determinations on behalf of the Equityholders required
under this Agreement. A decision, act, consent or instruction of the
Equityholder Representative shall constitute a decision of the Equityholders,
and shall be final, binding and conclusive upon the Equityholders, as the case
may be. Any Party receiving an Instrument from the Equityholder Representative
shall have the right to rely in good faith upon such Instrument, and to act in
accordance with the Instrument without independent investigation.

  

  

 

19  

  

(c) _No Liability of Equityholder Representative or the Purchaser_. Neither
the Equityholder Representative nor any of the directors, officers, agents or
employees of Equityholder Representative, if applicable, shall be liable to
any Equityholder or any other Person for any error of judgment, or any action
taken, suffered or omitted to be taken, under this Agreement, except in the
case of the Equityholder Representative's fraud, gross negligence or willful
misconduct. The Equityholder Representative may consult with legal counsel,
independent public accountants and other experts selected by the Equityholder
Representative and shall not be liable to any Equityholder for any action
taken or omitted to be taken in good faith in accordance with the advice of
such counsel, accountants or experts. The Purchaser shall have no Liability to
any of the Equityholders or otherwise arising out of the acts or omissions of
the Equityholder Representative or any disputes among the Equityholders or
between the Equityholders and the Equityholder Representative. The Purchaser
may rely entirely on its dealings with, and notices to and from, the
Equityholder Representative to satisfy any obligations it might have under
this Agreement, the Ancillary Documents or otherwise to the Equityholders.

  

  

(d) _Indemnity; Costs and Expenses_. Each Equityholder shall, only to the
extent of and in proportion to the portion of the Sale Consideration received
by such Equityholder, indemnify and defend the Equityholder Representative and
hold the Equityholder Representative harmless against any Damages incurred
without fraud, gross negligence or willful misconduct by the Equityholder
Representative and arising out of or in connection with the acceptance,
performance or administration of the Equityholder Representative's duties
under this Agreement. Any Damages, out-of-pocket costs or expenses incurred by
or reasonably expected to be incurred by the Equityholder Representative in
connection with the acceptance, performance and administration of his or her
duties as the Equityholder Representative pursuant to this Agreement
(including the hiring of legal counsel, accountants or auditors and other
advisors pursuant to the terms of this Agreement but excluding any of the
foregoing arising out of the Equityholder Representative's fraud, gross
negligence or willful misconduct) and all fees payable hereunder to the
Equityholder Representative by the Equityholders, shall be paid by recourse
directly to the Equityholders (in proportion to the Sale Consideration to
which each Equityholder is entitled under this Agreement, as set forth on
_Exhibit A_ ).

As a material inducement to the Purchaser to enter into this Agreement, except
as disclosed in the disclosure schedule delivered to the Purchaser by the
Equityholders concurrently herewith (the "Company Disclosure Schedule") (it

the representations in the corresponding section of this _Article III_ ), the
Equityholders hereby, jointly and severally, make the following
representations and warranties to the Purchaser.

in good standing would not have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.
_Schedule 3.1_ sets forth each jurisdiction where the Company conducts
business and indicates in which jurisdiction the Company is qualified or
licensed to do business. Copies of the Articles of Organization and Operating
Agreement have heretofore been Made Available to the Purchaser and are true,
complete and in effect as of the date hereof. The Company is not in violation
of its Articles of Organization and Operating Agreement and is operating and
has always operated its business in all respects in accordance with its

the Company is qualified or licensed to do business. The Company has never had
a Subsidiary other than the Subsidiaries listed on _Schedule 3.2(a)_. The
Company has no interest in, nor has it agreed to acquire an interest in, a
Person other than the Subsidiaries listed on _Schedule 3.2(a)_. Except as set
forth on _Schedule 3.2(a)_ , each Subsidiary of the Company is an entity duly
organized, validly existing, and in good standing under the laws of the
jurisdiction of its organization and has the requisite power and authority to
carry on its business as it is now being conducted, except where the failure
to be so qualified or in good standing would not have a Material Adverse
Effect on such Subsidiary.

  

  

(b) All of the outstanding equity securities of each Subsidiary of the Company
are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid, and non-assessable and are
set forth on _Schedule 3.2(b)_. Those equity securities owned by the Company
and set forth on _Schedule 3.2(b)_ are owned free and clear of any
Encumbrance, other than as set forth on _Schedule 3.2(b)_.

  

  

(c) Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.2(c)_ , there are no (i) outstanding or
authorized options, warrants, calls, subscriptions, rights, commitments or any

Subsidiary of the Company to issue, sell or transfer any additional equity
securities, (ii) outstanding securities or any securities which are
convertible into or exchangeable for any equity securities of any Subsidiary

the Company has an obligation of any kind to repurchase, return, redeem or
otherwise acquire any securities of such Subsidiary of the Company or to
provide funds to, make an investment in, or contribute capital to, any Person.

  

  

 

21

Company (a) is insolvent or has unreasonably small capital, (b) has incurred
debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as they mature or (c) has
Liabilities in excess of the reasonable market value of its assets. No
insolvency Proceedings or similar Proceedings have been, or have been
threatened to be, opened over the assets of the Company or any Subsidiary of
the Company, and there are no circumstances that would require or justify the
opening of or application of such Proceedings.

The assets, properties and rights of the Company and its Subsidiaries
constitute all of the assets, properties and rights which are necessary for
the operation of the Company's and its Subsidiaries' businesses as currently
conducted. The Company and its Subsidiaries hold legal and/or beneficial title
to each material property and asset which they purport to own, free and clear
of any Encumbrances other than Permitted Encumbrances, and each such material
property and asset is solely owned by, and in the possession and control of,
the Company and its Subsidiaries. The representations in this _Section 3.7_ do
not apply to the Intellectual Property Rights.

  

  

(b) All of the tangible assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries are in

its Subsidiaries (the "Leased Real Property"), and the Company and its
Subsidiaries have good and marketable title to all real property owned by the
Company (the "Owned Real Property"), free and clear of all Encumbrances,
except Permitted Encumbrances. Each parcel of Real Property is zoned so as to
permit the use of such parcels by Company as they are being used as of the
date hereof, and their present use and operation does not constitute a
nonconforming use and is not subject to a variance, and the Company has no
Knowledge or notice of any alleged violation of any fire, zoning, building, or
health law, regulation or ruling, whether federal, state or local, or of any
other alleged violation of Regulations which affect the Real Property. No
Person other than the Company or its Subsidiaries has any right to use, occupy
or lease all or any portion of the Real Property. A list of Leased Real
Property, together with the amount of rent, deposit information and term
related to each is set forth in _Schedule 3.7(c)_ , which is true and correct
as of the date hereof.

oral or written, between the parties to the Lease which in any material manner
vary the obligations or rights of either party to such Lease;

set forth on _Schedule 3.7(c)(ii)(B)_ and is true and correct;

  

  

(C) no rent under any Lease has been paid for more than thirty 30 calendar
days in advance;

  

  

(D) no leasing commissions, bonus payments or other payments are due or
payable by the Company under any Lease except as set forth in _Schedule

under any existing or pending Lease that are not set forth in _Schedule

operations in the Ordinary Course of Business and there has been no: (i)
Material Adverse Effect on the Company or its Subsidiaries, individually or
taken as whole, nor have any event or events occurred that, individually or in
the aggregate, with or without the lapse of time, could reasonably be expected

45  

  

 _Section 4.2_ _Authority and Execution_. Each Equityholder that is not an

standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization. Each
Equityholder that is not an individual has all legal right and requisite power
and authority to own, lease, and operate its properties and to carry on its
business as now being conducted. Each Equityholder that is not an individual,
or not a Trust, is duly qualified or licensed to do business and is in good
standing in each jurisdiction in which the property owned, leased or operated
by it or the nature of its business makes such qualification or licensing
necessary, except for such failures that, individually or in the aggregate,
would not be reasonably likely to impair the ability of such Equityholder to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each Equityholder
has good and sufficient legal right, power and authority to enter into and
deliver this Agreement and the Ancillary Documents and to complete the
transactions to be completed by such Equityholder contemplated hereunder and
thereunder. No Equityholder requires the consent, approval or authority of any
other Person to enter into or perform its obligations under this Agreement and
the Ancillary Documents and to complete the transactions to be completed by
such Equityholder contemplated hereunder and thereunder. This Agreement has
been duly executed and delivered by such Equityholder and constitutes the
legal, valid, and binding obligation of such Equityholder, enforceable against
such Equityholder in accordance with its terms, except as the enforceability
thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, or similar laws
affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and by general
principles of equity.

  

  

 _Section 4.3_ _Compliance with Other Instruments_. The execution, delivery
and performance of and compliance with this Agreement and the Ancillary
Documents and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will
not (a) to the extent such Equityholder is not an individual, result in a
violation of, or be in conflict with or constitute, with or without the
passage of time or the giving of notice or both, either a violation of, or
conflict with the organizational trust documents of such Equityholder or a
violation of, or conflict with any Regulations or Governmental Orders
applicable to any Equityholder, regardless of whether the Equityholder is an
entity or an individual, or (b) violate, conflict with, result in any breach
of, constitute a Default under, or give to others any rights of termination or
acceleration of any material contract to which such Equityholder is a party,
or result in the creation of any Encumbrance (other than a Permitted
Encumbrance) upon any of the properties or assets of such Equityholder.

  

  

 _Section 4.4_ _Equityholder Litigation_. There is no Proceeding pending
against such Equityholder relating to activities, properties or assets of the
Company. There is no factual or legal basis for any Proceeding that would be
reasonably likely to result, individually or in the aggregate, in a material
Liability for such Equityholder, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Such
Equityholder is not a party to or subject to the provisions of any
Governmental Order, writ, injunction, judgment or decree of any Governmental
Authority and there is no Proceeding by such Equityholder currently pending or
which such Equityholder intends to initiate relating to activities, properties
or assets of the Company.

Governmental Authority, or any other Person, is required to be made or
obtained by the Purchaser in connection with the execution, delivery and
performance by the Purchaser of this Agreement and the Ancillary Documents and
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.

  

  

 _Section 5.5_ _No Brokers_. Neither the Purchaser nor any of its respective
partners, Representatives or Affiliates has entered into nor will enter into

completion of the review to reflect the market value of assets of the Company
( _Schedule 6.7(b)_ , as revised, being referred to herein as the "Allocation

objections within such 20 Business Day period following receipt of the draft
of the applicable Tax Return. The Equityholder Representative and Purchaser
shall cooperate and consult with one another and attempt in good faith to
resolve any issues arising as a result of the review of such Tax Returns. If
the Equityholder Representative and Purchaser are unable to resolve any
dispute within such 20 Business Day period, the Equityholder Representative
shall have the right to file, or cause to be filed, such return as submitted
to Purchaser.

  

  

(d) After the Closing, the Equityholder Representative and each Equityholder

for Taxes or Proceedings related to any Taxes (each, a "Tax Controversy") with
respect to the activities or filings of the Company or any Subsidiary of the

of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company ending on or before the
Closing Date, which are reasonably relevant to any Tax Returns, claims for
refund, or any Tax Controversy. The Equityholder Representative, the
Equityholders, the Purchaser, and the Company and each Subsidiary of the
Company each agrees to retain all books and records with respect to Tax
matters pertinent to the Company and each Subsidiary of the Company relating
to the seven year period (or portion thereof) prior to the Closing Date for a
period of at least seven years and shall provide notice to the other prior to
destroying any such books and records (and an opportunity for the other to
take possession of such books and records).

  

  

(e) If, after the Effective Time, the Company, the Purchaser or the
Equityholder Representative or any Equityholders receives any document with
respect to the Tax matters of the Company that could affect any of the other
Parties, the Party receiving such document shall supply a copy of such
document to the potentially affected Party within 10 calendar days of receipt,
_provided_ , _however_ , that the failure to provide such a copy shall not be
a condition precedent to the liability of any Party under this Agreement. For
this purpose, such Tax documents shall include requests for information,
notices of proposed adjustment, revenue agent's reports or similar reports and
notices of deficiency, including notices of Encumbrances or levies relating to
any Tax. Any information provided or obtained under this paragraph shall be

Equityholders could have any Liability pursuant to this Agreement. The
Purchaser shall promptly notify the Equityholder Representative in writing
upon receipt by the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates of notice of any
audits, examinations, adjustments or assessments relating to Taxes that could
give rise to a claim for indemnification under _Article VIII_ (each, a "Tax
Claim"). The Purchaser, in its sole discretion, may contest such Tax Claim in
any permissible forum and shall otherwise have the sole right to direct,
control and settle any administrative or judicial Proceedings relating to such
Tax Claim, provided that the Equityholder Representative shall be entitled to
make comments to the Purchaser regarding the conduct of or positions taken in
any such administrative or judicial Proceeding and to participate, at the
Equityholder Representative's sole expense, in such administrative or judicial
Proceedings. The foregoing shall apply to Tax Claims in lieu of _Section 8.3_.
Except as otherwise provided in this _Section 6.7(f)_ , the Purchaser shall
have the sole right to control any audit or examination by any Governmental
Authority and contest, resolve and defend against any assessment for

periods.

past practice, except to the extent otherwise required by applicable
Regulations, (ii) timely pay all Taxes shown to be due and payable by the
Company or any Subsidiary of the Company on such Post-Signing Returns, and

developments with respect to ongoing actions in respect of such material Tax
matters).

  

  

(h) During the period from the date hereof to the Effective Time, the Company

following, shall be borne and paid 50% by the Equityholders and 50% by the
Purchaser so long as the Equityholders' share does not exceed $50,000;
_provided_ , _however_ , that any Taxes and fees incurred in connection the
transactions contemplated by _Section 6.1(b)_ shall be borne exclusively by
the Equityholders. The Purchaser (if required by applicable Regulations) shall
prepare and timely file all Tax Returns required to be filed in respect of any
such Taxes, except for any Tax Returns required in respect of such Taxes
incurred as a result of the transactions contemplated by _Section 6.1(b)_ ,

Equityholders, the Equityholder Representative and the Purchaser, upon the
other's request, shall use their commercially reasonable best efforts to

company, proprietorship or partnership form or otherwise, that engages in the
Company Business anywhere in the Restricted Territory; _provided_ , _however_

hand; and

  

  

 

57

the Purchaser on substantially equivalent terms to those in place at Closing
or at all.

  

  

(c) Each Equityholder acknowledges that the restrictions contained in this
_Section 6.8_ applicable to such Equityholder are reasonable and necessary to
protect the legitimate interests of the Company and the Purchaser and
constitute a material inducement to the Company and the Purchaser to enter

limitations permitted by applicable Regulations. The covenants contained in

covenants and provisions. The invalidity or unenforceability of any such
covenant or provision as written shall not invalidate or render unenforceable
the remaining covenants or provisions hereof, and any such invalidity or
unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render
unenforceable such covenant or provision in any other jurisdiction.

shall continue until the claim is fully resolved. All agreements, covenants
and obligations contained in this Agreement and the Ancillary Documents shall
survive in perpetuity unless satisfied earlier in accordance with their terms.

  

  

 _Section 8.2_ _Covenants to Indemnify_.

  

  

(a) Subject to the limitations described below in _Section 8.4_ , each of the
Purchaser and its respective Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the
Company) and each of their respective officers, directors, managers,
employees, members, stockholders, Representatives and agents (the "Purchaser
Indemnified Parties") shall be jointly and severally indemnified, defended,
held harmless and reimbursed by the Equityholders from and against any and all
damage, claim, loss, cost, diminution of value, Liability or expense,
including interest, penalties, reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses of
investigation, response action, removal action or remedial action
(collectively, "Damages") asserted against, incurred, sustained or suffered by
such Purchaser Indemnified Party that arise out of, or relate to (i) any
breach of any representation or warranty made by the Company or the
Equityholders in this Agreement, any Ancillary Document or in any certificate
or agreement delivered to the Purchaser or its Affiliates pursuant to this
Agreement; (ii) any failure to perform any agreement, covenant or obligation
made by the Company or any Equityholder in or pursuant to this Agreement, any
Ancillary Document or any agreement delivered to the Purchaser or its
Affiliates pursuant to this Agreement; (iii) any Pre-Closing Taxes, including
those matters set forth on _Schedule 8.2(a)(iii)_ ; (iv) any error or
misstatement in _Exhibit A_ ; (v) any matters set forth on _Schedule
8.2(a)(v)_ ; (vi) any of the matters set forth on _Schedule 8.2(a)(vi)_ ; or
(vii) any of the matters set forth on _Schedule 8.2(a)(vii)_.

  

  

 

63  

  

(b) Subject to the limitations described in this Agreement, the Purchaser
shall indemnify, defend, hold harmless and reimburse each Equityholder and
each of their respective Representatives, heirs and Affiliates (the "Company
Indemnified Parties"; the Company Indemnified Parties and Purchaser
Indemnified Parties, shall sometimes be referred to herein individually as a
"Covered Party" and collectively as the "Covered Parties") from and against
any and all Damages asserted against, suffered, sustained, accrued or incurred
by such Company Indemnified Party arising out of or relating to (i) any breach
of any representation or warranty made by the Purchaser in this Agreement, any
Ancillary Document or in any certificate or agreement delivered to the Company
or the Equityholders pursuant to this Agreement or (ii) any failure to perform
any agreement, covenant or obligation made by Purchaser in or pursuant to this
Agreement, any Ancillary Document or any agreement delivered to the Company or
the Equityholders pursuant to this Agreement.

  

  

(c) The term "Damages" as used in this _Article VIII_ is not limited to
matters asserted by third parties against the Covered Parties, but includes
Damages incurred, sustained or suffered by such Persons in the absence of
third-party claims, and payments by a Covered Party shall not be a condition
precedent to recovery.

  

  

 _Section 8.3_ _Notice of Claims_.

  

  

(a) If a Covered Party seeking indemnification hereunder receives notice of
the assertion of any claim (a "Claim Notice") with respect to which a Party
required to provide indemnification hereunder (an "Indemnifying Party") may be
obligated under this Agreement to provide indemnification, such Covered Party
shall give such Indemnifying Party prompt notice thereof; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the failure of any Covered Party to give such Claim Notice
shall not relieve any Indemnifying Party of its obligations under this
_Article VIII_. Such Claim Notice shall describe the claim in reasonable
detail, and, if practicable, shall indicate the estimated amount of Damages
that have been or may be sustained by such Covered Party.

  

  

 

64  

  

(b) An Indemnifying Party, at such Indemnifying Party's own expense and
through counsel reasonably acceptable to the Covered Party, may elect to
defend any third party claim; and if it so elects, it shall, within 20
calendar days after receiving notice of such third party claim (or sooner, if
the nature of such third party claim so requires), notify the Covered Party of
its intent to do so, and such Covered Party shall cooperate in the defense of
such third party claim; _provided_ , that such notice shall include an
acknowledgment from the Indemnifying Party that such Indemnifying Party is
undertaking and will prosecute the defense of the claim and confirming that
based on the information available as between the Covered Party and such
Indemnifying Party, such Indemnifying Party will, subject to the provisions of
_Section 8.4_ , be able to pay the full amount of potential Liability in
connection with any such claim (including for the Proceeding and all
Proceedings on appeal or other review which counsel for the Covered Party may
reasonably consider appropriate); _provided_ ; _further_ ; such Indemnifying
Party shall not have the right to defend or direct the defense of such claim
that (i) is asserted directly by or on behalf of a Person that is a supplier
or customer of the Company, the Purchaser or their Affiliates, (ii) seeks an
injunction or other equitable relief against the Covered Party. After notice
from an Indemnifying Party to a Covered Party of its election to assume the
defense of a third party claim, such Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to
such Covered Party for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by
such Covered Party in connection with the defense thereof; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that such Covered Party shall have the right to employ one counsel
to represent such Covered Party and all other Persons entitled to
indemnification in respect of such claim hereunder if, in the reasonable
opinion of counsel to the Covered Party (y) there are legal defenses available
to a Covered Party that are different from or additional to those available to
the Indemnifying Party, or (z) a conflict of interest between such Covered
Party and such Indemnifying Party exists in respect of such claim which would
make representation of the Indemnifying Party and the Covered Party
impermissible under applicable standards of professional conduct, and in
either of those events the reasonable fees and expenses of one such separate
counsel for all Covered Parties shall be paid by such Indemnifying Party. If
the Indemnifying Party does not notify the Covered Party within such 20
calendar days, the Covered Party shall have the right to undertake, at the
Indemnifying Party's cost, risk and expense, the defense, compromise or
settlement of the claim but shall not thereby waive any right to indemnity
therefor pursuant to this Agreement. The Indemnifying Party shall not, except
with the consent of the Covered Party, enter into any settlement that is not
exclusively monetary and shall be paid entirely by the Indemnifying Party and
does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the Person or
Persons asserting such claim to all Covered Parties of an unconditional
release from all Liability with respect to such claim or consent to entry of
any judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnifying Party shall not
be entitled to control any claim relating to Taxes of the Purchaser or its
Subsidiaries, or the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any Tax or
accounting period ending after the Closing Date and shall not be entitled to
settle, either administratively or after the commencement of litigation, any
claim for Taxes which could adversely affect the Liability of the Purchaser or
its Subsidiaries, or the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for Taxes for any
Tax or accounting period (or portion thereof) ending after the Closing Date,
without the prior written consent of the Purchaser; in the event of a conflict
between this _Section 8.3(b)_ and _Section 6.7(f)_ , _Section 6.7(f)_ shall
govern.

  

  

(c) _Sections 8.3(a)_ and _8.3(b)_ do not apply to the matters set forth on
_Schedules 8.2(a)(v)_ and _8.2(a)(vi)_ , which shall be governed by the
procedures set forth on _Schedules 8.2(a)(v)_ and _8.2(a)(vi)_ , respectively.

  

  

 _Section 8.4_ _Limitation on Indemnity_.

  

  

(a) Notwithstanding anything expressed or implied in this _Article VIII_ to
the contrary, no Covered Party shall be entitled to make a claim for
indemnification pursuant to this _Article VIII_ unless and until the aggregate
of all Damages suffered by such Covered Party hereunder exceeds $1,500,000
(the "Basket Amount"), whereupon all Damages (including the Basket Amount)
shall become due and payable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Basket Amount
shall apply to (i) a claim for a breach of a Fundamental Rep, (ii) a Covered
Party's claim for indemnification hereunder to the extent a breach results
from fraud, intentional misrepresentation or active concealment or (iii) a
claim for indemnification under _Sections 8.2(a)(ii)_ through _8.2(a)(vii)_ or
_Section 8.2(b)(ii)_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in
determining the amount of any Damages with respect to such breach, such
representations, warranties and covenants, agreements and obligations shall be
read without regard to any materiality qualifier (including any reference to
Material Adverse Effect) contained therein.

  

  

 

65  

  

(b) Any indemnification payments required to be made by the Equityholders
shall be paid (i) first, from the General Indemnity Escrow Amount (except for
such matters set forth on _Schedule 8.2(a)(v)_ , which shall be paid first
from the Determined Escrow Amount) and (ii) second, from the Equityholders
directly. Subject to _Section 8.7_ , all claims for Damages by a Purchaser
Indemnified Party shall be, subject to the limitations set forth in this
_Section 8.4_ , against the Equityholders jointly and severally; _provided_ ,
_however_ , but subject to _Section 8.7_ , the Equityholders shall not be
liable to any Purchaser Indemnified Party under the terms of this Agreement
for amounts in excess of 20% of the Sale Consideration paid by the Purchaser
(the "Cap"), except with respect to claims for (i) fraud, intentional
misrepresentation or active concealment, in which case there will be no Cap,
(ii) indemnification under _Sections 8.2(a)(ii)_ through _8.2(a)(vii)_ , in
which case there will be no Cap or (iii) a breach of the Fundamental Reps, in
which case the "Cap" will be the amount of the Sale Consideration paid by the
Purchaser to the Equityholders from time to time.

  

  

(c) IN NO EVENT SHALL ANY PARTY HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOLLOWING THE CLOSING
PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT OR OTHERWISE IN CONNECTION WITH THE PURCHASE OF THE
UNITS OR ANY OF THE OTHER TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT FOR ANY
PUNITIVE DAMAGES EXCEPT FOR ANY SUCH DAMAGES THAT ARE CLAIMED BY THIRD
PERSONS.

  

  

(d) To the extent permitted by Regulations, any payment made by a Person
indemnifying a Covered Party pursuant to this _Article VIII_ shall be treated
on the Parties' Tax Returns as an adjustment to the Sale Consideration for all
Tax purposes.

  

  

 _Section 8.5_ _Mitigation of Damages_. Each Indemnified Party shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate any Damages.

  

  

 _Section 8.6_ _Indemnification as Exclusive Remedy_. Notwithstanding anything
in this Agreement to the contrary or any right or remedy available under any
Regulations, except in in the case of claims for (i) a breach of a covenant,
agreement or obligation hereunder or (ii) fraud, intentional misrepresentation
or active concealment, the indemnification provided in this Agreement shall be
the sole and exclusive post-Closing remedy available to the Covered Parties
with respect to matters of any kind or nature arising under this Agreement,
and the Covered Parties shall not pursue or seek to pursue any other remedy
with respect to such matters.

  

  

 _Section 8.7_ _Right of Set Off_. Notwithstanding any other provision in this
Agreement to the contrary, the Purchaser and its Affiliates, in the
Purchaser's sole discretion, will have the right to set off and retain any
amount to which the Purchaser or its Affiliates may be entitled from any other
Party against any amount otherwise payable by the Purchaser or its Affiliates
to such Party (including any amounts payable from time to time pursuant to
_Section 2.4_ ). The exercise of or failure to exercise such right of set off
will not constitute an election of remedies or limit in any manner the
enforcement of any other remedy that may be available to the Purchaser.

  

  

 

66  

  

 _Section 8.8_ _Made Available_. The right to indemnification herein or other
remedies available herein will not be affected by any investigation conducted
with respect to, or the knowledge of, at any time, whether before or after the
execution and delivery of this Agreement (and regardless of whether any
information was Made Available or otherwise delivered pursuant to _Section
7.3(q)_ ), the accuracy or inaccuracy of or compliance with any
representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or obligation in this Agreement
or the Ancillary Documents.

  

  

 _Section 8.9_ _Release_.

  

  

(a) Subject to _Section 8.9(b)_ of this Agreement, effective from and after
the Effective Time, each Equityholder, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates
(other than, for the avoidance of doubt, the Company), Representatives,
successors, heirs, spouses, assigns, beneficiaries and all other Persons
claiming by, through, for or under such Equityholder or on behalf of such
Equityholder (such other persons collectively, the "Equityholder Related
Parties" and together with the Equityholder, the "Releasing Party") hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally releases, settles, cancels, discharges and
acknowledges to be fully and finally satisfied any and all claims, demands,
actions or causes of action for payment or performance of any debt, account,
covenant, contract, promise, loss reimbursement, compensation, Liability or
expense, including attorney's fees, of any and every kind, nature or
description whatsoever, at law or in equity (collectively, a "Releasable
Claim") that such Releasing Party may have had or may now have or assert
against the Company, the Purchaser or any of their present and former
Representatives, Affiliates, predecessors, successors and assigns
(collectively, the "Released Parties"), that are on account of any matter
whatsoever arising prior to the Effective Time or attributable to such period
(whether such Releasable Claims are known or unknown, knowable or unknowable,
suspected or unsuspected) (all Releasable Claims released in this _Section
8.9_ are referred to as the "Released Claims"). Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, Released Claims shall include any and all
Releasable Claims arising out of or relating to (i) any issuances, redemptions
or repurchases by the Company or any of its current or former Affiliates of
any securities, (ii) any sales, pledges, hypothecations or other transfers of
Units or other securities of the Company or any of its current or former
Affiliates by any Equityholder to any Person and (iii) any violations of the
Articles of Organization, Operating Agreement or other organizational
documents of the Company or any of its current or former Affiliates. TO THE
FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY REGULATIONS, EACH EQUITYHOLDER WAIVES THE BENEFIT
OF ANY PROVISION OF REGULATIONS TO THE EFFECT THAT A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT
EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE RELEASING PARTY DID NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST TO
THE RELEASING PARTY'S FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH IF
KNOWN BY THE RELEASING PARTY MAY HAVE AFFECTED THE RELEASING PARTY'S
SETTLEMENT WITH THE RELEASED PARTY.

  

  

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in _Section 8.9(a)_ will
be deemed to waive, release, alter or otherwise impair any rights or claims of
any Equityholder pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

  

 

67  

  

(c) Each Equityholder agrees that no Releasing Parties, nor anyone claiming
by, through, for or under them or on their behalf will bring, file, institute,
prosecute, maintain, participate in, or recover upon, either directly or
indirectly, or encourage or benefit from the institution of, any Proceeding
against any Released Party, in or before any Governmental Authority,
arbitrator or mediator for or relating to any of the Released Claims. Each
Equityholder represents that neither it nor any other Releasing Party has
filed or caused to be filed any Releasable Claim of any kind against any
Released Party, which is now pending with any Governmental Authority,
arbitrator or mediator. Each Equityholder further represents that it has not
transferred or assigned any Releasable Claims or Released Claims to any
Person.

Date"); _provided_ , _however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement
under this _Section 9.1(b)_ shall not be available to any Party whose action

the Sale to occur on or before such date and such action or failure to act
constitutes a breach of this Agreement;

  

  

(c) by either the Equityholder Representative and the Company, on the one
hand, or the Purchaser, on the other hand, if a Governmental Authority shall
have issued a Governmental Order or taken any other action (including the

Order or other action is final and nonappealable;

  

  

(d) by the Equityholder Representative and Company, upon a breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant, obligation or agreement on the part of the
Purchaser set forth in this Agreement, or if any representation, warranty

_Section 7.2(b)_ would not be satisfied as of the time of such breach or as of
the time such representation, warranty covenant, obligation or agreement shall
have become untrue, _provided_ that if such inaccuracy in the Purchaser's
representations, warranties, covenants, obligations or agreements or breach by
the Purchaser is curable by the Purchaser prior to the End Date through the
exercise of commercially reasonable efforts, then the Equityholder

Equityholder Representative shall have become untrue, in either case such that
the conditions set forth in _Section 7.3(a)_ , _Section 7.3(b)_ , _Section
7.3(c)_ or _Section 7.3(e)_ would not be satisfied as of the time of such
breach or as of the time such representation, warranty, covenant, obligation
or agreement shall have become untrue, _provided_ that if such inaccuracy in
the Company's or the Equityholders' or the Equityholder Representative's
representations, warranties, covenants, obligations or agreements or breach by
the Company or the Equityholders is curable by the Company or the
Equityholders prior to the End Date through the exercise of commercially
reasonable efforts, then the Purchaser may not terminate this Agreement under
this _Section 9.1(e)_ prior to 15 calendar days following the receipt of
written notice from the Purchaser to the Company of such breach (it being
understood that the Purchaser may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this _Section 9.1(e)_ if it shall have materially breached this Agreement or
if such breach by the Company or the Equityholders or the Equityholder
Representative is cured so that such conditions would then be satisfied); or

  

  

(f) by the Purchaser, pursuant to _Section 6.5(c)_.

  

  

 _Section 9.2_ _Notice of Termination; Effect of Termination_. In the event of
termination of this Agreement as provided in _Section 9.1_ (other than
_Section 9.1(a)_ ), the terminating Party shall deliver prompt notice thereof
to the other Parties, specifying the provisions hereof pursuant to which such
termination is made. In the event of the termination of this Agreement as
provided in _Section 9.1_ , this Agreement shall be of no further force or
effect, except (i) as set forth in _Section 6.2(a)_ , _Section 6.3_ , this
_Section 9.2_ and _Article X_ , each of which shall survive the termination of
this Agreement and (ii) nothing herein shall relieve any Party from Liability
for any breach of this Agreement. No termination of this Agreement shall
affect the obligations of the Parties contained in the Confidentiality
Agreement, all of which obligations shall survive termination of this
Agreement in accordance with their terms.

nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by
any of the Parties hereto, in whole or in part (whether by operation of law or
otherwise), without the prior written consent of the other Parties, and any
attempt to make any such assignment without such consent shall be null and
void ab initio, except that (a) the Purchaser may assign, in its sole

Agreement to an Affiliate without the consent of the Company; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that no such assignment or transfer shall relieve the Purchaser of

or held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, this Agreement shall be
considered divisible and inoperative as to such provision to the extent it is
deemed to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, and in all other respects this
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect; _provided_ , _however_ , that
if any provision of this Agreement is deemed or held to be illegal, invalid or
unenforceable the Parties agree to replace such illegal, invalid or

Further, should any provision contained in this Agreement ever be reformed or
rewritten by any judicial body of competent jurisdiction, such provision as so
reformed or rewritten shall be binding upon all Parties hereto.

  

  

 _Section 10.7_ _Schedules_. The Schedules and the Exhibits referenced in this
Agreement are a material part hereof and shall be treated as if fully
incorporated into the body of the Agreement.

  

  

 _Section 10.8_ _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except as provided in _Article
VIII_ , nothing expressed or referred to in this Agreement will be construed
to give any Person other than the Parties to this Agreement (and their
successors and assigns) any legal or equitable right, remedy, or claim under
or with respect to this Agreement or any provision of this Agreement.

  

  

 _Section 10.9_ _Specific Performance_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, the Parties agree that irreparable damage would
occur to each of the Company, the Equityholders and the Purchaser in the event
that any of the obligations, undertakings, covenants or agreements of the
Parties were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were
otherwise breached. Accordingly, notwithstanding _Section 10.13_ , the
Company, the Equityholders and the Purchaser shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement by the other,
without any bond or other security being required, and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement by a decree of specific
performance, without the necessity of proving actual damages or posting a bond
therefor, this being in addition to any other remedy to which either the
Company, the Equityholders or the Purchaser is entitled at law or in equity.

  

  

 _Section 10.10_ _Other Remedies_. Any and all remedies herein expressly
conferred upon a Party will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any
other remedy conferred hereby, by law or equity upon such party, and the
exercise by a Party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any
other remedy.

  

  

 _Section 10.11_ _No Strict Construction_. The Parties hereto have
participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. In the
event an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this
Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the Parties hereto, and
no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any
Party by virtue of the authorship of any of the provisions of this Agreement.

  

  

 

72  

  

 _Section 10.12_ _Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided herein, all fees and
expenses incurred in connection with or related to this Agreement and the
Ancillary Documents and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby shall
be paid by the Party incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not such
transactions are consummated; _provided_ that if the transactions contemplated
hereby are consummated, Transaction Expenses shall be borne and paid by the
Equityholders; _provided_ , _further_ , that the fees and expenses payable
under the HSR Act and any other applicable antitrust Regulations in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid one-half by the
Purchaser and one-half by the Equityholders. In the event of termination of
this Agreement, the obligation of each Party to pay its own expenses will be
subject to any rights of such Party arising from a breach of this Agreement by
the other Party.

  

  

 _Section 10.13_ _Submission to Jurisdiction; Waivers; Consent to Service of
Process_. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, each Party hereto
irrevocably agrees that any legal action or Proceeding with respect to this
Agreement or for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in respect hereof
brought by another Party hereto or its successors or assigns shall be brought
exclusively in the state and federal courts of the State of Colorado and each
of the Parties hereto hereby (x) irrevocably submits with regard to any such
action or Proceeding for itself and in respect to its property, generally and
unconditionally, to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the aforesaid
courts in the event any dispute arises out of this Agreement or any
transaction contemplated hereby, (y) agrees that it will not attempt to deny
or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from
any such court and (z) agrees that it will not bring any action relating to
this Agreement or any transaction contemplated hereby in any court other than
the aforesaid courts. Any service of process to be made in such action or
Proceeding may be made by delivery of process in accordance with the notice
provisions contained in _Section 10.2_. Each of the Parties hereto hereby
irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as a defense,
counterclaim or otherwise, in any action or Proceeding with respect to this
Agreement, (a) the defense of sovereign immunity, (b) any claim that it is not
personally subject to the jurisdiction of the above-named courts for any
reason other than the failure to serve process in accordance with this
_Section 10.13_ , (c) that it or its property is exempt or immune from
jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process commenced in such
courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment,
attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment or
otherwise), and (d) to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Regulations
that (i) the action or Proceeding in any such court is brought in an
inconvenient forum, (ii) the venue of such action or Proceeding is improper
and (iii) this Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may not be enforced in
or by such courts.

  

  

 _Section 10.14_ _Time is of the Essence_. With regard to all dates and time
periods set forth or referred to in this Agreement, time is of the essence.

  

  

 _Section 10.15_ _Legal Representation_. Each party hereto acknowledges that
Burch and Cracchiolo, P.A. ("BandC"), counsel for the Company, has in the past
performed, is now performing and may continue to perform legal services for
certain of the Equityholders and that, upon the Closing, BandC's representation
of the Company (but not such represented Equityholders) shall terminate.
Accordingly, each Party hereby acknowledges that BandC may continue to represent
such Equityholders in any and all matters whether or not related to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, including any matters that
are or may become adverse to the interests of the Purchaser and the Company
and including claims arising under this Agreement. Effective upon the Closing,
the Purchaser and the Company, each on its own behalf, hereby waives any
actual or potential conflict of interest that exists or that may exist
(including any conflict that exists or may arise by virtue of BandC's possession
of any information concerning the Company) as a result of BandC's representation
of such Equityholders in any matter, including any matter that is or may
become adverse to the interests of the Purchaser or the Company, including any
claims arising under this Agreement.

 _Section 10.16_ _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES, TO
THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE REGULATIONS, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE
TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT
OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY
(WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER THEORY). EACH PARTY HERETO (A)
CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS
REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE
EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES
THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS
AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN
