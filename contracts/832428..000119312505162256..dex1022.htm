\- 16 -  shares of Company Capital Stock (a " _Company Stock Certificate_ ") is
presented to the Payment Agent, the Surviving Corporation or Parent,
such Company Stock Certificate shall be canceled and shall be exchanged as
provided in _Section 2.8_.



_Section_ _2.8_ _Exchange of Certificates_.



(a) Promptly after the date of this Agreement but in any event prior to the
Closing Date, Parent shall select a reputable bank or trust company
reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as payment agent in the Merger
(the " _Payment Agent_ "). Immediately prior to the Effective Time, Parent
shall deposit with the Payment Agent a sufficient amount of cash to
make payments to the Non-Dissenting Shareholders in accordance with _Section
2.5(a)_ and to the Closing Date Option Holders pursuant to _Section 2.6_ (in
each case, excluding amounts to be withheld pursuant to _Section 2.5(c)_ ).
The cash amount so deposited with the Payment Agent is referred to
collectively as the " _Payment Fund_."



(b) Prior to the Closing, the Company will cause to be delivered to
shareholders of the Company (i) a letter of transmittal containing such
provisions as Parent, Company and the Payment Agent may reasonably specify (a
" _Letter of Transmittal_ "), and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of Company Stock Certificates. After the surrender of a
Company Stock Certificate to the Payment Agent for exchange at or after the
Effective Time, together with a duly executed Letter of Transmittal and such
other documents as may be reasonably required by Parent or the Payment Agent,
the holder of such Company Stock Certificate shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor the cash consideration that such holder has the right to
receive pursuant to _Section 2.5(a)_ (excluding any amounts to be withheld
pursuant to _Section 2.5(c)_ ) and the Company Stock Certificate so
surrendered shall be canceled. Until surrendered as contemplated by this
_Section 2.8_ , each Company Stock Certificate shall be deemed, from and after
the Effective Time, to represent only the right to receive, after the
surrender thereof, the consideration contemplated by this _Article II_. If any
Company Stock Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, Parent
may, in its discretion and as a condition to the delivery of any
consideration payable in the Merger in respect of shares represented by such
lost, stolen or destroyed Company Stock Certificate, require the owner of such
lost, stolen or destroyed Company Stock Certificate to provide an appropriate
affidavit of such loss, theft or destruction, and if the amount of such
consideration is more than $100,000, to deliver a bond (in such sum as Parent
may reasonably direct) as indemnity against any claim that may be made against
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Payment Agent with respect to such
lost, stolen or destroyed Company Stock Certificate.



(c) Any portion of the Payment Fund that remains undistributed to holders of
Company Stock Certificates as of the date that is 180 days after the Closing
Date shall be delivered by Payment Agent to Parent upon demand, and any
holders of Company Stock Certificates who have not theretofore surrendered
their Company Stock Certificates in accordance with this _Section 2.8_
shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of any consideration payable
to such holder in the Merger.



(d) Neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any holder
or former holder of Company Capital Stock for any consideration payable in
the Merger that has been delivered to any public official in good faith
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property law, escheat law or similar
Legal Requirement.



 

\- 17 - _Section_ _2.9_ _Dissenting Shares_.



(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
shares of Company Capital Stock that are or become "dissenting shares" within
the meaning of Section 1300(b) of the CGCL (" _Dissenting Shares_ ") at or
after the Effective Time shall not be converted into or represent the right
to receive the consideration specified in _Section 2.5(a)_ , but shall be
entitled only to such rights as are granted by the CGCL to Dissenting Shares.



(b) If any Dissenting Shares shall lose their status as such (through failure
to perfect or otherwise), then, as of the later of the Effective Time or the
date of loss of such status, such shares shall automatically be converted into
and shall represent only the right to receive consideration in accordance with
_Section 2.5(a)_ (including giving effect to the amounts to be withheld
pursuant to _Section 2.5(c)_ ), without interest thereon, after the surrender
of the Company Stock Certificate representing such shares.



(c) The Company shall give Parent: (i) prompt notice of any written demand
received by the Company prior to the Effective Time to require the Company to
purchase shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the CGCL, any withdrawal
of any such demand and any other demand, notice or instrument delivered to the
Company prior to the Effective Time pursuant to the CGCL; and (ii) the
opportunity to participate in all negotiations and Proceedings with respect to
any such demand, notice or instrument. The Company shall not make any payment
or settlement offer prior to the Effective Time with respect to any such
demand, notice or instrument unless Parent shall have consented in writing to
such payment or settlement offer.



_Section_ _2.10_ _Further Action_. If, at any time after the Effective Time,
any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of
this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title and
possession of and to all rights and property of Merger Sub and the Company,
the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall be
fully authorized to take such lawful and necessary action.



_Section_ _2.11_ _Working Capital Adjustments; Escrow_.



(a) The Company shall prepare and deliver to Parent at least five (5) Business
Days prior to the Closing Date the Estimated Closing Date Balance Sheet and a
statement of the Companys good faith estimate of the Working Capital of the
Company (the " _Estimated Working Capital_ ").



(b) Parent shall prepare and deliver to Shareholders Representative within
ninety (90) calendar days after the Effective Time a Closing Date Balance
Sheet and a statement of the Working Capital of the Company (the " _Closing
Date Working Capital_ "), which shall (i) be accompanied by all information
reasonably necessary to determine the information contained in such Closing
Date Balance Sheet and statements and such other information as may be
reasonably requested by the Shareholders Representative and (ii) be duly
certified by the Chief Financial Officer of Parent to be true, correct and
complete in all material respects as of the Closing Date. The Shareholders
Representative will be afforded a reasonable opportunity to observe, and to
consult with Parents accountants regarding, the procedures undertaken by
Parents accountants in connection with the preparation of such Closing Date
Balance Sheet and statements.



 

\- 18 - (c) If Shareholders Representative does not notify Parent in writing within
twenty (20) Business Days after receipt of Parents statement of the Closing
Date Working Capital that it disputes any of the information or calculations
provided in Parents statement of the Closing Date Working Capital, Parents
statement of the Closing Date Working Capital shall be final and conclusive.
If Shareholders Representative disagrees with any of the information or
calculations provided by Parent in its statement of the Closing Date Working
Capital, Shareholders Representative may, within twenty (20) Business Days
after delivery of such statement to it, deliver a written notice to Parent
stating in reasonable detail the existence and nature of such disagreement.
Any such notice of disagreement shall specify those items or amounts as to
which Shareholders Representative disagrees. If such notice of disagreement
shall be delivered, the parties shall use their reasonable best efforts to
reach agreement on the disputed items or amounts within twenty (20) Business
Days after Parents receipt of such notice. If the parties are unable to reach
agreement on the disputed items within such period, then the issues in dispute
will be submitted to PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, independent
public accountants (the " _Accountants_ "), for review and resolution, with
instructions to complete the review as promptly as practicable. Parent and
Shareholders Representative each will furnish to the Accountants such
workpapers and other documents and information relating to the disputed
issues as the Accountants may request and are available to that party or its
Subsidiaries (or its independent public accountants), and will be afforded the
opportunity to present to the Accountants any material relating to the
determination and to discuss the determination with the Accountants. The
resolution of the Accountants shall be conclusive and binding on the parties
and may be entered and enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction. One-
half of the fees and expenses charged by the Accountants shall be paid by
Parent and the remaining one-half shall be paid from the Escrow Fund; and
Parent and Shareholders Representative hereby agree to give joint
written instruments to the Escrow Agent for such disbursement.



(d) The Estimated Closing Date Balance Sheet and the related statement of the
Estimated Working Capital, and the Closing Date Balance Sheet and the related
statement of the Closing Date Working Capital, shall be prepared in accordance
with GAAP, and using the same accounting principles, practices and
methodologies, consistently applied, that were used to prepare the December
31, 2004 Balance Sheet. Solely for purposes of determining the Estimated
Working Capital and the Closing Date Working Capital, the parties hereby
agree to the Working Capital Guidelines set forth on _Annex I_.



(e) During its review period, the Shareholders Representative and his
Representatives shall have access during regular business hours and upon
reasonable notice to all relevant books and records and employees of the
Surviving Corporation to the extent he reasonably deems necessary to review
matters and information related to the preparation of the Closing Date Balance
Sheet (and including without limitation any financial and other information
relating to periods after the Closing Date that may be relevant to or helpful
in the review of the Closing Date Balance Sheet and the calculation of the
Closing Date Working Capital) in a manner not unreasonably interfering with
the business of the Surviving Corporation.



Within three (3) Business Days after the final determination of the Closing
Date Working Capital pursuant to _Section 2.11(c)_ , if the Estimated Working
Capital exceeds the Closing Date Working Capital (as determined under
_Section 2.11(c)_ , the amount of such excess shall be payable to Parent, and
Parent and the Shareholders Representative shall jointly execute and deliver
to the Escrow Agent a written notice instructing the Escrow Agent to disburse
such amounts from the Escrow Fund to Parent as soon  



 

\- 19 -  as practicable, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account designated by Parent. Conversely, if the Estimated Working Capital is
less than the Closing Date Working Capital (as determined under _Section
2.11(c)_ ), Parent shall promptly deliver the amount of such deficiency to the
Escrow Agent for placement into the Escrow Fund as soon as practicable, by
wire transfer of immediately available funds.



_Section_ _2.12_ _Closing Payment Schedule_.



(a) Two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing, the Company shall deliver to

held by each Closing Date Shareholder immediately prior to the Effective

_Section 6.6(a)_ (each an " _Acquisition Proposal_ "), the Company shall be
permitted (i) to engage in discussions and negotiations with, and provide
nonpublic information or data to, the Person making the Acquisition Proposal
or (ii) recommend approval of the Acquisition Proposal to the shareholders of
the Company or withdraw or modify in any adverse manner the Company Board
Recommendation, if and only to the extent that, (A) in any case as is
referred to in clauses (i) and (ii), the Company has entered into a
nondisclosure agreement with the Person making the Acquisition Proposal having
provisions that are no less favorable to the Company and no less restrictive
on such Person than those contained in the Nondisclosure Agreement, (B) the
Company Board has determined in good faith (after consultation with its
outside legal counsel) that the Acquisition Proposal, if accepted, (x) in the
case of clause (i) above, would more likely than not constitute a Superior
Proposal (as hereinafter defined), (y) in the case of clause (ii) above, if
consummated, would constitute a Superior Proposal, (z) in the case of clauses
(i) and (ii) above, that the failure to engage in discussions and
negotiations with respect to such Acquisition Proposal would reasonably be
expected to constitute a breach of its fiduciary duties to the Companys
shareholders under applicable Legal Requirements, and (C) the Company has
provided to Parent three (3) Business Days prior written notice that the
Company Board intends to take such action, specifying the material terms and
conditions of such Superior Proposal and identifying the Person or Persons
making such Superior Proposal. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Superior
Proposal_ " means any Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board determines
in good faith (after (i) consultation with its financial advisor and
(ii) taking into account all of the terms and conditions of the Acquisition
Proposal and this Agreement, including (A) any counterproposal by Parent
pursuant to _Section 11.1(h)_ , (B) the likelihood that the transactions
contemplated by the Acquisition Proposal will close in a timely manner, and
(C) the extent to which the financing for the transactions contemplated by the
Acquisition Proposal, to the extent required, is committed or is capable of
being obtained on the terms proposed) is more favorable to the Companys
shareholders than the Merger or any counterproposal pursuant to _Section
11.1(h)_.



 

\- 48 - _Section_ _6.7_ _Consent Solicitation Statement_. The Company shall deliver a
consent solicitation statement accurately describing this Agreement, the
Merger, the other Contemplated Transactions and the provisions of Chapter 13
of the CGCL, and setting forth the fair market value of each class and series
of Company Capital Stock as of the day prior to the date of this Agreement
(excluding any appreciation or depreciation in connection with this Agreement,
the Merger or the other Contemplated Transactions) as determined by the
Company Board (the " _Consent Solicitation Statement_ ") to its shareholders,
for the purpose of (a) informing them of approval of the Merger by the Company
Board and their right to dissent pursuant to Chapter 13 of the CGCL, and (b)
soliciting their written consent to the principal terms of the Merger and the
Contemplated Transactions. The Consent Solicitation Statement shall be
delivered to shareholders of the Company within five (5) calendar days of the
date hereof and shall be delivered on or within two (2) calendar
days following the Record Date to any shareholder of the Company of record on
the Record Date that has not received the Consent Solicitation Statement prior

_Section 6.6(b)_ , the Consent Solicitation Statement shall include a
statement to the effect that the Company Board unanimously recommends that the
Companys shareholders execute written consents approving the principal terms
of the Merger (the " _Company Board Recommendation_ "). Subject in each case
to the provisions of _Section 6.6_ and the fiduciary duties of the Company
Board, the unanimous recommendation of the Company Board that the shareholders
of the Company approve the principal terms of the Merger shall not be
withdrawn or modified in a manner adverse to Parent, and no resolution by the
Company Board or any committee thereof to withdraw or modify such
recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent shall be adopted or proposed.
The Company shall provide Parent and its Representatives with a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on the Consent Solicitation Statement prior
to any dissemination thereof to the Companys shareholders. The Company shall
provide Parent with a copy of the Consent Solicitation Statement on the date
of delivery thereof to its shareholders and shall also provide Parent with
copies of all written consents of the Companys shareholders. The
Company shall solicit written consents as provided in this _Section 6.7_ for
the 30-day period commencing on the beginning date of the period provided
under Chapter 13 of the CGCL for the exercise and perfection of dissenters
rights by holders of shares of Company Capital Stock.



_Section_ _6.8_   _Demands by Holders of Dissenting Shares_. The Company
shall promptly notify Parent of any demands it receives within the period
provided for the exercise and perfection of dissenters rights under Chapter
13 of the CGCL from any holders of shares of Company Capital Stock and the
Company shall provide Parent with a copy of each such demand.



_Section_ _6.9_ _FIRPTA Matters_. At the Closing, the Company shall deliver to
Parent a statement (in such form as may be reasonably requested by counsel to
Parent) conforming to the requirements of Section 1.897  2(h)(1)(i) of the

 _Section_ ___7.1_ _Indemnification_.



(a) Parent agrees that all rights to indemnification existing as of the date
of this Agreement in favor of those persons who are or were directors and
officers of the Company (the " _Indemnified Company Personnel_ ") for acts or
omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time, as provided in the Companys
Organizational Documents, shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full
force and effect in accordance with their terms, and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to fulfill and honor such obligations to the maximum
extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements. Parent agrees that, from

Company as in effect as of the date of this Agreement in respect of

Company Personnel, including as set forth in the Companys Organizational

(b) From the Effective Time until the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective
Time, Parent shall maintain in effect, for the benefit of the Indemnified
Company Personnel with respect to acts or omissions occurring on or prior to
the Effective Time, the existing policy of directors and officers liability
insurance maintained by the Company as of the date of this Agreement (the "
_Existing Policy_ "); provided, however, that (i) Parent may substitute for
the Existing Policy a policy or policies of not less favorable coverage; (ii)
Parent may self-insure the risk of loss; provided, however, that Parent must
provide the Indemnified Company Personnel with indemnification terms
and procedures (including advancement of expenses) at least as favorable as
provided pursuant to Article SEVENTH of Parents Amended and Restated Articles
of Incorporation as of the date of this Agreement, and provided further, that
Parents right to self-insure the risk of loss shall be subject to Parents
maintaining an Investment Grade credit rating according to both Moodys
Investors Service and Standard and Poors Rating Services; and (iii) Parent
shall not be required to pay annual premiums for the Existing Policy (or for
any substitute policies) in excess of 200% of the annual premium payable under
the Existing Policy as of the date of this Agreement (the " _Maximum Premium_
") and, in the event any future annual premiums for the Existing Policy (or
any substitute policies) exceed the Maximum Premium, Parent shall be entitled
to reduce the amount of coverage of the Existing Policy (or any substitute
policies) to the amount of coverage that can be obtained for a premium equal

condition that causes or constitutes a breach of any of its representations
and warranties as of the date of this Agreement, or if it becomes aware of the
occurrence after the date of this Agreement of any fact or condition that
would (except as expressly contemplated by this Agreement) cause or constitute
a breach of any such representation or warranty had such representation or
warranty been made as of the time of occurrence or discovery of such fact or
condition. During the same period, Parent shall promptly notify the Company of
the occurrence of any breach of any of its covenants in this _Article VII_ or
in _Article VIII_ or of the occurrence of any event that would reasonably be
expected to make the satisfaction of the conditions in _Article X_ unlikely.



_Section_ _7.3_ _Reasonable Best Efforts_. During the Pre-Closing Period,
Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the conditions in
_Article X_ to be satisfied.

(a) Parent and the Company shall promptly make all registrations, filings and
submissions with all Governmental Bodies required to be made or effected by
them pursuant to all applicable Legal Requirements with respect to this
Agreement and the Contemplated Transactions. During the Pre-Closing Period,
Parent and the Company shall cooperate with each other with respect to all
filings that the other elects to make or is required by Legal Requirements to
make in connection with the Contemplated Transactions.



(b) Without limiting the generality of _Section 8.1(a)_ , the Company and
Parent shall promptly (but not later than ten (10) calendar days after the
date hereof) make and effect all registrations, filings and submissions
required to be made or effected pursuant to the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust
Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the " _HSR Act_ ") and all other
applicable Legal Requirements with respect to this Agreement and the
Contemplated Transactions in order to obtain the expiration of any applicable
waiting period under any such Legal Requirements or any antitrust clearance
or similar clearance required to be obtained from the Federal Trade
Commission, the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice, any state
attorney general, any foreign competition authority or any other Governmental
Body in connection with the Contemplated Transactions. Each of the Company
and Parent shall bear one-half of the cost of such HSR Act or other filing.



(c) The Company and Parent shall (i) promptly provide all information
requested by any state or federal Governmental Body in connection with this
Agreement and the Contemplated Transactions, and (ii) promptly take all
actions and steps necessary to obtain the expiration of any applicable waiting
period or any antitrust clearance or similar clearance required to be obtained
from the Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division of the Department
of Justice, any state attorney general, any foreign competition authority or
any other governmental entity in connection with the Contemplated
Transactions. The actions required to be taken pursuant to this _Section 8.1_
in order to obtain required expirations or antitrust clearances will include
using reasonable efforts to avoid or set aside any preliminary or permanent
injunction or other Order but do not include making arrangements for the
disposition of particular assets and making arrangements to hold such assets
separate pending their disposition.



(d) Without limiting any other provision of this _Section 8.1_ , each party
hereto shall (i) give the other parties prompt notice of the commencement of
any Proceeding by or before any Governmental Body with respect to this
Agreement or any of the Contemplated Transactions, (ii) keep the other parties
informed as to the status of any such Proceeding, and (c) promptly inform
the other parties of any communication to or from the Federal Trade

\- 51 - _Section_ _8.2_ _Tax Matters_.



(a) Parent shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be
filed all Tax Returns for the Company and its Subsidiary that are filed after
the Closing Date.



(b) Parent shall provide draft copies of Tax Returns for any period beginning
before the Closing Date to the Shareholders Representative at least fifteen
(15) days prior to the due date (taking into account extensions thereof) for
the timely filing of any such Tax Return. Such Tax Return will be prepared
reasonably taking into account the Companys or its Subsidiarys past
practices and shall be provided to Shareholders Representative for review. If
the Shareholders Representative objects to any Tax Return, the Shareholders
Representative must notify Parent within five (5) days after receiving copies
of such Tax Returns. Parent and the Shareholders Representative shall then in
good faith endeavor to resolve any dispute prior to filing such Tax Return. If
the dispute cannot be resolved, the Accountants shall be retained to resolve
such dispute. The determination of the Accountants shall be binding, final and
non-appealable and if the Tax Return that was the subject of such dispute was
filed inconsistent with such determination, such Tax Return shall be promptly
amended to conform with such determination. The principles of _Section
2.11(c)_ with respect to cooperation and the payment of the fees and expenses
of the Accountants shall apply. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, Parent shall pay or cause to be paid any Taxes taken into
account as a liability in the determination of the Estimated Working Capital
or Closing Date Working Capital and shall remit such amount to the relevant
tax authority and together with the Indemnitees shall have no recourse to the
Escrow Fund in respect of such Taxes. The parties hereto shall, to the extent
permitted under applicable law, treat for all Tax purposes the Closing Date as
the last day of the taxable year or period of the Company and its Subsidiary.



(c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
the Indemnitees shall have no recourse to the Escrow Fund with respect to
Taxes resulting from actions (other than actions in connection with the Tax
Returns for the Company or the Subsidiary that are filed after the Closing
Date with respect to periods beginning prior to the Closing Date, but
excluding Tax Returns filed prior to the Closing Date which are amended after
the Closing Date) of Parent, the Company, its Subsidiary, or any Indemnitee
on or after the Closing Date that has the effect of increasing Taxes in
respect of periods for which an Indemnitee may otherwise have recourse to the
Escrow Fund. Without the prior written consent of the Shareholders
Representative, no Tax Return relating to a period for which an Indemnitee may
have recourse to the Escrow Fund may be amended. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, neither parent, the Company, its
Subsidiaries, nor any Indemnitee shall take, or allow to be taken, any action
to contact a taxing authority regarding any Tax reporting position of the
Company or its Subsidiary in respect of a period for which an Indemnitee may
have recourse to the Escrow Fund the effect of which is to accelerate the
making of any claim, the commencement of any audit or other inquiry by a
taxing authority or the payment of (or increase in the amount of) any Taxes
for any such period. If Parent, the Company, its Subsidiaries, or any
Indemnitee takes, or causes to be taken, any such action, the indemnity
provided in _Article XII_ shall be void with respect to any associated payment
of (or increase in) any Taxes. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, the Indemnitees shall have no recourse to the
Escrow Fund with respect to Taxes relating to the absence or loss, in each
case in whole or in part, of any Tax attribute, except if, and only to the
extent that, the net operating loss (NOL) carry-forward of the Company or its
Subsidiary as shown on the audited 2004 Financial Statements is materially
inaccurate. For this purpose, the  



 

\- 52 -  amount of the NOL carry-forward shall not be deemed materially inaccurate as
the result of (i) reductions in the amount of the NOL carry-forward due to
the use thereof by the Company or its Subsidiary after December 31, 2004, or
(ii) any limitations on its use relating to the Contemplated Transactions.



(d) All Tax allocation, indemnity or sharing agreements to which the Company
or its Subsidiary is a party shall not be of further effect with respect to
the Company or its Subsidiary following the Closing.



(e) Parent (for itself and the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiary) and
the Shareholders Representative shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent
reasonably requested by the other party, in connection with any Proceeding
with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon
the Shareholders Representatives request) the provision of records and
information that are reasonably relevant to any such Proceeding. Parent
agrees to cause the Surviving Corporation (i) to retain all books and records
with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Company and its Subsidiary
relating to any taxable period beginning before the Closing Date until the
expiration of the statute of limitations (and any extensions thereof) of the
respective taxable periods, and to abide by all record retention agreements
entered into with any taxing authority, and (ii) to give the Shareholders
Representative reasonable written notice prior to transferring, destroying or
discarding any such books and records and, if the Shareholders Representative
so requests, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiary
to allow the Shareholders Representative to take possession of such books
and records.



(f) Parent and the Shareholders Representative agree, upon request, to use or
cause the Surviving Corporation to use its reasonable efforts to obtain any
certificate or other document from any Governmental Body or any other Person
as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be
imposed (including, but not limited to, with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby).



(g) Without the prior written consent of Parent, neither the Company nor its
Subsidiary (prior to the Effective Time) shall make or change any election,
change an annual accounting period, adopt or change any accounting method,
file any amended Tax Return, enter into any closing agreement, settle any
Tax claim or assessment relating to the Company or its Subsidiary, surrender
any right to claim a refund of Taxes, consent to any extension or waiver of
the limitation period applicable to any Tax claim or assessment relating to
the Company or its Subsidiary, or take any other similar action relating to
the filing of any Tax Return or the payment of any Tax, if such election,
adoption, change, amendment, agreement, settlement, surrender, consent or
other action would have the effect of increasing the Tax liability of the
Company or its Subsidiary for any period ending after the Effective Time or
decreasing any Tax attribute of the Company or its Subsidiary existing at the
Effective Time.

pursuant to either _Section 11.1(e)_ at or after the time an Acquisition
Transaction with a Person other than Parent has been announced to the
shareholders of the Company or (ii) or _Section 11.1(h)_ , then the Company
shall pay Parent the Break-Up Fee as set forth in _Section 11.1(h)_ and,
notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Break-up Fee will
serve as the exclusive remedy to Parent under this Agreement and the
Companys obligation to pay the Break-Up Fee shall survive termination of this
Agreement. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to any provision of
_Section 11.1_ (other than _Section 11.1(e)_ or _Section 11.1(h)_ ),
all further obligations of the parties under this Agreement will terminate,
except that the obligations set forth in this _Section 11.2_ and in _Section
13.1_ and _Section 13.3_ will survive; provided, however, that if this
Agreement is terminated by a party because of any breach of the Agreement by
any other party or because one or more of the conditions to the terminating
partys obligations under this Agreement is not satisfied as a result of any
other partys failure to comply with obligations under this Agreement, the
terminating partys right to pursue all legal remedies will survive such
termination unimpaired.



 

\- 58 - ARTICLE XII



INDEMNIFICATION; ESCROW



_Section_ _12.1_ _Survival_.



(a) The representations and warranties of the Company (including the
representations and warranties set forth in _Article III_ , the Disclosure
Schedule and any updates to _Article III_ or the Disclosure Schedule pursuant
to _Section 6.4_ or _Section 9.1_ and the representations and warranties set
forth or incorporated directly or indirectly in the Closing Payment Schedule,
in the certificate referred to in _Section 9.4(b)_ or in any other certificate
or document delivered by the Company pursuant to this Agreement) shall survive
the Closing and continue in full force and effect until the 540th calendar day
after the Closing Date (the " _Escrow Termination Date_ "). Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if, at any time prior
to the Escrow Termination Date any Indemnitee delivers to the Shareholders
Representative a Notice of Indemnification Claim alleging the existence of an
inaccuracy in or a breach of any of the representations and warranties of the
Company and asserting a claim for recovery under _Section_ _12.2_ based on
such alleged inaccuracy or breach, then the claim asserted in such Notice of
Indemnification Claim shall survive until such time as such claim is fully
and finally resolved. The representations and warranties of Parent and Merger
Sub shall terminate and expire as of the Effective Time.



(b) The covenants and obligations of the Company shall survive the Closing
Date and continue in full force and effect until the Escrow Termination Date;
_provided, however,_ that if, at any time prior to the Escrow Termination
Date, any Indemnitee delivers to the Shareholders Representative a Notice of
Indemnification Claim alleging the existence of a breach of any of the
covenants or obligations of the Company and asserting a claim for recovery
under _Section 12.2_ based on such alleged breach, then the claim asserted in
such Notice of Indemnification Claim shall continue to survive until such
time as such claim is fully and finally resolved. The covenants and
obligations of Parent and Merger Sub shall expire and be of no further force
or effect at the Effective Time; _provided, however,_ that the covenants
and obligations of Parent set forth in _Sections 2.6_ , _2.11(b)  (f)_,
_7.1(b)_ , _12.5_ , _12.6_ and _12.8_ shall survive the Effective Time and
shall expire upon the satisfaction of such covenants and obligations and the
covenants and obligations of Parent set forth in _Sections 7.1(a)_ and _8.2_
shall survive the Effective Time and continue in full force and effect until
the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations.



_Section_ _12.2_ _Indemnification_.



(a) From and after the Effective Time (but subject to  _Section 12.1_ ), the
Indemnitees shall be entitled to be held harmless and indemnified from the
Escrow Fund (and solely out of the Escrow Fund) from and against, and shall be
entitled to compensation and reimbursement from the Escrow Fund for, any
Damages that are directly or indirectly suffered or incurred by any of the
Indemnitees or to which any of the Indemnitees may otherwise become subject
(regardless of whether or not such Damages relate to any Third Party Claim)
and that arise from or as a result of, or are directly or indirectly
connected with:



(i) any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty set forth in
_Article III_ or the Disclosure Schedule as of the date of this Agreement
(without giving effect to any update pursuant to _Section 6.4_ );



 

\- 59 - (ii) any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty set forth
in  _Article III_ or the Disclosure Schedule as if such representation and
warranty had been made on and as of the Closing Date (giving effect to any
update pursuant to _Section 6.4_ );



(iii) any inaccuracy in or breach of any certification, representation or
warranty set forth in the certificate referred to in _Section 9.4(b)_ or in
any other certificate or document delivered by the Company under this
Agreement; or



(iv) any breach of any covenant or obligation of the Company;



(b) The parties acknowledge and agree that, if the Surviving Corporation
suffers, incurs or otherwise becomes subject to any Damages as a result of or
in connection with any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or obligation, then (without limiting any of the rights of
the Surviving Corporation as an Indemnitee) Parent shall also be deemed, by
virtue of its ownership of the stock of the Surviving Corporation, to have
incurred Damages as a result of and in connection with such inaccuracy or
breach.



(c) If any Third Party Claim or other claim with respect to which Parent or
any other Indemnitee is entitled to be held harmless, indemnified, compensated
or reimbursed pursuant to this _Article XII_ is covered by insurance, Damages
arising from or attributable to such claim shall be reduced by an amount
equal to the net insurance proceeds reasonably likely to be recovered by
Parent or such other Indemnitee.



(d) If any Third Party Claim or other claim with respect to which Parent or
any other Indemnitee is entitled to be held harmless, indemnified,
compensated or reimbursed pursuant to this _Article XII_ shall result in a tax
benefit to Parent or such other Indemnitee, the Damages arising from or
attributable to such claim shall be reduced by an amount equal to the amount
by which Taxes payable (as determined on a present value basis using a
discount rate of five percent (5%)) by such party or its Affiliate is reduced
below the amount of Taxes that such party or its Affiliate would be required
to pay but for the incurrence of such Damages.



(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, neither
Parent nor any other Indemnitee shall have any recourse to the Escrow Fund in
respect of any liability to the extent such liability was included in the
calculation of Working Capital.



(f) From and after the Effective Time (but subject to _Section 12.1_ ),
Parent shall hold harmless and indemnify the Shareholders Representative and
the Non-Dissenting Shareholders and Closing Date Option Holders from and
against any Damages that are directly or indirectly suffered or incurred by
any such holders or to which such holders may become subject and that arise
from or as a result of or are directly or indirectly connected with any breach
of the covenants and obligations of Parent in _Sections 2.6_ , _2.11(b)-(f)_
, _7.1_ , _12.5_ , _12.6_ or _12.8_.



 

\- 60 - _Section_ _12.3_ _Threshold; Ceiling_.



(a) Except in the case of fraud, the Indemnitees shall not be entitled to
recover any Damages pursuant to _Section 12.2_ for any matter until such time
as the total amount of all Damages (including the Damages arising in
connection with such matter and all other Damages arising from any other
matters of the type referred to in _Section 12.2_ ) that have been directly
or indirectly suffered or incurred by any one or more of the Indemnitees, or
to which any one or more of the Indemnitees has or have otherwise become
subject, exceeds $5.25 million in the aggregate. At such time as the
cumulative amount of such Damages exceeds $5.25 million in the aggregate, the
Indemnitees shall be entitled to recover only the portion of such Damages
exceeding $5.25 million.



(b) The parties to this Agreement hereby agree that the exclusive remedy for
any breach of a representation or warranty, covenant or agreement contained in
this Agreement shall be the indemnification provisions set out in this
_Article XII_ ; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this  _Section 12.3_
shall prohibit any party from seeking specific performance or injunctive
relief against any other party in respect of a breach by such other party of
any covenant hereunder. The parties further agree that the sole recourse
for indemnification claims by the Indemnitees shall be recovery of funds from
the Escrow Fund in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement.



_Section_ _12.4_ _No Contribution_. No Non-Dissenting Shareholder shall have
any right of contribution, right of indemnity or other right or remedy
against Parent or against the Surviving Corporation in connection with any
indemnification obligation or any other liability to which such Non-Dissenting
Shareholder may become subject under or in connection with this Agreement or
any of the Contemplated Transactions.



_Section_ _12.5_ _Defense of Third Party Claims_. In the event of the
assertion or commencement by any Person of any claim or Proceeding (whether
against the Surviving Corporation, against Parent or against any other
Person) with respect to which any Indemnitee may be entitled to be held
harmless, indemnified, compensated or reimbursed pursuant to this _Article
XII_ (a " _Third Party Claim_ "), (a) Parent shall notify the
Shareholders Representative, promptly after Parent receives notice of such
Third Party Claim, of the nature of such Third Party Claim and the amount of
damages claimed by the Person who asserted or commenced such Third Party Claim
(it being understood that any failure by Parent to so promptly notify the
Shareholders Representative shall have no effect on an Indemnitees ability
to recover Damages pursuant to this _Article XII_ , except to the extent that
the defense of such Third Party Claim is materially prejudiced by such
failure), and (b) the Indemnitee shall deliver to the Shareholders
Representative, promptly after the Indemnitees receipt thereof, copies of all
notices and documents (including court papers) received by the Indemnitee
relating to a Third Party Claim. The Shareholders Representative shall be
entitled to assume and control the defense of such Third Party Claim, using
funds from the Escrow Fund, and through counsel of its choice (unless such
claim is covered by insurance which mandates insurance company selection of
such counsel) if it gives written notice of its intention to do so to the
Indemnitee within thirty (30) days of the receipt of such notice from the
Indemnitee in which case the Indemnitee shall not be entitled to recover from
the Escrow Fund any fees of counsel or any other expenses with respect to the
defense of such Third Party Claim; provided, however, that if the Indemnitee
reasonably determines based upon written advice of counsel that a conflict of
interest exists that would make it inappropriate for the same counsel to
represent both the Indemnitee and the Shareholders Representative, then the
Indemnitee shall be entitled to retain its own counsel at the expense of the
Escrow Fund; provided, further, that the Indemnitee shall not in such event be
entitled to obtain from the Escrow Fund fees and expenses of more than one
firm of separate counsel  



 

\- 61 -  in connection with any Third Party Claim in the same jurisdiction, in
addition to any local counsel. In the event that the Shareholders
Representative exercises the right to undertake any such defense against such
Third Party Claim as provided above, the Indemnitee shall cooperate with the
Indemnifying Party in such defense and make available to the Shareholders
Representative, out of funds from the Escrow Fund, the Shareholders
Representatives expense, all witnesses, pertinent records, materials and
information in the Indemnitees possession or under the Indemnitees control
relating thereto as is reasonably required by the Shareholders
Representative. Similarly, in the event the Indemnitee is, directly or
indirectly, conducting the defense against any such Third Party Claim, the
Shareholders Representative shall cooperate with the Indemnitee in such
defense and make available to the Indemnitee, out of funds from the Escrow
Fund all expenses, all such witnesses, records, materials and information in
the Shareholders Representatives possession or under the Shareholders
Representatives control relating thereto as is reasonably required by the
Indemnitee. No compromise or settlement of such Third Party Claim may be
effected by either the Indemnitee or the Shareholders Representative without
the other partys consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed) unless (i) there is no finding or admission of any violation of law
and no effect on any other claims that may be made against such other party
and (ii) each Indemnitee that is party to such claim is released from
liability with respect to such claim. A claim for indemnification for any
matter not including a Third Party Claim shall be asserted by written notice
to the party from whom indemnification is sought.



_Section_ _12.6_ _Duty to Mitigate_. Parent and any other Indemnitee shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate or otherwise reduce the amount
of any Damages that it incurs in connection with any matter with respect to
which it is entitled to be held harmless, indemnified, compensated or
reimbursed pursuant to this _Article XII,_ including taking commercially
reasonable measures to attempt to recover any insurance proceeds available to
offset such Damages under insurance policies maintained by Parent or the
Surviving Corporation or any other Indemnitee.



_Section_ _12.7_ _Exercise of Remedies by Indemnitees Other Than Parent_. No
Indemnitee (other than Parent or any successor thereto or assign thereof)
shall be permitted to assert any indemnification claim or exercise any other
remedy under this Agreement unless Parent (or any successor thereto or assign
thereof) shall have consented to the assertion of such indemnification claim
or the exercise of such other remedy.



_Section_ _12.8_ _Indemnification Claims; Escrow Fund Arrangements_.



(a) Any Indemnitee seeking to be held harmless, indemnified, compensated or
reimbursed pursuant to this _Article XII_ shall deliver a notice to the
Shareholders Representative and the Escrow Agent (any such notice being
referred to as a " _Notice of Indemnification Claim_ ," and the claim for
indemnification, compensation and reimbursement described in such Notice of
Indemnification Claim being referred to as an " _indemnification claim_ ").
Each Notice of Indemnification Claim shall (i) state that the Indemnitee
giving such Notice of Indemnification Claim believes that there is or has been
an inaccuracy in or breach of a representation, warranty, covenant or
obligation contained in this Agreement or that such Indemnitee is otherwise
entitled to be held harmless, indemnified, compensated or reimbursed under
this _Article XII_ , (ii) contain a brief description of the circumstances
supporting such Indemnitees belief that there is or has been such an
inaccuracy or breach or that such Indemnitee is otherwise entitled to be held
harmless, indemnified, compensated or reimbursed, and (iii) contain a good
faith, non-binding, preliminary estimate of the aggregate dollar amount of
actual and potential Damages that have arisen and may arise as a result of
the inaccuracy or breach or other matter referred to in such  



 

\- 62 -  Notice of Indemnification Claim (the amount of such estimate, as it may be
modified by such Indemnitee in good faith from time to time, being referred to
as the " _Claimed Amount_ "). 

---|--- 



(b) During the 60-day period commencing upon the delivery by an Indemnitee to
the Shareholders Representative and the Escrow Agent of a Notice of
Indemnification Claim (the " _Dispute Period_ "), the Shareholders
Representative may deliver to the Indemnitee and the Escrow Agent a written
response (the " _Response Notice_ ") in which the Shareholders
Representative: (i) agrees that the full Claimed Amount is owed to the
Indemnitee; (ii) agrees that part (but not all) of the Claimed Amount (the "
_Agreed Amount_ ") is owed to the Indemnitee; or (iii) asserts that no part of
the Claimed Amount is owed to the Indemnitee. Any part of the Claimed
Amount that is not agreed by the Shareholders Representative to be owed to
the Indemnitee pursuant to the Response Notice (or the entire Claimed Amount,
if the Shareholders Representative asserts in the Response Notice that no
part of the Claimed Amount is owed to the Indemnitee) shall be referred to as
the " _Contested Amount_ " (it being understood that the Contested Amount
shall be modified from time to time to reflect any good faith modifications by
the Indemnitee to the Claimed Amount). If a Response Notice is not received
by the Indemnitee prior to the expiration of the Dispute Period, then the
Shareholders Representative shall be conclusively and irrevocably deemed to
have agreed that the full Claimed Amount set forth in the Notice of
Indemnification Claim is owed to the Indemnitee.



(c) If (i) the Shareholders Representative delivers a Response Notice to the
Indemnitee during the Dispute Period agreeing that the full Claimed Amount is
owed to the Indemnitee, or (ii) the Shareholders Representative does not
deliver a Response Notice to the Indemnitee during the Dispute Period, then
Parent and the Shareholders Representative shall jointly execute and deliver
to the Escrow Agent, within three (3) Business Days following the earlier of
the delivery of such Response Notice or the expiration of the Dispute Period,
a written notice instructing the Escrow Agent to disburse the full Claimed
Amount set forth in the Notice of Indemnification Claim to the Indemnitee
from the Escrow Fund.



(d) If the Shareholders Representative delivers a Response Notice to the
Indemnitee during the Dispute Period agreeing that less than the full Claimed
Amount is owed to the Indemnitee, then Parent and the Shareholders
Representative shall jointly execute and deliver to the Escrow Agent, within
three (3) Business Days following the delivery of such Response Notice,
a written notice instructing the Escrow Agent to disburse the Agreed Amount
to the Indemnitee from the Escrow Fund.



(e) If the Shareholders Representative delivers a Response Notice to the
Indemnitee during the Dispute Period indicating that there is a Contested
Amount, then the Shareholders Representative and the Indemnitee shall attempt
to resolve the dispute relating to the Contested Amount. If the Indemnitee and
the Shareholders Representative resolve such dispute, then a settlement
agreement shall be signed by the Indemnitee and the Shareholders
Representative. Parent and the Shareholders Representative shall jointly
execute and deliver to the Escrow Agent, within three (3) Business Days
following the execution of such settlement agreement, a written notice
instructing the Escrow Agent to disburse the amount specified in such
settlement agreement to the Indemnitee from the Escrow Fund.



(f) If there is a dispute between the Shareholders Representative and the
Indemnitee relating to a Contested Amount and no settlement agreement is
reached despite negotiations between the parties pursuant to _Section 12.8(e)_
during the 30-day period commencing upon the delivery of the Response Notice
to the Indemnitee, then either Parent or the Shareholders Representative may,
by  



 

\- 63 -  written notice to the other, submit such dispute to binding arbitration in
the County of Los Angeles, California in accordance with the JAMS
Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures in effect on the date of the
execution of this Agreement (the " _Rules_ "); _provided, however,_ that if
the amount of the Damages relating to the disputed indemnification claim is at
issue in pending litigation with a third party, arbitration shall not be
commenced until such amount is determined by a judgment or settlement
agreement or if both parties agree to arbitration. Arbitration will be
conducted by one arbitrator mutually selected by Parent and the Shareholders
Representative; _provided, however,_ that if Parent and the Shareholders
Representative fail to mutually select an arbitrator within fifteen (15)
Business Days after such dispute is submitted to arbitration, then either
Parent or the Shareholders Representative can request that JAMS select the
arbitrator in accordance with the Rules. The parties agree to use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the arbitration hearing to be conducted within 75
days after the appointment of the arbitrator, and to use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the decision of the arbitrator to be furnished
within fifteen (15) Business Days after the conclusion of the arbitration
hearing. The arbitrators authority shall be confined to determining: (i)
whether the Indemnitee is entitled to recover the Contested Amount (or a
portion thereof), and the portion of the Contested Amount the Indemnitee is
entitled to recover; and (ii) whether the Indemnitee is the prevailing party
as hereinafter provided. The final decision of the arbitrator shall include
the dollar amount of the award to the Indemnitee, if any (the " _Award Amount_
") and the findings of fact and conclusions of law on which it is based,
shall be furnished to the Shareholders Representative, the Indemnitee and the
Escrow Agent in writing and shall constitute a conclusive determination of the
issues in question, binding upon the Shareholders Representative and the
Indemnitee. If the Indemnitee is determined by the arbitrator to be the
prevailing party, then the Award Amount shall be increased by the amount of
the reasonable expenses in connection with the arbitration (including
attorneys fees, administrative fees and any portion of the arbitrators fees
and expenses) paid and payable by the Indemnitee in connection with the
arbitration. If the Indemnitee is determined by the arbitrator not to be
the prevailing party and the arbitrator determines that the Shareholders
Representative is the prevailing party, then any Award Amount shall be reduced
by the amount of the reasonable expenses (including attorneys fees,
administrative fees and any portion of the arbitrators fees and expenses)
paid and payable by the Shareholders Representative in connection with the
arbitration; and if no amount is awarded to the Indemnitee, or the
Shareholders Representatives reasonable expenses exceed the Award Amount,
the Indemnitee shall reimburse the Shareholders Representative for his
reasonable expenses (including attorneys fees, administrative fees and any
portion of the arbitrators fees and expenses) paid and payable by the
Shareholders Representative in connection with the arbitration. Judgment upon
any award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having
jurisdiction. Parent and the Shareholders Representative shall jointly
execute and deliver to the Escrow Agent, within three (3) Business Days
following the receipt of the final decision of the arbitrator setting forth
the Award Amount, a written notice instructing the Escrow Agent to disburse
the Award Amount to the Indemnitee from the Escrow Fund. 

---|--- 



(g) The Escrow Fund shall be disbursed to the Escrow Participants as follows:



(i) If the amount held in the Escrow Fund (the " _Escrow Balance_ ") as of
the Escrow Termination Date exceeds the aggregate amount of the Contested
Amounts (including the entire Claimed Amount with respect to each
indemnification claim as to which the Dispute Period has not yet expired and
no Response Notice has been delivered) associated with all Unresolved Escrow
Claims as of the Escrow Termination Date, then within three (3) Business Days
thereafter Parent and  



 

\- 64 -  the Shareholders Representative shall jointly execute and deliver to the
Escrow Agent a written notice instructing the Escrow Agent to disburse to
the Escrow Participants from the Escrow Fund, in accordance with _Section
12.8(h)_ , an amount equal to the amount by which the Escrow Balance as of the
Escrow Termination Date exceeds the sum of such Contested Amounts (including
any such Claimed Amounts). 

---|--- 



(ii) Following the Escrow Termination Date, if an indemnification claim that
had not, prior to that date, been finally resolved and paid in accordance with
this _Section 12.8_ (an " _Unresolved Escrow Claim_ ") is finally resolved,
Parent and the Shareholders Representative shall jointly execute and deliver
to the Escrow Agent, within three (3) Business Days after the final resolution
of such Unresolved Escrow Claim and the payment from the Escrow Fund of all
amounts, if any, owing to the Indemnitee that asserted such Unresolved Escrow
Claim, a written notice instructing the Escrow Agent to disburse to the Escrow
Participants from the Escrow Fund an amount equal to the amount by which the
Escrow Balance as of the date of the disbursement exceeds the aggregate
amount of the Contested Amounts (including the entire Claimed Amount with
respect to each indemnification claim as to which the Dispute Period has not
yet expired and no Response Notice has been delivered), if any, determined to
be owing pursuant to this _Section 12.8(g)(ii)_ , in connection with the
Unresolved Escrow Claims.



(iii) For purposes of this _Section 12.8_ , the " _Escrow Participants_ "
shall be the Non-Dissenting Shareholders pursuant to _Section 2.5(a)(iii)(y)_
and _Section 2.5(a)(v)_ and the Closing Date Option Holders.



(iv) Each disbursement from the Escrow Fund to be made to the Escrow
Participants shall be made on a pro rata basis based on the
Escrow Participants respective Escrow Participation. An Escrow Participants
" _Escrow Participation_ " shall be the percentage corresponding to the
fraction having a numerator equal to the amount contributed to the Escrow
Fund pursuant to _Section 2.5(c)_ on behalf of such Escrow Participant and
having a denominator equal to the Aggregate Escrow Cash Amount.



_Section_ _12.9_ _Knowledge_. No Person shall be liable for, and no Indemnitee
shall be entitled to indemnification under this Agreement for, any Damages
resulting from any event relating to the breach of a representation or
warranty if any Indemnitee had Knowledge on or before the Closing Date of such
event. Each Indemnitee shall be deemed to have waived in full any breach of
any of the Companys representations and warranties of which such Indemnitee
has such Knowledge on or before the Closing Date.



_Section_ _12.10_ _No Consequential Damages_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, no Person shall be liable to or otherwise
responsible for consequential, incidental or punitive damages or for
diminution in value or lost profits.



 

\- 65 - ARTICLE XIII



GENERAL PROVISIONS



_Section_ _13.1_ _Expenses_. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this
Agreement, including _Section 2.5(b)_ , each party will bear such partys
respective expenses incurred in connection with the preparation, execution,
and performance of this Agreement and the Contemplated Transactions, including

press release (and individual press releases that have been approved by the
other party) upon execution of this Agreement and upon the Closing. Except as

Companys employees, customers, and suppliers and others having dealings with
the Company will be informed of the Contemplated Transactions. Except as may

_Section_ _13.7_ _Waiver_. The parties rights and remedies are cumulative and
not alternative. A partys failure or delay in exercising any right, power,
or privilege under this Agreement or the documents referred to in this
Agreement will not operate as a waiver of such right, power, or privilege, and

permitted by applicable law: (a) no claim or right arising out of this
Agreement or the documents referred to in this Agreement can be discharged by

instance for which it is given; and (c) no notice to or demand on one party

degree will remain in full force and effect to the extent not held invalid or
unenforceable.

_Section_ _13.16_   _Shareholders  Representative; Escrow Fund
Arrangements_.



(a) The Non-Dissenting Shareholders, by virtue of the approval of the
principal terms of the Merger, hereby irrevocably nominate, constitute and
appoint Farhad Mohit as the agent, agent for service of process and true and
lawful attorney-in-fact of the Non-Dissenting Shareholders (the "
_Shareholders  Representative_"), with full power of substitution, to act in
the name, place and stead of the Non-Dissenting Shareholders with respect to
this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement and the taking by the Shareholders
Representative of any and all actions and the making of any decisions required
or permitted to be taken or made by the Shareholders Representative under
this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement including the exercise of the power:
(i) to execute, deliver, acknowledge, certify and file (in the name of any or
all of the Non-Dissenting Shareholders or otherwise) any and all documents and
to take any and all actions that the Shareholders Representative may, in his
sole discretion, determine to be necessary, desirable or appropriate in
connection with any matter covered in _Section 2.11_ or any indemnification
claim under _Article XII_ or under the Escrow Agreement (including
negotiating, entering into compromises or settlements of and demanding
arbitration with respect to any such matters covered in _Section 2.11_ or any
indemnification claim); and (ii) to give and receive notices and
communications under this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement. Farhad Mohit
hereby accepts his appointment as the Shareholders Representative.



(b) The power of attorney granted in this _Section 13.16_ : (i) is coupled
with an interest and is irrevocable; (ii) may be delegated by the
Shareholders Representative; and (iii) shall survive the death or incapacity
of each of the Non-Dissenting Shareholders.



(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement or
the Escrow Agreement, each Indemnitee shall be entitled to deal exclusively
with the Shareholders Representative on all matters relating to _Section
2.11_ , _Article XII_ and the Escrow Agreement, and shall be entitled to rely
conclusively (without further evidence of any kind whatsoever) on any
document executed or purported to be executed on behalf of any Non-Dissenting
Shareholder by the Shareholders Representative, and on any other action taken
or purported to be taken on behalf of any Non-Dissenting Shareholder by
the Shareholders Representative, as fully binding upon such Non-Dissenting
Shareholder.



(d) The Shareholders Representative may at any time designate a replacement
Shareholders Representative and the Non-Dissenting Shareholders, by virtue
of the approval of the principal terms of the Merger, hereby consent to such
replacement Shareholders Representative. The Shareholders Representative may
be changed by Escrow Participants whose Escrow Participations total more than
50% from time to time upon not less than 10 days prior written notice to
Parent and the Escrow Agent. If the Shareholders Representative shall die,
become disabled or otherwise be unable to fulfill his responsibilities as
representative of the Non-Dissenting Shareholders, then the Non-Dissenting
Shareholders shall, by "majority vote" within 30 days after such death or
disability, appoint a successor  



 

\- 70 -  representative and, promptly thereafter, shall notify Parent of the identity
of such successor. Any such successor shall become the
"Shareholders Representative" for purposes of this Agreement. If for any
reason there is no Shareholders Representative at any time, all references
herein to the Shareholders Representative shall be deemed to refer to the
Non-Dissenting Shareholders.



(e) No bond shall be required of the Shareholders Representative and the
Shareholders Representative shall receive no compensation for his services.
The Shareholders Representative shall not be liable to any Non-Dissenting
Shareholder for any act done or omitted hereunder as Shareholders
Representative while acting in good faith and in the exercise of his
reasonable business judgment with respect to any matter arising out of or in
connection with the acceptance or administration of his duties hereunder (it
being understood that any act done or omitted pursuant to the advice of
counsel shall be conclusive evidence of such good faith). The Shareholders
Representative shall be entitled to be indemnified out of the Escrow Fund for
any loss, liability or expense incurred without gross negligence or bad faith
on the part of the Shareholders Representative with respect to any matter
arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of his
duties hereunder. The Shareholders Representative shall be entitled to
recover any out-of-pocket costs and expenses reasonably incurred by the
Shareholders Representative in good faith and in connection with actions
taken by the Shareholders Representative pursuant to this Agreement and the
Escrow Agreement (including the hiring of legal counsel and the incurring of
legal fees and costs) from the Escrow Fund. The Shareholders Representative
shall keep reasonably detailed records of the costs and expenses for which he
seeks reimbursement from the Escrow Fund.



(f) The Escrow Agreement will provide that, if at any time while funds remain
in the Escrow Fund, the Shareholders Representative delivers written
instructions signed solely by him to the Escrow Agent to disburse funds
therefrom as contemplated by _Section 13.16(e)_ , the Escrow Agent shall make
the requested disbursement in the manner so instructed.



_Section_ _13.17_ _Other Remedies; Specific Performance_. Except as otherwise
provided in this Agreement, any and all remedies expressly conferred upon any
party by the terms of this Agreement will be deemed cumulative with and not
exclusive of any other remedy conferred by this Agreement, or by law
or equity upon such party, and the exercise by any party of any one remedy
will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy. The parties hereto agree
that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of
this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or
were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties hereto
shall be entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of
this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in
any court of the United States or any state having jurisdiction, this being in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.



_Section_ _13.18_ _Waiver of Jury Trial_. Each of the parties irrevocably
waives any and all rights to trial by jury in any Proceeding between the
parties arising out of or relating to this Agreement and the Contemplated
Transactions.



_Section_ _13.19_ _Incorporation by Reference_. All references made in this
Agreement to any Section, Article, Annex, Exhibit or Schedule which is not
otherwise expressly indicated to be a reference to another document shall be
deemed to be a reference to a Section, Article, an Annex, Exhibit or Schedule
to this Agreement. All such Annexes, Exhibits and Schedules are incorporated
in and made part of this Agreement by reference.



 

\- 71 - _Section_ _13.20_ _Computation of Time_. If the day on which any delivery or
performance is due under this Agreement is not a Business Day, the time for
satisfaction of such delivery or performance shall be extended without any
action on the part of any party to the next succeeding Business Day.
