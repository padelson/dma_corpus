Arbitration Rules &amp; Procedures in effect on the date of the execution of this Agreement (the &#147;<U>Rules</U>&#148;); <I>provided, however, </I>that if the amount of the Damages relating to the disputed indemnification claim is at issue in
pending litigation with a third party, arbitration shall not be commenced until such amount is determined by a judgment or settlement agreement or if both parties agree to arbitration. Arbitration will be conducted by one arbitrator mutually
selected by Parent and the Shareholders&#146; Representative; <I>provided, however,</I> that if Parent and the Shareholders&#146; Representative fail to mutually select an arbitrator within fifteen (15) Business Days after such dispute is submitted
to arbitration, then either Parent or the Shareholders&#146; Representative can request that JAMS select the arbitrator in accordance with the Rules. The parties agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the arbitration hearing to be
conducted within 75 days after the appointment of the arbitrator, and to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the decision of the arbitrator to be furnished within fifteen (15) Business Days after the conclusion of the arbitration hearing.
The arbitrator&#146;s authority shall be confined to determining: (i) whether the Indemnitee is entitled to recover the Contested Amount (or a portion thereof), and the portion of the Contested Amount the Indemnitee is entitled to recover; and (ii)
whether the Indemnitee is the prevailing party as hereinafter provided. The final decision of the arbitrator shall include the dollar amount of the award to the Indemnitee, if any (the &#147;<U>Award Amount</U>&#148;) and the findings of fact and
conclusions of law on which it is based, shall be furnished to the Shareholders&#146; Representative, the Indemnitee and the Escrow Agent in writing and shall constitute a conclusive determination of the issues in question, binding upon the
Shareholders&#146; Representative and the Indemnitee. If the Indemnitee is determined by the arbitrator to be the prevailing party, then the Award Amount shall be increased by the amount of the reasonable expenses in connection with the arbitration
(including attorneys&#146; fees, administrative fees and any portion of the arbitrator&#146;s fees and expenses) paid and payable by the Indemnitee in connection with the arbitration. If the Indemnitee is determined by the arbitrator not to be the
prevailing party and the arbitrator determines that the Shareholders&#146; Representative is the prevailing party, then any Award Amount shall be reduced by the amount of the reasonable expenses (including attorneys&#146; fees, administrative fees
and any portion of the arbitrator&#146;s fees and expenses) paid and payable by the Shareholders&#146; Representative in connection with the arbitration; and if no amount is awarded to the Indemnitee, or the Shareholders&#146; Representative&#146;s

expenses) paid and payable by the Shareholders&#146; Representative in connection with the arbitration. Judgment upon any award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. Parent and the Shareholders&#146;
