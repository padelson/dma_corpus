The Parties agree that the Asset Consideration shall be allocated in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury
Regulations thereunder. The Parties agree that Landcadia shall prepare and provide to Seller Parent a draft allocation of the Asset
Consideration among the Purchased Assets within ninety (90) days after the Closing Date. Seller Parent shall notify Landcadia within
thirty (30) days of receipt of such draft allocation of any objection Seller Parent may have thereto. Unless Seller Parent delivers

the draft allocation provided by Landcadia to Seller Parent pursuant to the second sentence of this </FONT><U>Section 2.6</U> shall
become final and binding upon the Parties. Landcadia and Seller Parent agree to resolve any disagreement with respect to such allocation
in good faith. If Landcadia and Seller Parent are unable to timely resolve such disagreement within thirty (30) days following
the delivery of such a notice of objection, then any remaining disputed matters shall be finally and conclusively determined by
a mutually agreed independent accounting firm, the fees and expenses of which shall be paid by Landcadia and Seller Parent in a
manner determined by such accounting firm. In addition, the Parties hereby undertake and agree to file timely any information that
may be required to be filed pursuant to Treasury Regulations promulgated under Section 1060(b) of the Code, and shall use an agreed
allocation determined pursuant to this <U>Section 2.6</U> in connection with the preparation of Internal Revenue Service Form 8594

which is inconsistent with an agreed allocation determined pursuant to this <U>Section 2.6</U>, except as may be adjusted by subsequent
agreement following an audit by the Internal Revenue Service or as required by Law; provided, that no Party (nor their Affiliates)
shall be obligated to litigate any challenge to such allocation of the Asset Consideration by any Governmental Authority. The Parties

of the Corporation. If the meeting is to be held at a place, then the list shall be produced and kept at the time and place of

Any indemnification of a director or officer of the Corporation or advancement of
expenses (including attorneys&rsquo; fees, costs and charges) under this <U>Article VIII</U> shall be made promptly, and in any
event within 45 days (or, in the case of an advancement of expenses, 20 days, provided that the director or officer has delivered
the undertaking contemplated by <U>Section 8.1</U> if required), upon the written request of the director or officer. If the Corporation
denies a written request for indemnification or advancement of expenses, in whole or in part, or if payment in full pursuant to
such request is not made within 45 days (or, in the case of an advancement of expenses, 20 days, provided that the director or
officer has delivered the undertaking contemplated by <U>Section 8.1</U> if required), the right to indemnification or advancements
as granted by this <U>Article VIII</U> shall be enforceable by the director or officer in the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware, which shall be the sole and exclusive forum for any such action. Such person&rsquo;s costs and expenses incurred in connection
with successfully establishing his or her right to indemnification, in whole or in part, in any such action shall also be indemnified
by the Corporation to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. It shall be a defense to any such action (other than an action
brought to enforce a claim for the advancement of expenses where the undertaking required pursuant to <U>Section 8.1</U>, if any,
has been tendered to the Corporation) that the claimant has not met the standards of conduct which make it permissible under the
DGCL for the Corporation to indemnify the claimant for the amount claimed, but the burden of such defense shall be on the Corporation
to the maximum extent permitted by law. Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its Board, independent legal counsel
or its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant
is proper in the circumstances because he or she has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the DGCL, nor an actual
determination by the Corporation (including its Board, independent legal counsel or its stockholders) that the claimant has not
met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that the claimant has not met
the applicable standard of conduct.</P>

Indemnitee has not met any applicable standard for indemnification set forth in the Act. Neither the failure of the Company (including
its Managing Member or independent legal counsel) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such suit that indemnification
of the Indemnitee is proper in the circumstances because the Indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in
the Act, nor an actual determination by the Company (including the Managing Member or independent legal counsel) that the Indemnitee
has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall create a presumption that the Indemnitee has not met the applicable standard
of conduct or, in the case of such a suit brought by the Indemnitee, be a defense to such suit. In any suit brought by an Indemnitee
to enforce a right to indemnification or to an Advancement of Expenses hereunder, or brought by the Company to recover an Advancement
of Expenses hereunder pursuant to the terms of an Undertaking, the burden of proving that the Indemnitee is not entitled to be
indemnified, or to such Advancement of Expenses, shall be on the Company.</P>
