AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 



 

THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this "Agreement") is made and entered into
as of August 16, 2017, by and between National Commerce Corporation ("NCC"), a
corporation organized and existing under the Laws of the State of Delaware,
with its principal office in Birmingham, Alabama; and FirstAtlantic Financial
Holdings, Inc. ("FFHI"), a corporation organized and existing under the Laws
of the State of Florida, with its principal office in Jacksonville, Florida.

 



 

 _Preamble_

 



 

The respective Boards of Directors of NCC and FFHI have determined that the
transactions described herein are in the best interests of the Parties and
their respective stockholders. This Agreement provides for the acquisition of
FFHI by NCC pursuant to the merger of FFHI with and into NCC (the "Merger").
At the effective time of the Merger, and except as provided herein, the
outstanding equity securities of FFHI shall be converted into the right to
receive shares of common stock of NCC or, at the election of the stockholders
of FFHI, into cash (subject to the requirements and limitations set forth
herein).

 



 

The transactions described in or otherwise contemplated by this Agreement are
subject to, among other things: (i) the filing by NCC and the effectiveness of
a registration statement with respect to the shares of common stock of NCC to
be issued by NCC in the Merger; (ii) the approval of the stockholders of FFHI;
(iii) the approval of, notice to and/or waiver of the Federal Reserve and the
OCC; and (iv) the satisfaction of certain other conditions described in this
Agreement. It is the intention of the parties to this Agreement that, for
federal income tax purposes, the Merger and the Bank Merger shall each qualify
as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and the
Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder, and that this Agreement shall
constitute, and is adopted as, a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning
of Section 368(a) of the Code for purposes of Sections 354, 356 and 361 of the
Code (and any comparable provision of state law) for federal and applicable
state income tax purposes.

 



 

Certain capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined in this Agreement are
defined in Section 11.1 of this Agreement.

 



 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the above and the mutual warranties,
representations, covenants and agreements set forth herein, the Parties agree
as follows:

 



 

Article 1 _ 
Transaction and Terms of Merger_

 



 

1.1 _The Merger_ _._ Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, at the Effective Time, FFHI shall be merged with and into NCC in
accordance with the provisions of Section 252 of the DGCL and Section 607.1107
of the FBCA. At the Effective Time, the separate corporate existence of FFHI
shall cease. NCC shall be the surviving corporation resulting from the Merger
(the "Surviving Corporation") and shall continue to be governed by the DGCL.
The Merger will be consummated pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, which
has been approved and adopted by the respective Boards of Directors of NCC and
FFHI.

 



 



 

 



   



 

1.2 _Time and Place of Closing._ The place of the Closing shall be
at the offices of Maynard, Cooper and Gale, P.C., Birmingham, Alabama, or such
other place as may be mutually agreed upon by the Parties. Subject to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, unless otherwise mutually agreed upon
in writing by the chief executive officers of NCC and FFHI, the Closing will
take place at 9:00 a.m. Central Time on the last Business Day of the month in
which the closing conditions set forth in Article 9 below (other than those
conditions that are to be satisfied at the Closing) have been satisfied or
waived pursuant to Section 11.4 of this Agreement (the date of such Closing,
the "Closing Date").

 



 

1.3 _Effective Time._ Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement and the occurrence of the Closing, the Merger shall become
effective: (a) on the date and at the time that the later of the following
shall occur: (i) the Certificate of Merger required by the DGCL shall be
accepted for filing by the Secretary of State of Delaware, and (ii) the
Articles of Merger required by the FBCA shall be accepted for filing by the
Secretary of State of Florida; or (b) on such date and at such time subsequent
to the date and time established pursuant to subsection 1.3(a) above as may be
specified by the Parties in the Certificate of Merger and Articles of Merger
(provided that such subsequent date and time shall not be later than a time on
the 30th day after the date on which the Certificate of Merger and Articles of
Merger are filed) (such time is hereinafter referred to as the "Effective
Time"). Unless the chief executive officers of NCC and FFHI otherwise mutually
agree in writing, the Parties shall use their commercially reasonable efforts
to cause the Effective Time to occur on the Closing Date.

 



 

1.4 _Voting Agreements._ Concurrently with the execution and delivery of
this Agreement and as a material condition hereto, each member of the FFHI
Board and certain executive officers of FFHI are entering into Voting
Agreements with NCC whereby, among other things, such Persons have agreed,
upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, to vote all of
the shares of FFHI Common Stock owned by them in favor of this Agreement and
the Merger and to support actions necessary to consummate the Merger and the
Bank Merger.

 



 

1.5 _Merger of Bank Subsidiaries._ At the later of the Effective Time or
such time as provided in Section 8.13, FirstAtlantic Bank, a federal savings
association and wholly owned subsidiary of FFHI ("FirstAtlantic Bank") will be
merged (the "Bank Merger") with and into National Bank of Commerce, a national
banking association and wholly owned subsidiary of NCC ("NBC"), with NBC as
the surviving association, upon the terms and with the effect set forth in an
agreement and plan of merger (the "Bank Merger Agreement") in substantially
the form attached hereto as _Exhibit A_.

 



 

Article 2 _ 
Effect of THE Merger_

 



 

2.1 _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws._ The Certificate of
Incorporation of NCC in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation immediately
after the Effective Time, unless and until amended in accordance with
applicable Law. The Bylaws of NCC in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation immediately after the
Effective Time, unless and until amended in accordance with applicable Law.

 



 



 

 



   



 

2.2 _Directors and Officers._ The directors of the Surviving Corporation
immediately following the Effective Time shall consist of the directors of NCC
immediately prior to the Effective Time, and such directors shall hold office
until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, or their
earlier death, resignation or removal; _provided_ , _however_ , that NCC shall
take any and all steps required under its Certificate of Incorporation and
Bylaws to increase the size of the NCC Board as of the Effective Time and to
appoint the FFHI Designee, effective as of the Effective Time, to fill such
vacancy. Thereafter, NCC agrees to include the FFHI Designee in its
recommended slate of nominees for election as a director at each of its first
and second annual meetings of stockholders of NCC following the Effective
Time. Nothing in this Section 2.2 shall require NCC to elect, appoint,
nominate or recommend the FFHI Designee for election to the NCC Board if he or
she shall become the subject of a Disqualification; provided, however, that if
the FFHI Designee becomes the subject of a Disqualification prior to the
Effective Time, NCC shall select a substitute FFHI Designee. The officers of
the Surviving Corporation immediately following the Effective Time shall
consist of the officers of NCC immediately prior to the Effective Time, and
such officers shall hold office until their respective successors are duly
elected and qualified, or their earlier death, resignation or removal. __

 



 

2.3 _Effect of Merger._ At the Effective Time, the Merger shall have the
effect set forth in Sections 259 and 261 of the DGCL and the comparable
provisions of the FBCA. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, all
rights, franchises and interests of FFHI and NCC in and to every type of
property (real, personal and mixed) and choses in action shall be transferred
to and vested in the Surviving Corporation by virtue of the Merger without any
deed or other transfer. The Surviving Corporation shall hold and enjoy all
rights of property, franchises and interests, including appointments,
designations and nominations, and all other rights and interests as trustee,
executor, administrator, registrar of stocks and bonds, guardian of estates,
assignee and receiver, and in every other fiduciary capacity, in the same
manner and to the same extent as such rights, franchises, and interests were
held or enjoyed by FFHI and NCC at the Effective Time. All Liabilities and
obligations of FFHI and NCC shall be deemed to have been assumed by the
Surviving Corporation, and the Surviving Corporation shall be bound thereby in
the same manner and to the same extent as each of FFHI and NCC was so bound at
the Effective Time.

 



 

Article 3 _ 
Conversion of constituents ' CAPITAL STOCK AND OTHER EQUITY_

 



 

3.1 _Manner of Converting Equity Securities._ Subject to the provisions
of this Article 3, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without
any further action on the part of NCC, FFHI or the holders of any shares of
capital stock thereof, the shares of capital stock and the rights, options and
warrants to acquire shares of capital stock of the constituent corporations
shall be converted as follows:

 



 

(a) _NCC Capital Stock_. Each share of capital stock of NCC issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall continue to be an
issued and outstanding share of the capital stock of the Surviving Corporation
from and after the Effective Time.

 



 



 

 



   



 

(b) _FFHI Common Stock Held by Parties_. Each share of FFHI Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that is held as
treasury stock or that is owned, directly or indirectly, by any FFHI Company
or any NCC Company (other than shares of FFHI Common Stock held in trust
accounts (including grantor or rabbi trust accounts), managed accounts and the
like, or otherwise held in a fiduciary or agency capacity, that are
beneficially owned by third parties and other than shares of FFHI Common Stock
held, directly or indirectly, in respect of a debt previously contracted)
shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist at the Effective Time without any
conversion thereof, and no shares of NCC Common Stock, cash or other
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

 



 

(c) _Exchange Ratio for FFHI Common Stock_. Subject to Sections 3.2 and
3.4 below, each share of FFHI Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (excluding (i) shares cancelled pursuant to
Section 3.1(b) above, (ii) Cash Election Shares described in Section 3.1(d)(i)
below, and (iii) shares held by stockholders who perfect their dissenters'
rights of appraisal as provided in Section 3.3 below) shall cease to be
outstanding and shall be converted into and exchanged for the right to receive
0.44 shares of NCC Common Stock (the "Exchange Ratio").

 



 

(d) _Stock and Cash Election._

 



 

(i) Holders of FFHI Common Stock shall be provided an opportunity to elect
to receive cash consideration in lieu of receiving NCC Common Stock in the
Merger, in accordance with the election procedures set forth below. Subject to
Section 3.1(d)(v), a holder of FFHI Common Stock who properly elects to
receive cash with respect to one or more shares of FFHI Common Stock (each, a
"Cash Election Share") shall receive $17.25, without interest, for each such
Cash Election Share (the "Per Share Cash Consideration"); provided, however,
that the aggregate number of shares of FFHI Common Stock that will be
converted into and exchanged for the right to receive the Per Share Cash
Consideration shall be equal to, as nearly as practicable, but shall not
exceed 646,293 (the "Cash Conversion Share Limitation"), and the aggregate
cash consideration to be paid in respect of such Cash Election Shares
(excluding, for purposes of clarity, amounts paid or payable to holders of
Dissenting Shares) shall be equal to, as nearly as practicable, but shall not
exceed $11,148,555 (the "Total Cash Amount"). Subject to the foregoing
limitation and the proration procedures set forth in Section 3.1(d)(v), at the
Effective Time, each Cash Election Share shall cease to be outstanding and, in
lieu of converting into and being exchanged into the right to receive shares
of NCC Common Stock, shall be converted into and exchanged for the right to
receive the Per Share Cash Consideration.

 



 

(ii) The Exchange Agent shall mail an election form in such form as NCC
and FFHI shall mutually agree (the "Election Form") with or following the
issuance of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, to each holder of record of FFHI
Common Stock. Each Election Form shall permit a holder (or the beneficial
owner through appropriate and customary documentation and instructions) of
FFHI Common Stock to elect to receive cash with respect to all or a portion of
such holder's FFHI Common Stock, subject to the Cash Conversion Share
Limitation in Section 3.1(d)(i) above and the proration procedures set forth
in Section 3.1(d)(v).

 



 



 

 



   



 

(iii) Any shares of FFHI Common Stock (A) with respect to which the
holder shall not have submitted to the Exchange Agent an effective, properly
completed Election Form prior to 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on the day before the
FFHI Stockholders' Meeting (or such other time and date as NCC and FFHI may
mutually agree) (the "Election Deadline"), (B) with respect to which the
holder shall have submitted an Election Form prior to the Election Deadline
but with respect to which such holder shall have elected not to receive cash,
or (C) that are issued after the Election Deadline but prior to the Effective
Time to the holder of a FFHI Option or FFHI Warrant pursuant to the valid
exercise thereof during such period (all such shares described in this
subsection (iii) being referred to as "Stock Election Shares") shall, subject
to the proration procedure in subsection (v) below, be converted into NCC
Common Stock at the Effective Time as set forth in, and subject to, Section
3.1(c) above.

 



 

(iv) Any Election Form may be revoked or amended by the Person submitting
such Election Form at or prior to the Election Deadline. In the event that an
Election Form is revoked and a replacement Election Form therefor is not
submitted prior to the Election Deadline, the shares of FFHI Common Stock
represented by such Election Form shall become Stock Election Shares. Subject
to the terms of this Agreement and of the Election Form, the Exchange Agent
shall have reasonable discretion to determine whether any election, revocation
or change has been properly or timely made and to disregard immaterial defects
in the Election Forms, and any good faith decision of the Exchange Agent
regarding such matters shall be binding and conclusive. Neither NCC nor the
Exchange Agent shall be under any obligation to notify any person of any
defect in an Election Form.

 



 

(v) Within five (5) Business Days after the Election Deadline, unless the
Effective Time has not yet occurred, in which case as soon thereafter as
practicable, the allocation among the holders of FFHI Common Stock in
accordance with the Election Forms shall be effected by the Exchange Agent as
follows:

 



 

(A) _Cash Elections More Than the Total Cash Amount_. If the aggregate
amount of cash that would be paid upon conversion in the Merger of the Cash
Election Shares (the "Potential Cash Payment") is greater than the Total Cash
Amount, then, at NCC's sole option and election by written notice to FFHI, NCC
may increase the Cash Conversion Share Limitation up to the actual number of
Cash Election Shares (subject to an adjusted maximum Cash Conversion Share
Limitation of 861,293 shares) and the Total Cash Amount up to the amount of
the actual Potential Cash Payment (subject to an adjusted maximum of
$14,857,305). If NCC elects to increase the Cash Conversion Share Limitation
and Total Cash Amount so as to equal the number of Cash Election Shares and
Potential Cash Payment, respectively, then the provisions of Section
3.1(d)(v)(C) shall apply. If NCC either (x) does not elect to increase the
Cash Conversion Share Limitation and Total Cash Amount or (y) elects to
increase the Cash Conversion Share Limitation and Total Cash Amount but after
such increase the actual number of Cash Election Shares and Potential Cash
Payment still exceed the Cash Conversion Share Limitation and Total Cash
Amount, respectively, then:

 



 

(1) the number of Cash Election Shares designated by each holder of FFHI
Common Stock who properly submitted an Election Form shall be automatically
reduced to that number of shares equal to the product of (i) the number of
such holder's Cash Election Shares designated in the Election Form and (ii) a
fraction, the numerator of which is the Cash Conversion Share Limitation (as
increased in accordance with Section 3.1(d)(v)(A) above, as applicable), and
the denominator of which is the aggregate number of Cash Election Shares
designated in all Election Forms;

 



 



 

 



   



 

(2) each Cash Election Share remaining after adjustment pursuant to
subsection (1) above shall be converted into the right to receive the Per
Share Cash Consideration pursuant to Section 3.1(d)(i);

 



 

(3) each share of FFHI Common Stock that would have been a Cash Election
Share but for the adjustment pursuant to subsection (1) above shall
automatically be deemed to be a Stock Election Share; and

 



 

(4) each Stock Election Share, including those so designated pursuant to
subsection (3) above, shall be converted into the right to receive NCC Common
Stock pursuant to Section 3.1(c).

 



 

(B) _Cash Elections Less Than the Total Cash Amount_. If the Potential
Cash Payment is less than the Total Cash Amount, then:

 



 

(1) the Exchange Agent shall select first from among the Stock Election
Shares that obtained such status because the holders thereof did not submit an
effective, properly completed Election Form by the Election Deadline, by a pro
rata selection process, and then (if necessary) from among the remaining Stock
Election Shares, by a pro rata selection process, a sufficient number of Stock
Election Shares to instead receive the Per Share Cash Consideration such that
the aggregate cash amount that will be paid in the Merger equals as closely as
practicable but does not exceed the Total Cash Amount, and each share of FFHI
Common Stock that would have been a Stock Election Share but for the
adjustment pursuant to this subsection (1) shall automatically be deemed to be
a Cash Election Share. The pro rata selection process to be used by the
Exchange Agent shall consist of such equitable proration processes as shall be
mutually determined by NCC and FFHI before the Effective Time;

 



 

(2) each Cash Election Share, including those so designated pursuant to
subsection (1) above, shall be converted into the right to receive the Per
Share Cash Consideration pursuant to Section 3.1(d)(i); and

 



 

(3) each Stock Election Share remaining after the adjustment process
pursuant to subsection (1) above shall be converted into the right to receive
NCC Common Stock pursuant to Section 3.1(c).

 



 

(C) _Cash Elections Equal to the Total Cash Amount_. If the Potential
Cash Payment is equal or nearly equal (as determined by the Exchange Agent) to
(but in no event in excess of) the Total Cash Amount, then subsections (A) and
(B) above shall not apply and:

 



 

(1) each Cash Election Share shall be converted into the right to receive
the Per Share Cash Consideration pursuant to Section 3.1(d)(i); and

 



 

(2) each Stock Election Share shall be converted into the right to receive
NCC Common Stock pursuant to Section 3.1(c).

 



 



 

 



   



 

(e) _FFHI Options_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of the holders thereof, each outstanding and
unexercised option to purchase shares of FFHI Common Stock pursuant to the
FFHI Stock Incentive Plan (each, a "FFHI Option"), whether vested or unvested,
that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall
automatically be cancelled and converted into an obligation of NCC to pay (or
cause to be paid) and a right of the holder to receive, in full satisfaction
of any rights in respect of the FFHI Option, a cash payment, without interest,
equal to the product of (i) the total number of shares of FFHI Common Stock
subject to such FFHI Option, multiplied by (ii) the excess, if any, of the Per
Share Cash Consideration over the exercise price per share of FFHI Common
Stock subject to such FFHI Option (with the aggregate amount of such payment
to the holder to be rounded to the nearest cent), less the amount of any
required withholding Tax. Any FFHI Option that has an exercise price per share
that is equal to or greater than the Per Share Cash Consideration shall not be
entitled to any payment with respect to such cancelled FFHI Option, and such
FFHI Options shall be excluded from the calculations above. The Surviving
Corporation shall pay (or cause to be paid) to the holders of FFHI Options the
cash payments described in this Section 3.1(e) on or as soon as reasonably
practicable after the Effective Time, but in any event within ten (10)
Business Days following the Effective Time. For the sake of clarity, neither
NCC nor NBC shall assume any FFHI Option or the FFHI Stock Incentive Plan. Any
amounts payable pursuant to this Section 3.1(e) for purposes of unexercised
FFHI Options shall not be considered part of, or in any way adjust, the Total
Cash Amount. Concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement,
certain holders of FFHI Options have executed and delivered an Option
Termination Agreement with FFHI (each, an "Option Termination Agreement")
pursuant to which each such holder has agreed to the treatment of the FFHI
Options provided for in this Section 3.1(e).

 



 

(f) _FFHI Warrants_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of the holders thereof, each FFHI Warrant,
whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time, shall cease to represent a right to purchase shares of FFHI
Common Stock and shall be converted into a right to purchase shares of NCC
Common Stock, and NCC will assume such FFHI Warrant subject to its terms,
including any acceleration in vesting that will occur as a consequence of the
Merger according to any instrument or agreement governing such FFHI Warrant;
provided, however, that after the Effective Time: (i) the number of shares of
NCC Common Stock purchasable upon exercise of each FFHI Warrant will equal the
product of (A) the number of shares of FFHI Common Stock that were purchasable
under the FFHI Warrant immediately before the Effective Time and (B) the
Exchange Ratio, rounded to the nearest whole share; (ii) the per share
exercise price for each FFHI Warrant will equal the quotient obtained by
dividing (A) the per share exercise price of the FFHI Warrant in effect
immediately before the Effective Time by (B) the Exchange Ratio, rounded to
the nearest cent; and (iii) where the context so requires, all references to
FFHI shall be deemed to be references to NCC and its Subsidiaries, as
applicable, and all references to the FFHI Board (or the Compensation
Committee thereof) shall be deemed to be references to the NCC Board (or the
Compensation Committee thereof).

 



 

(g) _FFHI Restricted Stock._ At the Effective Time, each share of FFHI
Restricted Stock that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall become fully vested and treated as any other share of outstanding FFHI
Common Stock for purposes of this Agreement, and, for purposes of the election
procedures set forth in Section 3.1(d), shall be deemed outstanding and of
record at the time such election materials are provided to holders of record
of FFHI Common Stock and shall, without duplication, receive the form of
consideration with respect thereto determined in accordance with Section
3.1(d), less applicable withholding Taxes.

 



 



 

 



   



 

(h) _FFHI Actions to Effectuate Exchange._ Prior to the Effective Time,
(i) the compensation committee of the FFHI Board shall adopt such resolutions
or take such other actions as may be reasonably required to effect the
transactions described in Sections 3.1(e), (f) and (g), (ii) FFHI shall notify
each holder of FFHI Warrants and/or FFHI Restricted Stock (which form notices
shall be provided to NCC for review and comment in advance of distribution to
holders of FFHI Warrants and/or FFHI Restricted Stock) stating that such
holder's FFHI Warrants and/or FFHI Restricted Stock shall be treated in the
manner set forth in Sections 3.1(f) and (g) hereof, respectively, (iii) FFHI
shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain from each holder of FFHI
Warrants and/or FFHI Restricted Stock a written acknowledgement of the receipt
of such notice, and (iv) prior to the Closing Date, FFHI shall use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain an Option Termination Agreement from each
holder of FFHI Options that are outstanding as of the Closing Date who did not
enter into such an agreement concurrently with the execution and delivery of
this Agreement.

 



 

(i) _Maximum Number of Shares of NCC Common Stock Issuable_. Subject to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement, assuming that (i) there are no
FFHI Dissenting Shares, (ii) there is no adjustment to the Exchange Ratio
pursuant to Section 3.2 below, (iii) the number of Cash Election Shares equals
the Cash Conversion Share Limitation (without any increase therein) such that
holders of FFHI Common Stock receive an aggregate of $11,148,555 in Per Share
Cash Consideration in the Merger, (iv) all of the FFHI Options are vested and
the holders exercise all of the FFHI Options prior to the Effective Time (and
do so by paying the exercise price in cash), (v) the holders of FFHI Warrants
exercise all of the FFHI Warrants prior to the Effective Time (and do so by
paying the exercise price in cash), and (vi) all of the FFHI Restricted Stock
is fully vested and treated as any other share of outstanding FFHI Common
Stock, then the holders of FFHI Common Stock (including the holders of FFHI
Restricted Stock), FFHI Options, and FFHI Warrants would have the right to
receive, in the aggregate, a maximum of 2,559,323 shares of NCC Common Stock
as a result of the Merger.

 



 

3.2 _Anti-Dilution Provisions._ If NCC changes the number of shares of
NCC Common Stock issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a
result of a stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend or similar
recapitalization with respect to such stock and the record date therefor is
prior to the Effective Time, then the Exchange Ratio shall be proportionately
adjusted as needed to preserve the relative economic benefit to the Parties
provided for in Section 3.1(c).

 



 



 

 



   



 

3.3 _FFHI Dissenting Stockholders._ Notwithstanding the provisions of
Section 3.1 or anything in this Agreement to the contrary, shares of FFHI
Common Stock that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and that are held by a holder who properly dissents from the
Merger ("Dissenting Shares") when and in the manner required by Sections
607.1302 _et seq._ of the FBCA (the "Dissenter Provisions") shall not be
treated as Stock Election Shares or Cash Election Shares and shall not be
converted into the right to receive either shares of NCC Common Stock or the
Per Share Cash Consideration, but instead the holder of such Dissenting Shares
shall be entitled to payment of the fair value thereof in accordance with the
Dissenter Provisions, with such amount not being considered part of or in any
way adjusting the Total Cash Amount. At the Effective Time, such Dissenting
Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and
retired and shall cease to exist or be outstanding, and the holder thereof
shall cease to have any right with respect thereto, except the right to
receive the fair value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the
Dissenter Provisions; _provided, however_ , that no payment shall be made with
respect to any Dissenting Shares unless and until the holder thereof shall
have complied with the applicable provisions of the Dissenter Provisions and
surrendered to the Surviving Corporation the certificate or certificates
representing the Dissenting Shares for which payment is to be made. If any
holder of shares of FFHI Common Stock shall have failed to perfect such
holder's right to receive, or shall have effectively waived, withdrawn, lost
or forfeited any right to demand or receive, the fair value of such FFHI
Common Stock under the Dissenter Provisions, then such holder's shares of FFHI
Common Stock shall thereupon be deemed and treated as if they had, at the
Effective Time, been Stock Election Shares and converted into the right to
receive shares of NCC Common Stock in accordance with Section 3.1(c), subject
to the proration adjustment process in Section 3.1(d)(v). FFHI shall give NCC
(i) prompt notice of any written notices of any holder's intent to demand
payment or exercise appraisal rights in respect of any shares of FFHI Common
Stock, withdrawals or attempted withdrawals of such notices and any other
notices or instruments served pursuant to the Dissenter Provisions and
received by FFHI relating to any attempted, purported or actual exercise of
appraisal rights and (ii) the opportunity to participate in, direct and
control all discussions, negotiations and proceedings with respect to the
exercise of such appraisal rights under the Dissenter Provisions. Each holder
of Dissenting Shares who becomes entitled, pursuant to the Dissenter
Provisions, to payment for any Dissenting Shares shall receive payment
therefor from the Surviving Corporation (but only after the amount thereof
shall have been agreed upon or at the times and in the amounts required by the
Dissenter Provisions). FFHI shall not, except with the prior written consent
of NCC, voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to
settle, any demand for payment by a holder of Dissenting Shares. Nothing
contained in this Section 3.3 shall in any way limit the right of NCC to
terminate this Agreement and abandon the Merger under Section 10.1(i).

 



 

3.4 _Fractional Shares._ Fractional shares of NCC Common Stock shall not
be issued upon the surrender of certificates representing FFHI Common Stock
for exchange; no dividend or distribution with respect to NCC Common Stock
shall be payable on or with respect to any fractional share; and such
fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to
any other rights of a stockholder of NCC. In lieu of any such fractional
share, NCC shall pay to each former FFHI stockholder who otherwise would be
entitled to receive a fractional share of NCC Common Stock an amount in cash
(without interest) equal to the product of (i) the Average Quoted Price
multiplied by (ii) the fraction of a share of NCC Common Stock to which such
stockholder would otherwise be entitled.

 



 



 

 



   



 

Article 4 _ 
exchange of EQUITY SECURITIES_

 



 

4.1 _Exchange Procedures._ Promptly (and within five (5) Business Days)
after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Exchange
Agent to mail to the former holders of FFHI Common Stock appropriate
transmittal materials (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title to the certificates theretofore representing shares
of FFHI Common Stock shall pass, only upon proper delivery of such
certificates to the Exchange Agent). After completion of the allocation
procedure set forth in Section 3.1(d)(v) and upon surrender of one or more
certificates theretofore representing shares of FFHI Common Stock (each, an
"FFHI Certificate") for exchange and cancellation to the Exchange Agent (such
shares to be free and clear of all liens, claims and encumbrances), together
with a properly executed letter of transmittal, the holder of such FFHI
Certificate shall be entitled to receive promptly thereafter in exchange
therefor: (a) that number of whole shares of NCC Common Stock that such holder
of FFHI Common Stock became entitled to receive pursuant to Article 3 hereof
and (b) a check representing the aggregate cash consideration, if any, which
such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of Article 3
hereof (rounded to the nearest cent), and the FFHI Certificate so surrendered
shall forthwith be cancelled. The shares of NCC Common Stock to be issued
pursuant to Article 3 and this Section 4.1 shall be in uncertificated book
entry form, and upon compliance by a former holder of FFHI Common Stock with
the provisions hereof and of the letter of transmittal, NCC shall instruct its
registrar and transfer agent to make appropriate book entries with respect to
such shares of NCC Common Stock. Such book entries of the issuance of
uncertificated shares shall constitute delivery thereof for all purposes
pursuant to this Agreement. No interest will be paid or accrued on the Per
Share Cash Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares, or any unpaid
dividends and distributions, if any, payable to former holders of FFHI Common
Stock. None of NCC, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent shall be

Common Stock is entitled as a result of the Merger until such holder

Agent may require. __

 



 

4.2 _Rights of Former FFHI Stockholders._ At the Effective Time, the
stock transfer books of FFHI shall be closed as to holders of FFHI Common
Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time, and no transfer of FFHI Common
Stock by any such holder shall thereafter be made or recognized. Until
surrendered for exchange in accordance with the provisions of Section 4.1 of
this Agreement, each FFHI Certificate, other than shares to be cancelled
pursuant to Section 3.1(b) of this Agreement or as to which dissenter's rights
of appraisal have been perfected as provided in Section 3.3 of this Agreement,
shall from and after the Effective Time represent for all purposes only the
right to receive the consideration provided in Section 3.1 of this Agreement
in exchange therefor. To the extent permitted by Law, former stockholders of
record of FFHI Common Stock shall be entitled to vote after the Effective Time
at any meeting of NCC stockholders (with a record date after the Effective
Time) the number of whole shares of NCC Common Stock into which their
respective shares of FFHI Common Stock (excluding Cash Election Shares) have
been converted, regardless of whether such holders have exchanged their FFHI
Certificates for shares of NCC Common Stock in accordance with the provisions
of this Agreement. Whenever a dividend or other distribution is declared by
NCC on the NCC Common Stock, the record date for which is at or after the
Effective Time, the declaration shall include dividends or other distributions
on all shares issuable pursuant to this Agreement. Notwithstanding the
preceding sentence, any Person holding any FFHI Certificate at or after six
(6) months after the Effective Time (the "Cutoff") shall not be entitled to
receive any dividend or other distribution payable after the Cutoff to holders
of NCC Common Stock, which dividend or other distribution is attributable to
such Person's NCC Common Stock represented by said FFHI Certificate held after
the Cutoff, until such Person surrenders such FFHI Certificate for exchange as
provided in Section 4.1 of this Agreement. However, upon surrender of such
FFHI Certificate, appropriate book entries shall be made with respect to the
NCC Common Stock, and all such undelivered dividends or other distributions
(without interest) and any undelivered cash payments (without interest) shall
be delivered and paid with respect to each share represented by such FFHI
Certificate. No holder of shares of FFHI Common Stock shall be entitled to
voting rights or to receive any dividends or distributions declared or made
with respect to the NCC Common Stock with a record date before the Effective
Time.

 



 



 

 



   



 

4.3 _Identity of Recipient of NCC Common Stock._ In the event that the
delivery of the consideration provided for in this Agreement is to be made to
a Person other than the Person in whose name any FFHI Certificate surrendered
is registered, such FFHI Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed
(or accompanied by an appropriate instrument of transfer), with the
signature(s) appropriately guaranteed, and otherwise in proper form for
transfer, and the Person requesting such delivery shall pay any transfer or
other taxes required by reason of the delivery to a Person other than the
registered holder of such FFHI Certificate surrendered or establish to the
satisfaction of NCC that such tax has been paid or is not applicable.

 



 

4.4 _Lost or Stolen Certificates._ If any holder of FFHI Common Stock
convertible into the right to receive shares of NCC Common Stock or cash is
unable to deliver such holder's FFHI Certificate, NCC shall instruct its
registrar and transfer agent, in the absence of actual notice that any such
shares have been acquired by a bona fide purchaser, to make appropriate book
entries with respect to such holder for the shares of NCC Common Stock to
which the holder is entitled for such shares upon presentation of the
following: (a) evidence to the reasonable satisfaction of NCC that any such
FFHI Certificate has been lost, wrongfully taken or destroyed; (b) such
security or indemnity as may be reasonably requested by NCC to indemnify and
hold NCC and the Exchange Agent harmless; and (c) evidence satisfactory to NCC
that such Person is the owner of the shares theretofore represented by each
FFHI Certificate claimed by the holder to be lost, wrongfully taken or
destroyed and that the holder is the Person who would be entitled to present
such FFHI Certificate for exchange pursuant to this Agreement.

 



 

4.5 _Laws of Escheat._ If any of the consideration due or other payments
to be paid or delivered to the holders of FFHI Common Stock is not paid or
delivered within the time period specified by any applicable Laws concerning
abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws, and if such failure to pay or
deliver such consideration occurs or arises out of the fact that such property
is not claimed by the proper owner thereof, NCC or the Exchange Agent shall be
entitled (but not required) to dispose of any such consideration or other
payments in accordance with applicable Laws concerning abandoned property,
escheat or similar Laws. Any other provision of this Agreement
notwithstanding, none of NCC, FFHI, the Exchange Agent or any other Person
acting on their behalf shall be liable to a holder of FFHI Common Stock for
any amount paid or property delivered in good faith to a public official
pursuant to and in accordance with any applicable abandoned property, escheat
or similar Law.

 



 



 

 



   



 

4.6 _Withholding Rights_. Notwithstanding any provision contained herein
to the contrary, each of the Exchange Agent, FFHI, FirstAtlantic Bank, NCC,
NBC and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from the consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this
Agreement such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect
to (i) the making of such payment under any provision of Tax law and (ii) the
disposition of any FFHI Stock Option, FFHI Restricted Stock or FFHI Warrant
under this Agreement. If the Exchange Agent, FFHI, FirstAtlantic Bank, NCC,
NBC or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, so withholds and timely
remits such amounts to the appropriate Governmental Authority, such amounts
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
Person entitled to such payment under this Agreement or holder of the shares
of FFHI Stock, FFHI Stock Options, FFHI Restricted Stock or FFHI Warrant, as
the case may be, in respect of which the Exchange Agent, FFHI, FirstAtlantic
Bank, NCC, NBC or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, made such
deduction and withholding.

provide for losses relating to the other real estate owned portfolio of FFHI
as of the dates thereof. The reserve for losses in respect of Litigation (the
"FFHI Litigation Reserve") shown on the most recent FFHI Financial Statements
and FFHI Call Reports was, and the FFHI Litigation Reserve shown on the FFHI
Financial Statements and FFHI Call Reports as of any date subsequent to the
execution of this Agreement will be, as of such dates, adequate (within the
meaning of GAAP and applicable regulatory requirements or guidelines) to
provide for losses relating to or arising out of all pending or threatened
Litigation applicable to FFHI and the FFHI Subsidiaries as of the dates
thereof. Each such reserve described above has been established in accordance
with applicable accounting principles and regulatory requirements and
guidelines.

 



 

(b) The documentation relating to each Loan made by any FFHI Company and
to all security interests, mortgages and other liens with respect to all
collateral for Loans is adequate for the enforcement of the material terms of
such Loan, security interest, mortgage or other lien, except for inadequacies
in such documentation which will not, individually or in the aggregate, have a
Material Adverse Effect on FFHI. Except as set forth on _Schedule 5.9(b)_ , no
agreement pursuant to which any Loans or other assets have been or shall be
sold by any FFHI Company entitles the buyer of such Loans or other assets to
cause the FFHI Company to repurchase such Loan or other asset or the buyer to
pursue any other form of recourse against the FFHI Company, except in the
event of a breach by the FFHI Company of representations or warranties
therein. No FFHI Company has Knowledge of a breach of a representation or
warranty by any of the FFHI Companies in any such agreement or of the
occurrence of any other facts or circumstances that would entitle the buyer of
any Loan or other asset to cause any FFHI Company to repurchase such Loan or
other asset or the buyer to pursue any other form of recourse against any FFHI
Company.

 



 



 

 



   



 

(c) All Loans made by any FFHI Company have been made in compliance in
all material respects with all applicable Laws at the time of such Loan or any
renewal thereof, including, without limitation, Regulation Z, the Federal
Consumer Credit Protection Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair
Housing Act, the Community Reinvestment Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act,
and all Laws governing the operation of federal savings associations. Each
FFHI Company has systems, policies and procedures in place such that any
material violation of any of the foregoing would reasonably be expected to
have been detected by such FFHI Company. Each Loan on the books of any FFHI
Company was made in the ordinary course of its business.

 



 

(d) Without limiting the foregoing or anything else in this Agreement:

 



 

(i) Each FFHI Company has complied with, and all documentation in
connection with the origination, processing, underwriting and credit approval
of any mortgage or other Loan originated, purchased or serviced by any FFHI
Company has satisfied in all material respects: (A) all applicable Laws with
respect to the origination, insuring, purchase, sale, pooling, servicing,
subservicing, or filing of claims in connection with mortgage and other Loans,
including all Laws relating to real estate settlement procedures, consumer
credit protection, truth in lending, usury limitations, fair housing,
transfers of servicing, collection practices, equal credit opportunity and
adjustable rate mortgages; (B) the responsibilities and obligations set forth
in any agreement between any FFHI Company and any Agency, Loan Investor or
Insurer; (C) the applicable rules, regulations, guidelines, handbooks and
other requirements of any Agency, Loan Investor or Insurer; and (D) the terms
and provisions of any mortgage or other collateral documents and other Loan
documents with respect to each such Loan. Each FFHI Company has systems,
policies and procedures in place such that any material violation of any of
the foregoing would reasonably be expected to have been detected by such FFHI
Company; and

 



 

(ii) No Agency, Loan Investor or Insurer has (A) claimed in writing that
any FFHI Company has violated or has not complied with the applicable
underwriting standards with respect to Loans sold by any FFHI Company to a
Loan Investor or Agency, or with respect to any sale of servicing rights to a
Loan Investor, (B) imposed in writing restrictions on the activities
(including commitment authority) of any FFHI Company or (C) indicated in
writing to any FFHI Company that it has terminated or intends to terminate its
relationship with such FFHI Company for poor performance, poor loan quality or
concern with respect to such FFHI Company's compliance with Laws.

 



 



 

 



   



 

5.10 _Assets; Real Property; Insurance._ Except as set forth on _Schedule
5.10_ , the FFHI Companies have marketable title to, valid leasehold interests
in, or valid licenses to use, in each case free and clear of all Liens, all of
their respective Assets. All tangible real and personal properties and Assets
used in the businesses of the FFHI Companies are in good condition, reasonable
wear and tear excepted, and are usable in the ordinary course of business
consistent with FFHI's past practices. All Assets that are material to FFHI's
business on a consolidated basis, held under leases or subleases by any of the
FFHI Companies, are held under valid Contracts enforceable in accordance with
their respective terms (except as enforceability may be limited by applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other Laws affecting the
enforcement of creditors' rights generally and except that the availability of
the equitable remedy of specific performance or injunctive relief is subject
to the discretion of the court before which any proceedings may be brought),
and each such Contract is in full force and effect and there is not under any
such Contract any Default or claim of Default by FFHI or, to the Knowledge of
each FFHI Company, by any other party to the Contract. _Schedule 5.10(a)_
identifies each parcel of real estate or interest therein owned by any of the
FFHI Companies or in which any FFHI Company has any ownership interest.
_Schedule 5.10(b)_ identifies each parcel of real estate or interest therein
leased or subleased by any of the FFHI Companies or in which any FFHI Company
has any leasehold interest. If applicable, _Schedule 5.10(b)_ also lists or
otherwise describes each and every written or oral lease or sublease under
which any FFHI Company is the lessee of any real property. One of the FFHI
Companies has good and marketable fee simple title to the real property
described in _Schedule 5.10(a)_ and has an enforceable leasehold interest in
the real property described in _Schedule 5.10(b)_ , free and clear of all
Liens. None of the FFHI Companies has violated, or is currently in violation
of, any Law, regulation or ordinance relating to the ownership or use of the
real estate and real estate interests described or required to be described in
_Schedules 5.10(a)_ and _5.10(b)_ , including, without limitation, any Law
relating to zoning, building, occupancy, environmental or comparable matters,
which individually or in the aggregate would have a Material Adverse Effect on
FFHI. As to each parcel of real property owned or used by any FFHI Company, no
FFHI Company has received notice of any pending or, to the Knowledge of each
of the FFHI Companies, threatened condemnation proceedings, Litigation
proceedings or mechanic's or materialmen's liens. The Assets of the FFHI
Companies include all assets required to operate the business of the FFHI
Companies as now conducted. The policies of fire, theft, liability, DandO and
other insurance maintained with respect to the Assets or businesses of the
FFHI Companies provide adequate coverage under current industry practices
against loss or Liability, and the fidelity and blanket bonds in effect as to
which any of the FFHI Companies is a named insured are reasonably sufficient.
_Schedule 5.10(c)_ contains a list of all such policies and bonds maintained
by any of the FFHI Companies, and FFHI has provided true and correct copies of
each such policy to NCC. Except as set forth on _Schedule 5.10(c)_ , no claims
have been made under such policies or bonds.

a defendant or potentially responsible party (i) for alleged noncompliance
(including by any predecessor) with any Environmental Law or (ii) relating to
the release into the environment of any Hazardous Material or oil, whether or

Adverse Effect on FFHI.

 



 

5.12 _Compliance with Laws._ FFHI is duly registered as a savings and
loan holding company and FirstAtlantic Bank is a "qualified thrift lender"
under the HOLA. Each FFHI Company has in effect all Permits necessary for it

likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on
FFHI, and there has occurred no Default under any such Permit. Except as set

Orders and Permits applicable to its business or employees, agents or
representatives conducting its business; and

 



 

(b) has received no notification or communication from any agency or

Without limiting the foregoing, each FFHI Company is and has been in
compliance in all material respects with the United States Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act; the International Money Laundering Abatement and Anti-Terrorist
Financing Act, otherwise known as Title III of the USA Patriot Act; the
Currency and Foreign Transactions Reporting Act of 1970, as amended, otherwise
known as the Bank Secrecy Act, and all regulations issued thereunder; and each
FFHI Company has properly certified all foreign deposit accounts and has made
all necessary tax withholdings on all of its deposit accounts. Each FFHI
Company has timely and properly filed and maintained all requisite Currency
Transaction Reports and other related forms, including any requisite custom
reports required by any agency of the United States Department of the
Treasury, including the Internal Revenue Service. No FFHI Company or, to the
Knowledge of any FFHI Company, any director, officer, agent, employee,
Affiliate or Person acting on behalf of any FFHI Company is currently subject
to any sanctions administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the
United States Department of the Treasury ("OFAC"). No FFHI Company or any of
its Affiliates does business with the government of, or any Person located in,
any country, or with any other Person, targeted by any of the economic
sanctions of OFAC or any other Regulatory Authority. No FFHI Company is
controlled (within the meaning of Laws administered by OFAC) by any such
government or Person. Each FFHI Company has timely filed all Suspicious
Activity Reports with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (of the United
States Department of the Treasury) required to be filed by it under applicable
Law. Each FFHI Company has systems, policies and procedures in place such that
any material violation of any of the foregoing would reasonably be expected to

organization as to wages or conditions of employment, nor is there any strike
or other labor dispute involving any FFHI Company pending or threatened, nor
to its Knowledge, is there any activity involving any FFHI Company's employees

5.14 _Employee Benefit Plans._

 



 

(a) _Schedule 5.14(a)_ lists, and FFHI has delivered or made available to
NCC prior to the execution of this Agreement, correct and complete copies of
all pension, retirement, profit-sharing, salary continuation and split dollar
agreements, deferred compensation, director deferred fee agreements, director
retirement agreements, stock option, warrant, restricted stock unit, equity-
based compensation, employee stock ownership, severance pay, vacation, bonus
or other incentive plans, all other written or unwritten employee programs,
arrangements or agreements, all medical, vision, dental or other health plans,
all life insurance plans, and all other employee benefit plans or fringe
benefit plans, including, without limitation, "employee benefit plans," as
defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA (whether or not subject to ERISA), adopted,
maintained by, sponsored in whole or in part by, or contributed to by any FFHI
Company, any Affiliate of a FFHI Company, or any ERISA Affiliate thereof
within the last six (6) years for the benefit of employees, retirees,
dependents, spouses, directors, independent contractors or other beneficiaries
(collectively, the "FFHI Benefit Plans"). FFHI also has delivered or made
available to NCC prior to the execution of this Agreement correct and complete
copies of (where applicable): (i) all summary plan descriptions, summaries of
material modifications, and amendments related to such FFHI Benefit Plans;
(ii) the most recent determination or opinion letters, as applicable, received
from the Internal Revenue Service; (iii) the three (3) most recent Form 5500
Annual Reports; (iv) the three (3) most recent audited financial statements
and actuarial valuations; (v) all material related agreements, trust
agreements, insurance contracts and other documents that implement each such

respect of any FFHI Benefit Plan received in the last six (6) years. Any FFHI
Benefit Plan that is an "employee pension benefit plan," as defined in Section
3(2) of ERISA, is referred to herein as a "FFHI ERISA Plan." No FFHI Benefit
Plan is or has been a "defined benefit plan" (as defined in Section 414(j) of
the Code) or a "multi-employer plan" (as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA), a
multiple employer plan (as defined in Section 3(40) of ERISA) or Section
413(c) of the Code, or a multiple employer welfare arrangement (as defined in
Section 3(40)(A) of ERISA), and no ERISA Affiliate of any FFHI Company
maintains, sponsors or contributes or has maintained, sponsored or contributed
to any such employee benefit plan within the last six (6) years.

 



 

(b) All FFHI Benefit Plans and the administration thereof are in, and have
been in, compliance with the applicable terms of ERISA, the Code and any other
applicable Laws, except for instances of non-compliance that would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on FFHI. Each FFHI ERISA Plan that is intended to be qualified
under Section 401(a) of the Code and each corresponding trust intended to be
exempt under Section 501(a) of the Code has received a favorable determination
letter or may rely upon an opinion letter issued to the sponsor of a prototype
or volume submitter arrangement, as applicable, from the Internal Revenue
Service, and FFHI is not aware of any circumstances that could result in
revocation of any such favorable determination letter/opinion letter. No
transaction has been entered into with respect to any FFHI Benefit Plan that,
assuming the taxable period of such transaction expired as of the date hereof,
would subject any FFHI Company to a tax or penalty imposed by either Section
4975 of the Code or Section 502(i) of ERISA in amounts that are reasonably
likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on
FFHI. There are no actions, suits, arbitrations or claims, including any
investigations or audits by the Internal Revenue Service or any other
Governmental Authority pending (other than routine claims for benefits) or, to
the Knowledge of FFHI, threatened against any FFHI Benefit Plan, any FFHI
Company or ERISA Affiliate with regard to any FFHI Benefit Plan or related
trust. To the Knowledge of each FFHI Company, there are no actions, suits,
arbitrations or claims, including any investigations or audits by the Internal
Revenue Service or any other Governmental Authority, pending (other than
routine claims for benefits) or threatened against any trustee, fiduciary,
custodian, administrator or other third party holding or controlling assets of
any FFHI Benefit Plan respecting such FFHI Benefit Plan.

 



 



 

 



   



 

(c) Except as set forth on _Schedule 5.14(c)_ , neither the execution and
delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions provided
for herein will (i) result in any payment (including, without limitation,
severance, unemployment compensation, golden parachute or otherwise) becoming
due to any director, officer or employee of any FFHI Company from any FFHI
Company or any NCC Company under any FFHI Benefit Plan, employment contract or
otherwise, (ii) increase any benefits otherwise payable under any FFHI Benefit
Plan, or (iii) result in any acceleration of the time of payment or vesting of
any such benefit.

 



 

(d) With respect to all FFHI Benefit Plans (whether or not subject to
ERISA and whether or not qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code), all
contributions due (including any contributions to any trust account or
payments due under any insurance policy) or previously declared or otherwise
required by Law or contract to have been made and any employer contributions
(including any contributions to any trust account or payments due under any
insurance policy) accrued but unpaid as of the date hereof will be paid by the
time required by Law or contract. All contributions required to be made under
any FFHI Benefit Plan have been made by the applicable due date and meet the
requirements for deductibility under the Code, and all contributions that are
required and that have not been made have been properly recorded on the books
of FFHI in accordance with GAAP.

 



 

(e) Each contract, arrangement, plan, or FFHI Benefit Plan that is a
"nonqualified deferred compensation plan" (as defined for purposes of Section
409A(d)(1) of the Code) has been maintained and is, in form and operation, in
compliance in all material respects with Section 409A of the Code and the
applicable guidance issued thereunder. No amounts under any such contract,
arrangement, plan, or such FFHI Benefit Plan required the payment of the
interest or additional tax set forth under Section 409A(a)(1)(B) of the Code.
Except as set forth on _Schedule 5.14(e)_ , no FFHI Company has any obligation
to gross-up or indemnify any Person with respect to any Taxes imposed under
Section 409A of the Code.

 



 

(f) (i) Each FFHI Benefit Plan that is a "group health plan" (within
the meaning of Section 5000(b)(1) of the Code) has been operated in compliance
in all material respects with all Laws applicable to such plan (including the
Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010), its terms, and with the
group health plan continuation coverage requirements of Section 4980B of the
Code and Sections 601 through 608 of ERISA ("COBRA Coverage"), Section 4980D
of the Code and Sections 701 through 707 of ERISA, Title XXII of the Public
Health Service Act and the provisions of the Social Security Act, to the
extent such requirements are applicable. Except as set forth on _Schedule
5.14(f)_ , no FFHI Benefit Plan or written or oral agreement exists that
obligates the FFHI Companies or any ERISA Affiliate to provide health care
coverage, medical, surgical, hospitalization, death or similar benefits
(whether or not insured) to any employee, former employee of any FFHI Company
or member of the FFHI Board or any ERISA Affiliate following such employee's,
former employee's or director's termination of employment, including, but not
limited to, retiree medical, health or life benefits, other than as required
under COBRA Coverage or other similar applicable Law.

 



 



 

 



   



 

(ii) Except as set forth on Schedule 5.14(f), no FFHI Benefit Plan,
excluding any short-term disability, non-qualified deferred compensation,
vacation, bonus, fringe benefit or health flexible spending account plan or
program, is self-insured or funded through the general assets of a FFHI
Company or an ERISA Affiliate. No FFHI Benefit Plan that is an employee
welfare benefit plan under Section 3(1) of ERISA is funded by a trust or is
subject to Section 419 or 419A of the Code.

 



 

5.15 _Material Contracts._ Except as set forth on _Schedule 5.15_ , none
of the FFHI Companies, nor any of their respective Assets, businesses or
operations, is a party to, or is bound or affected by, or receives benefits
under any of the following (whether written or oral, express or implied): (i)
any employment, severance, termination, consulting or retirement Contract with
any Person; (ii) any Contract relating to the borrowing of money by any FFHI
Company or the guarantee by any FFHI Company of any such obligation (other
than Contracts evidencing deposit Liabilities, purchases of federal funds,

relating to indemnification or defense of any director, officer or employee of
any of the FFHI Companies or any other Person; (iv) any Contract with any
labor union; (v) any Contract relating to the disposition or acquisition of
any interest in any business enterprise; (vi) any Contract relating to the
extension of credit to, provision of services for, sale, lease or license of
Assets to, engagement of services from, or purchase, lease or license of
Assets from, any 5% stockholder, director or officer of any of the FFHI
Companies, any member of the immediate family of the foregoing or, to the
Knowledge of any FFHI Company, any related interest (as defined in Regulation
O promulgated by the Federal Reserve) ("Related Interest") of any of the
foregoing; (vii) any Contract (A) which limits the freedom of any of the FFHI
Companies to compete in any line of business or with any Person or (B) which

any FFHI Company; (viii) any Contract providing a power of attorney or similar
authorization given by any of the FFHI Companies, except as issued in the
ordinary course of business with respect to routine matters; or (ix) any
Contract (other than deposit agreements and certificates of deposits issued to
customers entered into in the ordinary course of business and letters of
credit) that involves the payment by any of the FFHI Companies of amounts
aggregating $50,000 or more in any twelve-month period (together with all
Contracts referred to in Sections 5.10 and 5.14(a) of this Agreement, the
"FFHI Contracts"). FFHI has delivered or made available to NCC correct and
complete copies of all FFHI Contracts. Each of the FFHI Contracts is in full
force and effect, and none of the FFHI Companies is in Default under any FFHI
Contract. All of the Indebtedness of any FFHI Company for money borrowed is
prepayable at any time by such FFHI Company without penalty or premium.
_Schedule 5.15_ lists the deadlines for extensions or terminations of all FFHI
Contracts.

 



 

5.16 _Legal Proceedings._ Except as set forth on _Schedule 5.16_ , there
is no Litigation instituted or pending, or, to the Knowledge of any FFHI
Company, threatened (or unasserted but considered probable of assertion)
against any FFHI Company, or against any Asset, interest, or right of any of
them, other than any immaterial, ordinary routine Litigation incidental to the
business of FFHI and its Subsidiaries, nor are there any Orders of any
Regulatory Authorities, other Governmental Authorities or arbitrators
outstanding, pending or, to the Knowledge of any FFHI Company, threatened
against any FFHI Company. No FFHI Company has any Knowledge of any fact or
condition presently existing that might give rise to any Order, Litigation,
investigation or proceeding which, if determined adversely to any FFHI
Company, would have a Material Adverse Effect on such FFHI Company or would
materially restrict the right of any FFHI Company to carry on its businesses
as presently conducted.

required to file with (i) the Regulatory Authorities, and (ii) any applicable
state securities or banking authorities and all other material reports and
statements required to be filed by it, and has paid all fees and assessments

Authority has initiated any proceeding or, to the Knowledge of any FFHI
Company, investigation into the business or operations of any FFHI Company. To
the Knowledge of any FFHI Company, there is no unresolved violation, criticism
or exception by any Regulatory Authority with respect to any report or

involved, except as otherwise noted therein, (b) fairly present the financial
position of the FFHI Companies as of the respective dates thereof, and (c)
fairly present the results of operations of the FFHI Companies for the
respective periods therein set forth. No FFHI Company is a party to, or has

partnership or any similar contract or arrangement (including any contract or
arrangement relating to any transaction or relationship between or among FFHI
and any other FFHI Company, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated Affiliate,
including any structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or
Person, on the other hand, or any "off-balance sheet arrangement"), where the
result, purpose or intended effect of such contract or arrangement is to avoid
disclosure of any material transaction involving, or material liabilities of,
FFHI or any other FFHI Company in FFHI's or such other FFHI Company's
financial statements.

neither FFHI nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any of their respective officers
or directors has employed any broker or finder or incurred any Liability for
any broker's fees, commissions or finder's fees in connection with any of the
transactions provided for in this Agreement. Before the execution of this

matters set forth therein, the merger consideration (defined in such opinion

opinion has not been withdrawn, amended, waived, modified or rescinded.

subject to an agreement to repurchase, no FFHI Company has pledged collateral
in excess of the amount of the debt secured thereby. No FFHI Company has
pledged collateral in excess of the amount required under any interest rate
swap or other similar agreement currently outstanding. All interest rate

into in the ordinary course of business and in accordance with prudent banking
practice and applicable rules, regulations and policies of any regulatory
authority and with counterparties believed to be financially responsible at
the time and are legal, valid and binding obligations of such FFHI Company,
enforceable according to their terms. Each FFHI Company has duly performed in
all material respects all of its obligations under such arrangements to the
extent that such obligations to perform have accrued, and there are no
material breaches, violations or defaults or allegations or assertions of such
by any party thereunder. No FFHI Company is a party to any agreement
securitizing any of its assets.

provisions of an anti-takeover nature contained in their organizational
documents or the provisions of any federal or state "anti-takeover," "fair
price," "moratorium," "control share acquisition" or similar Laws or
regulations (collectively, "Takeover Laws"). Each FFHI Company has taken all
action so that the entering into of this Agreement and the consummation of the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement do not and
will not result in the grant of any rights to any Person under the articles of
incorporation, bylaws, or other governing instruments of any FFHI Company or
restrict or impair the ability of NCC or any of its Subsidiaries to vote, or
otherwise to exercise the rights of a stockholder with respect to, shares of
any FFHI Company that may be directly or indirectly acquired or controlled by
it.

 



 

5.29 _Transactions with Management._ Except for (a) deposits that are on
terms and conditions comparable in all material respects to those made
available to other nonaffiliated similarly situated customers of FFHI at the
time such deposits were entered into, (b) the loans listed on _Schedule
5.9(a)(ii)_ , (c) the agreements designated on _Schedule 5.15_ , (d)

directors, officers or employees (or their Related Interests) involving the
expenditure of more than $1,000 as to any one individual (including any
business directly or indirectly controlled by any such person) or more than
$5,000 for all such contracts for commitments in the aggregate for all such
individuals.

 



 

5.30 _Absence of Certain Business Practices._ No FFHI Company or, to the
Knowledge of any FFHI Company, any officer, employee or agent of any FFHI
Company, or any other Person acting on their behalf, has, directly or
indirectly, given or agreed to give any gift or similar benefit to any
customer, supplier, governmental employee or other Person who is or may be in
a position to help or hinder the business of any FFHI Company (or assist any
FFHI Company in connection with any actual or proposed transaction) that (a)
might subject FFHI to any damage or penalty in any civil, criminal or
governmental Litigation or proceeding, (b) if not given in the past, might
have resulted in a Material Adverse Effect on FFHI or (c) if not continued in
the future, might result in a Material Adverse Effect on FFHI or might subject
FFHI to suit or penalty in any private or governmental Litigation or
proceeding.

 



 

5.31 _Privacy of Customer Information._ The FFHI Companies collectively
are the sole owner of all individually identifiable personal information
relating to identifiable or identified natural Persons ("Identifiable Personal
Information") with respect to customers, former customers and prospective
customers. The FFHI Companies' collection, use, and transfer of such
Identifiable Personal Information complies in all material respects with
FFHI's privacy policy, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley
Act and all other applicable privacy and other applicable Laws, and any
agreement or industry standard relating to privacy.

 



 



 

 



   



 

5.32 _Deposits._ Except as set forth on _Schedule 5.32_ , as of the date
of this Agreement, none of the deposits of FFHI are "brokered" deposits or are
subject to any encumbrance, legal restraint or other legal process (other than
garnishments, pledges, setoff rights, limitations applicable to public
deposits, escrow limitations and similar actions taken in the ordinary course
of business), and no portion of deposits of FFHI represents a deposit of any
Affiliate of FFHI. The deposit accounts of FirstAtlantic Bank are insured by
the FDIC in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance
Act, and FirstAtlantic Bank has paid all regular premiums and special
assessments and filed all reports required thereunder.

 



 

5.33 _Accounting Controls._ Each of the FFHI Companies maintains accurate
books and records reflecting its assets and Liabilities and maintains proper
and adequate internal accounting controls that provide assurance that (a)
transactions are executed with management's general or specific
authorizations; (b) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of the FFHI Financial Statements and FFHI Call Reports in
accordance with GAAP and RAP, and to maintain asset and Liability
accountability; (c) access to each FFHI Company's assets and incurrence of
each FFHI Company's Liabilities are permitted only in accordance with
management's specific or general authorizations; (d) the recorded
accountability for assets and Liabilities is compared with the existing assets
and Liabilities at reasonable intervals and appropriate action is taken with
respect to any difference; and (e) extensions of credit and other receivables
are recorded accurately, and proper and adequate procedures are implemented to
effect the collection thereof on a current and timely basis. None of FFHI's
systems, controls, data or information are recorded, stored, maintained,
operated or otherwise wholly or partly dependent on or held by any means
(including any electronic, mechanical or photographic process, whether
computerized or not) which (including all means of access thereto and
therefrom) are not under the exclusive ownership and direct control of the
FFHI Companies or their accountants, except as would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on FFHI. No FFHI Company has been
advised of any material deficiencies in the design or operation of internal
controls over financial reporting which could reasonably be expected to
adversely affect its ability to record, process, summarize and report
financial data, or any fraud, whether or not material, that involves
management. No material weakness in internal controls has been identified by
FFHI's auditors, and there have been no significant changes in internal
controls that could reasonably be expected to materially and adversely affect
internal controls.

 



 

5.34 _Securities Law Compliance; Registration Obligations._ FFHI's common
stock is traded on the OTCQX Market under the symbol "FFHD." FFHI has complied
in all material respects with all applicable state and federal securities Laws
and the rules, regulations or orders, injunctions or decrees of any applicable
Regulatory Authority relating thereto. No FFHI Company is under any
obligation, contingent or otherwise, to register its securities under the 1933
Act, the 1934 Act, or any state securities Laws. __

Except as disclosed in (a) a Schedule (subject to Section 11.4 below) or (b)
any publicly available report, statement, schedule form or other document
filed by NCC with the SEC in each case after December 31, 2016 and prior to
the date hereof (but excluding any risk factor disclosures contained under the

organized, validly existing, and in good standing under the Laws of the State
of Delaware, and has the corporate power and authority to carry on its
business as now conducted and to own, lease and operate its Assets and to
incur its Liabilities. NCC is duly qualified or licensed to transact business
as a foreign corporation in good standing in the states of the United States
and foreign jurisdictions where the character of its Assets or the nature or
conduct of its business requires it to be so qualified or licensed, except for
such jurisdictions in which the failure to be so qualified or licensed is not
reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on NCC.

 



 

6.2 _Authority; No Breach By Agreement._

 



 

(a) NCC has the corporate power and authority necessary to execute,
deliver and perform its obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the
transactions provided for herein. The execution, delivery and performance of
this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions provided for herein
have been, or prior to the Effective Time will be, duly and validly authorized
by all necessary corporate action on the part of NCC. Subject to required
regulatory consents, this Agreement constitutes a legal, valid and binding
obligation of NCC, enforceable against NCC in accordance with its terms,
except as such enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency or similar Laws of general applicability affecting creditors'
rights or by general principles of equity.

 



 

(b) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by NCC or of the
Bank Merger Agreement by NBC, nor the consummation by NCC of the transactions
provided for in this Agreement or by NBC of the transactions provided for in
the Bank Merger Agreement, nor compliance by NCC with any of the provisions of
this Agreement or by NBC with any of the provisions of the Bank Merger
Agreement, will (i) conflict with or result in a breach of any provision of
NCC's Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws or similar governing documents of
NBC, (ii) constitute or result in a Default under, or require any Consent
pursuant to, or result in the creation of any Lien on any Asset of any NCC
Company under, any Contract or Permit of any NCC Company, where failure to

aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on such NCC Company, or (iii) subject to
receipt of the requisite approvals referred to in Section 9.1(b) of this
Agreement, violate any Law or Order applicable to any NCC Company or any of
their respective Assets.

 



 

(c) Other than (i) in connection or compliance with the provisions of the
Securities Laws, applicable state corporate and securities Laws, and rules and
requirements of Nasdaq, (ii) Consents required from Regulatory Authorities,
(iii) notices to or filings with the Internal Revenue Service or the Pension
Benefit Guaranty Corporation with respect to any employee benefit plans, (iv)
notices to or filings with Nasdaq regarding the listing on Nasdaq of the

filings or notifications that, if not obtained or made, are not reasonably
likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on
NCC, no notice to, filing with or Consent of any public body or authority is
necessary for the consummation by NCC of the Merger and the other transactions
provided for in this Agreement or for the consummation by NBC of the Bank
Merger and the other transactions provided for in the Bank Merger Agreement.
No consents or approvals of or filings or registrations with any Regulatory
Authorities are necessary in connection with the execution and delivery by NCC
of this Agreement.

 



 



 

 



   



 

6.3 _Capital Stock._ The authorized capital stock of NCC, as of the date
of this Agreement, consists of (i) 30,000,000 shares of NCC Common Stock and
(ii) 250,000 shares of NCC Preferred Stock. As of the date hereof, 14,070,528
shares of NCC Common Stock and no shares of NCC Preferred Stock are issued and
outstanding. All of the shares of NCC Common Stock to be issued in exchange
for shares of FFHI Common Stock upon consummation of the Merger, when issued
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, will be duly and validly
issued and outstanding and fully paid and non-assessable under the DGCL. None
of the shares of NCC Common Stock to be issued in exchange for shares of FFHI
Common Stock upon consummation of the Merger will be issued in violation of
any preemptive rights of the stockholders of NCC. __

 



 

6.4 _Reports and Financial Statements._

 



 

(a) Since January 1, 2013, or the date of organization or acquisition if
later, each NCC Company has filed all reports and statements, together with
any amendments required to be made with respect thereto, that it was required
to file with (i) the SEC, including, but not limited to, Forms 10-K, Forms
10-Q, Forms 8-K, and proxy statements, (ii) other Regulatory Authorities, and
(iii) any applicable state securities or banking authorities. As of their
respective dates, each of such reports and documents, including the NCC
Financial Statements, exhibits, and schedules thereto, complied in all
material respects with all applicable Laws, including, without limitation, the
Securities Laws. As of its respective date, each such report and document did
not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading. The NCC Financial Statements included in such reports
(as of the dates thereof and for the periods covered thereby) (A) are, or if
dated after the date of this Agreement, will be, in accordance with the books
and records of the NCC Companies, which are or will be, as the case may be,
complete and correct and which have been or will have been, as the case may
be, maintained in accordance with good business practices, (B) present, or
will present, fairly in all material respects the consolidated financial
position of the NCC Companies as of the dates indicated and the consolidated
results of operations, changes in stockholders' equity, and cash flows of the
NCC Companies for the periods indicated, and (C) have been or will have been,
as the case may be, prepared in all material respects in accordance with GAAP,
which principles have been consistently applied during the periods involved
(subject to exceptions specified therein or as may be indicated in the notes
thereto or, in the case of interim financial statements, to normal year-end
adjustments that are not material). Porter Keadle Moore, LLC is a registered
public accounting firm and throughout the periods covered by the financial
statements filed by NCC with the SEC has been "independent" with respect to
NCC within the meaning of Regulation S-X under the 1934 Act.

 



 



 

 



   



 

(b) NCC maintains a system of internal control over financial reporting
(as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the 1934 Act) sufficient to
provide reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with GAAP. Since December 31, 2016, there has not been any material
change in the internal controls utilized by NCC to provide reasonable
assurance that its consolidated financial statements conform with GAAP. NCC
maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined by Rules 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e) under the 1934 Act) to ensure that material information required
to be disclosed by NCC in the reports that it files or submits under the 1934
Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the SEC's rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to
NCC's management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosures and to allow NCC's management to make the certifications of the
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of NCC required under the
1934 Act.

 



 

(c) Each of the principal executive officer and the principal financial
officer of NCC (or each former principal executive officer and each former
principal financial officer of NCC, as applicable) has made all certifications
required by Rule 13a-14 or 15d-14 under the 1934 Act and Section 302 and 906
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act with respect to the reports of NCC filed with the
SEC, and the statements contained in such certifications are true and accurate
in all material respects. No NCC Company has outstanding (or has arranged or
modified since the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act) any "extensions of
credit" (within the meaning of Section 402 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act) to
directors or executive officers (as defined in Rule 3b-7 under the Exchange
Act) of any NCC Company, other than loans or extensions of credit permitted
by, or excluded from the prohibition of, Section 402 of the Sarbanes Oxley
Act. NCC is otherwise in compliance with all applicable provisions of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act, except for any non-compliance that would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(d) No NCC Company is a party to, or has any commitment to become a party
to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet partnership or any similar contract
or arrangement (including any contract or arrangement relating to any
transaction or relationship between or among NCC and any other NCC Company, on
the one hand, and any unconsolidated Affiliate, including any structured
finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or Person, on the other
hand, or any "off-balance sheet arrangement"), where the result, purpose or
intended effect of such contract or arrangement is to avoid disclosure of any
material transaction involving, or material liabilities of NCC or any NCC
Company in NCC's or such other NCC Company's financial statements.

 



 

6.5 _Absence of Undisclosed Liabilities._ No NCC Company has any
Liabilities that are reasonably likely to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on NCC, except Liabilities (i) accrued or
reserved against in the consolidated balance sheets of NCC as of June 30,
2017, that are included in the NCC Financial Statements or reflected in the
notes thereto, (ii) incurred or paid in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past business practice, (iii) incurred or paid pursuant to and
in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, or (iv)
disclosed on _Schedule 6.5_. Except as disclosed on _Schedule 6.5_ , no NCC
Company has incurred or paid any Liability since June 30, 2017, except for
such Liabilities which are not reasonably likely to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on NCC.

 



 



 

 



   



 

6.6 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events._ Since June 30, 2017: (i)
there have been no events, changes or occurrences that have had, or are
reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on NCC, including, without limitation, any change in the
administrative or supervisory standing or rating of NCC with any Regulatory
Authority, and (ii) the NCC Companies have not taken any action, or failed to
take any action, prior to the date of this Agreement, which action or failure,
if taken after the date of this Agreement, would represent or result in a
material breach or violation of any of the covenants and agreements of NCC
provided in Article 7 of this Agreement.

 



 

6.7 _Compliance with Laws._ NCC is duly registered as a financial holding
company under the federal Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended. Each
NCC Company has in effect all Permits necessary for it to own, lease or
operate its Assets and to carry on its business as now conducted, except for
those Permits the absence of which are not reasonably likely to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on NCC, and there
has occurred no Default under any such Permit. Each of the NCC Companies:

 



 

(a) is and since October 31, 2010, has been in compliance in all material
respects with all Laws, Orders or Permits applicable to its business or
employees conducting its business; and

 



 

(b) since October 31, 2010, has received no notification or communication
from any agency or department of federal, state or local government or any
Regulatory Authority or the staff thereof (i) asserting that any NCC Company
is not in compliance with any of the Laws or Orders that such Governmental
Authority or Regulatory Authority enforces, (ii) threatening to revoke any
Permits, (iii) requiring any NCC Company to enter into or consent to the
issuance of a cease and desist order, formal agreement, directive, commitment
or memorandum of understanding, or to adopt any board resolution or similar
undertaking, or (iv) directing, restricting or limiting, or purporting to
direct, restrict or limit in any manner the operations of any NCC Company,
including, without limitation, any restrictions on the payment of dividends,
or that in any manner relates to such entity's capital adequacy, credit or
reserve policies or management or business.

 



 

6.8 _Material Contracts._ No NCC Company is in Default under any of its
Contracts.

 



 

6.9 _Legal Proceedings._ Except as set forth on _Schedule 6.9_ , there is
no Litigation instituted or pending, or, to the Knowledge of each NCC Company,
threatened (or unasserted but considered probable of assertion) against any
NCC Company, or against any Asset, interest, or right of any of them that is
reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on NCC, nor are there any Orders of any Regulatory Authorities,
other Governmental Authorities or arbitrators outstanding, pending or, to the
Knowledge of any NCC Company, threatened against any NCC Company, that are
reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on NCC.

 



 



 

 



   



 

6.10 _Statements True and Correct._ Neither this Agreement nor any
statement, certificate, instrument or other writing furnished or to be
furnished by any NCC Company or any Affiliate thereof to FFHI pursuant to this
Agreement, including the Exhibits or Schedules hereto, contains or will
contain any untrue statement of material fact or will omit to state a material
fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading. None of the information supplied
or to be supplied by any NCC Company or any Affiliate thereof for inclusion in
(i) the documents to be filed with the SEC, including, without limitation, the
Registration Statement and the Proxy Statement/Prospectus to be mailed to
holders of FFHI Common Stock and (ii) any other documents to be filed by any
NCC Company or any Affiliate thereof with the SEC or any other Regulatory
Authority in connection with the transactions provided for herein, will, at
the respective time at which such documents are filed, and with respect to the
Proxy Statement/Prospectus, when first mailed to the holders of FFHI Common
Stock, be false or misleading with respect to any material fact, or omit to
state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. All documents
that any NCC Company or any Affiliate thereof is responsible for filing with
any Regulatory Authority in connection with the transactions provided for
herein will comply as to form in all material respects with the provisions of
applicable Law.

 



 

6.11 _Tax Matters_. Each NCC Company has filed all material Tax Returns
that it was required to file under applicable Laws, other than Tax Returns
that are not yet due or for which a request for extension was filed consistent
with requirements of applicable Law. All such Tax Returns were correct and
complete in all material respects. All material Taxes due and owing by any NCC
Company have been paid other than Taxes that have been reserved or accrued on
the balance sheet of NCC or which NCC is contesting in good faith. Since
December 31, 2013, no claim has been made by an authority in a jurisdiction
where NCC does not file Tax Returns that it is or may be subject to taxation
by that jurisdiction. There are no Liens for Taxes (other than Taxes not yet
due and payable) upon any of the assets of any NCC Company. No NCC Company has
taken any action or has any Knowledge of any fact or circumstance that is
reasonably likely to prevent the transactions contemplated hereby, including
the Merger and the Bank Merger, from qualifying as a reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

 



 

6.12 _Regulatory Matters._ No NCC Company has taken any action or has any
Knowledge of any fact or circumstance that is reasonably likely to materially
impede or delay receipt of any Consents of Regulatory Authorities referred to
in Section 9.1(b) of this Agreement or result in the imposition of a condition
or restriction of the type referred to in the last sentence of such Section.

 



 

6.13 _1933 Act and 1934 Act Compliance._ The Proxy Statement/Prospectus
will comply in all material respects with applicable provisions of the 1933
Act and the 1934 Act and the rules and regulations thereunder; _provided,
however_ , that NCC makes no representation or warranty with respect to any
information provided by or on behalf of any FFHI Company for inclusion in the
Proxy Statement/Prospectus.

 



 

6.14 _Regulatory Capital._ NCC is "well capitalized" (as defined in 12
C.F.R. Part 225.2(r)) and "well managed" (as defined in 12 C.F.R. Part
225.2(s)). NBC is an "eligible bank" (as defined in 12 C.F.R. Part 5.3(g)).

 



 

6.15 _Opinion of Counsel._ NCC has no Knowledge of any facts that would
preclude issuance of the opinions of counsel referred to in Section 9.1(e).

 



 



 

 



   



 

6.16 _Deposits_. The deposit accounts of NBC are insured by the FDIC in
accordance with the provisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, and NBC
has paid all regular premiums and special assessments and filed all reports
required thereunder.

 



 

6.17 _Financial Advisor._ NCC has engaged Keefe, Bruyette and Woods, Inc.
(the "NCC Financial Advisor") to act as financial advisor to NCC in connection
with the Merger, pursuant to which the NCC Financial Advisor agreed, upon
request by NCC, to render an opinion to the NCC Board as to the fairness, from
a financial point of view, to NCC of the consideration to be offered in the
transaction. The NCC Board has received the opinion (which, if initially
rendered verbally, has been or will be confirmed by a written opinion, dated
the same date) of the NCC Financial Advisor to the effect that, as of the date
of such opinion, and based upon and subject to the factors, assumptions, and
limitations set forth therein, the merger consideration (defined in such
opinion as the __ Exchange Ratio and the Per Share Cash Consideration, taken
together) is fair, from a financial point of view, to NCC.

 



 

Article 7 _ 
CONDUCT OF BUSINESS PENDING CONSUMMATION_

 



 

7.1 _Affirmative Covenants._ Unless the prior written consent of NCC
shall have been obtained, and except as otherwise expressly provided for

the delivery of, a Superior Proposal, and (B) the FFHI Board determines in
good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that failure to
participate in discussions with such Person concerning such Acquisition

applicable Law, then FFHI may (x) furnish information (including non-public
information) with respect to FFHI to any such Person pursuant to a
confidentiality agreement containing confidentiality provisions no more
favorable to such Person than those in the Confidentiality Agreement between

any Acquisition Proposal. FFHI agrees that it will notify NCC promptly (and in
any event within 48 hours) if, to FFHI's Knowledge, any Acquisition Proposal
is received by, any information is requested from, or any discussions or
negotiations relating to an Acquisition Proposal are sought to be initiated or
continued with, FFHI, its Subsidiaries, or their officers, directors,
employees, representatives or agents. The notice shall indicate the name of
the Person making such Acquisition Proposal or taking such action and the
material terms and conditions of any proposals or offers, and thereafter FFHI

such proposals or offers and the status of any such discussions or
negotiations.

faith consider the recommendations by NCC regarding such litigation. FFHI
shall not settle any stockholder litigation without NCC's prior written
consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

this Agreement, or as required by applicable Law, or with the prior written
consent of FFHI, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, during the

or actions arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged
untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement,

with any Regulatory Authority or arise out of or are based upon the omission
or alleged omission to state a material fact required to be stated therein, or

frequent basis with the Designated Representative of the other Party hereto
and to report on the general status of its and its Subsidiaries' ongoing

applicable Law, in which case such Party shall notify the other Party of the
nondisclosure and the nature of such information) and (B) such other
information concerning its and its Subsidiaries' business, properties and
personnel as the other Party may reasonably request; provided, however, that
neither Party shall be required to provide any information to the other if
such Party reasonably determines that providing such information violates the
rights of such Party's customers under applicable Law or jeopardizes the
attorney-client privilege of the Party in possession or control of such
information (after giving due consideration to the existence of any common
interest, joint defense or similar agreement between the Parties).

 



 



 

 



   



 

(b) All information furnished by NCC to FFHI or its representatives

is abandoned and shall not apply to any information that (i) was already in

generally known to the public; or (iii) was disclosed to FFHI by a third party
not bound by an obligation of confidentiality, or disclosures made as required

Subsidiaries; (ii) was then generally known to the public; or (iii) was
disclosed to NCC by a third party not bound by an obligation of

unreasonably withheld. Prior to issuing or publishing any press release or
other public announcement or disclosure regarding the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, the releasing party shall provide a copy of
the release or announcement to the other Party prior to the issuance, and
shall provide a reasonable opportunity for comment. Nothing in this Section

that it deems necessary or advisable, with the advice of counsel, in order to
satisfy such Party's disclosure obligations imposed by Law.

 



 

8.7 _Expenses._ All costs and expenses incurred in connection with the
transactions provided for in this Agreement and the Bank Merger Agreement,

Party's willful breach of any provision of this Agreement.

commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Merger and the Bank Merger each
to qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the

thereunder, and that this Agreement shall constitute a "plan of
reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code for purposes
of Sections 354, 356 and 361 of the Code (and any comparable provision of
state law) for federal and applicable state income tax purposes. NCC and FFHI
shall prepare and file with each of their respective Tax Returns all
information required by Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-3 and related
provisions of the Treasury Regulations in a manner consistent with treating
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as a reorganization described
in Section 368(a) of the Code and shall take no position (whether in audits,
Tax Returns or otherwise) that is inconsistent with this treatment unless
required to do so by applicable Law. __

8.10 _Compliance Matters._ Prior to the Effective Time, FFHI shall take,
or cause to be taken, all commercially reasonable steps requested by NCC to
cure any deficiencies in regulatory compliance by FFHI; _provided, however_ ,
that NCC shall not be responsible for discovering such defects, shall not have
any obligation to disclose the existence of such defects to FFHI, and shall
not have any Liability resulting from such deficiencies or attempts to cure
them.

 



 

8.11 _Conforming Accounting and Reserve Policies._ At the request of NCC,
FFHI shall immediately prior to Closing establish and take such charge-offs,
reserves and accruals as NCC reasonably shall request to conform FFHI's loan,
accrual, capital, reserve and other accounting policies to the policies of NBC
(collectively, the "Conforming Adjustments").

 



 

8.12 [ _Removed and Reserved._ ]

 



 

8.13 _Bank Merger._ NCC and FFHI agree to take all action necessary and
appropriate, including causing the entering into of the Bank Merger Agreement
as soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, to effectuate the
Bank Merger in accordance with applicable Laws and the terms of the Bank
Merger Agreement as of the Effective Time or such later time, if any, as
determined by NCC. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Bank Merger may be
abandoned at the election of NCC at any time, whether before or after filings
are made for regulatory approval of the Bank Merger.

 



 

8.14 _Directors ' and Officers' Indemnification. _

 



 

(a) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, NCC shall
indemnify each director and officer of FFHI (each, an "Indemnified Party")
against all Liabilities arising out of actions or omissions occurring upon or
prior to the Effective Time (including, without limitation, the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement) to the extent permitted under the Articles of
Incorporation and Bylaws of FFHI as in effect on the date of this Agreement,
subject to (i) the limitations and requirements of such Articles of
Incorporation and Bylaws, and (ii) applicable Law, including, without
limitation, Section 607.0850 of the FBCA.

 



 



 

 



   



 

(b) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under Section
8.14(a) above, upon learning of any such Liability or Litigation, shall
promptly notify NCC thereof; provided that the failure to so notify shall not
affect the obligation of NCC under this Section 8.14 unless, and only to the
extent that, NCC is actually and materially prejudiced in the defense of such
claim as a consequence. In the event of any claim or Litigation that may give
rise to indemnity obligations on the part of NCC (whether arising before or
after the Effective Time), (i) NCC shall have the right to assume the defense
thereof, and NCC shall not be liable to such Indemnified Party for any legal
expenses of other counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred by such
Indemnified Party in connection with the defense thereof, except that if NCC
elects not to assume such defense or counsel for the Indemnified Party advises
that there are substantive issues that raise conflicts of interest between NCC
and the Indemnified Party under the rules of professional ethics, the
Indemnified Party may retain counsel satisfactory to him or her, and NCC shall
pay all reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified
Party; _provided, however_ , that NCC shall be obligated to pay for only one
firm of counsel for all Indemnified Parties in any jurisdiction; (ii) all
Indemnified Parties will cooperate in the defense of any such Litigation; and
(iii) NCC shall not be liable for any settlement effected without its prior
written consent; and provided further, that NCC shall not have any obligation
hereunder to the extent such arrangements are prohibited by applicable Law.

 



 

(c) For a period of six (6) years following the Effective Time, NCC will
use its commercially reasonable efforts to provide director's and officer's
liability insurance ("DandO Insurance") that serves to reimburse the present and
former officers and directors of FFHI or its Subsidiaries (determined as of
the Effective Time) with respect to claims against such directors and officers
arising from facts or events occurring before the Effective Time (including
the transactions contemplated hereby), which insurance will contain at least
the same coverage and amounts, and contain terms and conditions no less
advantageous to the Indemnified Party, as the coverage currently provided by
FFHI as of the date of this Agreement; _provided, however_ , that (i) if NCC
is unable to maintain or obtain the insurance called for by this Section
8.14(c), then NCC will provide as much comparable insurance as is reasonably
available, (ii) officers and directors of FFHI or its Subsidiaries may be
required to make application and provide customary representations and
warranties to the carrier of the DandO Insurance for the purpose of obtaining
such insurance, and (iii) in satisfaction of its obligations under this
Section 8.14(c), NCC may require FFHI to purchase, prior to but effective as
of the Effective Time, tail insurance providing such coverage prior to
Closing. Whether or not NCC or FFHI shall procure such coverage, in no event
shall FFHI expend, or shall NCC be required to expend, for such tail insurance
a premium amount in excess of $175,000 (the "Maximum DandO Tail Premium"). If
the cost of such tail insurance exceeds the Maximum DandO Tail Premium, then
FFHI or NCC, as applicable, shall obtain tail insurance coverage or a separate
tail insurance policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not
exceeding the Maximum DandO Tail Premium.

 



 

(d) If NCC or any of its successors and assigns (i) shall consolidate with
or merge into any other corporation or entity and shall not be the continuing
or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii)
shall transfer all or substantially all of its property and assets to any
individual, corporation or other entity, then, in each such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of NCC and its
Subsidiaries shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 8.14. The
provisions of this Section 8.14 shall survive the Effective Time and are
intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each
Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives.

 



 

8.15 _System Integration._ From and after the date hereof, subject to
applicable Law and regulation, FFHI shall, and shall cause its directors,
officers and employees to, and shall make all commercially reasonable efforts
(without undue disruption to either business) to cause FirstAtlantic Bank's
data processing consultants and software providers to, cooperate and assist
FirstAtlantic Bank and NBC in connection with an electronic and systematic
conversion of all applicable data of FirstAtlantic Bank to the NBC system
following the Effective Time and the consummation of the Bank Merger,
including the training of FirstAtlantic Bank employees during normal business
hours without undue disruption to FirstAtlantic Bank's business.

 



 



 

 



   



 

8.16 _Coordination; Integration._ Subject to applicable Law and
regulation, during the period from the date hereof until the Effective Time,
FFHI shall cause the Chief Executive Officer of FirstAtlantic Bank or, if such
Person is unavailable, another senior officer thereof, to assist and confer
with the officers of NBC, on a weekly basis, relating to the development,
coordination and implementation of the post-Bank Merger operating and
integration plans of NBC, as the resulting association in the Bank Merger.
Notwithstanding the conversion of the core processing and other data
processing and information systems of FirstAtlantic Bank in conjunction with
the Bank Merger, and subject to applicable provisions of Law and non-objection
from any Regulatory Authorities, it is the Parties' intent that following the
Bank Merger, the former main office and branches of FirstAtlantic Bank, along
with any branches of NBC in the same market area and under common day-to-day
management with the former branches of FirstAtlantic Bank, may operate and
conduct business under the trade name "FirstAtlantic Bank, a division of
National Bank of Commerce" for at least two (2) years following the Effective
Time (along with signage, stationery and marketing materials in such name).

 



 

8.17 _Non-Competition Agreements._ FFHI shall cause each non-employee
director of FFHI to execute and deliver to NCC a Non-Competition Agreement in
the form attached hereto as _Exhibit B_ , concurrently with the execution and
delivery of this Agreement and effective upon the Effective Time.

 



 

8.18 _Claims Letters._ FFHI shall cause each director and executive
officer of FFHI to execute and deliver a Claims Letter in the form attached
hereto as _Exhibit C_ concurrently with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement and effective upon the Effective Time. __

 



 

8.19 _Employment Agreements._

 



 

(a) As of the date of this Agreement, FFHI has entered into agreements
that terminate, effective immediately prior to (and subject to the occurrence
of) the Effective Time, the employment, consulting, severance, change in
control, or similar agreements or arrangements with the individuals set forth
on _Schedule 8.19(a)_ (collectively, the "Employment Agreement Termination
Letters"). In connection with the foregoing terminations, the individual who
was a party to any such agreement shall receive a cash payment at or around
the Effective Time in a single lump sum in the amount set forth on _Schedule
8.19(a)_ opposite the individual's name (subject to applicable tax
withholdings and the terms and conditions of the applicable Employment
Agreement Termination Letter). NCC and FFHI will work together in good faith
to implement mutually satisfactory arrangements such that the termination and
liquidation of such agreements will be made consistent with the provisions of
Section 409A of the Code for termination and liquidation of a plan in
connection with a change in control event under Section 409A of the Code, so
as to avoid any additional tax, interest or penalties in connection with the
termination and liquidation of said agreements.

 



 



 

 



   



 

(b) As of the date of this Agreement, NBC (as successor to FirstAtlantic
Bank) has entered into employment and non-competition agreements that become
effective as of (and subject to the occurrence of) the Effective Time with the
individuals set forth on _Schedule 8.19(b)_ (the "Employment Agreements").

 



 

8.20 _Section 280G Matters._ Prior to the Closing, NCC and FFHI will work
together in good faith to implement mutually satisfactory arrangements such
that the Merger will not trigger or result in any payment, including, without
limitation, any "excess parachute payment" as defined in Section 280G of the
Code, that could be disallowed as a deduction or result in the payment of
excise taxes under Section 280G of the Code.

 



 

8.21 _Employee Matters._

 



 

(a) Following the Effective Time, NCC shall maintain or cause to be
maintained employee benefit plans and compensation opportunities for the
benefit of employees (as a group) who are full-time active employees of FFHI
and its Subsidiaries on the Closing Date ("Covered Employees") that provide
employee benefits and compensation opportunities that, in the aggregate, are
substantially comparable to the employee benefits and compensation
opportunities that are made available on a uniform and non-discriminatory
basis to similarly situated employees of NCC or its Subsidiaries, as
applicable; _provided, however_ , that in no event shall any Covered Employee
be eligible to participate in any closed or frozen plan of NCC or its
Subsidiaries. Subject to applicable Law and the requirements of the insurers
under NCC's benefit plans, NCC shall give the Covered Employees full credit
for their prior service with the FFHI Companies (including prior service with
any companies acquired by the FFHI Companies or from whom branch offices were
acquired by the FFHI Companies, except to the extent resulting in duplication
of benefits) (i) for purposes of eligibility (including initial participation
and eligibility for current benefits) and vesting under any qualified or non-
qualified employee benefit plan maintained by NCC and in which Covered
Employees may be eligible to participate and (ii) for all purposes under any
welfare benefit plans, severance plans, vacation plans and similar
arrangements maintained by NCC (which shall not include, for the sake of
clarity, duplication of any severance obligations under Section 8.21(e)
below). Each Covered Employee's accrued paid time off and unused sick time
will be credited towards one or a combination of NCC's welfare benefit plans.

 



 

(b) With respect to any employee benefit plan of NCC that is a health,
dental, vision or other welfare plan in which any Covered Employee is eligible
to participate, for the plan year in which such Covered Employee is first
eligible to participate, NCC shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (i)
cause any pre-existing condition limitations or eligibility waiting periods
under such NCC plan to be waived with respect to such Covered Employee to the
extent that such condition was or would have been covered under the FFHI
Benefit Plan in which such Covered Employee participated immediately prior to
the Effective Time, and (ii) recognize any health, dental, vision or other
welfare expenses incurred by such Covered Employee in the year that includes
the Closing Date (or, if later, the year in which such Covered Employee is
first eligible to participate) for purposes of any applicable deductible and
annual out-of-pocket expense requirements under any such health, dental,
vision or other welfare plan.

 



 



 

 



   



 

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, FFHI shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, take all actions requested by NCC in writing upon no less
than five (5) days' advance notice that may be necessary or appropriate to (i)
cause one or more FFHI Benefits Plans to terminate as of the Effective Time,
or as of the date immediately preceding the Effective Time, (ii) cause benefit
accruals and entitlements under any FFHI Benefit Plan to cease as of the
Effective Time, or as of the date immediately preceding the Effective Time,
(iii) cause the continuation on and after the Effective Time of any contract,
arrangement or insurance policy relating to any FFHI Benefit Plan for such
period as may be requested by NCC, or (iv) facilitate the merger of any FFHI
Benefit Plan into any employee benefit plan maintained by NCC or an NCC
Subsidiary. Prior to the Effective Time, FFHI shall also take all actions that
may be necessary or appropriate to cause the FFHI Stock Incentive Plan to
terminate as of the date immediately preceding the Effective Time in exchange
for the treatment of outstanding awards as contemplated under Sections 3.1(e)
and 3.1(g) of this Agreement, such that neither NCC nor NBC shall assume any
FFHI Option or the FFHI Stock Incentive Plan. All resolutions, notices, or
other documents issued, adopted or executed in connection with the
implementation of this Section 8.21(c) shall be subject to NCC's reasonable
prior review and approval, which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed.

 



 

(d) Nothing in this Section 8.21 shall be construed to limit the right of
NCC or any of its Subsidiaries to amend or terminate any FFHI Benefit Plan
that is assumed by any NCC Company at or subsequent to the Effective Time or
other employee benefit plan, to the extent that such amendment or termination
is permitted by the terms of the applicable plan and applicable Law, nor shall
anything in this Section 8.21 be construed to require NCC or any of its
Subsidiaries to retain the employment of any particular Covered Employee for
any fixed period of time following the Closing Date, and the continued
retention (or termination) by NCC or any of its Subsidiaries of any Covered
Employee subsequent to the Effective Time shall be subject in all events to
NCC's or its applicable Subsidiary's normal and customary employment
procedures and practices, including customary background screening and
evaluation procedures and satisfactory employment performance.

 



 

(e) If, within nine (9) months after the Effective Time, any Covered
Employee is terminated by any NCC Company solely as a result of the Merger
(i.e., elimination of duplicative jobs, etc.), and not as a result of
inadequate performance or other good cause, NCC will pay severance to such
Covered Employee in an amount equal to two weeks' pay for each twelve (12)
months or portion thereof of such Covered Employee's prior employment with a
FFHI Company; _provided, however_ , that in no event will the total amount of
severance for any single Covered Employee exceed the lesser of $25,000 or an
amount equal to 26 weeks' pay in the aggregate. Any severance to which a
Covered Employee may be entitled in connection with a termination occurring
more than nine (9) months after the Effective Time will be as set forth in the
severance policies of NCC and its Subsidiaries as then in effect. For the sake
of clarity, this Section 8.21(e) does not apply to or benefit any Covered
Employee who is a party to an Employment Agreement or any change in control or
severance agreement; rather, the terms and conditions of such Employment
Agreement, change in control agreement or severance agreement, as applicable,
shall govern and control upon any termination of employment.

of each Party to perform this Agreement and consummate the Merger and the

with, and notifications to, all Regulatory Authorities required for
consummation of the Merger and the Bank Merger shall have been obtained or
made and shall be in full force and effect and all notice and waiting periods
required by Law to have passed after receipt of such Consents shall have
expired. No Consent obtained from any Regulatory Authority that is necessary
to consummate the transactions provided for herein shall be conditioned or
restricted in a manner (including, without limitation, requirements relating
to the raising of additional capital or the disposition of Assets) that in the
reasonable judgment of the Board of Directors of either Party would so
materially adversely impact the economic or business benefits of the
transactions provided for in this Agreement as to render inadvisable the
consummation of the Merger and the Bank Merger.

 



 

(c) _Consents and Approvals_. Each of the Parties shall have obtained any
and all Consents required for consummation of the Merger and the Bank Merger
(other than those referred to in Section 9.1(b) of this Agreement) or for the
preventing of any Default under any Contract or Permit of such Party that, if
not obtained or made, is reasonably likely to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on such Party. No Consent so obtained
that is necessary to consummate the transactions provided for herein shall be
conditioned or restricted in a manner that in the reasonable judgment of the
Board of Directors of either Party would so materially adversely impact the
economic or business benefits of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement as to render inadvisable the consummation of the Merger or the Bank
Merger.

 



 

(d) _Legal Proceedings_. No court or Regulatory Authority of competent
jurisdiction shall have enacted, issued, promulgated, enforced or entered any
Law or Order (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) or taken any other
action that prohibits, restricts or makes illegal consummation of the Merger,
the Bank Merger or any other transaction provided for in this Agreement. No
action or proceeding shall have been instituted by any Person, and the Parties
shall not have Knowledge of any threatened action or proceeding by any Person,
that seeks to restrain the consummation of the Merger, the Bank Merger or any
other transaction provided for in this Agreement that, in the opinion of the
NCC Board or the FFHI Board, renders it impossible or inadvisable to
consummate the transactions provided for in this Agreement.

 



 



 

 



   



 

(e) _Tax Opinions_. NCC shall have received a written opinion of counsel
from Maynard, Cooper and Gale, P.C. in form reasonably satisfactory to NCC, and
FFHI shall have received a written opinion of counsel from Troutman Sanders

effect that (i) the Merger will constitute a reorganization within the meaning
of Section 368(a) of the Code, (ii) the exchange in the Merger of FFHI Common
Stock for NCC Common Stock will not give rise to gain or loss to the
stockholders of FFHI with respect to such exchange (except to the extent of
any cash received), and (iii) neither FFHI nor NCC will recognize gain or loss
as a consequence of the Merger (except for income and deferred gain recognized
pursuant to Treasury regulations issued under Section 1502 of the Code). In
rendering such Tax Opinion, counsel for NCC and counsel for FFHI shall be
entitled to rely upon representations of officers of FFHI and NCC reasonably
satisfactory in form and substance to such counsel.

 



 

(f) _Registration Statement Effective_. The Registration Statement shall
have been declared effective under the 1933 Act by the SEC and no stop order
suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement shall have been
issued and no action, suit, proceeding or investigation for that purpose shall

state securities Laws permits or other authorizations, or confirmations as to
the availability of exemptions from registration requirements, as may be
necessary to issue the NCC Common Stock pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement.

 



 

(g) _Exchange Listing_. In accordance with the Nasdaq listing rules, NCC
shall have caused the shares of NCC Common Stock issuable upon consummation of
the Merger to be approved for listing on Nasdaq.

 



 

9.2 _Conditions to Obligations of NCC._ The obligations of NCC to perform
this Agreement and consummate the Merger and the other transactions provided
for herein are subject to the satisfaction of the following conditions, unless
waived by NCC pursuant to Section 11.4(a) of this Agreement:

 



 

(a) _Representations and Warranties_. The representations and warranties
of FFHI set forth or referred to in this Agreement or in any certificate or
document delivered pursuant to the provisions hereof that are qualified as to
materiality or Material Adverse Effect shall be true and correct in all
respects as of the date of this Agreement and as of the Effective Time with
the same effect as though all such representations and warranties had been
made on and as of the Effective Time (provided that representations and
warranties that are confined to a specified date shall speak only as of such
date), and the representations and warranties of FFHI set forth or referred to
in this Agreement or in any certificate or document delivered pursuant to the
provisions hereof that are not so qualified shall be true and correct in all
material respects as of the date of this Agreement and as of the Effective
Time with the same effect as though all such representations and warranties
had been made on and as of the Effective Time (provided that representations
and warranties that are confined to a specified date shall speak only as of
such date). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the representations and warranties
of FFHI set forth in Section 5.3 (Capitalization) and the second sentence of
Section 5.4(b) (FFHI Subsidiaries) shall be true and correct in all respects,
except for such failures to be true and correct as are _de minimis_ , as of

the Effective Time.

 



 



 

 



   



 

(b) _Performance of Obligations_. Each and all of the agreements,
obligations and covenants of FFHI to be performed and complied with pursuant
to this Agreement and the other agreements provided for herein prior to the

this Agreement have been satisfied, (ii) certified copies of resolutions duly
adopted by the FFHI Board and the FFHI stockholders evidencing the taking of
all corporate action necessary to authorize the Merger, the execution,

Business Day prior to the Closing Date (the "FFHI Measuring Date"), the
Adjusted FFHI Stockholders' Equity shall not be less than $59,000,000, as
determined in accordance with GAAP. For purposes of this Section 9.2(d),
"Adjusted FFHI Stockholders' Equity" means the consolidated equity of FFHI as

the FFHI Measuring Date, including without limitation the Conforming
Adjustments.

 



 

(e) _Conforming Adjustments_. The Conforming Adjustments shall have been
made to the satisfaction of NCC in its sole discretion.

 



 

(f) _Matters Relating to 280G Taxes_. NCC shall be reasonably satisfied,
either through mutually agreeable pre-Closing amendments or otherwise, that
FFHI shall have taken any and all reasonably necessary steps such that neither
the Merger nor the Bank Merger will trigger any "excess parachute payment" (as
defined in Section 280G of the Code) under any employment agreements, change

retirement or similar arrangements between a FFHI Company and any officers,
directors or employees thereof.

 



 



 

 



   



 

(g) _Employment Matters_. NCC shall have received documentation
reasonably satisfactory to NCC that all of the Employment Agreement
Termination Letters and all of the Employment Agreements have been duly
executed and delivered concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, and
that Mitchell W. Hunt, Jr. shall become an employee of NBC as of the Effective
Time under the terms of his Employment Agreement.

 



 

(h) _Regulatory Matters_. No agency or department of federal, state or
local government or any Regulatory Authority or the staff thereof shall have
(i) asserted that any FFHI Company is not in material compliance with any of
the Laws or Orders that such Governmental Authority or Regulatory Authority
enforces, (ii) revoked any material Permits, or (iii) issued, or required any
FFHI Company to consent to the issuance or adoption of, a cease and desist
order, formal agreement, directive, commitment or memorandum of understanding,
or any board resolution or similar undertaking, that, in the reasonable
estimation of NCC, materially restricts or impairs the conduct of such FFHI
Company's business or future prospects.

 



 

(i) _Absence of Adverse Facts_. There shall have been no reasonable
determination by NCC in good faith that any fact, Litigation, claim, event or
condition exists or has occurred that, in the reasonable judgment of NCC,
would have a Material Adverse Effect on, or may be foreseen to have a Material
Adverse Effect on, FFHI or the consummation of the transactions provided for
in this Agreement.

 



 

(j) _Consents Under Agreements_. FFHI shall have obtained all consents or
approvals of each Person (other than the Consents of the Regulatory
Authorities) whose consent or approval shall be required in order to permit
the succession by the Surviving Corporation to, or the continuation by a FFHI
Subsidiary of, as the case may be, any obligation, right or interest of FFHI
or such FFHI Subsidiary under any loan or credit agreement, note, mortgage,
indenture, lease, license, Contract or other agreement or instrument, except
those for which failure to obtain such consents and approvals would not in the
reasonable opinion of NCC, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material
Adverse Effect on the Surviving Corporation or the FFHI Subsidiary at issue or
upon consummation of the transactions provided for in this Agreement.

 



 

(k) _Deposits_. NCC shall have received _Schedule 5.32_ updated as of the
FFHI Measuring Date and the brokered deposits and other items described or

$40,000,000.

 



 

(l) _Loan Portfolio_. NCC shall have received _Schedule 5.9(a)(iv)_
updated as of the FFHI Measuring Date and there shall not have been any
material increase since the date of this Agreement in the Loans described or
required to be described thereon; _provided, however_ , that regardless of any
such increase, the condition in this Section 9.2(n) shall be deemed to be
satisfied if the quotient of the aggregate amount of the Classified Loans of
the FFHI Companies as of the FFHI Measuring Date divided by the sum of (i)
FFHI's equity plus (ii) the FFHI Allowance, both as set forth on FFHI's
balance sheet on the FFHI Measuring Date, is less than 0.20.

 



 

(m) _Action on Plans_. NCC shall have received such evidence and
documentation as it shall have reasonably requested to effectuate the
provisions of Sections 8.21(c) and (d) regarding the FFHI Benefit Plans and
FFHI Stock Incentive Plan.

 



 



 

 



   



 

(n) _Bank Merger Agreement_. Prior to the FFHI Stockholders' Meeting, the
Bank Merger Agreement shall have been executed and delivered by FirstAtlantic
Bank and approved by FFHI as FirstAtlantic Bank's sole stockholder.

 



 

(o) _Related Agreements_. None of the Voting Agreements, Option Termination
Agreements, Non-Competition Agreements or Claims Letters delivered pursuant to
this Agreement shall have been amended, revoked or terminated by any party
thereto (other than by a non-breaching party due to a material breach by NCC),
and NCC shall be reasonably satisfied that the FFHI Options, FFHI Warrants and
FFHI Restricted Stock shall be treated in accordance with the terms and
conditions of this Agreement and, with respect to the FFHI Options, the Option
Termination Agreements as they exist on the date of this Agreement.

 



 

(p) _Securities Market Matters_. FFHI shall have provided notice of the
Merger to any Regulatory Authority that maintains or exercises oversight
authority over any securities market on which the FFHI Common Stock is traded,
including, without limitation, the OTC Markets Group and FINRA, and shall have
made all filings and completed any other actions required by such Regulatory
Authority to cause the FFHI Common Stock to no longer be eligible for trading
or quotation on such market effective as of, and subject to the occurrence of,
the Effective Time.

 



 

9.3 _Conditions to Obligations of FFHI._ The obligations of FFHI to
perform this Agreement and consummate the Merger and the other transactions
provided for herein are subject to the satisfaction of the following
conditions, unless waived by FFHI pursuant to Section 11.4(b) of this
Agreement:

 



 

(a) _Representations and Warranties_. The representations and warranties
of NCC set forth or referred to in this Agreement or in any certificate or
document delivered pursuant to the provisions hereof that are qualified as to
materiality or Material Adverse Effect shall be true and correct in all
respects as of the date of this Agreement and as of the Effective Time with
the same effect as though all such representations and warranties had been
made on and as of the Effective Time (provided that representations and
warranties that are confined to a specified date shall speak only as of such
date), and the representations and warranties of NCC set forth or referred to
in this Agreement or in any certificate or document delivered pursuant to the
provisions hereof that are not so qualified shall be true and correct in all

TERmination_

and notwithstanding the approval of this Agreement by the stockholders of
FFHI, this Agreement may be terminated and the Merger abandoned at any time
prior to the Effective Time:

 



 

(a) by mutual written consent of the NCC Board and the FFHI Board; or

 



 

(b) by the NCC Board or the FFHI Board in the event of an inaccuracy of
any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement that cannot be or
has not been cured within thirty (30) days after the giving of written notice
to the breaching Party of such inaccuracy and which inaccuracy is reasonably
likely, in the opinion of the non-breaching Party, to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the breaching Party; or

 



 

(c) by the NCC Board or the FFHI Board in the event of a material breach
by the other Party of any covenant, agreement or other obligation contained in
this Agreement that cannot be or has not been cured within thirty (30) days
after the giving of written notice to the breaching Party of such breach; or

 



 



 

 



   



 

(d) by the NCC Board or the FFHI Board (provided that the terminating
Party is not then in material breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant, agreement or other obligation contained in this Agreement) if (i)
any Consent of any Regulatory Authority required for consummation of the
Merger, the Bank Merger or the other transactions provided for herein shall
have been denied by final non-appealable action of such authority or if any
action taken by such Regulatory Authority is not appealed within the time
limit for appeal, or (ii) the stockholders of FFHI fail to vote their approval
of this Agreement and the transactions provided for herein as required by
applicable Law at the FFHI Stockholders' Meeting where the transactions are
presented to such FFHI stockholders for approval and voted upon; or

 



 

(e) by the NCC Board if, notwithstanding any disclosures in the Schedules
attached hereto or otherwise, (i) there shall have occurred any Material
Adverse Effect with respect to FFHI, or (ii) any facts or circumstances shall
develop or arise after the date of this Agreement that are reasonably likely
to cause or result in any Material Adverse Effect with respect to FFHI, and
such Material Adverse Effect (or such facts or circumstances) shall not have
been remedied within twenty one (21) days after receipt by FFHI of notice in
writing from NCC specifying the nature of such Material Adverse Effect and
requesting that it be remedied; or

 



 

(f) by the FFHI Board if, notwithstanding any disclosures in the Schedules
attached hereto or otherwise, (i) there shall have occurred any Material
Adverse Effect with respect to NCC, or (ii) any facts or circumstances shall
develop or arise after the date of this Agreement that are reasonably likely
to cause or result in any Material Adverse Effect with respect to NCC, and
such Material Adverse Effect (or such facts or circumstances) shall not have
been remedied within twenty one (21) days after receipt by NCC of notice in
writing from FFHI specifying the nature of such Material Adverse Effect and
requesting that it be remedied; or

 



 

(g) by the NCC Board or the FFHI Board if the Merger shall not have been
consummated on or before 270 days following the date of this Agreement, if the
failure to consummate the transactions provided for herein on or before such
date is not caused by any breach of this Agreement by the Party electing to
terminate pursuant to this Section 10.1(g); _provided, however_ , that if on
such 270th day approval by a Regulatory Authority is pending and has not been
finally resolved or any stockholder litigation referenced in Section 7.6 has
not been resolved (by dismissal, settlement or otherwise), then such number of
days shall be automatically increased from 270 to 360; or

 



 

(h) by the NCC Board or the FFHI Board if any of the conditions precedent
to the obligations of such Party to consummate the Merger cannot be satisfied
or fulfilled by the date specified in Section 10.1(g) of this Agreement and
such failure was not the fault of the terminating Party; or

 



 

(i) by the NCC Board if (i) the holders of in excess of ten percent (10%)
of the outstanding shares of FFHI Common Stock properly assert their
dissenters' rights of appraisal pursuant to applicable Law; or

 



 



 

 



   



 

(j) by the NCC Board if (i) the FFHI Board shall have withdrawn, or
adversely modified, or failed upon NCC's request to reconfirm its
recommendation of the Merger or this Agreement, (ii) the FFHI Board shall have
approved or recommended to the stockholders of FFHI that they approve an
Acquisition Proposal other than that contemplated by this Agreement, (iii)
FFHI fails to call the FFHI Stockholders' Meeting or otherwise breaches its
obligations in Section 8.4 hereof, or (iv) any Person (other than FFHI or an
Affiliate of FFHI) or group becomes the beneficial owner of 50% or more of the
outstanding shares of FFHI Common Stock; or

 



 

(k) by the FFHI Board if it concludes in good faith that an Acquisition
Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and (after consultation with outside
legal counsel) that failure to terminate this Agreement to enter into a
definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal would likely
result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided,
however_ , that the FFHI Board may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this Section 10.1(k) unless and until (i) FFHI shall have complied with the
terms of this Agreement; (ii) the FFHI Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with outside legal counsel) that such Superior Proposal has been
made and has not been withdrawn and continues to be a Superior Proposal after
taking into account all adjustments to the terms of this Agreement that may be
offered by NCC under this Section 10.1(k); (iii) the FFHI Board has given NCC
at least three (3) Business Days' prior written notice of its intention to
terminate this Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to
such Superior Proposal (which notice shall specify the material terms and
conditions of any such Superior Proposal, including the identity of the Person
making such Superior Proposal) and has contemporaneously provided to NCC a
detailed summary of the proposed terms from the Person making such Superior
Proposal; and (iv) FFHI has negotiated, and has caused its representatives to
negotiate, in good faith with NCC during such notice period (to the extent NCC
wishes to negotiate) to enable NCC to revise the terms of this Agreement such
that it would cause such Superior Proposal to no longer constitute a Superior
Proposal. In the event of any material change to the terms of such Superior
Proposal, FFHI shall, in each case, be required to deliver to NCC a new
written notice, the notice period shall recommence, and FFHI shall be required
to comply with its obligations under this Section 10.1(k) with respect to such
new written notice. Any termination under this Section 10.1(k) shall be
subject to NCC's receipt of the Termination Fee as set forth in Section
10.2(b) below, and if such amount is not received by NCC in accordance
therewith, any purported termination pursuant to this Section 10.1(k) shall be
null and void.

 



 

(l) by the FFHI Board if both of the following conditions are satisfied:

 



 

(i) the Average Quoted Price is less than $31.84 (calculated as 80% of the
Starting Price); and

 



 

(ii) the quotient obtained by dividing the Average Quoted Price by the
Starting Price is less than 80% of the quotient obtained by dividing the
Average Index Price on the Determination Date by $3,680.30 (calculated as the
Average Index Price on the Nasdaq trading day prior to the effective date of
this Agreement).

 



 



 

 



   



 

If the FFHI Board elects to exercise its termination right pursuant to the
immediately preceding sentence, it shall give prompt written notice thereof to
NCC at any time during the two (2) Business Day period commencing on the
Business Day following the Determination Date; provided that such notice of
election to terminate may be withdrawn at any time within the aforementioned
two (2) Business Day period. During the two (2) Business Day period commencing
on the Business Day following the day on which NCC receives such notice, NCC
shall have the option, but not the obligation, to increase the consideration
to be paid for each Stock Election Share by making a cash payment (as part of
the Merger consideration in addition to, and not in lieu of, the NCC Common
Stock into which such Stock Election Share is converted pursuant to Section
3.1(c) of this Agreement) for each Stock Election Share (the "Cash Payment Per
Stock Election Share") in an amount (rounded to the nearest cent) equal to the
product of (x) the Exchange Ratio and (y) the difference between (i) $31.84,
calculated as the amount representing 80% of the Starting Price, and (ii) the
Average Quoted Price; provided, however, that NCC shall not be permitted to
elect to make the Cash Payment Per Stock Election Share if making such cash
payments would preclude issuance of the opinions of counsel referred to in
Section 9.1(e).

 



 

If NCC makes this election within such two (2) Business Day period, it shall
give prompt written notice to FFHI of such election, whereupon no termination
shall have occurred pursuant to this Section 10.1(l), and this Agreement shall
remain in effect in accordance with its terms. If the Closing Date would
naturally occur during NCC's two (2) Business Day option period pursuant to
the terms of this Agreement, the Closing Date shall be extended until a date
selected by NCC no more than ten (10) Business Days following the close of
such two-day period (unless NCC does not exercise its option and the Agreement
is thereby terminated).

 



 

FFHI and the FFHI Subsidiaries shall not, and shall use their best efforts to
ensure that their respective executive officers, directors, and stockholders
who may be deemed an "affiliate" (as defined in SEC Rules 145 and 405) of FFHI
do not, purchase or sell on Nasdaq, or submit a bid to purchase or an offer to
sell on Nasdaq, directly or indirectly, any shares of NCC Common Stock or any
options, rights or other securities convertible into shares of NCC Common
Stock during the determination period for the Average Quoted Price.

 



 

For purposes of this Section 10.1(l), the following terms shall have the
meanings indicated:

 



 

"Average Index Price" on a given date means the price (rounded to two decimal
places) derived by adding the closing price of the Nasdaq Bank Index as
reported by Bloomberg LP (symbol: CBNK) on each of the ten (10) consecutive
Nasdaq trading days ending on such given date, and dividing such sum by ten
(10).

 



 

"Average Quoted Price" has the meaning defined in Section 11.1.

 



 

"Determination Date" means the Nasdaq trading day ending on the fifth (5th)
Business Day prior to the date of the Closing.

 



 

"Starting Price" means $39.80.

adjusted to reflect any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend
(including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into NCC
Common Stock, as applicable), reorganization, recapitalization,
reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other like change with
respect to the number of shares of NCC Common Stock outstanding after the date
hereof and prior to the Closing Date.

 



 



 

 



   



 

10.2 _Effect of Termination._

 



 

(a) In the event of a termination of this Agreement by either the NCC
Board or the FFHI Board as provided in Section 10.1, this Agreement shall
become void and there shall be no Liability or obligation on the part of NCC
or FFHI or their respective Subsidiaries or any of the officers or directors
of any of them, except that this Section 10.2 and Article 11 and Sections 8.2
(Access to Information) and 8.7 (Expenses) of this Agreement shall survive any
such termination; _provided, however_ , that nothing herein shall relieve any
breaching Party from Liability for an uncured willful breach of a
representation, warranty, covenant, obligation or agreement giving rise to
such termination.

 



 

(b) In the event that this Agreement is terminated (i) by the NCC Board
pursuant to Section 10.1(j), (ii) by the FFHI Board pursuant to Section
10.1(k), or (iii) otherwise by the FFHI Board at a time when the NCC Board or
NCC has grounds to terminate the Agreement pursuant to Section 10.1(j), then
FFHI shall, in the case of clause (i), two (2) Business Days after the date of
such termination or, in the case of clause (ii) or (iii), on the date of such
termination, pay to NCC, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, the
amount of $4,000,000.00 (the "Termination Fee").

 



 

(c) In the event that (i) after the date hereof and prior to the FFHI
Stockholders' Meeting, an Acquisition Proposal shall have been publicly
disclosed or any Person shall have publicly disclosed that, subject to the
Merger being disapproved by FFHI stockholders or otherwise rejected, it will
make an Acquisition Proposal with respect to FFHI, and thereafter this
Agreement is terminated by the NCC Board or the FFHI Board pursuant to Section
10.1(d)(ii), and (ii) concurrently with such termination or within nine (9)
months of such termination FFHI enters into a definitive agreement with
respect to such Acquisition Proposal or consummates such Acquisition Proposal,
then FFHI shall, upon the earlier of entering into a definitive agreement with
respect to such Acquisition Proposal or consummating an Acquisition Proposal,
pay to NCC, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, the Termination
Fee.

 



 

(d) FFHI acknowledges that the agreements contained in Sections 10.2(b)
and 10.2(c) are an integral part of the transactions provided for in this
Agreement, and that, without these agreements, NCC would not enter into this
Agreement; accordingly, if FFHI fails to promptly pay the amount due pursuant
to Section 10.2(b) or Section 10.2(c), as the case may be, and, in order to
obtain such payment, NCC commences a suit which results in a judgment for any
of the Termination Fee, FFHI shall pay NCC its costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys' fees) in connection with such suit.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, other than
in the case of a willful breach of this Agreement, the payment of the
Termination Fee pursuant to this Section 10.2 shall fully discharge FFHI from,
and be the sole and exclusive remedy of NCC with respect to, any and all
losses that may be suffered by them based upon, resulting from, or rising out
of the circumstances give rise to such termination of this Agreement. In no
event shall FFHI be required to pay the Termination Fee on more than one
occasion.

 



 



 

 



   



 

10.3 _Non-Survival of Representations and Covenants._ The respective
representations, warranties, obligations, covenants and agreements of the
Parties shall not survive the Effective Time, except for those covenants and
agreements contained in this Agreement which by their terms apply in whole or
in part after the Effective Time.

electronic means shall constitute effective execution and delivery of this
Agreement as to the Parties and may be used in lieu of the original Agreement

11.10 _Captions._ The captions as to contents of particular articles,
sections or paragraphs contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes
only and are not part of this Agreement.

 



 

11.11 _Enforcement of Agreement._ The Parties agree that irreparable
damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement
was not performed in accordance with its specific terms or was otherwise
breached. It is accordingly agreed that the Parties shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any court of the United States
or any state having jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other remedy
to which they are entitled at law or in equity. In any dispute or action
between the Parties arising out of this Agreement, including any Litigation,
arbitration, and appellate proceedings (and efforts to enforce the judgment,
award or other disposition of any of the same), the prevailing Party shall be
entitled to have and recover from the other Party all reasonable fees, costs
and expenses incurred in connection with such dispute or action (including
reasonable attorneys' fees).

 



 

11.12 _Severability._ Any term or provision of this Agreement that is
invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction,
be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without
rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this
Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of any of the terms or
provisions of this Agreement in any other jurisdiction. If any provision of
this Agreement is so broad as to be unenforceable, the provision shall be
interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable.

 



 

11.13 _Construction of Terms._ Where the context so requires or permits,
use of the singular form includes the plural, and the use of the plural form
includes the singular, and the use of any gender includes any and all genders.
Accounting terms used and not otherwise defined in this Agreement have the
meanings determined by, and all calculations with respect to accounting or
financial matters unless otherwise provided for herein shall be computed in
accordance with, generally accepted accounting principles consistently
applied. References herein to articles, sections, paragraphs, subparagraphs or
the like shall refer to the corresponding articles, sections, paragraphs,
subparagraphs or the like of this Agreement. The words "hereof," "herein," and
terms of similar import shall refer to this entire Agreement. Unless the
context clearly requires otherwise, the use of the terms "including,"
"included," "such as," or terms of similar meaning, shall not be construed to
imply the exclusion of any other particular elements.

 



 

11.14 _Schedules._ The disclosures in the Schedules to this Agreement
relate only to the representations and warranties in the Section of the
Agreement to which they expressly relate and not to any other representation
or warranty in this Agreement; provided, however, that a disclosure in a
particular Schedule shall also be deemed to qualify any other representation
and warranty to the extent that the relevance of such exception to such other
representation and warranty is reasonably apparent on the face of the
disclosure (without needing to examine underlying documentation) by cross-
referencing or otherwise. In the event of any inconsistency between the
covenants or statements in the body of this Agreement and those in the
Schedules (other than an exception expressly set forth as such in the
Schedules with respect to a specifically identified representation or
warranty), the covenants and statements in the body of this Agreement will
control.

 



 



 

 



   



 

11.15 _Exhibits and Schedules._ Each of the Exhibits and Schedules
attached hereto is an integral part of this Agreement and shall be applicable
as if set forth in full at the point in the Agreement where reference to it is
made.

 



 

11.16 _No Third Party Beneficiaries._ Except for (a) if the Effective
Time occurs, Section 8.14, which is intended to benefit each Indemnified Party
and his or her heirs and representatives, and (b) if the Effective Time
occurs, the right of the holders of FFHI Common Stock to receive the Merger
consideration payable pursuant to this Agreement, nothing in this Agreement,
expressed or implied, is intended to confer upon any Person, other than the
Parties or their respective successors, any right, remedies, obligations or
Liabilities under or by reason of this Agreement, except as expressly
contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

11.17 _Alternative Structure._ Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, at any time prior to or following the Effective
Time, NCC shall be entitled to revise the structure of the Bank Merger in
order to substitute a different NCC Subsidiary (or no NCC Subsidiary) in the
place of NBC, whereby FirstAtlantic Bank or such other NCC Subsidiary would be
the surviving bank upon consummation of the Bank Merger, or whereby the Bank

Section 368(a) of the Code, (ii) be capable of consummation in as timely a
manner as the Bank Merger provided for herein, and (iii) not otherwise be
prejudicial to the interests of FFHI's stockholders. This Agreement, the Bank
