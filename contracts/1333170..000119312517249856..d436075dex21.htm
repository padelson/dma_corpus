collectively, the " _Shares_ "), except as otherwise provided herein, shall be
converted into the right to receive $30.00 per Share, without interest, upon
the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement.

WHEREAS, the board of directors of the Company (the " _Company Board_ ") has,
on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, (i) determined

covenants and agreements in connection with the Merger and also prescribe
various conditions to the Transactions.

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements
contained in this Agreement and for other good and valuable consideration,
the receipt and adequacy of which are acknowledged, the Parties agree as
follows: ARTICLE I

 

THE MERGER

 

Section 1.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged
with and into the Company, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub
shall thereupon cease and the Company shall continue as the surviving
corporation in the Merger. The Merger shall have the effects provided in
this Agreement and as specified in the applicable provisions of the DGCL. For
purposes of this Agreement, (a) the Company, as the corporation surviving the
Merger after the Effective Time, is sometimes referred to as the "
_Surviving Corporation_ " and (b) the Company and Merger Sub are collectively
referred to as the " _Constituent Corporations_."

 

Section 1.2 _Closing; Effective Time_. The closing of the Merger (the "
_Closing_ ") shall take place at the offices of Robinson Bradshaw and Hinson,
P.A., 101 North Tryon Street, Suite 1900, Charlotte North Carolina at 10:00
a.m. Eastern Time, or at such other place, date and time, or in such other
manner, as Parent and the Company may agree in writing (including by
electronic exchange of Closing documents in lieu of an in-person Closing), as
promptly as practicable following, but in any event no later than the second
(2nd) Business Day after, the satisfaction or waiver of the last to
be satisfied or waived of the conditions set forth in _Article VI_ (other
than those conditions that by their nature cannot be satisfied until the
Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions). The
date on which the Closing occurs is the " _Closing Date_." Subject to the
provisions of this Agreement, at the Closing, the Company and Merger Sub shall
file or cause to be filed a certificate of merger (the " _Certificate of
Merger_ ") with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware with respect
to the Merger, in such form as required by, and executed and acknowledged in
accordance with, the relevant provisions of the DGCL, and the Parties shall
take all such further actions as may be required by Law to make the Merger
effective. The Merger shall become effective on the date and time of the
filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State
of Delaware or such later date and time as is agreed upon in writing by
Parent and the Company and specified in the Certificate of Merger (such date
and time, the " _Effective Time_ ").

 

Section 1.3 _Governing Documents; Directors and Officers_.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, the Company Certificate will, by virtue of the
Merger, be amended and restated in its entirety to read as set forth in
_Exhibit A_ and, as so amended and restated, shall be the Certificate of
Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or amended
as provided therein or by applicable Law;

 

(b) At the Effective Time, the Company Bylaws shall be amended and restated in
their entirety to read as set forth in _Exhibit B_ and, as so amended and
restated, shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter
changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law; and

 

(c) The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be the initial directors of the Surviving Corporation and each director shall
serve until such directors successor is elected and has qualified or until
the earlier death, resignation, removal or

 



2  disqualification of such director in accordance with the DGCL and the
Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation. The
Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause each director of
the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time to execute and deliver a
letter effectuating his or her resignation as a member of the Company Board to
be effective as of the Effective Time. The officers of the Merger Sub
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial officers of the
Surviving Corporation and each officer shall serve until such officers
successor is elected or appointed or until the earlier death, resignation,
removal or disqualification of such officer in accordance with the DGCL and
the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.

 

Section 1.4 _Conversion of Shares; Conversion of Merger Sub Common Stock_.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further
action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any stockholder of
the Company:

(i) any Shares then held by the Company (or held in the Companys treasury)
shall be canceled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be
delivered in exchange therefor;

(ii) any Shares then held by Parent, Merger Sub or any other wholly owned
Subsidiary of Parent shall be canceled and shall cease to exist, and no
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor;

 

(iii) except as provided in clauses (i) and (ii) above and subject to _Section
1.4(b)_, each Share then issued and outstanding (including any Company
Restricted Shares but not including any Dissenting Shares) shall be converted
into the right to receive a cash amount equal to $30.00, without interest
thereon (the " _Merger Consideration_ "), subject to any withholding of Taxes
required by applicable Law in accordance with _Section 1.8_; and

 

(iv) each share of common stock, $0.001 par value per share, of Merger Sub
then issued and outstanding shall be converted into one (1) fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

(b) At the Effective Time, all Shares converted pursuant to _Section
1.4(a)(iii)_ shall cease to be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled
and shall cease to exist, and each holder of any certificates evidencing such
Shares (the " _Certificates_ ") or non-certificated Shares represented by
book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to
receive the Merger Consideration therefor.

 

(c) If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the
outstanding Shares are changed into a different number or class of shares by
reason of any stock split, division or subdivision of shares, stock dividend,
reverse stock split, consolidation of shares, reclassification,
recapitalization or other similar transaction, then the Merger Consideration
shall be appropriately adjusted.

 



3 Section 1.5 _Surrender of Certificates_.

 

(a) Prior to the Closing, Parent shall designate a bank or trust company
reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ")
for the holders of Shares and to receive the funds to which holders of such
Shares shall become entitled pursuant to this Agreement. The agreement
pursuant to which Parent designates the Paying Agent shall be in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to the Company and Parent. Prior to the
Closing, Parent shall deposit or cause to be deposited with the Paying Agent
sufficient funds to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration payable in respect
of the Shares pursuant to _Section 1.4(a)(iii)_ (the " _Payment Fund_ ").
With respect to any Dissenting Shares, Parent shall only be required to
deposit or cause to be deposited with the Paying Agent funds sufficient to pay
the aggregate Merger Consideration payable in respect of such Dissenting
Shares if the holder thereof fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or
loses its right to appraisal under the DGCL. To the extent the Payment Fund
diminishes for any reason below the level required to make prompt payment of
the amounts described in the preceding sentences, Parent and Merger Sub shall,
or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, promptly replace or restore the
lost portion of such fund so as to ensure that it is maintained at a level
sufficient to make such payments. The Payment Fund shall be invested by the
Paying Agent as directed by Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) no such
investment or losses thereon shall relieve Parent from making the payments
required by this _Article I_ or affect the amount of Merger Consideration
payable in respect of the Shares and following any losses Parent shall
promptly provide additional funds to the Paying Agent in the amount of any
such losses, (ii) no such investment shall have maturities that could prevent
or delay payments to be made pursuant to this Agreement, and (iii) such
investments shall be in (A) short-term direct obligations of or guaranteed by
the United States of America, (B) short-term commercial paper obligations,
(C) certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers
acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $5 billion, or (D)
money market funds having a rating in the highest investment category granted
by a recognized credit rating agency at the time of investment. Any and all
interest or other amounts earned with respect to such funds shall be paid to
Parent or its designee, except as provided in _Section 1.5(c)_. The Payment
Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. The Surviving Corporation shall
(and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) pay all charges and
expenses, including those of the Paying Agent, in connection with the
exchange of Shares and the payment of the Merger Consideration in respect of
the Shares.

(b) Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any event within two (2)
Business Days thereafter), Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall cause
the Paying Agent to mail to each Person who was, immediately prior to the
Effective Time, a holder of record of Shares entitled to receive any Merger
Consideration pursuant to _Section 1.4(a)(iii)_ (i) a form of letter of
transmittal (which shall be in a form reasonably acceptable to the Company and
Parent and shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss
and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in _Section
1.5(f)_) to the Paying Agent) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as
provided in _Section 1.5(f)_) or Book-Entry Shares pursuant to such letter of
transmittal. Upon (A) surrender to the Paying Agent of Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in _Section 1.5(f)_), together
with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in
accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be
reasonably required pursuant to such instructions,

 



4  or (B) receipt of an "agents message" by the Paying Agent (or such other
evidence, if any, of transfer as the Paying Agent may reasonably request) in
the case of Book-Entry Shares, the holder of such Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares, as applicable, shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the
applicable Merger Consideration for each Share formerly evidenced by such
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, and such Certificates and
Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, shall then be canceled. No interest shall
accrue or be paid on the applicable Merger Consideration payable upon the
surrender of any Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for the benefit of the
holder thereof. If the payment of any Merger Consideration is to be made to a
Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificates
formerly evidencing Shares are registered on the stock transfer books of
the Company, it shall be a condition of payment that the Certificate so
surrendered shall be endorsed properly or otherwise be in proper form for
transfer and that the Person requesting such payment shall have paid all
transfer and other similar Taxes required by reason of the payment of the
applicable Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder
of the Certificate surrendered, or shall have established to the satisfaction
of the Surviving Corporation that such Taxes either have been paid or are not
applicable. Payment of the applicable Merger Consideration with respect to
Book-Entry Shares shall only be made to the Person in whose name such Book-
Entry Shares are registered.

 

(c) At any time following the date that is twelve (12) months after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the
Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds which had been made available to the
Paying Agent and not disbursed to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
(including all interest and other income received by the Paying Agent in
respect of all funds made available to it), and, thereafter, such holders
shall be entitled to look only to the Surviving Corporation (subject to
abandoned property, escheat and other similar Law) as general creditors
thereof with respect to the applicable Merger Consideration that may be
payable upon due surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares held by
them. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Surviving Corporation nor the
Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder of Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares for the applicable Merger Consideration delivered in respect of such
share to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or other similar Law. If any Certificate or Book-Entry Share has not
been surrendered or transferred prior to the date on which the applicable
Merger Consideration in respect thereof would otherwise escheat to or become
the property of any Governmental Entity, then any such Merger Consideration in
respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall become, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, the property of the Surviving Corporation, free
and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 

(d) No dividends or other distributions with respect to capital stock of the
Surviving Corporation with a record date on or after the Effective Time shall
be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificates or Book-Entry Shares.

(e) At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company with
respect to Shares shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further
registration of transfers of Shares on the records of the Company. From and
after the Effective Time, the holders of Shares outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such
Shares except as otherwise provided herein or by applicable Law. If, after the
Effective Time, any Certificate or Book-Entry Share is presented to
the Surviving Corporation, Parent or

 



5  the Paying Agent for surrender or transfer, as applicable, it shall be
canceled and, subject to compliance with this _Section 1.5_, exchanged for
the cash amount in immediately available funds to which the holder thereof is
entitled pursuant to this _Section 1.5_.

(f) If any Certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, then, upon the
making of an effective affidavit (in form and substance reasonably acceptable
to Parent and the Paying Agent) of that fact by the Person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed to the Paying Agent (and, if
required by Parent or the Paying Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond,
in such reasonable and customary amount and upon such terms as may be
reasonably required by Parent or the Paying Agent, as indemnity against any
claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate), Parent
shall cause the Paying Agent to issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate a check in the amount (after giving effect to any
required Tax withholdings as provided in _Section 1.8_) equal to the Merger
Consideration payable in respect of the Shares formerly represented by such
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate.

 

Section 1.6 _Appraisal Rights_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Shares
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, and held by holders who
are entitled to appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL and have
properly exercised and perfected their respective demands for appraisal of
such Shares in the time and manner provided in Section 262 of the DGCL and, as
of the Effective Time, have neither effectively withdrawn nor lost their
rights to such appraisal and payment under the DGCL (the " _Dissenting Shares_
"), shall not be converted into the right to receive Merger Consideration, but
shall, by virtue of the Merger, be entitled to only such consideration as
shall be determined pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL; _provided_ , that if
any such holder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively
withdrawn or lost such holders right to appraisal and payment under the
DGCL, such holders Shares shall be deemed to have been converted as of the
Effective Time into the right to receive, without interest, the Merger
Consideration (less any amounts entitled to be deducted or withheld pursuant
to _Section 1.8_), and such Shares shall not be deemed to be Dissenting
Shares. The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any written demands
for appraisal of any Shares or written withdrawals of such demands and any
other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company
relating to rights to be paid the "fair value" of Dissenting Shares, and (ii)
the right to participate in any negotiations with respect to demands for
appraisal under the DGCL. The Company shall not, except with the prior written
consent of Parent, voluntarily make or agree to make any payment with respect
to any demands for appraisals of capital stock of the Company, offer to
settle or settle any such demands, approve any withdrawal of any such demands,
or agree to do any of the foregoing. The Company shall provide each of the
holders of Shares with the notice contemplated by Section 262 of the DGCL as
part of the Proxy Statement.

(b) If the Surviving Corporation makes any payment with respect to the
Dissenting Shares, then any portion of the Merger Consideration relating to
such Dissenting Shares held in the Payment Fund shall be delivered by the
Paying Agent to the Surviving Corporation upon demand.

 



6 Section 1.7 _Treatment of Company Equity Awards and Company Equity Plans_.

 

(a) _Board Resolutions_. The Company Board (or, if appropriate, the committee
administering the applicable Company Equity Plan) has adopted resolutions
(true and correct copies of which have been provided to Parent and which
resolutions have not been rescinded or otherwise modified prior to the time of
execution of this Agreement) providing that each (i) option to acquire Shares
(each, a " _Company Stock Option_ "), (ii) restricted stock unit (each, a "
_Company RSU_ "), (iii) restricted Share (each, a " _Company Restricted Share_
"), and (iv) performance share (each, a " _Company Performance Share_ "), in
each case, granted under a Company Equity Plan (each, a " _Company Equity
Award_ " and collectively, " _Company Equity Awards_ "), to the extent
outstanding and unvested as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, and
whether or not then subject to any performance conditions, will, effective as
of immediately prior to, and contingent upon, the Effective Time, vest in
full, with any applicable performance conditions associated with any such
Company Equity Award deemed to have been achieved at maximum performance
levels.

(b) _Treatment of Company Stock Options_. At the Effective Time, each Company
Stock Option, to the extent outstanding and unexercised as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time, will, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the holder of the
Company Stock Option or any other Person, be canceled as of immediately prior
to the Effective Time, and, in exchange therefor, each former holder of each
such canceled Company Stock Option will be entitled to receive (without
interest), in consideration of the cancellation of such Company Stock Option,
an amount in cash (less applicable Tax withholdings pursuant to _Section
1.8_) equal to the product of (x) the total number of Shares subject to such
Company Stock Option as of immediately prior to the Effective Time
(determined, for the avoidance of doubt, after giving effect to the
accelerated vesting described in _Section 1.7(a)_), multiplied by (y) the
excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per Share
of such Company Stock Option. In the event that the exercise price of any
Company Stock Option is equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration,
such Company Stock Option shall be canceled, without any consideration being
payable in respect thereof, and have no further force or effect.

(c) _Treatment of Company RSUs_. At the Effective Time, each Company RSU that
is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company, the holder of the Company RSU or any other Person, be canceled as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time and, in exchange therefor, each former

or permit necessary for the consummation of the Transactions.

Subsidiaries properties, books or records by any Person in connection with a
Company Competing Proposal or a proposal or offer that would reasonably be
expected to lead to a Company Competing Proposal. Neither the Company nor any
Company Subsidiary shall, after the date of this Agreement, enter into any
confidentiality or similar agreement that would prohibit it from providing
such information to Parent.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 4.2_ to the contrary, at any
time prior to the time the Required Company Stockholder Vote is obtained, the
Company Board may (i) make

 



36  a Company Change of Recommendation in response to a Company Intervening
Event, or (ii) enter into a Superior Proposal Acquisition Agreement related to
a Company Superior Proposal, in each case, if and only if, with respect to
each of clauses (i) and (ii), the Company Board has determined in good faith
after consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel that the failure
to take such action would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the
Company Board to the Companys stockholders under applicable Laws of the State
of Delaware and the Company first complies with _Section 4.2(e)_.

 

(e) Prior to the Company taking any action (i) that is permitted under
_Section 4.2(d)(i)_, the Company shall provide Parent with three (3)
Business Days prior written notice advising Parent that it intends to effect
a Company Change of Recommendation and specifying, in reasonable detail, the
reasons therefor (including the material facts and circumstances related to
the applicable Company Intervening Event), and during such three (3) Business
Day period, (x) the Company shall negotiate, and cause its Representatives to
negotiate, with Parent and its Representatives in good faith (to the extent
Parent wishes to negotiate) to enable Parent to determine whether to propose
revisions to the terms of this Agreement such that it would obviate the need
for the Company Board to make a Company Change of Recommendation, (y) the
Company shall consider in good faith any proposal by Parent to amend the
terms and conditions of this Agreement in a manner that would obviate the need
for the Company Board to effect a Company Change of Recommendation and (z) at
the end of the three (3) Business Day period described above, and taking into
account any changes to this Agreement proposed by Parent to the Company, the
Company Board must have determined in good faith after consultation with the
Companys outside legal counsel that the failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Company Board to the Companys
stockholders under applicable Delaware Law even if such changes proposed by
Parent were given effect or (ii) that is permitted under _Section
4.2(d)(ii)_, the Company shall provide Parent with three (3) Business Days
prior written notice (it being understood and agreed that any change or
amendment to the financial terms of any Company Competing Proposal shall
require the Company to again comply with this _Section 4.2(e)_ and provide a
new notice and an additional two (2) Business Day period) advising Parent that
the Company Board intends to take such action and contemporaneously providing
to Parent a copy of the Company Superior Proposal, a copy of any proposed
Superior Proposal Acquisition Agreement for such Company Superior Proposal
(including any financing commitments related thereto) (or, in each case, if
not provided in writing to the Company or any of its Representatives, a
written summary of the terms thereof), and during such three (3) Business Day
period (or any subsequent two (2) Business Day period), (x) the Company shall
negotiate, and cause its Representatives to negotiate, with Parent and its
Representatives in good faith (to the extent Parent wishes to negotiate) to
enable Parent to determine whether to propose revisions to the terms of
this Agreement or any other agreement related to the Transactions such that
such Company Competing Proposal would no longer constitute a Company Superior
Proposal, (y) the Company shall consider in good faith any proposal by Parent
to amend the terms and conditions of this Agreement or any other agreement
related to the Transactions such that such Company Competing Proposal would no
longer constitute a Company Superior Proposal and (z) at the end of such three
(3) Business Day period (or any subsequent two (2) Business Day period), and
taking into account any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by
Parent to the Company, the Company Board must have determined in good faith,
after consultation with its outside financial advisors and outside legal
counsel, that such Company Competing Proposal would continue to constitute a
Company Superior Proposal even if such changes proposed by Parent were given
effect.

 



37 (f) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the
Company Board from (i) taking and disclosing to the Companys stockholders a
position contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) and promulgated under the
Exchange Act, (ii) making any public statement or taking any action if the
Company Board determines that the failure to make such public statement or
take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties of the
Company Board to the Companys stockholders under applicable Law, (iii) making
any "stop, look and listen" communication pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) of the
Exchange Act, or (iv) making any disclosure required under the Exchange Act or
the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder or the rules of NASDAQ;
_provided_ , _however_ , that nothing set forth in this _Section 4.2(f)_
shall be deemed to modify the definition of "Company Change of Recommendation"
or permit the Company Board to make a Company Change of Recommendation except
in compliance with  _Section 4.2(d)_ and _Section 4.2(e)._ To the extent
practicable, the Company will provide Parent with advance notice of, and
discuss the nature of, any such planned disclosure.

 

(g) References in this _Section 4.2_ to the "Company Board" shall include, to
the extent applicable, a duly authorized committee thereof.

(h) The Company agrees in the event any Company Subsidiary or any officer or
director of the Company or a Company Subsidiary takes any action which, if
taken by the Company, would constitute a breach of this _Section 4.2_, the
Company shall be deemed in breach of this _Section 4.2_.

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable, and in any event no later than thirty
(30) days after the date of this Agreement, the Company, in consultation with
Parent, shall prepare, and the Company shall file with the SEC, a preliminary
Proxy Statement. The Company shall give Parent reasonable opportunity to
review and comment on the initial preliminary Proxy Statement and all
subsequent forms or versions of or amendments to the Proxy Statement prior to
the filing thereof with the SEC or dissemination to the holders of Shares, and
the Company shall consider such comments (that are provided in a timely
manner) in good faith. Except to the extent there has been a Company Change

Statement and the definitive Proxy Statement and shall furnish to the Company
the information relating to it and Merger Sub required by the Exchange Act or
reasonably requested by the Company. The Company shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts, after consultation with Parent, to respond as promptly as
practicable to any comments of the SEC and to cause the Proxy Statement in
definitive form to be mailed to the Companys stockholders at the
earliest practicable time. Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall
promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the Proxy

 



38  Statement if and to the extent that it shall have become false or misleading

additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by Parent and its counsel.
The Proxy Statement shall comply in all material respects with all applicable
requirements of Law. The Parties agree that, notwithstanding the notice
provisions of this Agreement, communications with respect to the preliminary

comments, may be made on behalf of each Party by email through their
respective counsel. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this 
_Section 5.1_, and subject to _Section 4.2_, the Company may amend or
supplement the Proxy Statement following a Company Change of Recommendation to
modify the Company Board Recommendation without the prior consent of Parent.

record date for, call, give notice of, convene and hold a special meeting of
stockholders of the Company for the purpose of seeking the Required Company
Stockholder Vote and, to the extent required under applicable SEC rules, seek
the approval from the Companys stockholders on a non-binding, advisory basis
of certain compensation that may become payable to the Companys named
executed officers in connection with the completion of the Merger (the "
_Company Stockholders Meeting_ "). Except to the extent there has been a
Company Change of Recommendation in accordance with and subject to  _Section
4.2_, the Company Board shall recommend that the stockholders of the Company
vote in favor of adoption of this Agreement. At the Company Stockholders
Meeting, Parent will cause all Shares held of record by Parent or Merger Sub

vote thereon to vote in favor of adoption of this Agreement. The Company shall
comply in all material respects with Delaware Law, the Company Governing
Documents, the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations of NASDAQ in
connection with the Company Stockholders Meeting, including preparing and
delivering the Proxy Statement to the Companys stockholders as required
pursuant to the Exchange Act and  _Section 5.1(a)_. Except to the extent
there has been a Company Change of Recommendation in accordance with and
subject to _Section 4.2_, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to solicit from its stockholders proxies in favor of adoption of this
Agreement, and secure any other approval of stockholders of the Company that
is required by applicable Law in connection with the Merger; _provided_ , that
(i) the Company shall not change the date of, postpone or adjourn the Company
Stockholders Meeting without Parents prior written consent (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), except (x) to
ensure that any required supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement is
provided to the stockholders of the Company within a reasonable amount of time
in advance of the Company Stockholders Meeting, (y) if the Company Board
determines in good faith that it is necessary to do so in order to solicit
additional proxies in order to obtain the Required Company Stockholder

 



39  Vote, whether or not a quorum is present or (z) as may be required by
applicable Law; and (ii) Parent may cause the Company to postpone or adjourn
the Company Stockholders Meeting by prior written notice to the Company,
provided that Parent shall require no more than one (1) such postponement or
adjournment, which shall last no more than ten (10) Business Days. The Company
shall keep Parent updated with respect to proxy solicitation results as
reasonably requested by Parent. Unless this Agreement is terminated in
accordance with its terms, the Company shall not submit to the vote of its
stockholders any Company Competing Proposal and the obligation of the Company
to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold the Company Stockholders
Meeting and mail the Proxy Statement (and any amendment or supplement that may
be required by Law) to the Companys stockholders shall not be affected by a
Company Change of Recommendation; _provided_ , _however_ , that, subject to
_Section 5.1(a)_, if the public announcement of a Company Change of
Recommendation or the delivery of notice by the Company to Parent pursuant
to  _Section 4.2(e)_ occurs less than ten (10) Business Days prior to the
Company Stockholders Meeting, the Company shall be entitled to postpone the
Company Stockholders Meeting to a date not more than ten (10) Business Days
after such event.

Section 5.2 _Access; Confidentiality; Notice of Certain Events_.

 

(a) During the Pre-Closing Period, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,

normal business hours and upon reasonable advance notice to all of their
respective books, Contracts and records (including Tax Returns) and (ii)
furnish to Parent and its Representatives all information (financial or
otherwise) concerning its business, properties and personnel as Parent or its
Representatives may reasonably request. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the

(A) that the Company, the Company Subsidiaries or their respective
Representatives are prohibited from providing under the terms of a
confidentiality agreement with a third party entered into prior to the date of
this Agreement or entered into after the date of this Agreement in the
ordinary course of business and not otherwise in breach of this Agreement (
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain the required consent of such third party to such access or
disclosure or make appropriate substitute arrangements to permit reasonable
disclosure not in violation of any such confidentiality agreement), (B) the
disclosure of which would violate any applicable Law or legal duty (
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to make appropriate substitute arrangements to permit reasonable
disclosure not in violation of any such Law or duty) or (C) that would
jeopardize any attorney-client, attorney work product or other legal privilege
( _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to allow for such access or disclosure to the maximum extent that does
not result in a loss of any such attorney-client, attorney work product or
other legal privilege). Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
minimize any disruption to the businesses of the Company that may result from
the requests for access, data and information hereunder.

 

(b) Parent shall hold, and shall cause its Representatives and affiliates to
hold, any nonpublic information, including any information exchanged pursuant
to this _Section 5.2_, in confidence to the extent required by and in
accordance with, and shall otherwise comply with, the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement.

 



40 (c) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall give
prompt notice to the Company, (i) of any written notice or other
communication received by such Party from any Governmental Entity in
connection with this Agreement, the Merger or other Transactions, or from any
Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in
connection with the Merger or the other Transactions, if the subject matter of
such communication or the failure of such Party to obtain such consent could
be material to the Company, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, (ii) of any
Legal Proceeding commenced or, to any Partys knowledge, threatened against,
such Party or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates or otherwise relating to,
involving or affecting such Party or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates,
in each case in connection with, arising from or otherwise relating to this
Agreement, the Merger or other Transactions, (iii) of any notice or other
communication received by the Company from any Person requesting the convening
of a meeting of the stockholders of the Company and (iv) upon becoming aware
of the occurrence or impending occurrence of any event or circumstance
relating to it or any of the Company Subsidiaries which would reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this _Section 5.2(c)_ shall not
cure any breach of any representation or warranty requiring disclosure of such
matter prior to the date of this Agreement or otherwise limit or affect the
remedies available hereunder to any Party. The failure to deliver any such
notice shall not affect any of the conditions set forth in _Article VI_ or
give rise to any right to terminate under _Article VII_ , except for any such
failure that constitutes a Willful Breach of this Agreement.

Section 5.3  _Efforts to Consummate_.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions provided herein, the Parties shall use
their respective reasonable best efforts to promptly take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable under this Agreement and applicable Laws to consummate and
make effective as reasonably promptly as practicable after the date hereof
the Transactions, including (i) preparing and filing with the appropriate
Governmental Entities as reasonably promptly as practicable all applications,
notices, petitions, filings, ruling requests, and other documents necessary

Governmental Entities in order to consummate the Transactions (collectively,
the " _Governmental Approvals_ ") and (ii) as reasonably promptly as
practicable taking all steps as may be necessary to obtain all such
Governmental Approvals. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing,

other filings that are required to be made in order to consummate the
Transactions pursuant to other applicable Laws. Each Party further agrees that

Law, or enter into any agreement with the FTC, the DOJ, any other Governmental
Entity, or any other party to delay or not to consummate the Transactions,
except with the prior written consent of the other Party. Each Party
further agrees that it will supply as promptly as practicable any additional
information or documentation that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act or
any other Law and use its reasonable best efforts to take all other actions
necessary, proper or advisable to cause the expiration or termination of the
applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act and any other Law as soon as
possible, including promptly complying with any "second request" for
information or similar request from the FTC, DOJ, or other Governmental
Entity.

 



41 (b) In connection with the actions referenced in _Section 5.3(a)_ to obtain
all Governmental Approvals for the Transactions under the HSR Act and any
other Laws, each of Parent and the Company shall (i) cooperate in all respects
with the other in connection with any communication, filing or submission and
in connection with any investigation or other inquiry, including any
proceeding initiated by a private party; (ii) keep the other Party and/or its
counsel promptly informed of any communication received by such Party from, or
given by such Party to, the FTC, the DOJ or any other U.S. or other
Governmental Entity and of any communication received or given in connection
with any proceeding by a private party, in each case regarding any of the
Transactions; (iii) to the extent practicable, consult with each other in
advance of any scheduled meeting or conference with the FTC, the DOJ or any
other Governmental Entity or, in connection with any proceeding by a private
party, with any other Person, and to the extent permitted by the FTC, the
DOJ or any other Governmental Entity or other Person, give the other Party
and/or its counsel the opportunity to attend and participate in such meetings
and conferences; and (iv) permit the other Party and/or its counsel to review
in advance any submission, filing or communication (and documents submitted
therewith) intended to be given by it to the FTC, the DOJ or any other
Governmental Entity; provided that Parent and the Company may, as each deems
advisable and necessary, reasonably designate any competitively sensitive
material to be provided to the other under this _Section 5.3(b)_ as
restricted information to be shared only with such Persons or its outside
counsel and subject to such terms as provided in the Confidentiality
Agreement.

(c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the Parties
contained in  _Section 5.3(a)_ and _Section 5.3(b)_, with regard to any
Governmental Entity that regulates administers or enforces any Laws related to
antitrust, competition, fair trade or similar matters, neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates shall, without Parents written
consent, in Parents sole discretion, discuss or commit to any divestiture
transaction, or discuss or commit to alter their businesses or commercial
practices in any way, or otherwise take or commit to take any action that
limits Parents freedom of action with respect to, or Parents ability to
retain any of the businesses, product lines or assets (whether tangible or
intangible) of, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates ("
_Company Assets_ ") or otherwise receive the full benefits of this Agreement
Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, in no event shall the Parent be obligated to (i) litigate against a
Governmental Entity or (ii) divest or hold separate, to enter into any
licensing or similar arrangement, or take any other action with respect to,
any assets (whether tangible or intangible) or operations relating to any
business of the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates or any of the
Company Assets, provided, however, that, to the extent any actions described
in clause (ii) are necessary to obtain regulatory clearance, Parent agrees
to divest or take other appropriate actions related to the Scheduled Assets.

(d) Subject to Parents undertakings pursuant to this  _Section 5.3_, the
final determination of the appropriate strategy and course of action with
respect to the actions contemplated in this _Section 5.3_ shall be made by
Parent; provided, however, that Parent shall keep the Company apprised of its
strategy and course of action and shall give the Company reasonable
opportunity to comment on such strategy and course of action, and Parent shall

 



42  consider such comments (that are provided in a timely manner) in good faith.
Parent shall be permitted to take the lead in all joint meetings and
communications with any Governmental Entity in connection with obtaining any
necessary Governmental Approvals pursuant to this _Section 5.3_. Parent
agrees that, at any time in an investigation, if a Governmental Entity
suggests or proffers a settlement of the investigation to permit the
Transactions to close, Parent shall promptly (and in any event within one (1)
Business Day) communicate the terms of the offer to the Company. Parent, in
its sole discretion, may accept or reject any settlement of the investigation
proposed by any Governmental Entity, provided that Parent complies with its
obligations under this _Section 5.3_.

(e) Subject to the conditions outlined in this _Section 5.3_ or as otherwise
required by applicable Law, the Parties shall not, and shall cause each of
their respective Subsidiaries not to, take (or permit their respective
Representatives to take) any action or fail to take any action that is
intended to, or would reasonably be expected to, individually or in the
aggregate, result in any of the conditions to the Merger not being satisfied
or prevent, materially delay, or materially impede the ability of the
Company, Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the Merger.

Section 5.4 _Publicity_. So long as this Agreement is in effect, neither the
Company nor Parent, nor any of their respective affiliates or Representatives,
shall issue or cause the publication of any press release or other public
announcement with respect to the Merger or this Agreement without the prior
written consent of the other Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed, unless such Party determines, after
consultation with outside counsel, that it is required by applicable Law or by
any listing agreement with or the listing rules of a national securities
exchange or trading market to issue or cause the publication of any press
release or other public announcement with respect to the Merger or this
Agreement, in which event such Party shall endeavor, on a basis reasonable
under the circumstances, to provide a meaningful opportunity to the other
Party to review and comment upon such press release or other announcement as
far in advance as practicable and shall give due consideration to all
reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that without limiting any of its obligations under _Section 4.2_,
the Company shall not be required by this _Section 5.4_ to provide any
such review or comment to Parent in connection with a Company Change of
Recommendation, and Parent shall not be required to provide any such review
and comment to the Company in connection with a Company Change of
Recommendation; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that each Party and their
respective affiliates or Representatives may make statements that are not
inconsistent with previous press releases, public disclosures or public
statements made by Parent or the Company in compliance with this _Section
5.4_ (so long as such disclosure is still accurate).

Section 5.5 _Directors  and Officers Insurance and Indemnification_. For
not less than six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to indemnify and hold harmless all past and
present directors and officers of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
(collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") against any costs or expenses
(including advancement of expenses to the extent provided in the Company
Governing Documents), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities
and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any actual or threatened
claim, action, investigation, suit or proceeding in respect of acts or
omissions occurring or alleged to have occurred at or prior to the Effective
Time (including acts or omissions occurring in connection with the adoption
of this Agreement,

 



43  the consummation of the Merger or the consummation of any of the other
Transactions), whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective
Time, in connection with such persons serving as an officer or director of
the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or serving at the request of
the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries as a director, officer,
employee or agent of another Person, to the fullest extent provided pursuant
to the Company Governing Documents or the organizational documents of any
Company Subsidiary or any other agreement, if any, in existence on the date of
this Agreement. The Parties agree that for six (6) years after the Effective
Time all rights to elimination or limitation of liability, indemnification
and advancement of expenses for acts or omissions occurring or alleged to have
occurred at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior
to, at or after the Effective Time, now existing in favor of the Indemnified
Parties as provided in the Company Governing Documents or the organizational
documents of any Company Subsidiary or any other agreement shall survive the
Merger and shall continue in full force and effect. Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to provide, for an aggregate period of not less than six
(6) years from the Effective Time, the Companys current directors and
officers an insurance and indemnification policy that provides coverage for
events occurring prior to the Effective Time (the " _D andO Insurance_") that is
no less favorable than the Companys existing policy as of the date of this
Agreement or, if insurance coverage that is no less favorable is unavailable,
the best available coverage; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Surviving
Corporation shall not be required to pay an annual premium for the DandO
Insurance in excess of three hundred percent (300%) of the last annual
premium paid prior to the date of this Agreement as set forth in _Section
2.16_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule or, if less, the cost of a policy
providing coverage on the same terms as the Companys existing policy as of
the date of this Agreement; _provided_ , _further_ , that, at the Companys
option, in lieu of the foregoing insurance coverage, the Company or Surviving
Corporation may at or prior to the Effective Time substitute therefor
a single premium tail coverage with respect to DandO Insurance with an annual
cost not in excess of three hundred percent (300%) of the last annual premium
paid prior to the date of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything in this 
_Section 5.5_ to the contrary, if any Indemnified Party notifies Parent on or
prior to the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time of a matter in
respect of which such Person may seek indemnification pursuant to this 
_Section 5.5_, the provisions of this _Section 5.5_ that require the
Surviving Corporation to indemnify and advance expenses shall continue in
effect with respect to such matter until the final disposition of all claims,
actions, investigations, suits and proceedings relating thereto. In the event
Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be
the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets
to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so
that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as
the case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this _Section
5.5_. The rights and obligations under this _Section 5.5_ shall survive
consummation of the Merger and, following the Effective Time, shall not be
terminated or amended in a manner that is adverse to any Indemnified Party
without the written consent of such Indemnified Party. The provisions of this
_Section 5.5_ are intended to be, following the Effective Time, for the
benefit of, and shall be Enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, his or her
heirs and his or her legal representatives.

 

Section 5.6 _Takeover Statutes_. The Parties shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, use reasonable best efforts to (a) take all action necessary
so that no Takeover Statute or, in

 



44  the case of the Company, any similar provision of the Company Governing
Documents, is or becomes applicable to the Merger or any of the other
Transactions and (b) if any such Takeover Statute or, in the case of the
Company, any similar provision of the Company Governing Documents, is or
becomes applicable to any of the foregoing, to take all action necessary so
that the Merger and the other Transactions may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to
eliminate or minimize the effect of such Takeover Statute on the Merger and
the other Transactions.

 

Section 5.7 _Obligations of Merger Sub_. Subject to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement, Parent shall (i) as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub,
duly execute and deliver to Merger Sub a written consent adopting this
Agreement immediately following the execution and delivery of this Agreement,
and (ii) take all action necessary to cause each of Merger Sub and the
Surviving Corporation to perform their respective obligations under this
Agreement and to cause Merger Sub to consummate the Transactions, including
the Merger, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement.

 

Section 5.8 _Employee Benefits Matters_.

 

(a) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, assume, honor
and fulfill all Company Benefit Plans and agreements between the Company or
any Company Subsidiary, on the one hand, and any current or former employee,
director or consultant, on the other hand, in accordance with their terms as
in effect immediately prior to the date of this Agreement or as entered into
or amended after the date of this Agreement as specifically permitted or
required by this Agreement (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, the Company
Equity Plans and ESPP). For a period of one (1) year following the Effective
Time, Parent shall provide, or cause to be provided, to those employees of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary who continue to be employed by Parent or
the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries following
the Effective Time, during their period of active employment by the Surviving
Corporation (or any affiliate thereof) during such one (1) year period (the "
_Continuing Employees_ ") (i) (x) base salary (or wages) and (y) annual cash
bonus opportunities that, in each case, are not less favorable than those
provided by the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii)
employee benefits (excluding equity or equity-based compensation) that, in the
aggregate, are substantially comparable to those provided by the Company
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(b) With respect to any accrued but unused personal, sick or vacation time to
which any Continuing Employee is entitled pursuant to the personal, sick or
vacation policies applicable to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to
the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
and instruct its affiliates to, as applicable (and without duplication of
benefits), assume the liability for such accrued personal, sick or vacation
time and, allow such Continuing Employee to use such accrued personal, sick
or vacation time in accordance with the practice and policies of the Company
as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 

(c) Parent agrees that all Continuing Employees shall be immediately eligible
to continue to participate in the Surviving Corporations health and welfare
benefit plans (to the same extent such Continuing Employees were eligible to
participate under the Companys health

 



45  and welfare benefit plans immediately prior to the Effective Time);
_provided_ , _however_ , that (i) nothing in this _Section 5.8_ or elsewhere
in this Agreement shall limit the right of Parent or the Surviving
Corporation to amend or terminate any such health or welfare benefit plan or
migrate the Continuing Employees to a successor health or welfare benefit plan
at any time (subject to compliance with  _Section 5.8(a)_) and (ii) if
Parent or the Surviving Corporation terminates any such health or welfare
benefit plan or migrates the Continuing Employees to a successor health or
welfare benefit plan, then the Continuing Employees shall be immediately
eligible to participate in the Surviving Corporations health and welfare
benefit plans for similarly situated employees to the extent that coverage
under such plans is replacing comparable coverage under a health and welfare
benefit plan in which such Continuing Employee participated immediately before
the Effective Time. To the extent that service is relevant for eligibility,
vesting or allowances (including paid time off) under any employee benefit
plan, program or arrangement of Parent or any of its affiliates, then Parent
shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i) waive all limitations as to pre-
existing conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to
participation and coverage requirements applicable to the Continuing
Employees, to the extent that such conditions, exclusions and waiting periods
would not apply under a similar employee benefit plan in which such employees
participated immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) ensure that any
new health or welfare benefit plan shall, for purposes of eligibility,
deductibles, co-payments and out-of-pocket maximums and allowances (including
paid time off), credit Continuing Employees for service and amounts paid
immediately prior to the commencement of participation in such new health or
welfare benefit plan to the same extent that such service and amounts paid
were recognized prior to such commencement of participation under the
corresponding health or welfare benefit plan of the Company, and (iii) cause
service rendered to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries (or any
predecessor) to be credited to the same extent as such service was recognized
under a similar employee benefit plan in which such employees participated
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(d) At the request of Parent made at least ten (10) Business Days prior to
the Closing Date, the Company Board (or the appropriate committee thereof)
shall adopt resolutions and take such corporate action as is necessary to
terminate any 401(k) plans maintained by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Company 401(k) Plans_ "), effective as
of the day prior to the Closing Date and contingent upon the consummation of
the Merger. The Company shall provide Parent with a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment on such resolutions and any documents prepared in
connection with such corporate actions prior to the adoption of such
resolutions or taking of such actions. Following the Effective Time and as
soon as practicable following the termination of the Company 401(k) Plans,
the assets thereof shall be distributed to the participants. Parent or the
Surviving Corporation shall permit the Continuing Employees who are then
actively employed to make rollover contributions of "eligible rollover
distributions" (within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code),
including loans, in the form of cash or promissory notes, in an amount equal
to the full account balance (including loans) distributed to such Continuing
Employees from the Company 401(k) Plans to Parents or the Surviving
Corporations applicable 401(k) plan.

(e) Nothing in this _Section 5.8_ or elsewhere in this Agreement shall
confer upon any Continuing Employee any right to continue in the employ or
service of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any affiliate of Parent, or
shall interfere with or restrict in any way the rights of Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any affiliate of Parent, which rights are hereby
expressly

 



46  reserved, to discharge or terminate the services of any Continuing Employee
at any time for any reason whatsoever, with or without cause, except to the
extent expressly provided otherwise in a written agreement between Parent,
the Surviving Corporation, the Company or any affiliate of Parent and the
Continuing Employee or any severance, benefit or other applicable plan or
program covering such Continuing Employee. Notwithstanding any provision in
this Agreement to the contrary, nothing in this _Section 5.8_ shall (i) be
deemed or construed to be an amendment or other modification of any Company
Benefit Plan or employee benefit plan of Parent or Merger Sub, (ii) create
any third party rights in any Person or (iii) alter or limit the ability of
the Surviving Corporation, Parent or any of their respective affiliates to
amend, modify or terminate any Company Benefit Plan or other employee benefit
program, agreement or arrangement at any time assumed, established, sponsored
or maintained by any of them.

(f) The provisions of this _Section 5.8_ are solely for the benefit of the
Parties to this Agreement and no current or former employee or any other
individual associated therewith shall be regarded for any purpose as a third
party beneficiary of the Agreement or have the right to enforce the
provisions hereof.

(g) The Company shall provide Parent with a copy of any material
written communications intended for broad-based and general distribution to
any current or former employees of the Company or any Company Subsidiary if
such communications relate to any of the Transactions, and, to the extent
practicable, shall provide Parent with a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment on such communications prior to distribution; provided that the
Company may make written communications to current or former employees without
Parents prior review to the extent such communications are consistent with
previous press releases, public disclosures or public statements made by
Parent or the Company in compliance with _Section 5.4_ (so long as such
disclosure is still accurate).

 

Section 5.9 _Security Holder Litigation_. Each Party shall provide the other
Party prompt oral notice (but in any event within two (2) Business Days) of
any litigation brought or threatened by any stockholder of that Party against
such Party, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective directors or
officers relating to the Merger, this Agreement or any of the Transactions.
The Company shall give Parent the opportunity to participate (at Parents
expense) in the defense, prosecution or settlement of any such litigation, and
the Company shall not offer to settle any such litigation, nor shall any
such settlement be agreed to without Parents prior written consent, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned; provided
that the Company shall be permitted to settle any such litigation without
Parents consent to the extent such settlement only requires the Company to
provide additional disclosure. In the event of, and to the extent of, any
conflict or overlap between the provisions of this _Section 5.9_ and _Section
4.1_ or  _Section 5.3_, the provisions of this _Section 5.9_ shall control.

Section 5.10 _Delisting_. Each of the Parties agrees to cooperate with the
other Parties in taking, or causing to be taken, all actions necessary to
delist the Shares from NASDAQ and terminate its registration under the
Exchange Act, provided that such delisting and termination shall not be
effective until after the Effective Time.

Section 5.11 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
and Parent shall take such steps as may be necessary to cause any dispositions
of equity securities of the

 



47  Company (including derivative securities with respect to equity securities
of the Company) pursuant to the Transactions by each officer or director of
the Company who is subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act to be exempt
under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

failure of such other representations and warranties to not be so true and
correct would not reasonably be expected to result, individually or in the
aggregate, in a Parent Material Adverse Effect (it being understood that, for
purposes of determining the accuracy of such representations and warranties,
(A) all " _Parent Material Adverse Effect_ " qualifications and other
materiality qualifications contained in such representations and warranties
shall be disregarded and (B) the truth and correctness of those

ARTICLE VII

Section 7.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated, and the Merger

(a) at any time prior to the Effective Time, by mutual written consent of
Parent and the Company;

(b) at any time prior to the Effective Time, by either Parent or the Company,

Governmental Entity has issued a final and nonappealable order, decree or
ruling, or has taken any other action, having the effect of permanently
restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the Merger or making
consummation of the Merger illegal; _provided_ that the right to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 7.1(b)_ shall not be available to a
Party whose breach of _Section 5.3_ was the primary cause of, or resulted
in, the issuance of order, decree or ruling or taking of such action;

(c) at any time prior to the Effective Time, by Parent, by written notice to

50 (d) at any time prior to the Effective Time, by either Parent or the Company,
by written notice to the other, if the Effective Time has not occurred on or
prior to the close of business on August 7, 2018 (the " _End Date_ ");
_provided_ _however_ , that a Party shall not be permitted to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 7.1(d)_ if a breach by such Party
of any provision of this Agreement shall have been the primary cause of, or
resulted in, such event; _provided_ _further_ , _however_ , that the End
Date may be extended for a period not to exceed ninety (90) days, at the sole
discretion of Parent, by written notice to the Company if on the End Date the
conditions set forth in _Section 6.1(c)_ have not been satisfied (but
remain capable of being satisfied) but all of the other conditions set forth
in _Article VI_ have been satisfied or waived (other than those conditions
that by their nature cannot be satisfied until the Closing Date, which
conditions shall remain capable of being satisfied or waived) as of such date
if the Closing were otherwise to occur on such date and the condition set
forth in _Section 6.1(c)_ remains capable of being satisfied, at which point
the extended date will serve as the End Date under this Agreement; and
_provided_ _further_ , _however_ , that the End Date may be extended for a
second period not to exceed ninety (90) days at the sole discretion of Parent,
by written notice to the Company if on the End Date (i) the conditions set

being satisfied) but all of the other conditions set forth in _Article VI_
have been satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that by their
nature cannot be satisfied until the Closing Date, which conditions shall
remain capable of being satisfied or waived) as of such date if the Closing
were otherwise to occur on such date and the condition set forth in _Section
6.1(c)_ remains capable of being satisfied, and (ii) Parent is, immediately
prior to the scheduled expiration of the first extension, engaged in
litigation with a Governmental Entity regarding antitrust
regulatory clearance, at which point the extended date will serve as the End
Date under this Agreement; provided that if (A) Parent (x) voluntarily
withdraws from such litigation and (y) at the time of such withdrawal, such
litigation has not been conclusively resolved in a manner that permits
consummation of the Merger, or (B) such litigation has been definitively
concluded in a manner that does not permit consummation of the Merger, the
date of such cessation or definitive conclusion will serve as the End Date;

(e) at any time prior to obtaining the Required Company Stockholder Vote, by
the Company, by written notice to Parent, to accept a Company Superior
Proposal and enter into the Superior Proposal Acquisition Agreement relating
to such Company Superior Proposal, if the Company has complied with, and the
Company Board, or a duly authorized committee thereof, has authorized the
Company to enter into a Superior Proposal Acquisition Agreement in compliance
with, _Section 4.2_ (including _Section 4.2(e)(ii)_); provided that such
termination shall not be effective and the Company shall not enter into any
such agreement, unless the Company pays the Termination Fee concurrently with
such termination in accordance with _Section 7.2(b)(i)_;

 

(f) at any time prior to the Effective Time, by Parent, by written notice to
the Company, if a breach of any representation or warranty or failure to
perform any covenant or obligation contained in this Agreement on the part of
the Company has occurred that would cause a failure of the conditions in
_Sections 6.2(a)_ or _6.2(b)_ to be satisfied; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,
that, for purposes of this _Section 7.1(f)_, if such a breach is curable by
the Company by the earlier

 



51  of the End Date and thirty (30) days following the date on which Parent
gives the Company notice of such breach and the Company is continuing to use
commercially reasonable efforts to cure such breach, then Parent may not
terminate this Agreement under this _Section 7.1(f)_ on account of such
breach unless such breach remains uncured upon the earlier of the End Date and
the expiration of such thirty (30)-day period;

 

(g) at any time prior to the Effective Time, by the Company, by written notice
to Parent, if a breach of any representation or warranty or failure to
perform any covenant or obligation contained in this Agreement on the part of
Parent that would cause a failure of the conditions in _Section 6.3(a)_ or
_Section 6.3(b)_ to be satisfied; _provided_ , _however_ , that, for purposes
of this _Section 7.1(g)_, if such a breach is curable by Parent by the
earlier of the End Date and thirty (30) days following the date on which the
Company gives Parent notice of such breach and Parent is continuing to use
commercially reasonable efforts to cure such breach, then the Company may not
terminate this Agreement under this _Section 7.1(g)_ on account of such
breach unless such breach remains uncured upon the earlier of the End Date and
the expiration of such thirty (30)-day period; or

(h) by either the Company or Parent, by written notice to the other, if the
Required Company Stockholder Vote shall not have been obtained upon a vote
taken thereon at the Company Stockholders Meeting, including any adjournment
or postponement thereof.

 

Section 7.2 _Effect of Termination_.

 

(a) In the event of the termination of this Agreement as provided in _Section
7.1_, the written notice thereof shall be given by the terminating Party to
the other Party or Parties shall specify the provision hereof pursuant to
which such termination is made, and this Agreement shall forthwith become null
and void and there shall be no liability on the part of Parent, Merger Sub or
the Company, except that the Confidentiality Agreement, this _Section 7.2_
and _Article VIII_ shall survive such termination; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that nothing herein shall relieve any Party from liability for fraud or a
Willful Breach of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set
forth in this Agreement prior to such termination; provided further, that
nothing in this Agreement shall limit any rights, obligations or remedies that
any Party may have under the Confidentiality Agreement for matters arising
before or after the termination of this Agreement.

(b) _Termination Fee_.

(i) If Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(c)_ or the
Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(e)_, the Company
shall pay or cause to be paid to Parent a fee of $60.0 million in cash (the "
_Termination Fee_ "), in the case of a termination of this Agreement by the
Company pursuant to  _Section 7.1(e)_, prior to or concurrently with such
termination by the Company and in the case of a termination by this Agreement
by Parent pursuant to _Section 7.1(c)_, within five (5) Business Days after
such termination. 

(ii) If (A) Parent or the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 7.1(d)_ or  _Section 7.1(h)_ or if Parent terminates this
Agreement pursuant to

 



52   _Section 7.1(f)_, (B) a Company Competing Proposal shall have been
publicly disclosed and such Company Competing Proposal shall not have been
publicly withdrawn at least ten (10) days prior to the date of such
termination, and (C) within twelve (12) months of such termination (1) the
Company consummates any Company Competing Proposal or (2) the Company enters
into a definitive agreement providing for any Company Competing Proposal,
then the Company shall pay or cause to be paid to Parent the Termination Fee
within five (5) Business Days after the earlier of entering into any
definitive agreement providing for a Company Competing Proposal
or consummation of any Company Competing Proposal; provided that the Company
shall not be required to pay the Termination Fee if (x) this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to _Section 7.1(d)_ and (y) Parent is obligated to pay
the Reverse Termination Fee pursuant to _Section 7.2(c)_.

(iii) In the event any amount is payable pursuant to this  _Section 7.2(b)_,
such amount shall be paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds to
an account designated in writing by Parent. In the event that Parent or its
designee shall receive full payment pursuant to this  _Section 7.2(b)_, the
receipt of the Termination Fee shall be Parents sole and exclusive remedy
under this Agreement and shall be deemed to be liquidated damages for any and
all losses or damages suffered or incurred by Parent, Merger Sub, any of
their affiliates or any other Person in connection with this Agreement (and
the termination hereof), the Transactions (and the abandonment thereof) or any
matter forming the basis for such termination, and none of Parent, Merger Sub
or any of their respective affiliates or any other Person shall be entitled to
bring or maintain any claim, action or proceeding against the Company or any
of its affiliates arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, any of
the Transactions or any matters forming the basis for such termination;
provided that the foregoing limitation shall not apply in the event of any
losses or damages incurred or suffered by Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
affiliates as a result of a breach of this Agreement by the Company or any of
its affiliates involving fraud or a Willful Breach.

(iv) For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the Company be obligated
to pay the Termination Fee on more than one (1) occasion.

 

(c) Reverse Termination Fee. If the Company or Parent terminates this
Agreement pursuant to (i) _Section 7.1(d)_ or (ii) _Section 7.1(b)_ (to
the extent that such restraint arises under any antitrust Laws), and in the
case of (i) or (ii), all of the conditions under _Section 6.1(a)_,  _Section
6.1(b)_ (except to the extent that such restraint arises under any antitrust
Laws) and _Section 6.2_ have been satisfied or waived, other than any such
conditions which by their nature cannot be satisfied until the Closing Date
so long as such conditions could be satisfied if the Closing Date were the
date of termination of this Agreement, then Parent shall pay or cause to be
paid to the Company a fee of $100.0 million by wire transfer of same-day funds
no later than five (5) Business Days after such termination (the "Reverse
Termination Fee"). In the event that the Company or its designee shall receive
full payment pursuant to this _Section 7.2(c)_, the receipt of the
Reverse Termination Fee shall be the Companys sole and exclusive remedy
under this Agreement and shall be deemed to be liquidated damages for any and
all losses or damages suffered or incurred by the Company, any of its
affiliates or any other Person in connection with this Agreement (and the
termination hereof), the Transactions (and the abandonment thereof) or any
matter forming the basis for such termination, and none of the Company or any
of its 

 



53  affiliates or any other Person shall be entitled to bring or maintain any
claim, action or proceeding against Parent or any of its affiliates arising
out of or in connection with this Agreement, any of the Transactions or any
matters forming the basis for such termination; provided that the foregoing
limitation shall not apply in the event of any losses or damages incurred or
suffered by the Company or any of its affiliates in the case of breach of
this Agreement by Parent, Merger Sub or any of their affiliates involving
fraud or a Willful Breach; provided that nothing in this _Section 7.2(c)_
shall limit any rights, obligations or remedies that any Party may have under
the Confidentiality Agreement for matters arising before or after the
termination of this Agreement.

(d) Each of the Parties acknowledges that the agreements contained in this
_Section 7.2_ are an integral part of the Transactions and that neither of
the Termination Fee nor the Reverse Termination Fee is a penalty, but rather
each is a reasonable amount that shall compensate Parent and Merger Sub, in
the case of the Termination Fee, or the Company, in the case of the Reverse
Termination Fee, in the circumstances in which such payment is payable for the
efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating
this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the
consummation of the Transactions, which amount would otherwise be impossible
to calculate with precision.

Section 8.5 _Interpretation_. When a reference is made in this Agreement to
Sections, such reference shall be to a Section of this Agreement unless
otherwise indicated. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including"
are used in this Agreement they shall be deemed to be followed by the words
"without limitation" or "but not limited to." As used in this Agreement, the
terms "affiliates" and "associates" shall have the meanings set forth in Rule
12b-2 of the Exchange Act. The table of contents and headings set forth in
this Agreement are for convenience of reference purposes only and shall not
affect or be deemed to affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of
this Agreement or any term or provision hereof. Any definition of or reference
to any Contract herein shall be construed as referring to such Contract as
from time to time amended, supplemented or otherwise modified (except for any
Contracts required to be included on the Company Disclosure Schedule). When
reference is made herein to a Person, such reference shall be deemed to
include all direct and indirect Subsidiaries, successors and assigns of such
Person unless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires. All
references herein to the Subsidiaries of a Person shall be deemed to include
all direct and indirect Subsidiaries of such Person unless otherwise indicated
or the context otherwise requires. The Parties agree that they have been
represented by counsel during the negotiation and execution of this Agreement
and, therefore, waive the application of any Law, holding or rule of
construction providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other document
shall be construed against the Party drafting such agreement or document. The
words "hereof,"

 



56  "herein," "hereinafter" and "hereunder" and words of similar import when

particular provision of this Agreement, unless the context requires
otherwise. The term "or" has the inclusive meaning represented by the phrase

Parents Representatives for their review by posting to the electronic data
room used in connection with this Agreement. The listing of any matter on

admission by the Company, or to otherwise imply, that any such matter is
material, is outside the ordinary course of business, is required to be
disclosed by the Company under this Agreement or falls within relevant
minimum thresholds or materiality standards set forth in this Agreement. No
disclosure in the Company Disclosure Schedule relating to any possible breach
or violation by the Company of any Contract or Law shall be construed as an
admission or indication that any such breach or violation exists or has
actually occurred. In no event shall the listing of any matter in the Company
Disclosure Schedule be deemed or interpreted to expand the scope of
the Companys representations, warranties or covenants set forth in this
Agreement.

Section 8.7 _Entire Agreement; Third-Party Beneficiaries_.

 

(a) This Agreement (including the Company Disclosure Schedule) and the

with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersede all other
prior agreements (except that the Confidentiality Agreement shall be deemed
amended hereby so that until the termination of this Agreement in accordance
with  _Section 7.1_, Parent and Merger Sub shall be permitted to take the
actions contemplated by this Agreement) and understandings, both written and
oral, among the Parties or any of them with respect to the subject matter
hereof and thereof. For the avoidance of doubt, the Confidentiality Agreement
will survive any termination of this Agreement.

Company Disclosure Schedule) is not intended to confer upon any Person other
than the Parties any rights

 



57  or remedies hereunder. The representations and warranties in this Agreement
are the product of negotiations among the Parties and are for the sole benefit
of the Parties. Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are
subject to waiver by the Parties in accordance with _Section 8.1_ without
notice or liability to any other Person. In some instances, the
representations and warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation
among the Parties of risks associated with particular matters regardless of
the knowledge of any of the Parties. Consequently, Persons other than the
Parties may not rely upon the representations and warranties in this Agreement
as characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this
Agreement or as of any other date.

Section 8.8  _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by rule of Law or public
policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the Merger are not affected in any manner adverse to any Party.
Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal
or incapable of being enforced, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as
closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the Transactions
are fulfilled to the extent possible.

Proceeding arising out of, relating to, or in connection with this Agreement,

rule that would cause the application of the Laws of any jurisdiction
other than the State of Delaware, regardless of the Law that might otherwise
govern under applicable principles of conflicts of laws thereof. In any Legal
Proceeding between any of the Parties arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or any of the Transactions, each of the Parties (a) irrevocably and

Proceeding relating to this Agreement or the Transactions in any court other
than the aforesaid courts, and (d) each of the Parties irrevocably consents to

AND ALL RIGHTS TO TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE
AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE MERGER AND OTHER
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT
(A) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE EITHER OF SUCH WAIVERS, (B) IT UNDERSTANDS AND
HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF

 



58  SUCH WAIVERS, (C) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVERS VOLUNTARILY, AND (D) IT HAS BEEN
INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL
WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS  _SECTION 8.10_.

Section 8.11 _Assignment_. This Agreement shall not be assigned by any of the
Parties (whether by operation of Law or otherwise) without the prior written
consent of the other Parties. No assignment by any Party shall relieve such
Party of any obligation or liability under this Agreement. Subject to the
preceding sentence, but without relieving any Party of any obligation
hereunder, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and
be Enforceable by the Parties and their respective successors and assigns.

remedy shall not preclude the exercise of any other remedy.

 

(b) Each Party to this Agreement agrees that, in the event of any breach or
threatened breach by another Party of any covenant, obligation or other
provision set forth in this Agreement (i) such Party shall be entitled,
without any proof of actual damages (and in addition to any other remedy that

Transactions and, subject to _Section 7.2(c)_, each Party hereby waives any
objections to any remedy referred to in this _Section 8.12_ (including any
objection on the basis that there is an adequate remedy at Law or that an
award of such remedy is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at Law or
equity). For the avoidance of doubt, each Party agrees that there is not an
adequate remedy at Law for a breach of this Agreement by any Party.

Section 8.13 _Non-Recourse_. Any claim or cause of action based upon,
arising out of or related to this Agreement may only be brought against
Persons that are expressly named as Parties hereto, and then only with respect
to the specific obligations set forth herein. No former, current or future
direct or indirect equity holders, controlling Persons, stockholders,

     | I. |

action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, 

---|---|--- 
 



A-1 action by or in the right of the Corporation) by reason of the fact that he or
she is or was, or has agreed to become, a director or officer of the
Corporation, or is or was serving, or has agreed to serve, at the request of
the Corporation, as a director, officer, partner, employee or trustee of, or
in a similar capacity with, another corporation, partnership, joint
venture, trust or other enterprise (including any employee benefit plan) (all
such persons being referred to hereafter as an "Indemnitee"), or by reason of
any action alleged to have been taken or omitted in such capacity, against
all expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid
in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by or on behalf of Indemnitee
in connection with such action, suit or proceeding and any appeal therefrom,
if Indemnitee acted in good faith and in a manner which Indemnitee reasonably
believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the Corporation,
and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable
cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful. The termination of any
action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction or upon
a plea of _nolo contendere_ or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a
presumption that Indemnitee did not act in good faith and in a manner which
Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests
of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding,
had reasonable cause to believe that his or her conduct was unlawful. 
---|--- 



     | II. |

_Actions or Suits by or in the Right of the Corporation_. The Corporation
shall indemnify any Indemnitee who was or is a party to or threatened to be
made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in
the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of
the fact that Indemnitee is or was, or has agreed to become, a director or
officer of the Corporation, or is or was serving, or has agreed to serve, at
the request of the Corporation, as a director, officer, partner, employee or
trustee of, or in a similar capacity with, another corporation, partnership,
joint venture, trust or other enterprise (including any employee benefit
plan), or by reason of any action alleged to have been taken or omitted in
such capacity, against all expenses (including attorneys fees) and, to the
extent permitted by law, amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably
incurred by or on behalf of Indemnitee in connection with such action, suit or
proceeding and any appeal therefrom, if Indemnitee acted in good faith and in
a manner which Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to,
the best interests of the Corporation, except that no indemnification shall be
made under this Section II in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to
which Indemnitee shall have been  

---|---|--- 
 



A-2 the extent, that the Court of Chancery of Delaware shall determine upon
application that, despite the adjudication of such liability but in view of
all the circumstances of the case, Indemnitee is fairly and reasonably
entitled to indemnity for such expenses (including attorneys fees) which the
Court of Chancery of Delaware shall deem proper. 
---|--- 
 



     | III. | _Indemnification for Expenses of Successful Party_.
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Article, to the extent that an
Indemnitee has been successful, on the merits or otherwise, in defense of any
action, suit or proceeding referred to in Sections I and II of this Article
EIGHTH, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, or on appeal from
any such action, suit or proceeding, Indemnitee shall be indemnified against
all expenses (including attorneys fees) actually and reasonably incurred by
or on behalf of Indemnitee in connection therewith. 
---|---|--- 



     | IV. |

_Notification and Defense of Claim_. As a condition precedent to an
Indemnitees right to be indemnified, such Indemnitee must notify the
Corporation in writing as soon as practicable of any action, suit, proceeding
or investigation involving such Indemnitee for which indemnity will or could
be sought. With respect to any action, suit, proceeding or investigation of
which the Corporation is so notified, the Corporation will be entitled to
participate therein at its own expense and/or to assume the defense thereof at
its own expense, with legal counsel reasonably acceptable to Indemnitee.
After notice from the Corporation to Indemnitee of its election so to assume
such defense, the Corporation shall not be liable to Indemnitee for any legal
or other expenses subsequently incurred by Indemnitee in connection with
such action, suit, proceeding or investigation, other than as provided below
in this Section IV. Indemnitee shall have the right to employ his or her own
counsel in connection with such action, suit, proceeding or investigation, but
the fees and expenses of such counsel incurred after notice from the
Corporation of its assumption of the defense thereof shall be at the expense
of Indemnitee unless (a) the employment of counsel by Indemnitee has been
authorized by the Corporation, (b) counsel to Indemnitee shall have
reasonably concluded that there may be a conflict of interest or position on
any significant issue between the Corporation and Indemnitee in the conduct of
the defense of such action, suit, proceeding or investigation, or (c) the
Corporation shall not in fact have employed counsel to assume the defense of
such action, suit, proceeding or investigation, in each of which cases the
fees and expenses of counsel for Indemnitee shall be at the expense of the
Corporation, except as otherwise expressly provided by this Article. 

---|---|--- 
 



A-3 Indemnitee, to assume the defense of any claim brought by or in the right of
the Corporation or as to which counsel for Indemnitee shall have reasonably
made the conclusion provided for in clause (ii) above. The Corporation shall
not be required to indemnify Indemnitee under this Article EIGHTH for any
amounts paid in settlement of any action, suit, proceeding or investigation
effected without its written consent. The Corporation shall not settle any
action, suit, proceeding or investigation in any manner which would impose any
penalty or limitation on Indemnitee without Indemnitees written
consent. Neither the Corporation nor Indemnitee will unreasonably withhold or
delay its consent to any proposed settlement. 
---|--- 



     | V. | _Advance of Expenses_. Subject to the provisions of Section
VI of this Article EIGHTH, in the event of any action, suit, proceeding or
investigation of which the Corporation receives notice under this Article,
any expenses (including attorneys fees) incurred by or on behalf of
Indemnitee in defending an action, suit, proceeding or investigation or any
appeal therefrom shall be paid by the Corporation in advance of the final
disposition of such matter; provided, however, that the payment of such
expenses incurred by or on behalf of Indemnitee in advance of the final
disposition of such matter shall be made only upon receipt of an undertaking
by or on behalf of Indemnitee to repay all amounts so advanced in the event
that it shall ultimately be determined that Indemnitee is not entitled to be
indemnified by the Corporation as authorized in this Article; and further
provided that no such advancement of expenses shall be made under
this Article EIGHTH if it is determined (in the manner described in Section
VI) that (i) Indemnitee did not act in good faith and in a manner he
reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the
Corporation, or (ii) with respect to any criminal action or proceeding,
Indemnitee had reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful. Such
undertaking shall be accepted without reference to the financial ability of
Indemnitee to make such repayment.  
---|---|--- 



     | VI. |

_Procedure for Indemnification_. In order to obtain indemnification or
advancement of expenses pursuant to Section I, II, III or V of this Article
EIGHTH, an Indemnitee shall submit to the Corporation a written request. Any
such advancement of expenses shall be made promptly, and in any event within
60 days after receipt by the Corporation of the written request of
Indemnitee, unless (i) the Corporation has assumed the defense pursuant to
Section IV of this Article EIGHTH (and none of the circumstances described in
Section IV of this Article EIGHTH that would nonetheless entitle the  

---|---|--- 
 



A-4 separate counsel have occurred) or (ii) the Corporation determines within such
60-day period that Indemnitee did not meet the applicable standard of conduct
set forth in Section I, II or V of this Article EIGHTH, as the case may be.
Any such indemnification, unless ordered by a court, shall be made with
respect to requests under Section I or II only as authorized in the specific
case upon a determination by the Corporation that the indemnification of
Indemnitee is proper because Indemnitee has met the applicable standard of
conduct set forth in Section I or II, as the case may be. Such determination
shall be made in each instance (a) by a majority vote of the directors of the
Corporation consisting of persons who are not at that time parties to the
action, suit or proceeding in question ("disinterested directors"), whether or
not a quorum, (b) by a committee of disinterested directors designated by
majority vote of disinterested directors, whether or not a quorum, (c) if
there are no disinterested directors, or if the disinterested directors so
direct, by independent legal counsel (who may, to the extent permitted by
law, be regular legal counsel to the Corporation) in a written opinion, or (d)
by the stockholders of the Corporation. 
---|--- 
 



     | VII. | _Remedies_. The right to indemnification or advancement of
expenses as granted by this Article shall be enforceable by Indemnitee in any
court of competent jurisdiction. Neither the failure of the Corporation
to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that
indemnification is proper in the circumstances because Indemnitee has met the
applicable standard of conduct, nor an actual determination by the Corporation
pursuant to Section VI of this Article EIGHTH that Indemnitee has not met
such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or
create a presumption that Indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of
conduct. Indemnitees expenses (including attorneys fees) reasonably
incurred in connection with successfully establishing Indemnitees right to
indemnification, in whole or in part, in any such proceeding shall also be
indemnified by the Corporation. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | VIII. |

_Limitations_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article,
except as set forth in Section VII of the Article EIGHTH, the Corporation
shall not indemnify an Indemnitee pursuant to this Article EIGHTH in
connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such Indemnitee
unless the initiation thereof was approved by the Board of Directors of the
Corporation. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article, the
Corporation shall not indemnify an Indemnitee to the extent such Indemnitee is
reimbursed from the proceeds of insurance, and in the  

---|---|--- 
 



A-5 an Indemnitee and such Indemnitee is subsequently reimbursed from the proceeds
of insurance, such Indemnitee shall promptly refund indemnification payments
to the Corporation to the extent of such insurance reimbursement. 
---|--- 



     | IX. | _Subsequent Amendment_. No amendment, termination or repeal
of this Article or of the relevant provisions of the DGCL or any other
applicable laws shall affect or diminish in any way the rights of any
Indemnitee to indemnification under the provisions hereof with respect to any
action, suit, proceeding or investigation arising out of or relating to any
actions, transactions or facts occurring prior to the final adoption of such
amendment, termination or repeal. 
---|---|--- 



     | X. | _Other Rights_. The indemnification and advancement of
expenses provided by this Article shall not be deemed exclusive of any other
rights to which an Indemnitee seeking indemnification or advancement of
expenses may be entitled under any law (common or statutory), agreement or
vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to
action in Indemnitees official capacity and as to action in any other
capacity while holding office for the Corporation, and shall continue as to
an Indemnitee who has ceased to be a director or officer, and shall inure to
the benefit of the estate, heirs, executors and administrators of Indemnitee.
Nothing contained in this Article shall be deemed to prohibit, and the
Corporation is specifically authorized to enter into, agreements with officers
and directors providing indemnification rights and procedures different from
those set forth in this Article. In addition, the Corporation may, to
the extent authorized from time to time by its Board of Directors, grant
indemnification rights to other employees or agents of the Corporation or
other persons serving the Corporation and such rights may be equivalent to, or
greater or less than, those set forth in this Article. 
---|---|--- 



     | XI. | _Partial Indemnification_. If an Indemnitee is entitled
under any provision of this Article to indemnification by the Corporation for
some or a portion of the expenses (including attorneys fees),
judgments, fines or amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably
incurred by or on behalf of Indemnitee in connection with any action, suit,
proceeding or investigation and any appeal therefrom but not, however, for the
total amount thereof, the Corporation shall nevertheless indemnify Indemnitee
for the portion of such expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines
or amounts paid in settlement to which Indemnitee is entitled. 
---|---|--- 
 



A-6 insurance, at its expense, to protect itself and any director, officer,
employee or agent of the Corporation or another corporation, partnership,
joint venture, trust or other enterprise (including any employee benefit
plan) against any expense, liability or loss incurred by him in any such
capacity, or arising out of his status as such, whether or not the Corporation
would have the power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability
or loss under the DGCL. 
---|---|--- 



     | XIII. | _Savings Clause_. If this Article or any portion hereof
shall be invalidated on any ground by any court of competent jurisdiction,
then the Corporation shall nevertheless indemnify each Indemnitee as to
any expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid
in settlement in connection with any action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal or administrative, including an action
by or in the right of the Corporation, to the fullest extent permitted by any
applicable portion of this Article that shall not have been invalidated and to
the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | XIV. | _Definitions_. Terms used herein and defined in Section
145(h) and Section 145(i) of the DGCL shall have the respective meanings
assigned to such terms in such Section 145(h) and Section 145(i).

in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof,
require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate or
certificates, or such owners legal representative, to advertise the same in

shall be made to the person entitled thereto and the transaction shall be
recorded upon the books of the corporation.

the State of Delaware confers jurisdiction on the Court of Chancery of the

If any provision or provisions of this Section 1 of Article VIII shall be
held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable as applied to any person or

other circumstance and of the remaining provisions of this Section 1 of
Article VIII (including, without limitation, each portion of any sentence of
this Section 1 of Article VIII containing any such provision held to be
invalid, illegal or unenforceable that is not itself held to be invalid,
