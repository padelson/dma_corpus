STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT

This STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT (this "Agreement"), made as of March 22, 2016,
by and between Carefree Communities Intermediate Holdings, L.L.C. ("Seller"),
Sun Communities Operating Limited Partnership (the "Buyer") and Sun
Communities, Inc. a Maryland corporation ("SUI").

WHEREAS, Seller is the sole owner of all of the issued and outstanding shares
of common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "Shares") of Carefree
Communities Inc. (the "Company").

WHEREAS, the Company owns one hundred percent (100%) of the ownership
interests in the Holding Companies and Holding Companies own or lease,
directly or indirectly through the Property Owner Subsidiaries, 103
manufactured home communities, park model communities and recreational vehicle
communities.

WHEREAS, Seller desires to sell to the Buyer, and the Buyer desires to
purchase from Seller, the Shares, on the terms and subject to the conditions
hereinafter set forth.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual covenants and
agreements herein contained, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the
parties hereto hereby agree as follows:

ARTICLE I 

PURCHASE AND SALE

Section 1.1 Purchase and Sale. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of
this Agreement, at the Closing, the Buyer will purchase and acquire from
Seller, and Seller will sell, assign and transfer to the Buyer the Shares in
exchange for the Purchase Price.

Section 1.2 Closing Payment; SUI Shares. At the Closing, the Buyer shall pay
to (a) Seller, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, an amount
equal to the Estimated Purchase Price less the Purchase Price Adjustment
Escrow Amount and less the Stock Consideration Amount, and (b) the Escrow
Agent, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, an amount equal to the
Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Amount, which will be held in an escrow
account (the "Escrow Account") pursuant to the provisions of the Escrow
Agreement and used for purposes of any payments payable to Buyer and/or Seller
pursuant to Section 1.7(e). At the Closing, SUI shall issue to Seller a number
of shares of SUI's common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "SUI Shares"),
which number will be the nearest whole number equal to the Stock Consideration
Amount divided by an issuance price of $67.57 per share (subject to adjustment
as provided below). If, during the period between the date of this Agreement
and the Closing, any change in the outstanding shares of SUI common stock
shall occur by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split
(including reverse stock split) or combination, exchange or readjustment of
shares, or any stock dividend or other dividend of securities convertible into
SUI common stock, or any record date for any such purpose shall be
established,



then the per share price of the SUI Shares shall be appropriately adjusted to
fully reflect the effect of any such change. The "Estimated Purchase Price"
means an amount equal to (i) the Base Purchase Price plus (ii) the amount, if
any, by which the Estimated Net Working Capital exceeds the Target Working
Capital, minus (iii) the amount, if any, by which the Estimated Net Working
Capital is less than the Target Working Capital, plus (iv) the amount of
Estimated Cash, minus (v) the amount of Estimated Indebtedness, plus (vi) the
amount of Estimated Due Diligence Report Expenses, minus (vii) the amount of
Estimated Seller Transaction Expenses.

Section 1.3 The Closing. The closing of the purchase and sale of the Shares
(the "Closing") shall take place at the offices of Simpson Thacher and Bartlett
LLP, 425 Lexington Avenue, New York, New York 10017 at 10:00 a.m. New York
time on June 9, 2016; provided if as of June 1, 2016 Lender Consents with
respect to Existing Loans having an aggregate principal amount of more than
$25,000,000 have not been received, the Buyer shall have the option of
extending the date of the Closing to July 9, 2016 upon notice given to Seller
no later than June 6, 2016, subject in each case to the satisfaction or waiver
of the conditions set forth in Article V (other than conditions that by their
nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or
waiver of such conditions), or at such other time or on such other date as the
parties may mutually agree upon in writing (the date on which the Closing
actually occurs, the "Closing Date").

Section 1.4 Closing Deliveries by Buyer. At the Closing, the Buyer shall
deliver the following to Seller:

Section 1.6 Determination of Estimated Purchase Price. At least three (3)
business days prior to the Closing Date, Seller will deliver to the Buyer a
written statement (the "Estimated Closing Statement") containing Seller's good
faith calculation of (i) the estimated Net Working Capital, as of 11:59 p.m.,
New York time, on the day immediately prior to the Closing Date ("Estimated
Net Working Capital"), (ii) the estimated Cash of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, as of 11:59 p.m., New York time, on the day immediately prior to
the Closing Date ("Estimated Cash"), (iii) the estimated Indebtedness of the

immediately prior to the Closing Date ("Estimated Indebtedness"), (iv) the
estimated Due Diligence Report Expenses ("Estimated Due Diligence Report
Expenses") and (v) the estimated Seller Transaction Expenses ("Estimated
Seller Transaction Expenses"). During the period after the delivery of the
Estimated Closing Statement and prior to the Closing Date, the Buyer shall
have an opportunity to review the Estimated Closing Statement and Seller shall
cooperate with the Buyer in good faith to mutually agree upon the Estimated
Closing Statement in the event the Buyer disputes any item proposed to be set
forth on such statement; provided, however, that if Seller and the Buyer are
not able to reach mutual agreement prior to the Closing Date, the Estimated
Closing Statement provided by Seller to the Buyer, as modified to include any
changes agreed to by Seller and Buyer, shall be binding for purposes of this
Section 1.6.

Section 1.7 Purchase Price Adjustment.

(a) As promptly as practicable and in any event within sixty (60) days after
the Closing Date, the Buyer shall prepare and deliver to Seller a statement
(the "Buyer's Statement") setting forth in reasonable detail its calculation
of (i) the Net Working Capital, as of 11:59 p.m., New York time, on the day
immediately prior to the Closing Date, (ii) the Cash of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, as of 11:59 p.m., New York time, on the day 

immediately prior to the Closing Date, (iii) Indebtedness of the Company and
its Subsidiaries, as of 11:59 p.m., New York time, on the day immediately
prior to the Closing Date, (iv) the Due Diligence Report Expenses and (v) the
Seller Transaction Expenses.

(b) After delivery of the Buyer's Statement, the Buyer shall give Seller and
its Representatives and Affiliates reasonable access to review the work
papers, schedules, memoranda and other documents prepared or reviewed by the
Buyer and its Representatives in connection with the preparation of the
Buyer's Statement and allow them to make reasonable inquiries of its
Representatives regarding questions concerning, or disagreements with, the
Buyer's Statement and the Buyer shall cause its Representatives to reasonably
cooperate with and respond to such inquiries provided that such actions do not
unreasonably interfere with the operations of the Buyer, the Company and its
Subsidiaries. The Buyer shall, and shall cause the Company and its
Subsidiaries and its Affiliates to, reasonably cooperate with Seller and its
Representatives and Affiliates in the review of the Buyer's Statement,
including by providing reasonable access to the books, records and
Representatives of the Buyer, the Company and its Subsidiaries and their
respective Affiliates in connection therewith (subject, in the case of the
Buyer's auditors, to execution by Seller of such reasonable and customary
acknowledgement or non-reliance letter as such auditors may request).

(c) Within thirty (30) days after delivery of the Buyer's Statement to Seller,
Seller will advise the Buyer in writing whether it agrees with the Buyer's
Statement or whether Seller objects to it. If Seller disputes any amounts
reflected on the Buyer's Statement, it shall deliver to the Buyer a statement
setting forth its objections thereto, setting forth, in reasonable detail, the
basis for such dispute, the dollar amounts involved and Seller's calculation
of the Buyer's Statement, within thirty (30) days of the Buyer's delivery of
the Buyer's Statement to Seller (such written notice of objection, the
"Objection Statement"). If an Objection Statement is not delivered to the
Buyer within thirty (30) days after delivery of the Buyer's Statement to
Seller, the Buyer's Statement shall be final, binding and non-appealable by
the parties hereto. Seller and the Buyer shall negotiate in good faith to
resolve any objections made by Seller, but if they do not reach a final
resolution within fifteen (15) days after the delivery of the Objection
Statement, either Seller or the Buyer may submit the issues remaining in
dispute for final resolution to Deloitte and Touche LLP or if Deloitte and Touche
LLP is unable to serve, to an independent certified public accounting firm of
national reputation mutually agreed by the Buyer and Seller (the firm so
determined, "Arbitrator"). Each party agrees to execute, if requested by the
Arbitrator, a reasonable and customary engagement letter, including customary
indemnities. The Arbitrator shall consider only those items and amounts which
are identified in the Objection Statement and which the Buyer and Seller are
unable to resolve. In resolving any item of dispute, the Arbitrator may not
assign a value to any item greater than the greatest value for such item
claimed by either the Buyer or Seller or less than the smallest value for such
item claimed by either the Buyer or Seller. Seller and the Buyer shall use
their commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Arbitrator to resolve all
disagreements as soon as practicable and in any event within thirty (30) days
after the submission of any dispute to the Arbitrator. The resolution of the
dispute by the Arbitrator shall be final, binding and non-appealable on the
parties hereto. The costs and expenses of the 

Arbitrator shall be borne by Seller and the Buyer based on the percentage
which the portion of the contested amount not awarded to such party bears to
the amount actually contested by such party, as finally determined by the
Arbitrator.

(d) The "Purchase Price" means an amount equal to (i) the Base Purchase Price
plus (ii) the amount, if any, by which the Net Working Capital, as of 11:59
p.m., New York time, on the day immediately prior to the Closing Date, as
finally determined pursuant to this Section 1.7, exceeds the Target Working
Capital, minus (iii) the amount, if any, by which the Net Working Capital, as
of 11:59 p.m., New York time, on the day immediately prior to the Closing
Date, as finally determined pursuant to this Section 1.7, is less than the
Target Working Capital, plus (iv) the amount of Cash of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, as of 11:59 p.m., New York time, on the day immediately prior to
the Closing Date, as finally determined pursuant to this Section 1.7, minus
(v) the amount of Indebtedness of the Company and its Subsidiaries, as of
11:59 p.m., New York time, on the day immediately prior to the Closing Date,
as finally determined pursuant to this Section 1.7, plus (vi) the amount of
Due Diligence Report Expenses, as finally determined pursuant to this Section
1.7, minus (x) the amount of Seller Transaction Expenses, as finally
determined pursuant to this Section 1.7.

(e) No later than five (5) business days after the Purchase Price has been
determined the following payments (if any) shall be made:

(i) If the Purchase Price is greater than the Estimated Purchase Price, the
Buyer shall pay the amount of such excess to Seller (and all funds in the
Escrow Account shall be released to Seller).

(ii) If the Estimated Purchase Price is greater than the Purchase Price, Buyer
shall be paid the amount of such excess (the "PP Overpayment") from the Escrow
Account; provided, except as otherwise set forth in this Section 1.7(e)(ii),
Buyer's sole recourse with respect thereto shall be the Purchase Price
Adjustment Escrow Amount held by the Escrow Agent (and any remaining funds in
the Escrow Account (if any) following such payment to Buyer shall be released
to Seller); provided, further, if the PP Overpayment exceeds the Purchase
Price Adjustment Escrow (such excess, the "Escrow Deficiency") and the
Estimated Cash exceeds the amount of Cash of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
as of 11:59 p.m., New York time, on the day immediately prior to the Closing
Date, as finally determined pursuant to this Section 1.7 (such excess, the
"Cash Deficiency"), Seller shall pay an amount to Buyer equal to the lesser of
the Cash Deficiency and the Escrow Deficiency .

(iii) If the Purchase Price is equal to the Estimated Purchase Price, no
adjustment payment shall be made (and all funds in the Escrow Account shall be
released to Seller).

Any payment to be made pursuant to this Section 1.7(e) shall be made by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account (or accounts) specified
in writing by Seller or the Buyer, as applicable. Buyer and Seller hereby
agree to deliver joint written instructions to the 

Escrow Agent to deliver promptly from the Escrow Account all funds to be
delivered in accordance with this Section 1.7(e).

Section 1.8 Withholding. The Buyer shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from the consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this
Agreement such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect
to the making of such payment under any Tax Laws. If the Buyer so withholds
(or causes to be withheld) any such amounts and pays over such amounts as
required by Law, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which the Buyer made
such deduction and withholding.

necessary for each such entity to own, lease, franchise, manage and operate
its Properties, assets and rights and to carry on its business as it is now

impact on the ability of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to carry on
its business as it now being conducted. No suspension, cancellation,
revocation or adverse modification of any Company Permit is pending or, to the
knowledge of Seller, has been threatened in writing, except where the failure

any property or asset of such entity is bound, except, with respect to clauses
(i) and (ii), for any conflicts, defaults, breaches or violations of such
Laws, Contracts or Company Permits that would not, individually or in the
aggregate, have a material adverse effect on any Property or reasonably be
expected to have a material impact on the ability of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to continue carry on its business as it now being conducted.

Section 2.8 Financial Statements; No Unknown Liabilities.

Section 401(a) of the Code is so qualified and has received a favorable
determination letter as to its qualification, or if such Company Plan is a
prototype plan, the opinion or notification letter for each such Company Plan,
and, to the knowledge of Seller, nothing has occurred, whether by action or
failure to act, that would reasonably be expected to cause the loss of such
qualification. Each Company Plan has been established and administered in all
material respects in accordance with its terms, and in material compliance
with the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code and other applicable laws,
rules and regulations. The Company and its Subsidiaries, as the case may be,
have made all contributions and paid all premiums in respect of each Company
Plan in a timely fashion in accordance with the terms of each Company Plan,

of payment or vesting or funding, or increase the amount, of compensation or
benefit due to any employee, director, officer or independent contractor of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under any Company Plan, or (ii) result
in any payment or benefit that would reasonably be expected to constitute an
"excess parachute payment" (as such term is defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of
the Code). Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any obligation
(including, indirectly, by way of indemnification) to make any Tax gross-up

maintained in good faith compliance with Section 409A of the Code and
associated Internal Revenue Service and Treasury Department guidance, and

of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to continue carry on its business as
it now being conducted, no unfair labor practice complaint, grievance or
arbitration proceeding is pending or, to the knowledge of Seller, threatened
against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

(b) Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries are in compliance with all
applicable Laws respecting labor, employment and employment practices, worker
classification, withholding, terms and conditions of employment, wages and
hours, overtime, workers' compensation, pay equity and occupational safety and

action, including making any contribution, gift, bribe, payoff, influence
payment, kickback or other similar payment to any Person, private or public,

constitute a violation in any material respect by the Company or any
Subsidiary of any Law (i) to obtain favorable treatment in securing business,
(ii) to pay for favorable treatment for business secured, or (iii) to obtain
special concessions, in each case for or in respect of the Company or any

validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of
organization and has the requisite power and authority and all necessary
governmental approvals to own, lease and operate its properties, rights and
assets and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted, except where
the failure to be so organized, existing or in good standing or to have-such

aggregate, reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay Buyer from
performing its obligations under, and consummating the transactions
contemplated by, this Agreement.

Section 3.2 Authority. The Buyer has all requisite limited partnership power
and authority to enter into this Agreement, to perform its obligations
hereunder and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The
execution, delivery and performance by the Buyer of this Agreement, the
purchase of the Shares and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby have been duly authorized by all necessary action on the part of the
Buyer, and no other actions on the part the Buyer or its partners are
necessary to authorize this Agreement. This Agreement has been duly and
validly executed and delivered by the Buyer and, assuming due authorization,
execution and delivery by Seller, constitutes a legal, valid and binding
obligation of the Buyer enforceable against the Buyer in accordance with its
terms, subject to the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency
(including all laws relating to fraudulent transfers), reorganization,
moratorium or similar Law affecting creditors' rights generally and subject to
the effect of general principles of equity.

Section 3.3 No Conflict; Required Filings and Consents. 

(l) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Buyer does not, and
the performance of this Agreement by the Buyer and the consummation by the
Buyer of the transactions contemplated hereby will not, (i) conflict with or
violate the organizational documents of the Buyer, (ii) conflict with or
violate any Law applicable to the Buyer or by which any property, right or
asset of the Buyer is bound or affected, or (iii) result in any breach or

by which the Buyer or any property, right or asset of the Buyer is bound or
affected, except, with respect to clauses (ii) and (iii), for any such
breaches, defaults or other occurrences which would not, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay Buyer
from performing its obligations under, and consummating the transactions
contemplated by, this Agreement.

(m) The execution and delivery by the Buyer of this Agreement does not, and
the performance of this Agreement by the Buyer and the consummation by the
Buyer of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not, require any
consent, approval, authorization or permit of, or filing with or notification
to, any Governmental Authority, except where the failure to obtain such
consents, approvals, authorizations or permits, or to make such filings or
notifications, would not, individually or in the aggregate, prevent or
materially delay the Buyer from consummating any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or performing its material obligations under
this Agreement.

Section 3.4 SEC Documents. Buyer has made available to Seller (by public
filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") or otherwise) a
true and complete copy of each report, form, schedule, document, prospectus,
registration statement and definitive proxy statement filed by SUI, together
with all certifications required pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002,
as amended (the "Sarbanes-Oxley Act"), in each case since January 1, 2014
(collectively, the "SEC Documents"). The SEC Documents were filed with or
furnished to the SEC in a timely manner and constitute all reports, forms,
schedules, documents, prospectuses, registration statements and definitive
proxy statements required to be filed or furnished by SUI under the Securities
Act, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and
the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder since January 1, 2014. As of
their respective dates, or, if supplemented, modified or amended since the
time of filing, as of the date of the most recent supplement, modification or
amendment, (a) the SEC Documents complied in all material respects with the
requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be,
and the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder applicable to such SEC
Documents and (b) none of the SEC Documents contained or contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omitted or omit to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. SUI and
its subsidiaries maintain "disclosure controls and procedures" (as such term
is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) and such disclosure
controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonable assurance that
material information required to be disclosed by SUI in the reports that it
files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, 

summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules
and forms and is accumulated and communicated to SUI's management as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. SUI has
designed and maintains a system of internal control over financial reporting
(as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) intended to provide
reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting for SUI
and its subsidiaries. SUI is in compliance in all material respects with the
applicable provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the applicable listing and
corporate governance rules and regulations of the New York Stock Exchange.

Section 3.5 Consolidated Financial Statements. The consolidated financial
statements of SUI included in the SEC Documents complied as to form in all
material respects with the applicable accounting requirements and the
published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, have been
prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis during the
periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto, or, in the
case of the unaudited statements, as permitted by Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X
under the Exchange Act) and fairly presented, in accordance with applicable
requirements of GAAP and the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC

and the consolidated cash flows of SUI for the periods presented therein.

other persons, that may have a material current or, to the knowledge of Buyer,
material future effect on SUI's consolidated financial condition, results of
operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, capital resources or significant
components of revenue or expenses. Except as set forth on the consolidated
balance sheet of SUI and its Subsidiaries (including the notes thereto) as of
December 31, 2015 included in the SEC Documents, neither SUI, the Buyer, nor
any of its Subsidiaries has any material liability or obligation of any nature
(whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise) that would be required by
GAAP to be recorded on or reflected in the consolidated financial statements
of SUI and its Subsidiaries, except for liabilities and obligations (i)
incurred pursuant to this Agreement, (ii) incurred since December 31, 2015 in
the ordinary course of business and in a manner consistent with past practice
or (iii) set forth in the SEC Documents filed with the SEC after January 1,

Section 4.2 Access to Information.

(n) From the date hereof until the Closing, upon reasonable advance written
notice from Buyer, Seller shall (i) afford to Buyer and its Representatives
reasonable access, during normal business hours, to the offices, properties,
other facilities, books and records, officers, directors, employees, agents
and other representatives of the Company and its Subsidiaries, in each case as
may be reasonably requested by the Buyer and (ii) furnish to Buyer and its
Representatives such additional financial and operating data and other
information regarding the business and properties of the Company and the
Subsidiaries as the Buyer may from time to time reasonably request; provided
all such activities set forth in clauses (i) and (ii) shall be conducted at
the sole cost and expense of Buyer and in such a manner as not to interfere
unreasonably with the business or operations of the Company; provided,
further, that Seller shall not be obligated to provide such access or
information if Seller determines, in its reasonable judgment, that doing so
would cause competitive harm to the Company or any of its Affiliates if the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement are not consummated, violate
applicable Law or a Contract (including any confidentiality agreement),
jeopardize the protection of any attorney work-product protections, attorney- 

client privileges or similar protections and privileges, or expose the Company
or any its Affiliates to risk of liability for disclosure of sensitive or
personal information; provided, however, that the parties hereto shall attempt
in good faith to make such alternative arrangements as may be reasonably
necessary so that the restrictions in the immediately preceding proviso would
not apply. Buyer shall, and shall cause its Representatives, to hold all
information provided or furnished pursuant to this Section 4.2 (or otherwise
pursuant to this Agreement (including Section 4.13)) confidential in
accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement. During any visit
to the business or property sites of the Company or any Subsidiary, Buyer
shall, and shall cause its Representatives accessing such properties to,
comply with all applicable Laws and all of the Company's and its Subsidiaries'
safety and security procedures. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, neither Buyer, nor any of Representatives, shall conduct any
environmental investigation at any Company Real Property involving any
sampling or other intrusive investigation of air, surface water, groundwater,
soil or anything else at or in connection with any Company Real Property
("Phase II Testing") without the prior written consent of Seller and subject
to Section 4.2(a) of the Disclosure Schedules.

(o) For a period of six years following the Closing Date (or longer if
required by applicable Law), Buyer shall, and shall cause the Company (and its
Subsidiaries) to use their commercially reasonable efforts to preserve and
keep the records held by them relating to the respective businesses of the
Company and its Subsidiaries and shall make such records (or copies) and
reasonably appropriate personnel available, at reasonable times and upon
reasonable advance notice, to Seller, its Affiliates and their Representatives
as may be reasonably requested by such party in connection with any insurance
claims by, legal proceedings or Tax audits against, governmental
investigations of, or compliance with applicable Laws by, Seller, its
Affiliates and their Representatives.

(p) At Closing, Seller shall make available to Buyer Rent Rolls and
Reservation Lists updated to a date not more than thirty (30) days prior to
the Closing Date.

Section 4.3 Public Announcements. The Buyer and Seller shall issue a joint
press release relating to this Agreement, the text of which has been
previously agreed to by the Buyer and Seller. Thereafter, the Buyer and Seller
agree not to, without the prior written consent of the other party, issue any
press release or otherwise make any public statements with respect to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except to the
extent disclosure is (i) required by applicable Law (including, without
limitation, rules and regulations promulgated under the Securities Act or the
Exchange Act) in which case the Buyer or Seller, as the case may be, shall, to
the extent reasonably practicable, have the right to review such disclosure
prior to its issuance, distribution or publication and the parties shall work
together in good faith to reach an agreement on the content of any such press
release or announcement or (ii) made to limited partners or members,
prospective limited partners or members or investors or prospective investors
(including lenders and prospective lenders) of Seller or any of its Affiliates
who are subject to confidentiality obligations with respect to such
information. 

Section 4.4 Tax Matters.

(j) The Buyer and the Company shall take all steps, or forbear from taking
steps, necessary after the Closing (including, without limitation, complying
with Section 856(a)(6) of the Code) to ensure that the Company is, and will
continue to be, classified as a real estate investment trust pursuant to
Section 856 of the Code (without regard to any "savings" or "cure" provisions
in the Code) until the end of the Company's taxable year which contains the
Closing Date.

(k) After the Closing Date, the Buyer and Seller shall reasonably cooperate,
and shall cause their respective Affiliates, if any, to reasonably cooperate,
in the preparation of all Tax Returns and shall provide, or cause to be
provide, to the requesting party any records or other information in its
possession that are reasonably requested by such party in connection
therewith. Each party shall reasonably cooperate with the other party in
connection with any Tax investigation, audit or other proceeding. The Buyer
and Seller shall retain or cause to be retained all Tax Returns and all books
and records relating to Taxes of the Company for all Taxable Periods beginning
on or before the Closing Date until thirty (30) days after the expiration of
the applicable statute of limitations for the Tax in question (and, to the
extent notified by the Buyer or Seller, any waiver or extension thereof), and
abide by all record retention agreements entered into with any Tax Authority.
The Buyer and Seller shall each provide the other with reasonable written
notice prior to transferring, destroying or discarding any such books and
records.

(l) The Buyer agrees to treat, and agrees to cause the Company to treat, the
distribution made by the Company on March 21, 2016 as a "qualified designated
distribution" in accordance with Treasury Regulation §1.857-11 and Section
852(e) of the Code. The Buyer further agrees not to treat, and agrees not to
cause the Company to treat, any portion of such distribution, or any other
distribution made by the Company prior to the Closing, as a capital gain
dividend as such term is defined in Section 857(b)(3)(C) of the Code in
respect of any sale or other disposition of an asset after the Closing by the
Company, any Subsidiary of the Company or any other entity in which the
Company holds a direct or indirect equity interest.

Section 4.5 Transaction Costs and Expenses. The Buyer and Seller agree to
comply with all real estate transfer tax Law applicable to the sale of the
Shares. The Buyer shall be responsible for the payment of all real property
transfer taxes (if any), deed recording taxes, conveyance taxes, documentary
stamp taxes or other similar Taxes or charges payable as a result of the
conveyance of the Shares to the Buyer pursuant to this Agreement. Except as
provided in the preceding sentence or as otherwise expressly set forth in this
Agreement, each party shall be responsible for its costs (including fees and
expenses of its Representatives) incurred in connection with this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby, whether or not the Closing occurs.

Section 4.6 Confidentiality.

(e) The parties acknowledge that the Company and SUI entered into the
confidentiality agreement, dated November 11, 2015 (the "Confidentiality
Agreement"), 

which agreement shall be deemed incorporated in this Agreement as if it were
set forth herein in its entirety. Upon the Closing the Confidentiality
Agreement shall terminate and be of no further force and effect, except with
respect to information regarding Seller and its Affiliates (other than the
Company and its Subsidiaries).

(f) From the Closing Date until the second anniversary of the Closing Date,
Seller agrees to, and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause its
Representatives to: (i) treat and hold as confidential any and all non-public
information relating to the Company and Subsidiaries, (ii) in the event that
Seller or any such Representative becomes legally compelled to disclose any
such information, to the extent legally permissible, provide the Buyer with
prompt written notice of such requirement so that the Buyer, the Company or
any Subsidiary may seek a protective order or other remedy or waive compliance
with this Section 4.6, and (iii) in the event that such protective order or
other remedy is not obtained, or the Buyer waives compliance with this Section
4.6, furnish only that portion of such confidential information which is
legally required to be provided and exercise its reasonable best efforts (at
Buyer's expense) to obtain assurances that confidential treatment will be
accorded such information; provided, however, that this sentence shall not
apply to any information that, at the time of disclosure, is available
publicly and was not disclosed in breach of this Agreement by the Seller or
its Representatives; provided further that Seller, its Affiliates and their
Representatives may disclose such information to limited partners or members,
prospective limited partners or members or investors or prospective investors
(including lenders and prospective lenders) of Seller or any of its Affiliates
who are subject to confidentiality obligations with respect to such
information.

Section 4.7 Employee Benefits.

(a) Until December 31, 2016, the Company shall provide to each employee of the
Company and its Subsidiaries who remains employed with the Company or its
Subsidiaries following the Closing Date (each, an "Employee") compensation and
benefits that are substantially similar in the aggregate to those in effect
immediately prior to the Closing Date.

(b) Following the Closing, (i) the Buyer shall cause the Company and its
Subsidiaries to ensure that no limitations or exclusions (other than to the
extent applicable to any Employee immediately prior to the Closing under any
Company Plan) as to pre-existing conditions, evidence of insurability or good
health, waiting periods or other limitations or restrictions on coverage apply
to any Employees or their dependents or beneficiaries under any welfare
benefit plans in which such Employees may be eligible to participate, and (ii)
the Buyer shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to provide or cause to
be provided, that any costs or expenses incurred by the Employees (and their
dependents or beneficiaries) through the Closing during the applicable plan
year in which the Closing occurs are taken into account for purposes of
satisfying applicable deductibles, co-payments, maximum out-of-pocket
provisions and similar limitations on coverage under any such welfare benefit
plans. Following the Closing, the Buyer shall or shall cause the Company and
its Subsidiaries to grant or cause to be granted to all current Employees from
and after the Closing credit for all 

service with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (and their respective
predecessors) prior to the Closing for purposes of eligibility to participate
and vesting credit (but not benefit accrual) with respect to each employee
benefit plan, policy or practice, sponsored or maintained by the Buyer, the
Company or any of their Subsidiaries; provided, however, that such service
credit shall not be recognized to the extent that such recognition would
result in a duplication of benefits or the funding thereof with respect to the
same period of service or with respect to newly implemented plans for which
prior service is not taken into account.

(c) The provisions of this Section 4.7 are solely for the benefit of the
parties to this Agreement and no current or former employee, officer, director
or independent contractor of the Company or its Subsidiaries, or any other
individual associated therewith shall be regarded for any purpose as a third-
party beneficiary of this Agreement. Nothing in this Agreement shall (i) be
construed as establishment of or an amendment to any Company Plan or other
employee benefit plan for any purpose, (ii) alter or limit the ability of the
Buyer or any of its Affiliates to amend, modify or terminate any Company Plan
in accordance with the terms and conditions thereof or (iii) prevent the Buyer
or the Company or any of their Affiliates from terminating the employment of
any Employee after the Closing Date.

Section 4.8 Resignations. Seller agrees (i) to use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain and deliver to the Buyer at the Closing evidence reasonably
satisfactory to the Buyer of the resignation, effective as of the Closing, of
all directors, officers or managers, as applicable, of the Company or any
Subsidiary other than any independent directors (or springing managers)
required in connection with any of the Existing Loans, or (ii) to cause such
directors, officers or managers to be removed from their positions as such
effective as of the Closing.

Section 4.9 Termination of Affiliate Arrangements. Seller shall cause any
Contract that is disclosed (or should have been disclosed) in Section
2.17(a)(xi) of the Disclosure Schedules, other than those Contracts set forth
in Section 4.9 of the Disclosure Schedules, to be terminated effective as of
no later than the Closing without any ongoing liability on the part of the
Company or any Subsidiary.



Section 4.10 Release. Effective as of the Closing, Seller, on behalf of itself
and its Affiliates, hereby irrevocably and unconditionally releases the
Company and its Subsidiaries, and each of their respective officers, directors
and employees, from any and all Actions, liabilities and obligations, and
agrees not to bring or threaten to bring or otherwise join in any Actions
against such Person, relating to, arising out of or in connection with any
facts or circumstances which existed on or prior to the Closing Date.

Section 4.11 Notice of Developments. Prior to the Closing, each party hereto
shall promptly notify the other party hereto in writing, if, to the knowledge
of such party (a) there is any event, circumstance, fact or occurrence arising
subsequent to the date of this Agreement which is reasonably expected to
result in a breach of a representation or warranty or covenant such that it
would be reasonable to expect that the applicable closing conditions would be
incapable of being satisfied by the Outside Date; provided that, (a) nothing
in this Section 4.11 shall be deemed to affect, modify or condition the
obligations of each party to effect the Closing 

and the Buyer's obligation to pay the Purchase Price in accordance with the
terms hereof and (b) each party's obligations, actions or inactions pursuant
to this Section 4.11 shall be deemed excluded for purposes of determining
whether the conditions set forth in either Section 5.2(b) or Section 5.3(b)
have been satisfied.

Section 4.12 Lender Consents.

(c) Each of Seller and the Buyer shall use its commercially reasonable efforts
to obtain written consent of the Existing Lender Parties with respect to the
Existing Loans to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or written
confirmation that no such consent is required ("Lender Consents"). In
connection with obtaining any Lender Consent, notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, without the prior written consent of the Buyer,
prior to the Closing, Seller shall not permit the Company or any Subsidiary to
(x) pay or commit to pay to such Person whose approval or consent is being
solicited any cash or other consideration, make any commitment or incur any
liability or other obligation due to such Person, unless such payment,
liability or obligation is fully satisfied prior to the Closing or (y) modify
the terms of any Existing Loan in any material respect.

(d) In the event that the Existing Lender Parties under an Existing Loan
require the payment of any consent fees, assumption fees or similar fees as a
condition to granting consent under the Existing Loans with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the "Assumed Loan Assumption
Fees"), the Buyer shall be responsible for the payment of all such Assumed
Loan Assumption Fees, together with any costs or expenses of the applicable
Existing Lender Party that are reimbursable under the terms of the Existing
Loans. In the event a Lender Consent is not obtained (i) with respect to one
or more Existing Loans, the Buyer shall nevertheless be obligated to complete
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement without any adjustment to the
Base Purchase Price and (ii) with respect to the NHC Loans, and as a result
thereof, the Company or any Subsidiary is required to prepay or defease any
NHC Loan, the Buyer shall be responsible for the payment of all prepayment
penalties, defeasance fees and expenses, breakage costs and make-whole
premiums and other fees, premiums or expenses resulting from the prepayment or
defeasement of such NHC Loan.

Section 4.13 Financing.

(u) Subject to applicable Law, prior to the Closing, Seller shall, and Seller
shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to use their reasonable best
efforts to provide all cooperation reasonably requested in writing by the
Buyer in connection with Buyer arranging debt financing (in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) with respect to the Company,
its Subsidiaries or the Company Real Properties through debt financing sources
that have been approved by Seller pursuant to the Confidentiality Agreement
(the "Debt Financing"); provided, however, that (i) nothing herein shall
require such cooperation to the extent it would unreasonably interfere with
the business or operations of Seller, the Company or its Subsidiaries or
require Seller, the Company or its Subsidiaries (or any Affiliate thereof) to
agree to pay any fees, reimburse any expenses, or give any indemnities prior
to the Closing, (2) neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be 

required to enter into any definitive agreement related to any proposed Debt
Financing that is not contingent upon the Closing or that would be effective
prior to the Closing and (3) neither the Company's board of directors nor any
of its Subsidiaries' boards of directors (or equivalent bodies) shall be
required to approve any Debt Financing or agreements related thereto at or
prior to the Closing. By way of illustration and not limitation, promptly upon
request by the Buyer, Sellers shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to
promptly notify the applicable Existing Lender Parties upon notice by Buyer
that it is electing to pay-off any Existing Loans. None of the
representations, warranties or covenants of Seller set forth in this Agreement
shall be deemed to apply to, or deemed breached or violated by, any of the
actions taken by Seller, the Company or its Subsidiaries pursuant to this
Section 4.13.

(v) The Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to have all Affiliates of
Seller (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries) and all executive
officers of the Company released from any continuing obligations under any
guarantees, indemnities or similar instruments executed in connection with the
Existing Loans set forth on Section 4.13(b) of the Disclosure Schedules (the
"Specified Existing Loans") and cause such guaranties, indemnities and similar
instruments to be terminated with no further force or effect as of the Closing
(collectively, the "Guarantor Release"). The Buyer shall execute and deliver
such information and documents as reasonably requested by the Existing Lender
Parties and/or any applicable rating agencies in connection with obtaining the
Guarantor Release. In connection with obtaining a Guarantor Release, the Buyer
shall provide the Existing Lender Parties with any such documents and/or
reaffirmations as may be reasonably required by the Existing Lender Parties
and/or any applicable rating agencies, including, without limitation,
replacement guarantees from Buyer. The Buyer shall use its reasonable best
efforts to have the SUI Shares to be issued to Seller at Closing to be
approved for listing on the New York Stock Exchange, subject to official
notice of issuance, prior to the Closing Date.

(w) Subject to applicable Law, prior to the Closing, Seller shall, and Seller
shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to use their reasonable best
efforts to provide all cooperation reasonably requested in writing by the
Buyer in connection with enabling Buyer and its Representatives to prepare
financial statements in compliance with the requirements of Rule 3-14 of
Regulation S-X for use in a registered offering of equity by Buyer (or an
Affiliate) in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and enable Buyer's accountants or Moss Adams to audit such financial
statements, including, if requested by Buyer, using reasonable best efforts to
(x) provide a customary representation letter in such form as is reasonably
required by Buyer's accountants or Moss Adams, as applicable, with such facts
and assumptions as reasonably determined by such accountants in order to make
such certificate accurate, signed by the individual(s) responsible for the
Company's financial reporting, as prescribed by generally accepted auditing
standards as promulgated by the Auditing Standards Divisions of the American
Institute of Public Accountants in order to enable an independent public
accountant to render an opinion on such financial statements, (y) cause the
auditor of the Company's financial statements to provide its consent to the
inclusion of such report, without exception or qualification, with respect to
the Audited Financial Statements, and (z) to provide to Buyer and its
underwriters appropriate comfort letters in accordance with the American
Institute of Public Accountants' professional standards and to 

participate in due diligence sessions customarily conducted in connection with
the provision of comfort letters.

(x) The Buyer shall, promptly upon request by Seller, reimburse Seller for all
reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred by Seller, the Company or its
Subsidiaries in performing their obligations under this Section 4.13 (and such
out-pocket-costs shall not be Seller Transaction Expenses or Current
Liabilities if such expenses are not reimbursed prior to the Closing), and
indemnify Seller for any and all liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs,
expenses, interest, awards, judgments and penalties suffered or incurred by
Seller, the Company, its Subsidiaries or their respective Representatives
arising therefrom (and in the event the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement are not consummated, the Buyer shall promptly reimburse Seller for
any out-of-pocket costs not previously reimbursed).

(y) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 4.13, the
condition set forth in Section 5.2(b), as it applies to the obligations of
Seller under this Section 4.13, shall automatically be deemed satisfied, and
Seller shall not be deemed to be in breach of this Section 4.13 for any
purposes, except to the extent Seller has materially and willfully breached
its obligations under this Section 4.13, the Buyer has provided to Seller
written notice of such breach within ten (10) Business Days of first becoming
aware of such breach and Seller fails to cure such breach by the earlier of
ten (10) Business Days after such notice is provided or the Outside Date.

(z) The Buyer acknowledges and agrees that (i) the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall not be conditioned on, or
delayed or postponed as a result of the obtaining of (or the failure to
obtain) the Debt Financing, any equity financing contemplated by Section
4.13(c) or any Lender Consents, (ii) it shall continue to be obligated to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement irrespective and
independently of the availability of the Debt Financing, any equity financing
contemplated by Section 4.13(c) and any Lender Consents and (iii) none of the
representations, warranties or covenants of Seller set forth in this Agreement
shall be deemed to be breached or violated by the failure to obtain any Lender
Consents.

(aa) All non-public or otherwise confidential information regarding Seller,
the Company and the Subsidiaries obtained by the Buyer or its Representatives
pursuant to Section 4.13 above shall be kept confidential in accordance with
the Confidentiality Agreement.

Section 4.14 Efforts.

foregoing, each of the Buyer (and its Affiliates) and Seller shall use its

objection or assertion by any Governmental Authority challenging this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and (vi) execute and deliver
any additional instruments necessary to consummate the transactions

(e) Without limiting the generality of anything contained in this Section
4.14, each party hereto shall: (i) give the other party prompt notice of the
making or commencement of any request, inquiry, investigation, action or legal
proceeding by or before any Governmental Authority with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (ii) keep the other party
informed as to the status of any such request, inquiry, investigation, action

and cooperate with the other party and will consider in good faith the views
of the other party in connection with any filing, analysis, appearance,
presentation, memorandum, brief, argument, opinion or proposal made or
submitted in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
In addition, except as may be prohibited by any Governmental Authority or by
any Law, in connection with any such request, inquiry, investigation, action
or legal proceeding, each party hereto will permit authorized representatives
of the other party to be present at each meeting or conference relating to
such request, inquiry, investigation, action or legal proceeding and to have
access to and be consulted in connection with any document, opinion or
proposal made or submitted to any Governmental Authority in connection with
such request, inquiry, investigation, action or legal proceeding.

Section 4.15 Exclusivity. From the date of this Agreement through the earlier

and Seller shall direct the Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective
Representatives not to, directly or indirectly (a) solicit, initiate or engage
in any discussions or negotiations with any Person (other than Buyer and its
Representatives) relating to any transaction involving the acquisition of any
Company Real Property, the acquisition of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (whether directly or indirectly by way of merger, consolidation,
purchase of shares, purchase of assets or otherwise) or the acquisition of a
material portion of the shares of capital stock, membership interests, other
equity securities or assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (an
"Alternative 

Transaction"), (b) encourage or knowingly facilitate any inquiries, proposals,
or offers by any Person (other than Buyer and its Representatives)) relating
to an Alternative Transaction or (c) provide any non-public information with
respect to any Company Real Property, the Company or its Subsidiaries to any
Person (other than Buyer and its Representatives) to the extent relating to an
Alternative Transaction.

Section 4.16 Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance.

(a) Without limiting any additional rights that any Person may have under any
Company Plan, from the Closing Date through the sixth anniversary of the date
on which the Closing Date occurs, Buyer shall cause the Company to indemnify
and hold harmless each present (as of immediately prior to the Closing) and
former officer, director, employee or agent of the Company and its
Subsidiaries (the "Indemnified Individuals") against all claims, losses,
liabilities, damages, judgments, inquiries, fines and reasonable fees, costs
and expenses, including attorneys' fees and disbursements, incurred in
connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining
to the fact that the Indemnified Individual is or was an officer, director,
employee or agent of the Company or its Subsidiaries, whether asserted or
claimed prior to, at or after the Closing, to the extent provided or permitted
under the existing certificate of incorporation and bylaws (or equivalent
governing documents) of each of the Company and its Subsidiaries and to the
fullest extent permitted under applicable Law. In the event of any such claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation, (x) each Indemnified Individual
will be entitled to advancement of expenses incurred in the defense of any
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation from Buyer or the Company
within ten (10) Business Days of receipt by Buyer from the Indemnified
Individual of a request therefor, (y) neither Buyer nor the Company shall
settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any proceeding
or threatened action, suit, proceeding, investigation or claim (and in which
indemnification could be sought by such Indemnified Individual hereunder),
unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional
release of such Indemnified Individual from all liability arising out of such
action, suit, proceeding, investigation or claim or such Indemnified
Individual otherwise consents and (z) the Buyer and Company shall cooperate in
the defense of any such matter.

(b) The certificate of incorporation and bylaws (or equivalent governing
documents) of each of the Company and its Subsidiaries shall contain
provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification, advancement of
expenses and exculpation of former or present directors, managers and officers
than are set forth in the organizational documents of the Company (or
equivalent governing documents) as of the date hereof, which provisions shall
not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six years from
the Closing Date in any manner that would adversely affect the rights
thereunder of any such individual.

(c) Buyer shall cause the Company to purchase a "tail" insurance policy for a
period of six years after the Closing Date, with reputable and financially
sound carriers of at least the same coverage and amounts and containing terms
and conditions that are no less 

advantageous than the current policies of directors' and officers' liability
insurance maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to
claims arising from or related to facts or events that occurred at or before
the Closing; provided, however, that in no event shall Buyer be required to
expend, for the entire tail policy, in excess of 200% of the annual premium
currently paid by the Company and its Subsidiaries for their current policy of
directors' and officers' liability insurance. Buyer agrees to take all
necessary actions to maintain such policies in full force and effect and
fulfill its obligations thereunder throughout such six-year period following

(c) When a reference is made in this Agreement to Sections, Schedules or
Exhibits, such reference shall be to a Section, Schedule or Exhibit of this
Agreement, respectively, unless otherwise indicated. Whenever the words
"include," "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be
deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation". The words "hereof,"
"herein" and "hereunder" and words of similar import when used in this
Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not any particular
provision of this Agreement. The term "or" is not exclusive. The definitions
contained in this Agreement are applicable to the singular as well as the
plural forms of such terms. References to a Person are also to its permitted
successors and assigns. Whenever the context may require, any pronoun shall
include the corresponding masculine, feminine and neuter forms. Unless the
context otherwise requires, all references to an agreement instrument or other
document means such agreement, instrument or other document as amended,
supplemented and modified from time to time to the extent permitted by the
provisions thereof. As used in this Agreement, the phrase "made available"
shall mean that the referenced document or other material was posted, and
accessible by Buyer and its representatives for no less than three (3) days
prior to the date of this Agreement, in Seller's electronic data room hosted
by Seller (the "Data Room"). The Data Room shall remain accessible through the
Closing Date and the parties shall cooperate in good faith to obtain a
permanent record of the documents and other instruments posted to the Data
Room as of one (1) day prior to the date of this Agreement and the Closing
Date.

Section 7.4 Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law, or public
policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term
or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to
effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in a mutually
acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby be
consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.
Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, the
parties intend that the remedies and limitations set forth in Article VI and
Section 7.6 are to each be construed as an integral provision of this
Agreement and that such remedies and limitations shall not be severable in any
respect.

Section 7.5 Entire Agreement; Assignment. This Agreement and the
Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement among the parties
hereto with respect to the subject 

matter hereof and thereof and supersede all prior agreements and undertakings,
both written and oral, among the parties hereto, or any of them, with respect
to the subject matter hereof and thereof. This Agreement shall not be assigned
(whether pursuant to a merger, by operation of law or otherwise) by either
party without the prior written consent of the other party. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the Buyer may assign this Agreement to one or more of its
Affiliates without the consent of Seller; provided that any such assignment by
the Buyer shall not relieve the Buyer of any liability or obligation
hereunder; provided, further, that any such assignment shall not impede or
delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Any
assignment or transfer in violation of the preceding sentence shall be void.

Section 7.6 No Third Party Beneficiaries; No Recourse. Except for Section
4.16, which shall be for the benefit of each Indemnified Individual, his or
her heirs, executors or administrators and his or her representatives, each of
which is hereby intended to be an express third party beneficiary thereof,
this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of each
party hereto, and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended
to or shall confer upon any other Person any right, benefit or remedy of any
nature whatsoever (including as a third party beneficiary) under or by reason
of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, neither
the former, current or future members, managers, employees or agents of the
Buyer or Seller or any of their Affiliates, nor the former, current or future
shareholders, partners, members, Affiliates, associates, officers, directors,
employees, agents or other Representatives of any of them shall be liable
under this Agreement or for any claim (whether in tort, contract or otherwise)
based on, in respect of, or by reason of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or by respect of any oral representation made
or alleged to be made in connection herewith.

Section 7.7 Specific Performance. Each party hereto agrees that irreparable
damage may occur to a party if any provision of this Agreement were breached
or not performed by the other party in accordance with the terms hereof. It is
accordingly agreed that each party hereto shall be entitled to seek an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement by the other
party hereto and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement, in addition to any other remedy, at law or in equity, to which it
is entitled. Each party further agrees that (A) no such party will oppose the
granting of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief as
provided herein on the basis that the other party has an adequate remedy at
law or that an award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for
any reason at law or equity and (B) no other party or any other Person shall
be required to obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar instrument in
connection with or as a condition to obtaining any remedy referred to in this
Section 7.7, and each party irrevocably waives any right it may have to
require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or similar
instrument.

Section 7.8 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by, interpreted
under, and construed and enforced in accordance with, the Law of the State of
Delaware, not taking into account any rules of conflicts laws that would cause
the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction. 

Section 7.9 Submission to Jurisdiction. Each of the parties irrevocably agrees
that any legal action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this
Agreement brought by any other party or its successors or assigns shall be
brought and determined in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or,
if such court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, any state or federal court in
the State of Delaware, and each of the parties hereby irrevocably submits to
the exclusive jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts for itself and with respect
to its property, generally and unconditionally, with regard to any such action
or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby. Each of the parties agrees not to commence any action,
suit or proceeding relating thereto except in the courts described above in
Delaware, other than actions in any court of competent jurisdiction to enforce
any judgment, decree or award rendered by any such court in Delaware as
described herein. Each of the parties further agrees that notice as provided
herein shall constitute sufficient service of process and the parties further
waive any argument that such service is insufficient. Each of the parties
hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, and agrees not to assert, by
way of motion or as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any action or
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, (a) any claim that it is not personally subject to the
jurisdiction of the courts in Delaware as described herein for any reason, (b)
that it or its property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such
court or from any legal process commenced in such courts (whether through
service of notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of
execution of judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise) and (c) that (i)
the suit, action or proceeding in any such court is brought in an inconvenient
forum, (ii) the venue of such suit, action or proceeding is improper or (iii)
this Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by
such courts.

Section 7.10 WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY WAIVES TO
THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A
TRIAL BY JURY WITH RESPECT TO ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING
OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS. EACH
OF THE PARTIES HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY
OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER
PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THAT FOREGOING
WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTY HERETO HAVE BEEN
INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE TRANSACTIONS, AS APPLICABLE, BY,
AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION
7.10.

Section 7.11 Headings. The descriptive headings contained in this Agreement
are included for convenience of reference only and shall not affect in any way
the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

Section 7.12 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed and delivered
(including by facsimile transmission) in one or more counterparts, and by the
different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when executed
shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken together shall
constitute one and the same agreement. A signed copy of this 

Agreement transmitted by facsimile, email or other means of electronic
transmission shall be deemed to have the same legal effect as delivery of an
original executed copy of this Agreement for all purposes.

Section 7.13 Further Assurances. From time to time, as and when requested by
any party hereto, the other party shall execute and deliver, or cause to be
executed and delivered, all such documents and instruments and shall take, or
cause to be taken, all such further or other actions as such other party may
reasonably deem necessary or desirable to transfer the Shares to the Buyer or
otherwise consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, subject
to the terms and conditions set forth herein; provided, however, that no such
instrument or document shall expand a party's liability beyond that
contemplated in this Agreement and the cost thereof shall be borne by the
party making the request.

Section 7.14 Construction. The parties acknowledge that the parties and their
counsel have reviewed and revised this Agreement and that any rule of
construction to the effect that any ambiguities are to be resolved against the
drafting party shall not be employed in the interpretation of this Agreement,
any Schedules, exhibits or amendments hereto.

Section 7.15 Amendment; Waiver.

(a) Any provision of this Agreement, the Disclosure Schedules or any exhibits
hereto may be amended, modified, supplemented or waived only by amendment,
modification, supplementation or waiver in writing and signed: (i) in the case
of an amendment to this Agreement, the Disclosure Schedules or any exhibits
hereto, by Seller and the Buyer; or (ii) in the case of a waiver, by the party
against whom the waiver is to be effective. Oral modification of this
Agreement is not permitted, and each of Seller and the Buyer hereby waives any
right to claim an oral modification of this Agreement.

(b) No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power or
privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or
partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The rights and remedies in
this Agreement provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any other
rights or remedies in this Agreement provided or available at Law or in
equity.

Section 7.16 Time is of the Essence. With regard to all dates and time periods
set forth or referred to in this Agreement, time is of the essence.

Section 7.17 Disclosure Schedules. The information in the Disclosure Schedules
constitutes (i) exceptions or qualifications to representations, warranties,
covenants and obligations of Seller as set forth in this Agreement or (ii)
descriptions or lists of assets and liabilities and other items referred to in
this Agreement. The section number headings in the Disclosure Schedules
correspond to the section numbers in this Agreement and any information
disclosed in any section of the Disclosure Schedules shall be deemed to be
disclosed and incorporated into any other section of the Disclosure Schedules
to the extent that it would be reasonably apparent on the face of such
disclosure that such matter is applicable to such other 

section of the Disclosure Schedules. The Disclosure Schedules shall not be
construed as indicating that any disclosed information is required to be
disclosed, and no disclosure shall be construed as an admission that such
information is material to, or required to be disclosed by, Seller. Seller
may, at its option, include in the Disclosure Schedules items that are not
material, and such inclusion, or any references to dollar amounts, shall not
be deemed to be an acknowledgement or representation that such items are
material, to establish any standard of materiality or to define further the
meaning of such terms (including Material Adverse Effect) for purposes of this
Agreement. No disclosure on the Disclosure Schedules relating to a possible
breach or violation of any Contract or Law shall be construed as an admission
or indication that a breach or violation exists or has actually occurred. The
Disclosure Schedules constitute a part of this Agreement and are incorporated
into this Agreement for all purposes as if fully set forth herein. Capitalized
terms used in the Disclosure Schedules that are not defined therein shall have
the meanings given them in this Agreement.

Section 7.18 Legal Representation. It is acknowledged by each of the parties
hereto that Seller and its Affiliates have retained Simpson Thacher and Bartlett
LLP ("STB") to act as its legal counsel in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby and that STB has not acted as counsel for any other party
in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, and that the other
party does not have the status of a client of STB for conflict of interest or
any other purposes as a result thereof. The Buyer and Seller hereby agree
that, in the event that a dispute arises after the Closing relating to this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, STB may represent Seller
and its Affiliates (collectively, "Centerbridge") in such dispute even though
the interests of Centerbridge may be directly adverse to the Buyer, the
Company or any of their respective Affiliates, and even though STB formerly
may have represented the Company or any of its Affiliates in a matter
substantially related to such dispute. The Buyer further agrees that, in
connection with any future dispute after the Closing between the Buyer, the
Company or any of their respective Affiliates, on the one hand, and
Centerbridge, on the other hand, with respect to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, as to all communications among STB, the Company, any of the
Company's Subsidiaries and Centerbridge that relate in any way to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the attorney-client privilege and
the expectation of client confidence belongs to Centerbridge and may be
controlled by Centerbridge and shall not pass to or be claimed by the Buyer,
the Company or any of their respective Affiliates.
