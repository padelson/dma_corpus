CONSIDERATION; EXCHANGE PROCEDURES  

 3.01. _Effect on Capital Stock._ Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, at the Effective Time, automatically by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of any Person:   ##### 

 

 (a) _Outstanding Company Common Stock._ Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Treasury Stock and any Dissenting Shares) shall become and be converted into that number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio.  

 (b) _Outstanding Parent Common Stock._ Each share of Parent Common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain issued and outstanding and shall be unaffected by the Merger.  

 (c) _Treasury Stock._ Each share of Company Stock held as Treasury Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and retired at the Effective Time and no consideration shall be issued in exchange therefor.  

 3.02 _Rights as Shareholders; Stock Transfers._ At the Effective Time, holders of Company Stock shall cease to be, and shall have no rights as, shareholders of the Company other than to receive the Merger consideration provided under this Article III and any declared and unpaid dividends with respect to Company Common Stock and any declared and unpaid dividends or other distributions with respect to the Parent Common Stock included in the Merger consideration as provided in Section 3.05(b). After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company or the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Stock.  

 3.03 _Fractional Shares._   

 (a) No certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of a Certificate or Certificates, and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights as a stockholder of the Surviving Corporation.  

 (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, each holder of shares of Company Common Stock converted into shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to the Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after taking into account all Certificates delivered by such holder) shall, at the time of surrender of the Certificate or Certificates representing such holderÂ’s shares of Company Common Stock, receive an amount of cash (without interest) equal to the product arrived at by multiplying such fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock by the closing price of a share of Parent Common Stock on the NYSE on the Business Day preceding the Effective Time (as reported in _The Wall Street Journal_ , or if not reported therein, in another authoritative source), rounded to the nearest whole cent.  

 3.04. _Dissenting Shares._ Each outstanding share of Company Common Stock the holder of which has perfected his or her right to dissent from the Merger under the MBCL and has not effectively withdrawn or lost such right as of the Effective Time (the "Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into, or represent a right to receive, shares of Parent Common Stock hereunder, and the holder thereof shall be entitled only to such rights as are granted by such provisions of the MBCL. If any holder of Dissenting Shares shall fail to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost the right to dissent, the Dissenting Shares held by such holder shall thereupon be treated as though such Dissenting Shares had been converted into the right to receive shares of Parent Common Stock to which such holder would be entitled pursuant to   ##### 

 

Section 3.01(a) hereof. The Company shall give Parent prompt notice
upon receipt by the Company of any such written demands for payment of the
fair value of shares of Company Common Stock and of withdrawals of such
demands and any other instruments provided pursuant to the MBCL. Any payments
made in respect of Dissenting Shares shall be made by the Surviving
Corporation.  

 3.05. _Exchange Procedures._   

 (a) At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent for the benefit of the holders of Certificates, for exchange in accordance with this Article III, certificates representing the shares of Parent Common Stock, and cash in lieu of any fractional shares (such cash and certificates for shares of Parent Common Stock, together with any dividends or distributions with respect thereto, being referred to as the "Exchange Fund"), to be issued in exchange for outstanding shares of Company Common Stock. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the stockholders of the Company as of the first anniversary of the Effective Date shall be paid to Parent. Any former stockholders of the Company who have not theretofore complied with this Article III shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of the shares of Parent Common Stock, cash in lieu of any fractional shares and any unpaid dividends and distributions on the Parent Common Stock deliverable in respect of each share of the Company Common Stock, as the case may be, such stockholder holds as determined pursuant to this Agreement, in each case, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, the Company, the Exchange Agent or any other person shall be liable to any former holder of shares of the Company Common Stock for any amount delivered in good faith to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.  

 (b) At or after the Effective Time, each holder of a Certificate or Certificates, upon surrender of the same to the Exchange Agent, shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a certificate or certificates representing the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock into which the shares of Company Common Stock theretofore represented by the Certificate or Certificates so surrendered shall have been converted as provided in Section 3.01(a) hereof. As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, but in no event later than five Business Days after the CompanyÂ’s transfer agent delivers a certified shareholdersÂ’ list to the Exchange Agent, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder of record of an outstanding Certificate which is to be exchanged for Parent Common Stock as provided in Section 3.01(a) hereof, a form of letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to such Certificate shall pass, only upon delivery of such Certificate to the Exchange Agent) advising such holder of the terms of the exchange effected by the Merger and of the procedure for surrendering to the Exchange Agent such Certificate in exchange for a certificate or certificates evidencing Parent Common Stock or cash in lieu of any fractional share interest. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, Certificates surrendered for exchange by any Company Affiliate shall not be exchanged for certificates representing shares of Parent Common Stock in accordance with the terms of this Agreement until Parent has received a written agreement from such person as specified in Section 6.15.  

 (c) No holder of a Certificate shall be entitled to receive any dividends in respect of the Parent Common Stock into which such shares shall have been converted by virtue of the Merger until the certificate representing such shares is surrendered in exchange for a certificate or certificates representing shares of Parent Common Stock. In the event that dividends are   ##### 

 

declared and paid by Parent in respect of Parent Common Stock after
the Effective Time but prior to any holderÂ’s surrender of Certificates,
dividends payable to such holder in respect of shares of Parent Common Stock
not then issued shall accrue (without interest). Any such dividends shall be
paid (without interest) upon surrender of the Certificates. Parent shall
be entitled, after the Effective Time, to treat Certificates as
evidencing ownership of the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock
into which the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such
Certificates shall have been converted pursuant to this Agreement,
notwithstanding the failure on the part of the holder thereof to surrender
such Certificates.  

 (d) The Exchange Agent and Parent, as the case may be, shall not be obligated to deliver a certificate or certificates representing shares of Parent Common Stock to which a holder of Company Common Stock would otherwise be entitled as a result of the Merger until such holder surrenders a Certificate or Certificates for exchange as provided in this Section 3.04, or, in default thereof, an appropriate affidavit of loss and indemnity agreement and/or a bond in an amount as may be required in each case by Parent. If any certificate evidencing shares of Parent Common Stock is to be issued in a name other than that in which the Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a condition of the issuance thereof that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the person requesting such exchange pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other tax required by reason of the issuance of a certificate for shares of Parent Common Stock in any name other than that of the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or otherwise establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or is not payable.  

 3.06. _Anti-Dilution Provisions._ If, between the date hereof and the Effective Time, the shares of Parent Common Stock shall be changed into a different number or class of shares by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares or readjustment, or a stock dividend thereon shall be declared with a record date within said period, the Exchange Ratio shall be proportionately adjusted.  

 3.07 _Company Options; Company SARs._   

 (a) At the Effective Time, each Company Option which is then outstanding, whether or not exercisable, shall cease to represent a right to acquire shares of Company Common Stock and shall be converted automatically into an option to purchase shares of Parent Common Stock, and Parent shall assume each Company Option, in accordance with the terms of the applicable Company Stock Option Plan and stock option or other agreement by which it is evidenced, except that from and after the Effective Time, (i) Parent and the Human Resources Committee of its Board of Directors shall be substituted for the Company and the committee of the Company Board (including, if applicable, the entire Company Board) administering such Company Stock Option Plan, (ii) each Company Option assumed by Parent may be exercised solely for shares of Parent Common Stock, (iii) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to such Company Option shall be equal to the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, provided that any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock resulting from such multiplication shall be rounded to the nearest share, and (iv) the per share exercise price under each such Company Option shall be adjusted by dividing the per share exercise price under each such Company Option by the Exchange Ratio, provided that such exercise price shall be rounded to the nearest cent. Notwithstanding clauses (iii) and (iv) of the preceding sentence, each Company Option which is an "incentive stock option" shall be adjusted as required by Section   ##### 

 

424 of the Code, and the regulations promulgated thereunder, so as not
to constitute a modification, extension or renewal of the option within
the meaning of Section 424(h) of the Code. Parent and the Company agree to
take all necessary steps to effect the foregoing provisions of this Section
3.07.  

 (b) Within five Business Days after the Effective Date, Parent shall file a registration statement on Form S-3 or Form S-8, as the case may be (or any successor or other appropriate forms), with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock subject to the options referred to in paragraph (a) of this Section 3.06 and shall use its reasonable efforts to maintain the current status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained therein for so long as such options remain outstanding in the case of a Form S-8 or, in the case of a Form S-3, until the shares subject to such options may be sold without a further holding period under Rule 144 under the Securities Act.  

 (c) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall pay each holder of a Company SAR, in full satisfaction of such Company SAR, a cash payment in an amount in respect thereof equal to the product of (i) the excess, if any, of the Company SAR Cashout Amount over the exercise price of such Company SAR and (ii) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Company SAR as set forth in the individual Company SAR agreements, less any income or employment tax withholding required under the Code or any provision of state or local law; provided that such amount shall be deferred to the extent the holder of the Company SAR has previously elected in writing to defer any such payment as permitted by the individual Company SAR agreements.

therein. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the
contrary, this Agreement shall be submitted to the shareholders of the
Company for their approval at the Company Meeting and nothing contained
herein shall be deemed to relieve the Company of such obligation.  

 6.03. _Registration Statement._   

 (a) Parent agrees to prepare a registration statement on Form S-4 or other applicable form (as may be amended, the "Registration Statement") to be filed by Parent with the SEC in connection with the issuance of Parent Common Stock in the Merger (including the proxy statement and prospectus and other proxy solicitation materials of the Company constituting a part thereof (the "Proxy Statement/Prospectus") and all related documents). The Company shall prepare and furnish such information relating to it and its directors, officers and shareholders as may be reasonably required in connection with the above-referenced documents based on its knowledge of and access to the information required for said documents, and the Company, and its legal, financial and accounting advisors, shall have the right to review in advance and reasonably approve such Registration Statement prior to its filing. The Company agrees to cooperate with Parent and ParentÂ’s counsel and accountants in requesting and obtaining appropriate opinions, consents and letters from its financial advisor and independent auditor in connection with the Registration Statement and the Proxy Statement/Prospectus. Provided that the Company has cooperated as described above, Parent agrees to file, or cause to be filed, the Registration Statement and the Proxy Statement/Prospectus with the SEC as promptly as reasonably practicable. Each of the Company and Parent agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Registration Statement to be declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as reasonably practicable after the filing thereof. Parent also agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to obtain all necessary state securities law or "blue sky" permits and approvals required to carry out the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. After the Registration Statement is declared effective under the Securities Act, the Company shall promptly mail the Proxy Statement/Prospectus to its shareholders.  

 (b) Parent agrees to advise the Company, promptly after Parent receives notice thereof, of the time when the Registration Statement has become effective or any supplement or amendment has been filed, of the issuance of any stop order or the suspension of the qualification of Parent Common Stock for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, of the initiation or, to the extent Parent is aware thereof, threat of any proceeding for any such purpose, or of any request by the SEC for the amendment or supplement of the Registration Statement or for additional information.  

 6.04 _Regulatory Filings._   

 (a) Each of Parent and the Company and their respective Subsidiaries shall cooperate and use their respective reasonable best efforts to prepare all documentation, to effect all filings and to obtain all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties and Governmental Authorities necessary to consummate the Transactions and any other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Bank Merger Agreement; and any initial filings with Governmental Authorities (other than the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, which is addressed in   ##### 

 

Section 6.03(a)) shall be made by Parent as soon as reasonably
practicable after the execution hereof. Each of Parent and the Company shall
have the right to review in advance, and to the extent practicable each shall
consult with the other, in each case subject to applicable laws relating to
the exchange of information, with respect to all material written
information submitted to any third party or any Governmental Authority in
connection with the Transactions. In exercising the foregoing right, each of
such parties agrees to act reasonably and as promptly as practicable. Each
party hereto agrees that it shall consult with the other parties hereto with
respect to the obtaining of all material permits, consents, approvals and
authorizations of all third parties and Governmental Authorities necessary or
advisable to consummate the Transactions and each party shall keep the other
parties apprised of the status of material matters relating to completion of
the Transactions.  

 (b) Each party agrees, upon request, to furnish the other parties with all information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers and shareholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with any filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of such other parties or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any third party or Governmental Authority.  

 6.05 _Press Releases._ The Company and Parent shall consult with each other before issuing any press release with respect to the Transactions or this Agreement and shall not issue any such press release or make any such public statements without the prior consent of the other party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld; provided, however, that a party may, without the prior consent of the other party (but after such consultation, to the extent practicable in the circumstances), issue such press release or make such public statements as may upon the advice of outside counsel be required by law or, in the case of the Company and Parent, the requirements of Nasdaq and the NYSE, respectively. The Company and Parent shall cooperate to develop all public announcement materials and make appropriate management available at presentations related to the Transactions as reasonably requested by the other party.  

 6.06 _Access; Information._   

 (a) The Company agrees that upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable laws relating to the exchange of information, it shall afford Parent and its officers, employees, counsel, accountants and other authorized representatives such access during normal business hours throughout the period prior to the Effective Time to the books, records (including, without limitation, Tax Returns and work papers of independent auditors), properties and personnel of the Company and its Subsidiaries and to such other information relating to the Company or its Subsidiaries as Parent may reasonably request and, during such period, it shall furnish promptly to Parent all information concerning the business, properties and personnel of the Company or its Subsidiaries as Parent may reasonably request.  

 (b) Parent agrees that upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable laws relating to the exchange of information, it shall afford the Company and its authorized representatives such access to executive officers of Parent and such appropriate information as may be reasonably necessary to confirm the accuracy of the representations and warranties of Parent herein as the Company may reasonably request.  

 (c) All information furnished to Parent by the Company pursuant to Section 6.06(a) or by Parent to the Company pursuant to Section 6.06(b) shall be subject to, and Parent shall   ##### 

 

hold all such information in confidence in accordance with, the provisions
of the Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of November 11, 2003, between
the Company and Parent.  

 (d) No investigation by Parent of the business and affairs of the Company shall affect or be deemed to modify or waive any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement in this Agreement, or the conditions to the obligations of Parent to consummate the Merger.  

 (e) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement or in any other agreement between the parties to the contrary, the Company and Parent (and each of their respective employees, representatives or other agents) may disclose to any and all Persons, without limitation of any kind, the tax treatment and the tax structure of the Transactions and all materials of any kind (including opinions and other tax analyses) that are provided to the taxpayer relating to such tax treatment and tax structure beginning on the earliest of (i) the date of the public announcement of discussions relating to the Transactions, (ii) the date of public announcement of the Transactions or (iii) the date of the execution of an agreement (with or without conditions) to enter into the Transactions, provided, however, that neither the Company nor Parent (nor any of their respective employees, representatives or other agents) may disclose any other information that is not relevant to the tax treatment or the tax structure of the Transactions or any other information to the extent that such disclosure could reasonably be expected to result in a violation of any federal or state securities law.  

 6.07. _No Solicitation by the Company._   

 (a) From the date of this Agreement through the Effective Time, the Company shall not, nor shall it permit any of its Subsidiaries to, nor shall it authorize or permit any of its or its SubsidiariesÂ’ directors, officers or employees or any investment banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other representative retained by it or any of its Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly through another Person, (i) solicit, initiate or encourage (including by way of furnishing information or assistance), or take any other action designed to facilitate or that is likely to result in, any inquiries or the making of any proposal that constitutes, or is reasonably likely to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) enter into any agreement with respect to an Acquisition Proposal, (iii) participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding any Acquisition Proposal or (iv) make or authorize any statement or recommendation in support of any Acquisition Proposal. If, and only to the extent that, (i) the approval of this Agreement by the CompanyÂ’s shareholders has not occurred, (ii) the Company Board reasonably determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that such action would be required in order for directors of the Company to comply with their respective fiduciary duties under applicable law in response to a bona fide, written Acquisition Proposal not solicited in violation of this Section 6.07(a) that the Company Board believes in good faith is a Superior Proposal and (iii) the Company provides notice to Parent of its decision to take such action in accordance with the requirements of Section 6.07(b), the Company may (1) furnish information with respect to the Company to any Person making such an Acquisition Proposal pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement (as determined by the Company after consultation with its outside legal counsel) on terms substantially similar to, and no less favorable to the Company than, the terms contained in any such agreement between the Company and Parent, (2) participate in discussions or negotiations regarding such an Acquisition Proposal and (3) authorize any statement or recommendation in support of such an Acquisition Proposal and effect a Change in Recommendation.   ##### 

 

 (b) The Company shall notify Parent promptly (but in no event later than twenty four (24) hours) after receipt of any Acquisition Proposal, or any material modification of or material amendment to any Acquisition Proposal, or any request for nonpublic information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or for access to the properties, books or records of the Company or any Subsidiary by any Person that informs the Company Board or a member of the senior management of the Company or any Subsidiary that it is considering making, or has made, an Acquisition Proposal. Such notice to Parent shall be made orally and in writing, and shall indicate the identity of the Person making the Acquisition Proposal or intending to make or considering making an Acquisition Proposal or requesting non-public information or access to the books and records of the Company or any Subsidiary, and the material terms of any such Acquisition Proposal and any modification or amendment to such Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall keep Parent fully informed, on a current basis, of any material changes in the status and any material changes or modifications in the terms of any such Acquisition Proposal, indication or request. The Company also shall promptly, and in any event within twenty four (24) hours, notify Parent, orally and in writing, if it enters into discussions or negotiations concerning any Acquisition Proposal in accordance with Section 6.07(a).  

 (c) The Company and its Subsidiaries shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing discussions or negotiations with any Persons (other than Parent) conducted heretofore with respect to any of the foregoing, and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause all Persons other than Parent who have been furnished confidential information regarding the Company in connection with the solicitation of or discussions regarding an Acquisition Proposal within the twelve (12) months prior to the date hereof promptly to return or destroy such information. The Company agrees not to, and to cause its Subsidiaries not to, release any third party from the confidentiality and standstill provisions of any agreement to which the Company or its Subsidiaries is or may become a party, and shall immediately take all steps necessary to terminate any approval that may have been heretofore given under any such provisions authorizing any person to make an Acquisition Proposal.  

 (d) The Company shall ensure that the directors, officers, employees, agents and representatives (including any investment bankers, financial advisors, attorneys, accountants or other retained representatives) of the Company or its Subsidiaries are aware of the restrictions described in this Section 6.07 as reasonably necessary to avoid violations thereof. It is understood that any violation of the restrictions set forth in this Section 6.07 by any director, officer, employee, agent or representative (including any investment banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other retained representative) of the Company or its Subsidiaries, at the direction or with the consent of the Company or its Subsidiaries, shall be deemed to be a breach of this Section 6.06 by the Company.  

 (e) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Company or the Company Board from complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange Act with respect to an Acquisition Proposal, provided that such rules will in no way eliminate or modify the effect that any action pursuant to such rules would otherwise have under this Agreement.  

 6.08 _Certain Policies._ Prior to the Effective Date, each of the Company and its Subsidiaries shall, consistent with GAAP, the rules and regulations of the SEC and applicable banking laws and regulations, modify or change its loan, OREO, accrual, reserve, tax, litigation and real estate valuation policies and practices (including loan classifications and levels of reserves) so as to be applied on a basis that is consistent with that of Parent; provided, however,   ##### 

 

that no such modifications or changes need be made (i) more than five
(5) Business Days prior to the anticipated Effective Date and (ii) unless
Parent agrees in writing that all conditions to Closing set forth in Article
VII have been satisfied or waived (other than those conditions relating to
the delivery of certificates, opinions and other instruments and documents at
the Closing); and further provided that in any event, no accrual or other
action made by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to this
Section 6.08 shall constitute or be deemed to be a breach, violation of or
failure to satisfy any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement,
condition or other provision of this Agreement or otherwise be considered in
determining whether any such breach, violation or failure to satisfy shall
have occurred. The recording of any such adjustments shall not be deemed to
imply any misstatement of previously furnished financial statements or
information and shall not be construed as concurrence of the Company or its
management with any such adjustments.  

 6.09 _Indemnification._   

 (a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent (the "Indemnifying Party") shall indemnify and hold harmless each present and former director, officer and employee of the Company or a Company Subsidiary, as applicable, determined as of the Effective Time (the "Indemnified Parties") against any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneysÂ’ fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, arising in whole or in part out of or pertaining to the fact that he or she was a director, officer, employee, fiduciary or agent of the Company or any Company Subsidiary or is or was serving at the request of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries as a director, officer, employee, fiduciary or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including without limitation matters related to the negotiation, execution and performance of this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, to the fullest extent which such Indemnified Parties would be entitled under the Company Bylaws (including without limitation the provisions thereunder relating to the advancement of expenses), as in effect on the date hereof. Without limiting the foregoing, Parent also agrees that limitations on liability existing in favor of the Indemnified Parties as provided in the Company Articles or similar governing document of the Company Bank and any other Subsidiary of the Company as in effect on the date hereof with respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective Time shall survive the Merger and the Bank Merger and shall continue in full force and effect from and after the Effective Time.  

 (b) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under this Section 6.08, upon learning of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, shall promptly notify the Indemnifying Party, but the failure to so notify shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of any liability it may have to such Indemnified Party except to the extent that such failure actually prejudices the Indemnifying Party. In the event of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before or after the Effective Time), (i) the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Parties will cooperate reasonably in the defense of any such matter, (ii) the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any settlement effected without its prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, and (iii) the Indemnifying Party shall have no obligation hereunder to the extent that indemnification of an Indemnified Party in the manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by applicable laws and regulations or by an applicable federal or state banking agency or a court of competent jurisdiction.   ##### 

 

 (c) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the persons serving as directors and officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time to be covered by the directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’ liability insurance policy maintained by the Company (provided that Parent may substitute therefor policies of at least the same coverage and amounts containing comparable terms and conditions as such policy or single premium tail coverage with policy limits equal to the CompanyÂ’s existing coverage limits and which is not materially less advantageous to such directors and officers) for a six-year period following the Effective Time with respect to acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time which were committed by such directors and officers in their capacities as such, provided that in no event shall Parent be required to expend for any one year more than an amount equal to 200% of the current annual amount expended by the Company to maintain such insurance (the "Insurance Amount"), and further provided that if Parent is unable to maintain or obtain the insurance called for by this Section 6.09(c) as a result of the preceding provision, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain as much comparable insurance as is available for the Insurance Amount.  

 (d) If Parent or any of its successors or assigns shall consolidate with or merge into any other entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving entity of such consolidation or merger or shall transfer all or substantially all of its assets to any other entity, then and in each case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.09.  

 (e) The provisions of this Section 6.9 are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives.  

 6.10 _Employees; Benefit Plans._   

 (a) Prior the Effective Time, Parent shall take all reasonable action so that employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries shall be entitled to participate, effective as soon as administratively practicable following the Effective Time, in each employee benefit plan, program or arrangement of Parent of general applicability (the "Parent Benefit Plans") to the same extent as similarly-situated employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries (it being understood that inclusion of the employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries in the Parent Benefit Plans may occur at different times with respect to different plans), provided, however, that nothing contained herein shall require Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to make any grants to any former employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries under any discretionary equity compensation plan of Parent. To the extent that employees of the Company and its subsidiaries are not entitled to participate in any Parent Benefit Plan effective as of the Effective Time, Parent shall continue the corresponding employee benefit plan, program or arrangement of the Company and its Subsidiaries (other than the Company ESOP) without amendment, except as may be required by applicable law, so as to ensure that there is not a lapse in participation or coverage (but in no event to provide duplicate participation or coverage), as applicable, prior to participation in such Parent Benefit Plan; provided that in no event shall Parent be required to continue any employee benefit plan, program or arrangement of the Company for which there is no corresponding Parent Benefit Plan. Parent shall cause each Parent Benefit Plan in which employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries are eligible to participate to take into account for purposes of eligibility, vesting and benefit accruals under the Parent Benefit Plans (other than ParentÂ’s defined benefit pension plan) the service of such employees with the Company and its Subsidiaries (and any predecessor entities) to the same extent as such service was credited generally for such purpose by the Company and its Subsidiaries, provided, however, that such service shall not be   ##### 

 

recognized to the extent that such recognition would result in a duplication
of benefits with respect to the same period of service. Nothing herein
shall limit the ability of Parent to amend or terminate any of the Company
Benefit Plans in accordance with their terms at any time.  

 (b) At and following the Effective Time, Parent shall honor, and the Surviving Corporation shall continue to be obligated to perform, in accordance with their terms, all benefit obligations to, and contractual rights of, current and former employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries existing as of the Effective Date, as well as all employment, severance or change-in-control agreements of the Company and its Subsidiaries which are identified in Section 5.01(p)(i) of the Company Disclosure Schedule.  

 (c) If employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries become eligible to participate in a medical, dental, health or disability plan of Parent or its Subsidiaries, Parent shall cause each such plan to (i) waive any preexisting condition limitations to the extent such conditions are covered under the applicable medical, health, dental or disability plans of Parent, (ii) honor under such plans any deductible, co-payment and out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the employees and their beneficiaries during the portion of the calendar year prior to such participation and (iii) waive any waiting period limitation or evidence of insurability requirement which would otherwise be applicable to such employee on or after the Effective Time, in each case to the extent such employee had satisfied any similar limitation or requirement under an analogous Plan prior to the Effective Time.  

 (d) For a period of one year following the Effective Time, Parent or Parent Bank, at their sole cost and expense, shall provide all employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries whose employment was terminated other than for cause, disability or retirement at or following the Effective Time, and who so desires, outplacement assistance services in accordance with ParentÂ’s employment policies and practices, shall assist such employees in locating new employment and shall notify all such employees who want to be so notified of opportunities for positions with Parent or any of its Subsidiaries for which Parent reasonably believes such persons are qualified and shall consider any application for such positions submitted by such persons, provided, however, that any decision to offer employment to any such person shall be made in the sole discretion of Parent.  

 (e) All employees of the Company or one of its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time shall become employees of a Parent Subsidiary as of the Effective Time, and Parent or a Parent Subsidiary will use its reasonable best efforts to give such persons (other than any such person who is party to an employment agreement or a severance agreement) at least four weeks prior written notice of any job elimination after the Effective Time for a period of ninety (90) days following the Effective Time. Subject to such four-week notice requirement, Parent or any of its Subsidiaries shall have no obligation to continue the employment of any such person and nothing contained herein shall give any employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries the right to continue employment with Parent or any of its Subsidiaries after the Effective Time. An employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (other than an employee who is party to an employment agreement or a change-in-control agreement) whose employment is involuntarily terminated other than for "cause" (as defined in the Parent employee severance plan provided to the Company) during the one-year following the Effective Time shall be entitled to receive severance payments in accordance with, and to the extent provided in, the Parent employee severance plan with respect to the Transactions, a copy of which the Company acknowledges has been provided to it by Parent. An employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (other   ##### 

 

than an employee who is party to an employment agreement or a change-in-
control agreement) whose employment is involuntarily terminated other than
for "cause" following the first annual anniversary of the Effective
Time shall be entitled to receive severance payments in accordance with, and
to the extent provided in, the Parent employee severance plan generally
applicable to similarly-situated employees of Parent or its Subsidiaries.  

 (f) Prior to December 31, 2003, the Company shall take such corporate action as is necessary to amend the Company ESOPÂ’s minimum required distribution provisions as required by Revenue Procedure 2002-29 and the final Treasury Regulations under Section 401(a)(9) of the Code. As soon as practicable after the date hereof, the Company shall take such corporate action as is necessary to provide that the Company ESOP shall be terminated and that the account of each participant in the Company ESOP shall become fully vested and nonforfeitable, in each case effective as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and subject to the consummation of the Merger. Following the Effective Time, the assets of the Company ESOP shall be distributed to participants in the Company ESOP as soon as reasonably practicable after the receipt of a favorable determination letter on termination of the Company ESOP from the IRS, and Parent shall take the action necessary (including any amendment of ParentÂ’s 401(k) plan) to permit the participants who are employees of Parent or its Subsidiaries as of the date of such distribution to roll any eligible rollover distributions over into ParentÂ’s 401(k) plan. In connection with the termination of the Company ESOP, the Company shall promptly apply to the IRS for a favorable determination letter on the tax-qualified status of the Company ESOP on termination and with respect to any amendments to be made to the Company ESOP in connection with its termination or otherwise, if such amendments have not previously received a favorable determination letter from the IRS with respect to their qualification under Section 401(a) of the Code.  

 6.11. _The Bank Merger._ Parent and the Company agree to take all action necessary and appropriate to cause the Company Bank to merge with and into Parent Bank (the "Bank Merger") in accordance with applicable laws and regulations and the terms of the Bank Merger Agreement, it being the intention of the parties hereto that the Bank Merger be consummated immediately prior to the Merger. Without limiting the foregoing, as soon as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement, (a) Parent shall (i) cause the Board of Directors of Parent Bank to approve the Bank Merger Agreement, (ii) cause Parent Bank to execute and deliver the Bank Merger Agreement and (iii) approve the Bank Merger Agreement in its capacity as the sole shareholder of Parent Bank, and (b) the Company shall (i) cause the Board of Directors of the Company Bank to approve the Bank Merger Agreement, (ii) cause the Company Bank to execute and deliver the Bank Merger Agreement and (iii) approve the Bank Merger Agreement in its capacity as the sole shareholder of the Company Bank. The Bank Merger Agreement shall contain terms that are normal and customary in light of the transactions contemplated hereby and such additional terms as are necessary to carry out the purposes of this Agreement.  

 6.12. _Advice of Changes._ Parent and the Company shall promptly advise the other party of any change or event having, or which could be reasonably expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect on it or which it believes would, or which could reasonably be expected to, cause or constitute a material breach of any of its representations, warranties or covenants contained herein; provided that a failure to comply with this Section 6.12 shall not constitute the failure of any condition set forth in Article VII to be satisfied, or give rise to any right of termination under Section 8.01(d) or (e), unless the underlying Material Adverse Effect or material breach would   ##### 

 

independently result in the failure of a condition set forth in Article VII
to be satisfied or the right to terminate this Agreement under
Section 8.01(d) or (e), as the case may be. From time to time prior to the
Effective Time (and on the date prior to the Closing Date), each party will
supplement or amend its Disclosure Schedules delivered in connection with the
execution of this Agreement to reflect any matter which, if existing,
occurring or known at the date of this Agreement, would have been required to
be set forth or described in such Disclosure Schedules or which is necessary
to correct any information in such Disclosure Schedules which has been
rendered materially inaccurate thereby. No supplement or amendment to such
Disclosure Schedules shall have any effect for the purpose of determining the
accuracy of the representations and warranties of the parties contained in
Article V in order to determine the fulfillment of the conditions set forth
in Sections 7.02(a) or 7.03(a) hereof, as the case may be, or the compliance
by the Company or Parent, as the case may be, with the respective covenants
and agreements of such parties contained herein.  

 6.13. _Current Information._ During the period from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time, the Company will cause one or more of its designated representatives to confer on a regular and frequent basis with representatives of Parent and to report the general status of the ongoing operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries. Without limiting the foregoing, the Company agrees to provide Parent (or make available to Parent in the case of documents filed with the SEC) (i) within ten (10) Business Days following the close of each calendar month between the date hereof and the Effective Time (twenty (20) Business Days in the case of the month of December), a consolidated statement of financial condition at the end of such month and comparative consolidated statements of operations for such month and the same month in the prior year, (ii) a copy of each report filed by the Company and the Company Bank with a Governmental Authority within three (3) Business Days following the filing thereof and (iii) monthly updates of the information required to be set forth in Section 5.01(v)(i) of the Company Disclosure Schedule. The Company will promptly notify Parent of any material change in the normal course of business or in the operation of the properties of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and of any governmental complaints, investigations or hearings (or communications indicating that the same may be contemplated), or the institution or the threat of significant litigation involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and will keep Parent fully informed of such events.  

 6.14. _Transition._ Commencing following the date hereof, Parent and the Company shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to, use their reasonable best efforts to facilitate the integration of the Company and its Subsidiaries, including the Company Bank, with the businesses of Parent and its subsidiaries following consummation of the Merger and the Bank Merger.  

 6.15. _Affiliates._ The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to identify those persons who may be deemed to be "affiliates" of the Company within the meaning of Rule 145 promulgated by the SEC under the Securities Act (the "Company Affiliates") and to cause each person so identified to deliver to Parent as soon as practicable, and in any event prior to the date of the Company Meeting, a written agreement to comply with the requirements of Rule 145 under the Securities Act in connection with the sale or other transfer of Parent Common Stock received in the Merger, which agreement shall be substantially in the form of Exhibit 6.15 hereto.   ##### 

 

 6.16. _Coordination of Dividends._ From the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time, the Company shall coordinate the declaration of any dividends in respect of the Company Common Stock and the record dates and payment dates relating thereto with that of the Parent Common Stock, it being the intention of the parties that the holders of Company Common Stock shall not receive more than one dividend, or fail to receive one dividend, for any single calendar quarter with respect to their shares of Parent Common Stock and/or Company Common Stock and any shares of Parent Common Stock any holder of Company Common Stock receives in exchange therefor in the Merger.  

 6.17. _Stock Exchange Listing._ Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in the Merger to be approved for listing on the NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance, as of the Effective Time.  

 6.18 _Section 16 Matters._ Parent and the Company agree that, in order to most effectively compensate and retain the Company Insiders (as defined below) in connection with the Merger, both prior to and after the Effective Time, it is desirable that the Company Insiders not be subject to a risk of liability under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law in connection with the conversion of Company SARs into cash and shares of the Company Common Stock and the Company Options into shares of Parent Common Stock and options to purchase Parent Common Stock, respectively, in the Merger, and for that compensatory and retentive purpose agree to the provisions of this Section 6.18. Assuming that the Company delivers to Parent the Section 16 Information (as defined below) in a timely fashion, the Parent Board, or a committee of Non-Employee Directors thereof (as such term is defined for purposes of Rule 16b-3(d) under the Exchange Act), shall adopt a resolution providing that the receipt by the Company Insiders of cash in exchange for Company SARs, Parent Common Stock in exchange for shares of Company Common Stock and of options to purchase Parent Common Stock upon conversion of Company Options, in each case pursuant to the Merger and to the extent such securities are listed in the Section 16 Information, are intended to be exempt from liability pursuant to Section 16(b) under the Exchange Act. "Section 16 Information" shall mean information accurate in all material respects regarding the Company Insiders, the number of Company SARs held by each such Company Insider to be exchanged for cash in connection with the Merger, the number of shares of Company Common Stock held by each such Company Insider and expected to be exchanged for Parent Common Stock in the Merger and the number and description of Company Options held by each such Company Insider and expected to be converted into options to purchase Parent Common Stock in connection with the Merger; provided that the requirement for a description of any Company Options shall be deemed to be satisfied if copies of all Company Stock Option Plans, and forms of agreements evidencing grants thereunder, under which such Company Options have been granted have been made available to Parent. "Company Insiders" shall mean those officers and directors of the Company who are subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act and who are listed in the Section 16 Information.  

 6.19. _Directorship and Consulting Agreement._   

 (a) Parent agrees to take all action necessary to appoint or elect, effective as of the Effective Time, John Otis Drew as a director of Parent. Such person shall serve until the first annual meeting of stockholders of Parent following the Effective Time and until his or her successor is elected and qualified. Subject to compliance with the director qualification requirements set forth in the Parent Bylaws and the fiduciary duties of the Parent Board, Parent   ##### 

 

shall include such person on the list of nominees for director presented by
the Parent Board and for which said Board shall solicit proxies at the
first annual meeting of stockholders of Parent following the Effective Time,
which person shall be nominated for a two or three year term (which shall be
a three-year term in the event that the Effective Date occurs prior to
ParentÂ’s annual meeting of stockholders in 2004).  

 (b) Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement by Parent and the Company, Parent and John Otis Drew shall enter into the Consulting Agreement in the form of Annex B hereto.  

ARTICLE VII

ARTICLE VIII  

TERMINATION  

 8.01. _Termination._ This Agreement may be terminated, and the Transactions may be abandoned:  

 (a) _Mutual Consent._ At any time prior to the Effective Time, by the mutual consent of Parent and the Company if the Board of Directors of each so determines by vote of a majority of the members of its entire Board.  

 (b) _No Regulatory Approval._ By the Company or Parent, if its Board of Directors so determines by a vote of a majority of the members of its entire Board, in the event the approval of any Governmental Authority required for consummation of the Transactions shall have been denied by final, nonappealable action by such Governmental Authority or a Governmental Authority shall have requested the permanent withdrawal of an application therefor.  

 (c) _No Shareholder Approval._ By either Parent or the Company (provided in the case of the Company that it shall not be in material breach of any of its obligations under Section 6.02), if the approval of the shareholders of the Company required for the consummation of the Merger shall not have been obtained by reason of the failure to obtain the required vote at a duly held meeting of such shareholders or at any adjournment or postponement thereof.   ##### 

 

 (d) _Breach of Representations and Warranties._ By either Parent or the Company (provided that the terminating party is not then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained herein) if there shall have been a material breach of any of the representations or warranties set forth in this Agreement by the other party, which breach is not cured within thirty (30) days following written notice to the party committing such breach, or which breach, by its nature, cannot be cured prior to the Closing; provided, however, that neither party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.01(d) unless the breach of representation or warranty, together with all other such breaches, would entitle the party receiving such representation or warranty not to consummate the Merger hereby under Section 7.02(a) (in the case of a breach of a representation or warranty by Parent) or Section 7.03(a) (in the case of a breach of a representation or warranty by the Company).  

 (e) _Breach of Covenants._ By either Parent or the Company (provided that the terminating party is not then willfully in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained herein) if there shall have been a material breach of any of the covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement on the part of the other party, which breach shall not have been cured within thirty (30) days following receipt by the breaching party of written notice of such breach from the other party hereto, or which breach, by its nature, cannot be cured prior to the Closing, provided, however, that neither party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.01(e) unless the breach of covenant or agreement, together with all other such breaches, would entitle the party receiving the benefit of such covenant or agreement not to consummate the Merger under Section 7.02(b) in the case of a breach of a covenant or agreement by Parent or Section 7.03(b) in the case of a breach of a representation or warranty by the Company.  

 (f) _Delay._ By either Parent or the Company if the Merger shall not have been consummated on or before October 31, 2004, unless the failure of the Closing to occur by such date shall be due to a material breach of this Agreement by the party seeking to terminate this Agreement.  

 (g) _Failure to Recommend._ At any time prior to the Company Meeting, by Parent if (i) the Company shall have breached its obligations under Section 6.07 in any respect materially adverse to Parent, (ii) the Company Board shall have failed to recommend approval of this Agreement by the shareholders of the Company or shall have effected a Change in Recommendation (or shall have resolved to do so), whether or not permitted by this Agreement, (iii) the Company Board shall have recommended, proposed, or publicly announced its intention to recommend or propose, to engage in an Acquisition Transaction with any Person other than Parent or a Subsidiary of Parent or (iv) the Company shall have materially breached its obligations under Section 6.02 by failing to call, give notice of, convene and hold the Company Meeting in accordance with Section 6.02.  

 (h) _Certain Tender or Exchange Offers._ By Parent if a tender offer or exchange offer for 25% or more of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock is commenced (other than by Parent or a Subsidiary thereof), and the Company Board recommends that shareholders of the Company tender their shares in such tender offer or exchange offer or otherwise fails to recommend that such shareholders reject such tender offer or exchange offer within the ten (10) business day period specified in Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act.   ##### 

 

 8.02. _Effect of Termination and Abandonment._   

 (a) In the event of termination of this Agreement and the abandonment of the Merger pursuant to this Article VIII, no party to this Agreement shall have any liability or further obligation to any other party hereunder except (i) as set forth in this Section 8.02 and Section 9.01 and (ii) that termination will not relieve a breaching party from liability for any willful breach of any covenant, agreement, representation or warranty of this Agreement giving rise to such termination.  

 (b) In recognition of the efforts, expenses and other opportunities foregone by Parent while structuring and pursuing the Merger, the parties hereto agree that the Company shall pay to Parent a fee of $12.0 million (the "Termination Fee") if this AgreementÂ’s terminated as follows:  

 (i) if this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 8.01(g) or (h), then the Company shall pay the entire Termination Fee to Parent on the first Business Day following such termination; and  

 (ii) (A) if this Agreement is terminated by (1) Parent pursuant to Section 8.01(e) as a result of a willful breach by the Company or (2) by either Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 8.01(c) and in the case of any termination pursuant to clause (1) or (2) an Acquisition Proposal shall have been publicly announced and not withdrawn prior to the Company Meeting in the case of clause (2) or termination in the case of clause (1) (or any Person shall have publicly announced, communicated or made known an intention, whether or not conditional, to make an Acquisition Proposal, and shall not have publicly withdrawn such announcement, communication or intention prior to the Company Meeting in the case of clause (2) or termination in the case of clause (1)) or, in the case of clause (1) only, otherwise communicated or made known to the senior management of the Company or the Company Board, and not withdrawn prior to termination, at any time after the date of this Agreement and prior to the taking of the vote of the shareholders of the Company contemplated by this Agreement at the Company Meeting, in the case of clause (2), or the date of termination of this Agreement, in the case of clause (1), then the Company shall pay the Termination Fee to Parent if within eighteen (18) months after such termination of this Agreement the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company enters into any agreement with respect to, or consummates, an Acquisition Transaction, on the date of execution of such agreement or consummation of an Acquisition Transaction.  

 Any amount that becomes payable pursuant to this Section 8.02(b) shall be paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by Parent.  

 (c) The Company and Parent agree that the agreement contained in paragraph (b) of this Section 8.02 is an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, that without such agreement Parent would not have entered into this Agreement and that such amounts do not constitute a penalty or liquidated damages in the event of a breach of this Agreement by the Company. If the Company fails to pay Parent the amounts due under paragraph (b) above within the time periods specified therein, the Company shall pay the costs and expenses (including reasonable legal fees and expenses) incurred by Parent in connection with any action in which Parent prevails, including the filing of any lawsuit, taken to collect payment of such amounts, together with interest on the amount of any such unpaid amounts at   ##### 

 

the prime lending rate prevailing during such period as published in _The
Wall Street Journal_ , calculated on a daily basis from the date such amounts
were required to be paid until the date of actual payment.

Except for the Indemnified PartiesÂ’ right to enforce ParentÂ’s obligation under Section 6.09 or Mr. DrewÂ’s right to enforce ParentÂ’s obligations under Section 6.19, which are expressly intended to be for the irrevocable benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives and Mr. Drew, respectively, nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, is intended to confer upon any Person, other than the parties hereto or their respective successors, any rights, remedies, obligations or liabilities under or by reason of this Agreement.   ##### 

 

 9.08. _Severability._ Except to the extent that application of this Section 9.08 would have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company or Parent, any term or provision of this Agreement which is invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement in any other jurisdiction. If any provision of this Agreement is so broad as to be unenforceable, the provision shall be interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable. In all such cases, the parties shall use their reasonable best efforts to substitute a valid, legal and enforceable provision which, insofar as practicable, implements the original purposes and intents of this Agreement.  

 9.09. _Enforcement of the Agreement._ The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any court of the United States or any state having jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.  

 9.10. _Interpretation._ When a reference is made in this Agreement to Sections, Exhibits or Schedules, such reference shall be to a Section of, or Exhibit or Schedule to, this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents and headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and are not part of this Agreement. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation." The phrases "the date of this Agreement," "the date hereof" and terms of similar import, unless the context otherwise requires, shall be deemed to refer to December 8, 2003.  

 9.11. _Assignment._ No party may assign either this Agreement or any of its rights, interests or obligations hereunder without the prior written approval of the other party. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns.  

 9.12. _Alternative Structure._ Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, Parent may at any time modify the structure of the Merger and/or the Bank Merger subject to the prior written consent of the Company, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, provided that (i) the Merger consideration to be paid to the holders of Company Common Stock pursuant to Article III hereof is not thereby changed in kind or reduced in amount as a result of such modification, (ii) there are no material adverse tax consequences to the shareholders of the Company as a result of such modification and (iii) such modification will not materially delay or jeopardize receipt of any required approvals of Governmental Authorities or otherwise materially delay consummation of the Merger.

ANNEX A   

SHAREHOLDER AGREEMENT  

 SHAREHOLDER AGREEMENT (the "Agreement"), dated as of December 8, 2003, by and between _ _, a shareholder ("Shareholder") of CCBT Financial Companies, Inc. (the "Company"), a Massachusetts corporation, and Banknorth Group, Inc. ("Parent"), a Maine corporation. All terms used herein and not defined herein shall have the meanings assigned thereto in the Merger Agreement (defined below).  

 WHEREAS, Parent and the Company are simultaneously entering into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of the date hereof (as may be amended from time to time pursuant to its terms, the "Merger Agreement"), pursuant to which the Company will merge with and into Parent on the terms and conditions set forth therein (the "Merger") and, in connection therewith, each outstanding share of Company Common Stock will be converted into the right to receive 1.084 shares of Parent Common Stock, plus cash in lieu of any fractional share interest; and  

 WHEREAS, Shareholder owns the shares of Company Common Stock identified on Annex I hereto (such shares, together with all shares of Company Common Stock subsequently acquired by Shareholder during the term of this Agreement, being referred to as the "Shares"); and  

 WHEREAS, in order to induce Parent to enter into the Merger Agreement, Shareholder, solely in such ShareholderÂ’s capacity as a shareholder of the Company and not in any other capacity, has agreed to enter into and perform this Agreement;  

 NOW, THEREFORE, for good and valuable consideration, the receipt, sufficiency and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:  

 1\. _Agreement to Vote Shares._ Shareholder agrees that at any meeting of the shareholders of the Company, or in connection with any written consent of the shareholders of the Company at which a proposal of the type set forth in clause (ii) below is presented for consideration by the shareholders of the Company, Shareholder shall:  

 (i) appear at each such meeting or otherwise cause the Shares to be counted as present thereat for purposes of calculating a quorum; and  

 (ii) vote (or cause to be voted), in person or by proxy, all the Shares (whether acquired heretofore or hereafter) that are beneficially owned by Shareholder or as to which Shareholder has, directly or indirectly, the right to vote or direct the voting, (x) in favor of adoption and approval of the Merger Agreement and the Merger; (y) against any action or agreement that would result in a breach of any covenant, representation or warranty or any other obligation or agreement of the Company contained in the Merger Agreement or of Shareholder contained in this Agreement; and (z) against any Acquisition Proposal or any other action, agreement or transaction that is intended, or could reasonably be expected, to materially impede, interfere or be inconsistent with,   ##### 

 

delay, postpone, discourage or materially and adversely affect consummation
of the Merger or this Agreement.  

 2\. _No Transfers._ After the date hereof and prior to the Company Meeting (as defined in the Merger Agreement), Shareholder agrees not to, directly or indirectly, sell transfer, pledge, assign or otherwise dispose of, or enter into any contract option, commitment or other arrangement or understanding with respect to the sale, transfer, pledge, assignment or other disposition of, any of the Shares if such sale, transfer, pledge, assignment or disposition could occur prior to the Company Meeting, except the following transfers shall be permitted: (i) transfers by will or operation of law, in which case this Agreement shall bind the transferee, subject to applicable law, (ii) transfers pursuant to any pledge agreement, subject to the pledgee agreeing in writing to be bound by the terms of this Agreement, (iii) transfers in connection with estate and tax planning purposes, including transfers to relatives, trusts and charitable organizations, subject to the transferee agreeing in writing to be bound by the terms of this Agreement, (iv) transfers to any other shareholder of the Company who has executed a copy of this Agreement on the date hereof with respect to some or all of the Shares held by such shareholder and (v) such transfers as Parent may otherwise permit in its sole discretion. Any transfer or other disposition in violation of the terms of this Section 2 shall be null and void.  

 3\. _Representations and Warranties of Shareholder._ Shareholder represents and warrants to and agrees with Parent as follows:  

 A. _Capacity._ Shareholder has all requisite capacity and authority to enter into and perform his, her or its obligations under this Agreement.  

 B. _Binding Agreement._ This Agreement constitutes the valid and legally binding obligation of Shareholder, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditorsÂ’ rights and to general equity principles.  

 C. _Non-Contravention._ The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Shareholder does not, and the performance by Shareholder of his, her or its obligations hereunder and the consummation by Shareholder of the transactions contemplated hereby will not, violate or conflict with, or constitute a default under, any agreement, instrument, contract or other obligation or any order, arbitration award, judgment or decree to which Shareholder is a party or by which Shareholder is bound, or any statute, rule or regulation to which Shareholder is subject or, in the event that Shareholder is a corporation, partnership, trust or other entity, any charter, bylaw or other organizational document of Shareholder.  

 D. _Ownership of Shares._ Shareholder has good title to all of the Shares as of the date hereof, and, except as set forth on Annex I hereto, the Shares are so owned free and clear of any liens, security interests, charges or other encumbrances.   ##### 

 

 4\. _Specific Performance and Remedies._ Shareholder acknowledges that it will be impossible to measure in money the damage to Parent if Shareholder fails to comply with the obligations imposed by this Agreement and that, in the event of any such failure, Parent will not have an adequate remedy at law or in equity. Accordingly, Shareholder agrees that injunctive relief or other equitable remedy, in addition to remedies at law or in damages, is the appropriate remedy for any such failure and will not oppose the granting of such relief on the basis that Parent has an adequate remedy at law. Shareholder agrees that Shareholder will not seek, and agrees to waive any requirement for, the securing or posting of a bond in connection with ParentÂ’s seeking or obtaining such equitable relief. In addition, after discussing the matter with Shareholder, Parent shall have the right to inform any third party that Parent reasonably believes to be, or to be contemplating, participating with Shareholder or receiving from Shareholder assistance in violation of this Agreement, of the terms of this Agreement and of the rights of Parent hereunder, and that participation by any such persons with Shareholder in activities in violation of ShareholderÂ’s agreement with Parent set forth in this Agreement may give rise to claims by Parent against such third party.  

 5\. _Term of Agreement; Termination._   

 A. The term of this Agreement shall commence on the date hereof.

 CONSULTING AGREEMENT by and between Banknorth Group, Inc. ("Banknorth"), a Maine corporation, and John Otis Drew (the "Consultant"), dated as of December 8, 2003.  

WITNESSETH:  

 WHEREAS, Banknorth and CCBT Financial Companies, Inc. ("CCBT") have entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of December 8, 2003 (the "Merger Agreement"), pursuant to which CCBT shall merge with and into Banknorth, with Banknorth as the surviving corporation (the "Merger"); and  

 WHEREAS, in connection with the Merger, the Consultant shall no longer serve as Chairman of CCBT; and  

 WHEREAS, following the Merger, the Consultant shall serve as a member of the Board of Directors of Banknorth; and  

 WHEREAS, Banknorth desires to ensure that after the Merger Banknorth will continue to receive the benefit of the ConsultantÂ’s services and his knowledge with respect to the communities and customers served by CCBT, on the terms and conditions set forth below in this Agreement, and the Consultant desires to render such services;  

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual covenants, representations, warranties and agreements contained herein, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows:  

 1. _Effective Date._ The term "Effective Date" shall have the meaning set forth in the Merger Agreement.  

 2. _Consulting Period._ The Consultant shall render consulting services, on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, for the period beginning on the Effective Date and ending on the fifth anniversary thereof (the "Consulting Period"). This Agreement shall not be terminable by Banknorth for any reason other than the death or permanent and total disability (as determined by a physician selected by Banknorth and reasonably acceptable to the Consultant or his representative) of the Consultant.  

 3. _Consulting Services._ During the Consulting Period, the Consultant shall advise on and provide services with respect to BanknorthÂ’s relations with the communities located in the primary areas in which CCBT conducted business immediately prior to the Effective Date (the "Market Area"). During the Consulting Period, the Consultant agrees to cooperate to make himself reasonably available, taking into account the ConsultantÂ’s other commitments, to attend Banknorth sponsored corporate and business functions in the Market   ##### 

 

Area. During the Consulting Period, the ConsultantÂ’s services hereunder
shall be performed primarily at the current CCBT headquarters located in
South Yarmouth, Massachusetts or at such other location as may be mutually
agreed upon between the Consultant and Banknorth.  

 4. _Compensation._   

 (a) _Consulting Fees._ During the Consulting Period, Banknorth shall pay the Consultant a consulting fee of $90,000 per year (the "Consulting Fee"), payable in 12 equal monthly installments on the first business day of each month, with the first of such payments to be paid on the Effective Date. In the event the Consultant continues to serve as a director of Banknorth, nothing contained herein shall preclude him from receiving compensation and benefits on the same basis as non-employee directors of Banknorth generally.  

 (b) _Expenses._ During the Consulting Period, the Consultant shall be entitled to receive prompt reimbursement for all reasonable and documented expenses incurred by the Consultant in connection with his services hereunder, including without limitation travel expenses, in accordance with BanknorthÂ’s policies for senior executives as in effect from time to time.  

 (c) _Change in Control._ In the event of a "change in control" of Banknorth (as defined in BanknorthÂ’s 2003 Equity Incentive Plan, as in effect on the date hereof or, if more favorable to the Consultant, as defined for purposes of the change in control (or any derivation of such term) provisions or agreements applicable to senior executives of Banknorth), the Consulting Fees for the remaining portion of the Consulting Period shall be paid to the Consultant in a lump sum within ten days of the date of the change in control, and the obligation to provide the benefits under Section 4(b) shall continue for the remainder of the Consulting Period.  

 5. _Confidentiality._   

 (a) The Consultant shall hold in a fiduciary capacity for the benefit of Banknorth all secret or confidential information, knowledge or data relating to Banknorth and its affiliates which shall have been obtained by the Consultant during his service to CCBT prior to the Consulting Period and to Banknorth during the Consulting Period and which shall not be or become public knowledge (other than by acts by the Consultant or representatives of the Consultant in violation of this Agreement), including, without limitation, any such information relating to: business or operations; plans, strategies, prospects or objectives; products, technology, processes or specifications; research and development operations or plans; customers and customer lists; distribution, sales, service, support and marketing practices and operations; financial condition, results of operations and prospects; operational strengths and weaknesses; and personnel and compensation policies and procedures. The Consultant shall not, without the prior written consent of Banknorth or as may otherwise be required by law or legal process, communicate or divulge any such information, knowledge or data to anyone other than Banknorth and those designated by it or to an attorney retained by the Consultant.  

 (b) The Consultant agrees that damages at law will be an insufficient remedy to Banknorth in the event that the Consultant violates any of the provisions of paragraph (a) of   ##### 

 

this Section 5, and that Banknorth may apply for and, upon the
requisite showing, have injunctive relief in any court of competent
jurisdiction to restrain the breach or threatened or attempted breach of or
otherwise to specifically enforce any of the covenants contained in paragraph
(a) of this Section 5\. The Consultant hereby consents to any injunction
(temporary or otherwise) which may be issued against the Consultant and to
any other court order which may be issued against the Consultant from
violating, or directing the Consultant to comply with, any of the covenants
in paragraph (a) of this Section 5\. The Consultant also agrees that such
remedies shall be in addition to any and all remedies, including damages,
available to Banknorth against the Consultant for such breaches or threatened
or attempted breaches.  

 6. _Successors._   

 (a) This Agreement is personal to the Consultant and, without the prior written consent of Banknorth, shall not be assignable by the Consultant otherwise than by will or the laws of descent and distribution. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the ConsultantÂ’s legal representatives.  

 (b) This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon Banknorth and its successors and assigns.  

 7. _Counterparts._ This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, and all of which shall constitute one and the same agreement.  

 8. _No Right to Directorship._ Nothing contained in this Agreement shall create any right on the part of the Consultant to continue to serve as a director of Banknorth following the Effective Date.  

 9. _Miscellaneous._   

 (a) This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Maine, without reference to principles of conflict of laws. The captions of this Agreement are not part of the provisions hereof and shall have no force or effect. This Agreement may not be amended or modified except by a written agreement executed by the parties hereto or their respective successors and legal representatives.  

 (b) The Consultant acknowledges that his services hereunder are to be rendered as an independent contractor, and that he is solely responsible for the payment of all Federal, state and local taxes that are required by applicable laws or regulations to be paid with respect to the Consulting Fees and the benefits provided hereunder.   ##### 

 

 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Consultant has hereunto set his hand and, pursuant to the authorization of its Board of Directors, Banknorth has caused this Agreement to be executed in its name on its behalf, all as of the day and year first above written.
