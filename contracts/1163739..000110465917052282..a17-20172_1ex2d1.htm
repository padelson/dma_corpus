Interim Order and as required by applicable Law, subject to the terms of this
Agreement, the Company shall diligently pursue and take all steps necessary or
desirable to have the hearing before the Court of the application for the
Final Order pursuant to Section 193 of the ABCA held as soon as reasonably

Section 2.9 _Court Proceedings_. Subject to the terms of this Agreement,
Parent and AcquisitionCo will cooperate with and assist the Company in seeking
the Interim Order and the Final Order, including by providing to the Company,
on a timely basis, any information reasonably required to be supplied by

 _Section 8.2(a)_, with reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon
drafts of all material to be filed with the Court in connection with the
Arrangement, and will give reasonable consideration to all such comments.
Subject to applicable Law, the Company will not file any material with the
Court in connection with the Arrangement or serve any such material, and will
not agree to modify or amend materials so filed or served, except as
contemplated by this _Section 2.9_ or with the prior written consent of

conditioned or delayed; provided that nothing in this Agreement shall limit
the Companys ability to take any and all steps, including the filing of all
manner of documents with any Governmental Entity, to enforce its rights under
this Agreement, including in connection with any dispute involving the Company
and its Subsidiaries on the one hand and Parent and AcquisitionCo on the other
hand. The Company shall also provide to outside counsel to Parent and
AcquisitionCo, as specified in _Section 8.2(a)_ and on a timely basis, copies
of any notice of appearance or other Court documents served on the Company in
respect of the application for the Interim Order or the Final Order or any
appeal therefrom and of any notice, whether written or oral, received by the
Company indicating any intention to oppose the granting of the Interim Order
or the Final Order or to appeal the Interim Order or the Final Order. The
Company will ensure that all materials filed with the Court in connection with
the Arrangement are consistent in all material respects with the terms of this
Agreement and the Plan of Arrangement. With the Companys prior consent (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), legal
counsel to Parent and AcquisitionCo may make such submissions on the hearing
of the motion for the Interim Order and the application for the Final Order as
such counsel considers appropriate, provided that such submissions are
consistent in all material respects with this Agreement and the Plan of
Arrangement. The Company will also oppose any proposal from any party that the
Final Order contain any provision inconsistent with this Agreement, and, if at
any time after the issuance of the Final Order and prior to the Effective
Date, the Company is required by the terms of the Final Order or by Law to
return to Court with respect to the Final Order, it shall, subject to the
terms of the Final Order or by Law, do so after notice to, and in consultation
and cooperation with, Parent.

 



 

Section 2.10 _Articles of Arrangement and Effective Date_. The Articles of
Arrangement shall implement the Plan of Arrangement. On the second Business

prohibited, the waiver of those conditions as of the Effective Date) set forth
in _Article 6_, unless another time or date is agreed to in writing by the
Parties, the Articles of Arrangement shall be filed by the Company with the
Registrar, provided that the Articles of Arrangement shall not be sent to the
Registrar pursuant to the ABCA, for endorsement and filing by the Registrar,
except as contemplated by this Agreement and with the prior written consent of
Parent and AcquisitionCo (which consent shall not in any way diminish or limit
Parents or AcquisitionCos obligation to consummate the Arrangement at the
time contemplated by this _Section 2.10_). From and after the Effective Time,
the Plan of Arrangement will have all of the effects provided by applicable
Law, including the ABCA. The closing of the Arrangement will take place at

place as may be agreed to by the Parties.

 



 

Section 2.11 _Payment of Consideration_. Parent will, following receipt by the
Company of the Final Order and at or prior to the Effective Time, deliver or
cause to be delivered to the

Consideration payable to the Company Shareholders pursuant to the Plan of
Arrangement (other than Company Shareholders exercising Dissent Rights and who
have not withdrawn their notice of dissent). In addition, Parent shall deliver

satisfy its obligations pursuant to _Sections 2.15_ and _2.16_.

 



 

Section 2.12 _Announcement and Shareholder Communications_. Parent, on the one
hand, and the Company, on the other hand, shall each publicly announce the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement promptly following the date hereof
(which public announcement by the Company shall, for greater certainty,
include the approvals, determinations and resolutions contemplated by _Section
2.6_, and the text and timing of each such announcement to be approved by the
other Party in advance) and shall use reasonable best efforts to develop a
joint communications plan. Parent, AcquisitionCo and the Company agree to co-
operate in the preparation of presentations, if any, to Company Shareholders
or Parent Shareholders regarding the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and no Party shall (a) issue any press release or otherwise make
public announcements with respect to this Agreement or the Plan of Arrangement
without the prior written consent of each other Party (which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), except that Parent and the
Company may make any public statement in response to specific questions by the
press, analysts, investors or those attending industry conferences or
financial analyst conference calls, so long as such statement is consistent
with the joint communications plan and substantially similar to previous press
releases, public disclosures or public statements made jointly by Parent and
the Company (or individually, if approved by the other party), or _(b)_
subject to _Section 5.2_, make any filing with any Governmental Entity with
respect to this Agreement or the Plan of Arrangement without the prior written
consent of the other Party; provided, however, that the foregoing shall be
subject to each Partys overriding obligation to make any disclosure or filing
required under applicable Laws or stock exchange rules, and the Party making
such disclosure shall use commercially reasonable efforts to give prior oral
or written notice to the other Party and reasonable opportunity to review or
comment on the disclosure or filing, and if such prior notice is not possible,
to give such notice immediately following the making of such disclosure or
filing.

holdings of all Persons having rights issued by the Company to acquire Company
Shares (including holders of Company Options and Company Restricted Stock
Units) and a list of non-objecting beneficial owners of Company Shares,
together with their addresses and respective holdings of Company Shares. The
Company shall from time to time require that its registrar and transfer agent
furnish Parent and AcquisitionCo with such additional information, including
updated or additional lists of Company Shareholders and lists of holdings and
other assistance as Parent or AcquisitionCo may reasonably request.

 



 

Section 2.14 _U.S. Securities Law Matters_. The Parties agree that the
Arrangement will be carried out with the intention that all Parent Shares
issued pursuant to the Arrangement to the Company Shareholders will be issued
by Parent in reliance on the exemption from the registration requirements of

carried out on the following basis:

 



 

(a) The procedural and substantive fairness of the terms and conditions of the
Arrangement will be subject to the approval of the Court;

 



 

(b) The Court will be advised as to the intention of the Parties to rely on

terms and conditions of the Arrangement;

 



 

(c) The Court will be required to satisfy itself as to the procedural and
substantive fairness of the terms and conditions of the Arrangement to the
Company Securityholders, subject to the Arrangement;

 



 

(d) The Company will ensure that each Company Shareholder entitled to receive

advising them of their right to attend the hearing of the Court to approve the
procedural and substantive fairness of the terms and conditions of the
Arrangement and providing them with sufficient information necessary for them
to exercise that right;

 



 

(e) The Company Shareholders entitled to receive Parent Shares will be advised
that the Parent Shares issued pursuant to the Arrangement have not been
registered under the U.S. Securities Act and will be issued by Parent in
reliance on the exemption provided by Section 3(a)(10) of the U.S. Securities
Act;

 



 

(f) The Final Order approving the terms and conditions of the Arrangement that
is obtained from the Court will expressly state that the Arrangement is
approved by the Court as being procedurally and substantively fair to the
Company Securityholders;

 



 

(g) The Interim Order approving the Company Meeting will specify that each
Company Shareholder will have the right to appear before the Court at the
hearing of the Court to give approval of the Arrangement so long as they enter
an appearance within a reasonable time;

 



 

(h) The Court will hold a hearing before approving the procedural and
substantive fairness of the terms and conditions of the Arrangement; and

 



 

(i) The Final Order shall include a statement to substantially the following
effect and an acknowledgement by the court of such statement:

 



 

"This Order will serve as a basis of a claim to an exemption, pursuant to
Section 3(a)(10) of the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended, from
the registration requirements otherwise imposed by that act, regarding the
distribution of securities of Parent pursuant to the Plan of Arrangement."

 



       
 

 



 

Section 2.15 _Treatment of Options_.

 



 

(a) As of the Effective Time, each Company Option that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be fully vested and exercisable
pursuant to the provisions of the applicable Company Stock Incentive Plan and
award agreements, by virtue of the Acquisition and without any further action
by Parent, AcquisitionCo, the Company or the holder of that Company Option,
and shall be cancelled in consideration for the right to receive an amount in
cash (less any required withholding Taxes) payable by the Company, without
interest, equal to the product of (i) the excess of (A) the Market Value per
Company Share over (B) the exercise price per share of each Company Option,
multiplied by (ii) the aggregate number of Company Shares that may be acquired
upon exercise of such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time;
provided that, each Company Option with an exercise price per share that is
equal to or more than the Market Value shall be cancelled for no
consideration.

 



 

(b) The Company covenants and agrees that it shall take all actions necessary
such that each unexercised Company Option outstanding at the Effective Time
shall be cancelled in accordance with _Section 2.15(a)_ hereof and as
contemplated by the Plan of Arrangement.

 



 

Section 2.16 _Treatment of Restricted Stock Units_.

 



 

(a) As of the Effective Time, each Company Restricted Stock Unit that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be fully vested
pursuant to the provisions of the applicable Company Stock Incentive Plan and
award agreement, by virtue of the Acquisition and without any further action
by Parent, AcquisitionCo, the Company or the holder of that Company Restricted
Stock Unit, and shall be cancelled in consideration for the right to receive
an amount in cash (less any required withholding Taxes) payable by the
Company, without interest, equal to the Market Value per Company Share
multiplied by the aggregate number of Company Shares represented by such
Company Restricted Stock Unit immediately prior to the Effective Time.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, all amounts payable in
respect of a Company Restricted Stock Unit shall be paid in accordance with
the terms of the applicable Company Stock Incentive Plan, award agreement and
Board approval, as applicable. For purposes of the foregoing, each outstanding
Company Restricted Stock Unit that is subject to a performance-based vesting
requirement shall become fully vested and converted as provided above based
upon the number of units at the "target" level of performance applicable to
such award.

 



 

(b) The Company covenants and agrees that it shall take all actions necessary
such that each Company Restricted Stock Unit outstanding at the Effective Time
shall be cancelled in accordance with Section 2.16(a) hereof and as
contemplated by the Plan of Arrangement.

 



 

Section 2.17 _Dissenting Shareholders_. The registered Company Shareholders
may exercise Dissent Rights with respect to their Company Shares in connection
with the Arrangement pursuant to and in the manner set forth in the Plan of
Arrangement and the Interim Order. The Company shall give Parent and
AcquisitionCo prompt notice of any written notice of a dissent, withdrawal of
such notice, and any other instruments served pursuant to such Dissent Rights
and received by Company and promptly provide Parent and AcquisitionCo with
copies of such notices and written objections and all other correspondence
related thereto, and subject to applicable Laws, shall provide Parent and
AcquisitionCo with an opportunity to review and comment upon any written
communications proposed to be sent by or on behalf of the Company to any
Company Shareholder exercising or purporting to exercise Dissent Rights in
relation to

 



      
 

 



 

the Arrangement Resolution and reasonable consideration shall be given to any
comments made by Parent, AcquisitionCo and their counsel prior to sending any
such written communications. The Company will, upon request of Parent or
AcquisitionCo, use all reasonable commercial efforts to obtain the withdrawal
of any dissent notice (provided that the Company shall not be required to make
or commit to make any payments or concessions). Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the Company shall not settle any claims with respect to Dissent Rights without
the prior written consent of Parent and AcquisitionCo. Parent and
AcquisitionCo will have the right, upon written notice to the Company, to
participate, each at its own expense, in the Companys negotiations with
Company Shareholders who have exercised Dissent Rights.

(d) _Public Documents_. The Company has furnished or filed Company Public
Documents required to be furnished or filed with the applicable Securities

filing), the Company Public Documents complied, and each Company Public
Document filed after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Date will
comply, in all material respects with the requirements of all applicable

Effective Date, will contain) any untrue statement of a material fact or
omitted (or will omit) to state a material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading. Each Company Public Document that
is a registration statement, as amended, if applicable, filed pursuant to the
U.S. Securities Act, as of the date such registration statement or amendment
became effective, did not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements therein not misleading. The financial statements of the
Company included in the Company Public Documents complied as to form, as of
their respective dates of filing with the applicable Securities Authority, in
all material respects with all the published rules and regulations of the
applicable Securities Authority with respect thereto (except, in the case of
unaudited statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC), have been
prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis during the
periods involved (except as may be disclosed therein) and fairly present in
all material respects the consolidated financial position of the Company and
its consolidated Subsidiaries and the consolidated results of operations,
changes in shareholders equity and cash flows of such companies as of the
dates and for the periods shown. As of the

 



      
 

 



 

date hereof, there are no outstanding written comments from any Securities
Authority with respect to any of the Company Public Documents.

 



 

(e) _Undisclosed Liabilities_. Except for (i) those liabilities that are
reflected or reserved for in the consolidated financial statements of the
Company included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2016 or its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter
ended June 30, 2017, as filed with the SEC prior to the date hereof, (ii)
liabilities incurred since June 30, 2017 in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice, (iii) liabilities that are, individually and in
the aggregate, immaterial to the Company, (iv) liabilities incurred pursuant

required to be reflected in the Companys financial statements in accordance
with GAAP.

 



 

(f) _Compliance with Applicable Laws and Reporting Requirements_. (i) The
Company and its Subsidiaries hold all permits, certificates, licenses,
variances, exemptions, orders and approvals of all Governmental Entities that
are material to the operation of the businesses of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (the " ** _Company Permits_** "), and the
Company and its Subsidiaries are, and for the two years preceding the date
hereof have been, in compliance with the terms of the Company Permits and all
applicable laws and regulations, except where the failure so to hold or comply
would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company. The businesses of the Company and its Subsidiaries are not being and
during the two years preceding the date hereof have not been conducted in
violation of any law, ordinance (including zoning) or regulation of any
Governmental Entity (including the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002), except for
violations that, individually or in the aggregate, do not have, and would not
reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. No
investigation by any Governmental Entity with respect to the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries is pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened,
other than, in each case, those the outcome of which, individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect
on the Company.

 



 

(ii) The Company and its Subsidiaries have designed and maintain a system of
internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and
15d-15(f) of the U.S. Exchange Act) sufficient to provide reasonable
assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
GAAP. The Company (A) has designed and maintains disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the U.S. Exchange
Act) to ensure that material information required to be disclosed by the
Company in the reports that it files or submits under the U.S. Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in the SECs rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to the
Companys management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure, and (B) has disclosed, based on its most recent
evaluation of such disclosure controls and procedures prior to the date
hereof, to the Companys auditors and the audit committee of the Company Board
(1) any

 



      
 

 



 

significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of
internal controls over financial reporting that are reasonably likely to
adversely affect in any material respect the Companys ability to record,
process, summarize and report financial information and (2) any fraud, whether
or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a
significant role in the Companys internal controls over financial reporting.

other demand or proceeding (whether judicial, arbitral, administrative or
other) pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened, against or
affecting the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company that would reasonably
be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
Effect on the Company or prevent, materially delay or materially impede the
Companys ability to perform its obligations hereunder or to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby, nor is there any judgment, decree,
injunction, rule or order of any Governmental Entity or arbitrator outstanding
against the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company having or that would
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company or on Parent or AcquisitionCo after the

the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or bound by any
contract, arrangement, commitment or understanding (A) with respect to the
employment of any directors, officers or employees, or with any consultants
that are natural persons, involving the payment of $500,000 or more per annum,
(B) that is a "material contract" (as such term is defined in Item 601(b)(10)
of Regulation S-K of the SEC), (C) that purports to limit the ability of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries (or, after the Effective Time, Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries) to compete in any line of business, in any geographic
area or with any person, or that requires referrals of business and, in each
case, which limitation or requirement would reasonably be expected to be
material to the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole, (D) that is a
Company Employee Benefit Plan and that provides for an increase in benefits or
the acceleration of the vesting or funding of benefits (other than Company
Options and Company Restricted Stock Units), by the occurrence of any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (whether alone or in connection
with

 



      
 

 



 

any other event, condition or circumstance), (E) that has as its subject
matter a Company Affiliate Transaction, (F) that would reasonably be expected
to prevent, materially delay or materially impede the consummation of any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (G) that is an options,
futures, forwards, swaps, hedging contracts or similar derivative contracts
relating to interest rates, foreign exchange, commodity prices or otherwise,
or (H) that is a material contract that is not cancellable (at no additional
cost, expense or fee) on 90 days or less notice that grants "most favored
nation" status that, following the Effective Time, would impose obligations
upon Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, including AcquisitionCo and its
Subsidiaries. All contracts, arrangements, commitments or understandings of
the type described in _Section 3.1(i)(i)_ (collectively referred to herein
as the " ** _Company Contracts_** ") are valid and in full force and effect,
except to the extent they have previously expired in accordance with their
terms or if the failure to be in full force and effect, individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect
on the Company. The Company has provided or made available to Parent correct
and complete copies of each Company Contract. Neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries has, and to the knowledge of the Company, none of the other
parties thereto have, violated any provision of, or committed or failed to
perform any act, and no event or condition exists, which with or without
notice, lapse of time or both would constitute a default under the provisions
of, any Company Contract, except in each case for those violations and
defaults that, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

 



 

(ii) Except as set forth in _Section 3.1(i)(ii)_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or bound
by any contract, arrangement, commitment or understanding that, after the
Effective Time, would purport to limit the ability of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries to compete in any line of business, in any geographic area or
with any person, or that requires referrals of business.

 



 

(j) _Benefit Plans_.

 



 

(i) _Section 3.1(j)(i)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter contains a list of
all material Company Employee Benefit Plans.

 



 

(ii) With respect to each material Company Employee Benefit Plan, the Company
has made available to Parent a true and correct copy of such Plan, including
any and all amendments thereto.

 



 

(iii) _Section 3.1(j)(iii)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter identifies each
Company Employee Benefit Plan that is intended to be a "qualified plan"
pursuant to Section 401(a) of the Code (" ** _Company Qualified Plans_** ").
The IRS has issued a favorable determination letter with respect to each
Company Qualified Plan and the related trust (or a favorable opinion letter
upon which the Company or its applicable Subsidiary is entitled to rely, in
the case of a prototype or volume submitter document for which a separate
determination letter is not required) that has not been revoked, and there are
no circumstances, and no events have occurred, that could reasonably be
expected to adversely affect the qualified status of any Company Qualified
Plan or the related trust. No Company Employee Benefit Plan is or is required
to be funded

 



       
 

 



 

through a trust that is intended to meet the requirements of Section 501(c)(9)
of the Code.

 



 

(iv) With respect to each Company Employee Benefit Plan that is not a Non-US
Company Plan, all contributions, premium payments, and other payments,
expenses and reimbursements required to be made by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries by applicable Law or regulation or by any plan document or other
contractual undertaking, have been timely made (except where the Companys
failure to timely make such contributions or pay such premiums would not
result in any material liability, penalty or tax), or have been properly
accrued and accurately reflected on the Companys financial statements.

 



 

(v) With respect to each employee benefit plan, program, policy, practice,
agreement, or other arrangement maintained and/or operated by a Governmental
Entity and subject to the applicable Laws of any jurisdiction outside the
United States and Canada, all contributions, premium payments, and other
payments, expenses and reimbursements required to be made by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries by applicable Law or regulation or by any plan
document or other contractual undertaking, have been timely made (except where
the Companys failure to timely make such contributions or pay such premiums
would not result in any material liability, penalty or tax), or have been
properly accrued and accurately reflected on the Companys financial
statements.

 



 

(vi) Each Company Employee Benefit Plan has been established, maintained and
administered in compliance, in all material respects, with all applicable
provisions of ERISA, the Code, all other Laws and regulations applicable to
such Company Employee Benefit Plan, and the terms applicable to such Company
Employee Benefit Plan. There is not now, nor do any circumstances exist that
could give rise to, any requirement for the posting of security by the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to a Company Employee Benefit Plan or
the imposition of any lien on the assets of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries under ERISA, the Code or other applicable Law.

 



 

(vii) Neither the Company, nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor any of their
respective ERISA Affiliates has ever maintained, sponsored or contributed to,
or had an obligation to maintain, sponsor or contribute to, or had any actual
or contingent liability or obligation with respect to, and no Company Employee
Benefit Plan currently is, (i) a "defined benefit plan" as defined in Section
3(35) of ERISA, (ii) a pension plan subject to the funding standards of
Section 302 or Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code, (iii) a
"multiemployer plan" as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA or Section 414(f) of
the Code or (iv) a "multiple employer plan" within the meaning of Section
210(a) of ERISA or Section 413(c) of the Code. Neither the Company nor any of
its ERISA Affiliates has any actual or contingent liability under Title IV of
ERISA, and no condition exists, other than as a result of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, that presents a risk to the Company or any of
its ERISA Affiliates of incurring any such liability.

 



      
 

 



 

(viii) With respect to any Company Employee Benefit Plan that is maintained
for the benefit of employees, consultants or directors outside of the United
States (each such Company Employee Benefit Plan, a " ** _Non-US Company
Plan_** "), (A) if intended to qualify for special tax treatment, the Non-US
Company Plan meets the requirements for such treatment in all material
respects, (B) the financial statements of the Company and its Subsidiaries
accurately reflect in all material respects the Non-US Company Plan
liabilities and accruals for contributions required to be paid to the Non-US
Company Plans, in accordance with GAAP, and (C) there have not occurred, nor
are there continuing, any transactions or breaches of fiduciary duty under any
Law or regulation in connection with a Non-US Company Plan which could have a
Material Adverse Effect on (1) any Non-US Company Plan or (2) the condition of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

 



 

(ix) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor any of their
respective ERISA Affiliates, has engaged in any transaction described in
Section 4069 or Section 4204 or 4212(c) of ERISA.

 



 

(x) _Section 3.1(j)(x)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth each
Company Employee Benefit Plan (or other arrangement) under which the execution
and delivery of this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby could (either alone or in connection with any other event,
condition or circumstance): (i) result in, cause the accelerated vesting,
funding or delivery of, or increase the amount or value of, any payment or
benefit to any current or former employee, officer, consultant or director of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) result in the payment or
provision (whether in connection with any termination of employment or
otherwise) of any "excess parachute payment" within the meaning of Section
280G of the Code with respect to any current or former employee, consultant or
contractor of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; (iii) limit the right of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to amend, merge or terminate any
Company Employee Benefit Plan or trust; or (iv) give rise to the payment of
any amount that would not be deductible by reason of Section 162(m) of the
Code.

 



 

(xi) No Company Employee Benefit Plan provides for a tax gross-up or any
similar payments or benefits with respect to the excise tax imposed under
Section 4999 of the Code or the tax or penalties imposed under Section 409A of
the Code.

 



 

(xii) To the Companys knowledge, none of the Company, its Subsidiaries nor
any other Person, including any fiduciary, has engaged in any "prohibited
transaction" (as defined in Section 4975 of the Code or Section 406 of ERISA),
which would reasonably be expected to subject any of the Company Employee
Benefit Plans or their related trusts, the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or
any Person that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has an obligation to
indemnify, to any material tax or penalty imposed under Section 4975 of the
Code or Section 502 of ERISA.

 



      
 

 



 

(xiii) There are no pending or, to the Companys knowledge, threatened,
claims (other than routine claims for benefits in the ordinary course),
lawsuits or arbitrations which have been asserted or instituted by any current
or former employee or consultant of the Company or its Subsidiaries, and to
the Companys knowledge, no set of circumstances exists which may reasonably
give rise to a claim or lawsuit against the Company Employee Benefit Plans,
any fiduciaries thereof with respect to their duties to the Company Employee
Benefit Plans or the assets of any of the trusts under any of the Company
Employee Benefit Plans which could reasonably be expected to result in any
material liability of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. There are no
outstanding assessments, penalties, fines, liens, charges, surcharges, or
other amounts due or owing pursuant to any workplace safety and insurance
legislation, and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries have been
reassessed in any material respect under such legislation during the past
three (3) years and no audit of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is
currently being performed pursuant to any applicable workplace safety and
insurance legislation. There are no pending claims or, to the knowledge of the
Company, potential claims which may materially adversely affect the Companys
accident cost experience in respect of the business of the Company or any
Subsidiary of the Company.

 



 

(xiv) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liability for
life insurance, death or medical benefits to current or former employees or
beneficiaries or dependents thereof, except for health continuation coverage
as required by Section 4980B of the Code or Part 6 of Title I of ERISA or
other applicable Law.

 



 

(xv) Each Company Employee Benefit Plan that is a "nonqualified deferred
compensation plan" (within the meaning of Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code)
subject to Section 409A of the Code has been operated and administered, in all
material respects, in compliance with Section 409A of the Code and any
guidance issued by the Department of Treasury or the IRS thereunder, to the
extent applicable to such plan.

 



 

(xvi) All Company Options were granted at an exercise price at least equal to
the fair market value (within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code and the
regulations promulgated thereunder) of a Company Share on the date of grant
and no Company Option has been extended or amended, and no Company Option has
been repriced, in each case since its original date of grant.

being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and for which
adequate reserves are being maintained.

matters which create, or which with notice or the passage of time would

Property Leases is valid, binding and in full force and effect without default

or passage of time or both, would constitute a default or breach by either
party under any Company Real Property Lease), except in each case where the
failure to comply or the default would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company. True and complete copies of all
Company Real Property Leases that are material to the Company have been made

including all amendments or modifications thereof and all side letters or
other instruments affecting the obligations of any party thereunder. There is

(I) the Pre-Acquisition Reorganizations are not prejudicial to securityholders
of the Company (having regard to the indemnities provided herein);

 



 

(II) the Pre-Acquisition Reorganizations do not impair the ability of the
Purchaser or the Company to complete the Arrangement or delay the completion
of the Arrangement;

 



 

(III) the Pre-Acquisition Reorganizations are effected as close as reasonably
practicable prior to the Effective Time;

 



 

(IV) none of the Company or its Subsidiaries is required to take any action

incrementally greater than the Taxes or other consequences to such party in
connection with the completion of the Arrangement in the absence of action
being taken pursuant to this _Section 4.1(p)_;

 



 

(V) the Pre-Acquisition Reorganizations do not result in any material breach
by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of any Contract or any breach by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries of their respective organizational
documents or Law; and

 



 

(VI) the Pre-Acquisition Reorganizations shall not become effective unless the
Purchaser has waived or confirmed in writing the satisfaction of all
conditions in its favour under _Section 6.1_ and _Section 6.2_ and shall
have confirmed in writing that the Purchaser is prepared to promptly and
without condition (other than compliance with this _Section 4.1(p))_ proceed
to effect the Arrangement.

 



 

(ii) The Purchaser waives any breach of a representation, warranty or covenant
by the Company, where such breach is a result of an action taken by the
Company or a Subsidiary of the Company in good faith pursuant to a request by
the Purchaser in accordance with this _Section 4.1(p)_. The Purchaser shall
provide written notice to the Company of any proposed Pre-Acquisition
Reorganization at least 15 Business Days prior to the Effective Time. Upon
receipt of such notice, the Purchaser and the Company shall work co-
operatively and use commercially reasonable efforts to prepare prior to the
Effective Time all documentation necessary and do all such other acts and
things as are reasonably necessary, including making amendments to this
Agreement or the Plan of Arrangement (provided that such amendments do not
require the Company to obtain approval of Shareholders (other

 



      
 

 



 

than as properly put forward and approved at the Company Meeting) or
materially delay the Effective Date), to give effect to such Pre-Acquisition
Reorganization. If the Arrangement is not completed other than due to a breach
by the Company of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Purchaser
shall:

 



 

(1) forthwith reimburse the Company for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and
expenses incurred in connection with any proposed Pre-Acquisition
Reorganization; and

 



 

(2) indemnify the Company for any losses or costs (other than those reimbursed
in accordance with the foregoing) incurred by the Company and arising directly
out of any Pre-Acquisition Reorganization provided however, that such
indemnity shall include any reasonable costs incurred by the Company in order
to restore the organizational structure of the Company to a substantially
identical structure of the Company as at the date hereof.

 



 

(iii) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company
acknowledges that the Purchaser may enter into transactions (the " _Bump
Transactions_ ") designed to step up the tax basis in certain capital property
of the Company for purposes of the Tax Act and agrees to use commercially
reasonable efforts to provide information reasonably required by Purchaser in
this regard on a timely basis and to assist in the obtaining of any such
information in order to facilitate a successful completion of the Bump
Transactions or any such other reorganizations or transactions as is
reasonably requested by the Purchaser.

dealings with them to the end that their goodwill and ongoing businesses shall
not be impaired in any material respect at the Effective Time. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, no failure to act by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries with

any dividends on or make other distributions in respect of any of its equity
securities, (ii) split, combine, subdivide, consolidate or reclassify any
capital stock or issue or authorize or propose the issuance or authorization
of any other securities in respect of, in lieu of or in substitution for,

other agents and representatives (collectively, " ** _Representatives_** "),
reasonable access (during normal business hours, upon reasonable prior notice
and in accordance with procedures reasonably established by, and in a manner
as shall not unreasonably interfere with the business or operations of, the
Parent, AcquisitionCo, Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries, as
applicable) during the period prior to the earlier of the Effective Time or

consummation of the Arrangement or the other transactions contemplated hereby,
or (C) any law, rule, regulation, order or decree is enacted, entered,

intention to effect such action (which notice shall include a copy of the

notice of any material development with respect to any of the foregoing by the
end of the day (New York time) following the day on which such development

Section 5.5 _Employee Benefits Plans_.

 



 

(a) For the period beginning on the Effective Date and ending on the six (6)
month anniversary of the Effective Date, Parent shall, or shall cause one of
its Subsidiaries to, provide each employee of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Date who continues his or her
employment with Parent or one of its Subsidiaries (including the Company)
following the Effective Date (each, a " ** _Continuing Employee_** ")
compensation and benefit opportunities that are comparable in the aggregate to
those provided to such Continuing Employee under the Company Employee Benefit
Plans in effect immediately prior to the Effective Date (excluding (i) any
equity-based compensation or (ii) retention, stay, change-in-control or
similar payments or benefits). Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall, or
shall cause one of its Subsidiaries to, honor any terms and conditions of
employment of Continuing Employees to the extent required by applicable Law or
the terms and conditions of any collective bargaining agreement, works
council, or other similar agreement listed on _Section 3.1(r)_ of the Company
Disclosure Letter, as such agreement may be in effect from time to time.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, nothing herein
shall preclude or limit the right of Parent or its applicable affiliate(s)
from terminating the employment of any Continuing Employee after the Effective
Date for any lawful reason.

 



 

(b) For purposes of eligibility and vesting (but not benefit accrual) under
the Company Employee Benefit Plans and the Parent Employee Benefit Plans
providing benefits to any Continuing Employee after the Effective Date (the "
** _New Plans_** "), each Continuing Employee shall be credited with his or
her years of service with the Company and its Subsidiaries, as the case may
be, before the Effective Date, to the same extent as such Continuing Employee
was entitled, before the Effective Time, to credit for such service under any
similar Company Employee Benefit Plan; provided that the foregoing service
credit shall not apply with respect to benefit accrual under any defined
benefit pension plan or to the extent that its application would result in a
duplication of benefits. In addition, and without limiting the generality of
the foregoing: (i) each Continuing Employee shall be immediately eligible to

 



      
 

 



 

participate, without any waiting time, in any New Plans to the extent coverage
under such New Plan replaces coverage under a comparable Company Employee
Benefit Plan in which such Continuing Employee participated immediately before
the replacement; and (ii) for purposes of each such New Plan providing
medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any Company
Employee, Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause all pre-
existing condition exclusions, evidence of insurability requirements and
actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such
Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents, and Parent shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause any eligible expenses incurred by
such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents under the
applicable Company Employee Benefit Plan during the portion of the plan year
of such New Plan ending on the date such Continuing Employees participation
in such New Plan begins to be taken into account under such New Plan for
purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket
requirements applicable to such Continuing Employee and his or her covered
dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in
accordance with such New Plan.

 



 

(c) After the date hereof, the Company, in consultation with Parent, shall
satisfy any required notifications and/or consent requirements of any works
councils or other similar labor or employee organizations, or as required
under any applicable labor relations legislation, any collective bargaining
agreement or similar labor agreement.

 



 

(d) Following the date of this Agreement, no new election period shall be
commenced for purposes of the Companys Employee Stock Savings Plan.

 



 

(e) Following the date of this Agreement, the Company shall continue to
operate its 2017 Short Term Incentive Plan (the " ** _2017 STIP_** ") in
accordance with past practices and in the ordinary course of business in
accordance with the existing terms of the 2017 STIP except as otherwise
modified by this provision. Amounts payable by the Company (if any) under the
2017 STIP shall be paid on or before March 15, 2018 as determined by Parent,
with any such amounts to be calculated based upon applicable performance
achievement; provided, that, in the event that the Effective Date occurs on or
before December 31, 2017, then, in calculating the amounts to be paid under
the 2017 STIP, with respect to the stub period for the remainder of 2017, the
Company shall calculate the financial objectives component of the 2017 STIP by
annualizing January 1, 2017 through the last day of the month preceding the
Effective Date subject to adjustment to add back transaction costs,
restructuring costs, impairments, and any business disruption directly caused
by action required to be taken by the terms of this Agreement. Such
calculation and support shall be prepared by the Company and delivered, as
soon as reasonably practicable once the anticipated Effective Date is known,
to the Chief Executive Officer of Parent who shall review and approve using
good faith as soon as practicable, but in any event within three Business days
prior to the Effective Date. Participants will earn and be owed the bonus if
they are still employees of the Company and/or its Subsidiaries on the earlier
of the Effective Date or December 31, 2017.

 



 

(f) The Company shall deliver, within 10 Business Days following the date
hereof, the following documentation relating to each Company Employee Benefit
Plan, it being understood that any such additional documentation shall not be
deemed to act as an exception to any of the representations set forth in
_Section 3.1(j)_: (A) the most recent annual report (Form 5500) filed with
the IRS, if any, (B) the current plan documents comprising such Company

 



      
 

 



 

Employee Benefit Plan, including any and all amendments thereto, (C) each
trust agreement, insurance contract or other funding agreement relating to
such Company Employee Benefit Plan, if any, (D) the most recent summary plan
description for each Company Employee Benefit Plan, if any, (E) the most
recent actuarial report or valuation relating to a Company Employee Benefit
Plan subject to Title IV of ERISA, if any, and (F) the most recent
determination letter, opinion letter or advisory letter issued by the IRS with
respect to any Company Qualified Plan, if any.

 



 

This _Section 5.5_ shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of
the parties to this Agreement. Nothing in this _Section 5.5_, whether express
or implied, shall confer upon any Continuing Employee or any other current or
former employee, director, consultant or other service provider of the Company
or its Subsidiaries, or any other Person, any rights or remedies including any
right to employment or continued employment for any specified period, of any
nature or kind whatsoever, and no such Person shall be regarded for any
purpose as a third-party beneficiary of this Agreement. Nothing contained in
this Agreement shall (a) constitute or be deemed to be an amendment to any
Company Employee Benefit Plan, Parent Employee Benefit Plan or any other
compensation or benefit plan, program, practice, policy, agreement or
arrangement of the Company, Parent, AcquisitionCo or any of their respective
Subsidiaries; or (b) prevent the amendment or termination of any Company
Employee Benefit Plan or Parent Employee Benefit Plan or interfere with the
right or obligation of the Company, Parent or AcquisitionCo to make such
changes as are deemed necessary to conform with applicable Law or regulation
(including Section 409A of the Code).

 



 

Section 5.6 _Section 16 Matters_. Assuming that the Company delivers to
Parent the Section 16 Information reasonably (and in any event no less than 10
Business Days) in advance of the Effective Time, the Parent Board, or a
committee of Non-Employee Directors thereof (as such term is defined for
purposes of Rule 16b-3(d) under the U.S. Exchange Act), shall reasonably
promptly thereafter and in any event prior to the Effective Time adopt a
resolution providing that the receipt by the Insiders of the Company of Parent
Shares in exchange for Company Shares pursuant to the transactions
contemplated hereby and to the extent such securities are listed in the
Section 16 Information provided by the Company to Parent prior to the
Effective Time, is intended to be exempt from liability pursuant to Section
16(b) under the U.S. Exchange Act. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall take all actions necessary to ensure that the disposition of Company
Shares and equity-based securities of the Company (including Company
Restricted Stock Units and Company Options) pursuant to the transactions
contemplated hereby that are held by Insiders of the Company are exempt from
liability pursuant to Section 16(b) under the U.S. Exchange Act.

 



 

Section 5.7 _Fees and Expenses_. Whether or not the Arrangement is
consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party incurring
such expense, except as otherwise provided in _Section 7.3_ and except that
filing fees paid to any Governmental Entities with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby pursuant to the HSR Act, the CCA or any Merger Control Law
shall be paid by Parent.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 5.8 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_.

 



 

(a) Without limiting any other rights that any Indemnified Party may have
pursuant to any employment agreement, indemnification agreement or otherwise,
from and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause AcquisitionCo to, to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable law, indemnify, defend and hold
harmless, and provide advancement of expenses to, each person who is now, or
has been at any time prior to the date hereof or who becomes prior to the
Effective Time, an officer or director of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (the " ** _Indemnified Parties_** ") against all losses, claims,
damages, costs, expenses (including attorneys and other professionals fees
and expenses), liabilities or judgments or amounts that are paid in settlement
of or in connection with any threatened or actual claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation based in whole or in part on or arising in whole
or in part out of the fact that such person is or was a director, officer or
employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or is or was serving at the
request of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a director, officer,
employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, limited liability
company, joint venture, employee benefit plan, trust or other enterprise or by
reason of anything done or not done by such person in any such capacity and
pertaining to any matter existing or occurring, or any acts or omissions
occurring, at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed
prior to, or at or after, the Effective Time, in each case to the fullest
extent such persons are permitted by applicable law to be indemnified by, or
have the right to advancement of expenses from, the Company as of the date
hereof.

 



 

(b) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall
cause AcquisitionCo to, maintain in effect, for the benefit of the Indemnified
Parties with respect to their acts or omissions as directors and officers of
the Company and its Subsidiaries, as applicable, occurring prior to Effective
Time (including with respect to acts or omissions occurring in connection with
this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby),
the current policies of directors and officers liability insurance
maintained by the Company (the " ** _Existing D andO Policy_**"); _provided_
that, (i) Parent may, or may cause AcquisitionCo to, substitute therefor a
policy or policies with limits, terms and conditions that are no less
advantageous to the insured; (ii) neither Parent nor AcquisitionCo shall be
required to pay annual premiums for the Existing DandO Policy (or for any
substitute policy or policies) in excess of 250% of the annual premium paid by
the Company with respect to the Existing DandO Policy as of the date hereof,
which is set forth in _Section 5.8_ of the Company Disclosure Letter (the "
** _Insurance Amount_** "); and (iii) if such premiums for such insurance
would at any time exceed the Insurance Amount, then Parent shall maintain, or
cause AcquisitionCo to maintain, policies of insurance that, in Parents good
faith determination, provide the maximum coverage available at an annual
premium equal to the Insurance Amount. In lieu of the foregoing, Parent may,
or may cause AcquisitionCo to, at its option, purchase, from one or more
insurers reasonably acceptable to the Company, a single payment, run-off
policy or policies of directors and officers liability insurance covering
each Indemnified Party with respect to their acts or omissions as directors
and officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries, as applicable, occurring
prior to Effective Time (including with respect to acts or omissions occurring
in connection with this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby) on terms and conditions, including limits, not less
favorable in the aggregate than the terms and conditions contained in the
current policies of directors and officers liability insurance maintained by
Parent, such policy or policies to become effective at the Effective Time and
remain in effect for a period of six years after the Effective Time.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) If Parent or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or
merges into any other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers or
conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any person,
then, and in each such case, to the extent necessary, proper provision shall
be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent, as the case may be,
shall assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 5.8_.

 



 

(d) The provisions of this _Section 5.8_ (i) are intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and their
respective heirs and representatives and (ii) are in addition to, and not in
substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any
such person may have by contract or otherwise.

 



 

Section 5.9 _Stockholder Litigation_. Subject to applicable law, the Company
shall give Parent the opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement
of any stockholder litigation against the Company and/or its directors or
executive officers relating to the Arrangement and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. The Company agrees that it shall not settle or
offer to settle any litigation commenced prior to or after the date of this
Agreement against it or its directors, executive officers or similar persons
by any stockholder of such party relating to the Arrangement or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement without the prior written consent
of Parent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned).

 



 

Section 5.10 _Additional Agreements_. In case at any time after the Effective
Time any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of
this Agreement or to vest Parent or AcquisitionCo with full title to all
properties, assets, rights, approvals, immunities and franchises of either of
the constituent corporations of the Arrangement, the proper officers and
directors of each Party to this Agreement shall take all such necessary
action.

 



 

Section 5.11 _Exemption from the Registration Requirements of the U.S.
Securities Act_. If exemption from the registration requirements of the U.S.
Securities Act pursuant to Section 3(a)(10) is not available, the parties
agree to amend the provisions of this Agreement, the Arrangement and any other
relevant documents to such extent reasonably necessary to ensure that the
transaction contemplated by this Agreement can be effected in a manner
consistent with the provisions of the U.S. Securities Act and any relevant
Securities Laws, provided that no Party shall be required to agree to any
amendment that would be materially detrimental to such Party or its
equityholders, including, for the avoidance of doubt, any amendment to the

(or any of their respective shareholders, directors, officers, employees,

7.3_, _Section 5.1_, _Section 5.7_, _Section 5.12_ and _Article 8_, which

then the Company shall pay the sum of $8 million (the " ** _Company
Termination Fee_** ") on the second Business Day following such termination;

 



 

(ii) if the Company shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section
7.2(h)_, then the Company shall pay the Company Termination Fee prior to or

previously paid by the Company to Parent pursuant to this _Section 7.3(b)_,
on the second Business Day following the consummation of such Acquisition
Proposal; and

 



 

(iv) if (A) either party shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section

7.3(b)_, on the second Business Day following the consummation of such
Acquisition Proposal.

 



 

(c) Each of the Parties acknowledges that any amount payable pursuant to
_Section 7.3(b)_ is not a penalty, but rather is liquidated damages in a
reasonable amount that will compensate Parent or Company in the circumstances
in which such payments are due and payable and which do not involve fraud or
willful and intentional breach of this Agreement, for the efforts and
resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement
and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation
of the Arrangement, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate
with precision. In no event shall Parent be entitled to payment of the Company
Termination Fee on more than one occasion and in no event shall Parent,
Company any of their respective Affiliates or any other Person have any right
to bring or maintain any other claim, action or proceeding against

 



      
 

 



 

Company, Parent or any of their respective Affiliates arising out of this
Agreement and of the transactions contemplated hereby or any matters forming
the basis for such termination, in each case other than arising out of fraud
or willful and intentional breach of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 7.4 _Amendment_. Subject to the provisions of the Interim Order, the
Plan of Arrangement and applicable Laws, this Agreement and the Plan of
Arrangement may, at any time and from time to time before or after the holding

jurisdiction set forth in this _Section 8.3_ shall not constitute general
consents to service of process in the Province of Alberta and shall have no
effect for any purpose except as provided in this _Section 8.3_ and shall not
be deemed to confer rights on any person other than the parties. The Parties
agree that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be
conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment
or in any other manner provided by applicable law. In addition, each of the
Parties agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal
jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such court and
irrevocably waives any and all right to trial by jury with respect to any
action related to or arising out of this Agreement or the Arrangement.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 8.4 _Injunctive Relief_. The Parties agree that irreparable harm may
occur for which money damages might not be an adequate remedy at Law in the
event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. Accordingly,
the Parties agree that, in the event of any breach or threatened breach of
this Agreement by a Party, the non-breaching Party will be entitled, without
the requirement of posting a bond or other security, to seek equitable relief,
including injunctive relief and specific performance, and the Parties shall
not object to the granting of injunctive or other equitable relief on the
basis that there exists an adequate remedy at law. Such remedies will not be
the exclusive remedies for any breach of this Agreement but will be in
addition to all other remedies available at Law or equity to each of the
Parties.

 



 

Section 8.5 _Time of Essence_. Time shall be of the essence in this Agreement.

 



 

Section 8.6 _Entire Agreement, Binding Effect, Assignment and References_.
This Agreement (including the exhibits and schedules hereto), the Company
Disclosure Letter, the Parent Disclosure Letter, the Confidentiality Agreement
and the other Transaction Agreements constitute the entire agreement, and
supersede all other prior agreements and understandings, both written and
oral, between the Parties, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter
hereof and thereof and, except as expressly provided in this Agreement, this
Agreement is not intended to and shall not confer upon any Person other than
the Parties any rights or remedies under this Agreement. This Agreement shall
be binding upon and shall endure to the benefit of the Parties and their
respective successors and permitted assigns. Neither this Agreement nor any of
the rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement may be assigned by
any of the Parties without the prior written consent of the other Party.

 



 

Section 8.7 _No Liability_. No director or officer of Parent shall have any
personal liability whatsoever to the Company under this Agreement, or any
other document delivered in connection with the transactions contemplated on
behalf of Parent. No director or officer of the Company shall have any
personal liability whatsoever to Parent under this Agreement, or any other
document delivered in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement on behalf of the Company.

 



 

Section 8.8 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule or Law or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is not affected
in any manner materially adverse to any Party. Upon such determination that
any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being
enforced, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement
so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in
an acceptable manner to the end that the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement are fulfilled to the fullest extent possible.

 



 

Section 8.9 _Counterparts, Execution_. This Agreement may be executed in one
or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original but all
of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument. The Parties
shall be entitled to rely upon delivery of an executed facsimile or similar
executed electronic copy of this Agreement, and such

 



      
 

 



 

facsimile or similar executed electronic copy shall be legally effective to
create a valid and binding agreement between the Parties.

 **ARTICLE 2 
EFFECT OF ARRANGEMENT**

 



 

2.1 _Arrangement Agreement_. This Plan of Arrangement is made pursuant to and
subject to the provisions of the Arrangement Agreement. Other than as
expressly provided for herein, no portion of this Plan of Arrangement shall

 **ARTICLE 3 
ARRANGEMENT**

occurring five minutes following completion of the previous event without any
further authorization, act or formality:

 



 

(a) Each Dissent Share shall be transferred by such Dissenting Shareholder to
AcquisitionCo (free and clear of any Liens) in accordance with, and for the
consideration contemplated in, _Article 4_;

 



 

(b) Each Company Option that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be fully vested and exercisable pursuant to the provisions of the
applicable Company Stock Incentive Plan and award agreements, by virtue of the
Acquisition and without any further action by Parent, AcquisitionCo, the
Company or the holder of that Company Option, and shall be cancelled in
consideration for the right to receive an amount in cash (less any required

      
 

 



 

withholding Taxes) payable by the Company as soon as reasonably practicable
following the Effective Time, without interest, equal to the product of (i)
the excess of (A) the Market Value per Company Share over (B) the exercise
price per share of each Company Option, multiplied by (ii) the aggregate
number of Company Shares that may be acquired upon exercise of such Company
Option immediately prior to the Effective Time; provided that, each Company
Option with an exercise price per share that is equal to or more than the
Market Value shall be cancelled for no consideration.

 



 

(c) Each Company Restricted Stock Unit that is outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be fully vested pursuant to the provisions of the
applicable Company Stock Incentive Plan and award agreements, by virtue of the
Acquisition and without any further action by Parent, AcquisitionCo, the
Company or the holder of that Company Restricted Stock Unit, and shall be
cancelled in consideration for the right to receive an amount in cash (less
any required withholding Taxes) payable by the Company as soon as reasonably
practicable following the Effective Time, without interest, equal to the
Market Value per Company Share multiplied by the aggregate number of Company
Shares represented by such Company Restricted Stock Unit immediately prior to
the Effective Time. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, all
amounts payable in respect of a Company Restricted Stock Unit shall be paid in
accordance with the terms of the applicable Company Stock Incentive Plan,
award agreement and Board approval, as applicable. For purposes of the
foregoing, each outstanding Company Restricted Stock Unit that is subject to a
performance-based vesting requirement shall become fully vested and converted
as provided above based upon the number of units at the "target" level of
performance applicable to such award.

 



 

(d) The following shall occur:

 



 

(i) each Company Share (other than any Dissent Share) shall be transferred to
AcquisitionCo (free and clear of any Liens);

 



 

(ii) in respect of each Company Share transferred in _Section 3.1(d)(i)_,
Parent shall issue the Share Consideration to each Company Shareholder;

 



 

(iii) AcquisitionCo shall issue to Parent that number of common shares of
AcquisitionCo equal in value to the aggregate Share Consideration (based on a
value of $1.00 per share) as consideration for Parent having issued the Share
Consideration in _Section 3.1(d)(i)_; and

 



 

(iv) there shall be added to the stated capital account maintained by
AcquisitionCo for its common shares an amount equal to the fair market value
of the Share Consideration issued by Parent in _Section 3.1(d)(ii)_;

 



 

(e) with respect to each Company Share transferred in accordance with _Section
3.1(a)_ or _Section 3.1(d)_:

 



 

(i) the registered holder thereof shall cease to be the registered holder of
such Company Share and shall cease to have any rights in respect of such
Company Share and the name of such registered holder shall be removed from the
register of Company

      
 

 



 

Shareholders as of the time of transfer prescribed in _Section 3.1(a)_ or
_Section 3.1(d)_, as applicable;

 



 

(ii) the registered holder thereof shall be deemed to have executed and
delivered all consents, releases, assignments and waivers, statutory or
otherwise, required to transfer such Company Share; and

 



 

(iii) AcquisitionCo will be the holder of all of the outstanding Company
Shares as of the time of transfer prescribed in _Section 3.1(a)_ or _Section
3.1(d)_, as applicable, and the central securities register of Company shall
be revised accordingly and AcquisitionCo shall be entitled to all of the
rights and privileges attached to the Company Shares; and

 



 

(f) the transfers, exchanges, issuances and terminations provided for in this
_Section 3.1_ will be deemed to occur on the Effective Date, notwithstanding
that certain procedures related thereto may not be completed until after the
Effective Date.

 



 

3.2 _No Fractional Shares_. No fractional Parent Shares shall be issued upon
the surrender of Company Share certificates for exchange, and any such
fractional share interests to which a former Company Shareholder would
otherwise have been entitled will not entitle such former Company Shareholder
to vote or to any other rights of a holder Parent Shares. In lieu of any such
fractional Parent Shares, each former Company Shareholder otherwise entitled
to fractional Parent Shares shall receive the nearest whole number of Parent
Shares. For greater certainty, where such fractional interest is greater than
or equal to 0.5, the number of Parent Shares to be issued shall be rounded up
to the nearest whole number of Parent Shares and where such fractional
interest is less than 0.5, the number of Parent Shares to be issued shall be
rounded down to the nearest whole number of Parent Shares.

 



 

 **ARTICLE 4 
DISSENT RIGHTS**

 



 

4.1 _Dissent Rights_

 



 

(a) Each registered Company Shareholder may exercise rights of dissent (" **
_Dissent Rights_** ") with respect to Company Shares held by such Company
Shareholder pursuant to Section 191 of the ABCA, as modified by the Interim
Order and this _Section 4.1(a)_; provided that, notwithstanding subsection
191(5) of the ABCA, the written objection to the Arrangement Resolution
referred to in subsection 191(5) of the ABCA must be received by the
registered Company Shareholder to the Company by not later than 4:00 p.m.
(Eastern time) two Business Days immediately preceding the date of the Company
Meeting (as it may be adjourned or postponed from time to time). Dissenting
Shareholders who:

 



 

(i) are ultimately entitled to be paid by AcquisitionCo fair value for their
Dissent Shares, shall be deemed to have transferred such Dissent Shares
(without any further authorization, act or formality and free and clear of any
Liens) to AcquisitionCo in accordance with _Section 3.1(a)_ as of the time
prescribed in _Section 3.1(a)_ at the fair value of the Dissent Shares, which
fair value, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the ABCA,
shall be determined as of the Effective Time; or

      
 

 



 

(ii) are ultimately not entitled, for any reason, to be paid by AcquisitionCo
fair value for their Dissent Shares, shall be deemed to have participated in
the Arrangement in respect of those Company Shares on the same basis as a non-
dissenting Company Shareholder and shall be entitled to receive, and shall
receive, only the consideration set forth in _Section 3.1(d)_.

 



 

(b) In no event shall Parent, AcquisitionCo, Purchaser, Company, the
Depositary or any other person be required to recognize a Dissenting
Shareholder as a registered or beneficial owner of Company Shares or any
interest therein (other than the rights set out in this _Section 4.1_) at or
after the Effective Time, and at the Effective Time the names of such
Dissenting Shareholders shall be deleted from the central securities register
of Company as at the Effective Time.

 



 

(c) For greater certainty, in addition to any other restrictions in the
Interim Order, no person shall be entitled to exercise Dissent Rights with
respect to Company Shares in respect of which a person has voted or has
instructed a proxy holder to vote in favor of the Arrangement Resolution.

 



 

 **ARTICLE 5 
EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES**

 



 

5.1 _Certificates and Payments_

 



 

(a) Following receipt of the Final Order and prior to the Effective Time,
Parent shall deliver or arrange to be delivered to the Depositary the
Consideration, including certificates or Direct Registration System Advices
representing the Parent Shares required to be issued to the Company
Shareholders in accordance with _Section 3.1(d)_ hereof, which Parent Share
evidence shall be held by the Depositary as agent and nominee for such former
Company Shareholders for distribution to such former Company Shareholders in
accordance with the provisions of _Article 5_ hereof.

 



 

(b) Upon surrender to the Depositary for cancellation of a certificate which
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding Company Shares
that were transferred pursuant to _Section 3.1(d)_, together with a duly
completed and executed Letter of Transmittal and such additional documents and
instruments as the Depositary may reasonably require, the Company Shareholder
represented by such surrendered certificate shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor the Consideration to which the holder is entitled to receive
in respect of the Company Shares represented by such certificate, and the
Depositary shall deliver to such Company Shareholder the Consideration, which
such Company Shareholder has the right to receive under the Arrangement for
such Company Shares and any certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be
cancelled.

 



 

(c) Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 5.1_, each certificate
that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented Company Shares shall
be deemed after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon
such surrender the Consideration to which the holder is entitled to receive in
lieu of such certificate as contemplated in this _Section 5.1_. Any such
certificate formerly representing Company Shares not duly surrendered on

      
 

 



 

or before the sixth anniversary of the Effective Date shall cease to represent
a claim by or interest of any former holder of Company Shares of any kind or
nature against or in Parent, AcquisitionCo, Purchaser or Company. On such
date, all Consideration to which such former holder was entitled shall be
deemed to have been surrendered and forfeited to Parent.

 



 

(d) In the event any certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented one or more outstanding Company Shares that were transferred
pursuant to _Section 3.1(d)_ shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such
certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Depositary will deliver in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, the Consideration
deliverable in accordance with such holders Letter of Transmittal. When
authorizing such payment in exchange for any lost, stolen or destroyed
certificate, the Person to whom such Consideration is to be delivered shall as
a condition precedent to the delivery of such Consideration, give a bond
satisfactory to Parent and the Depositary (acting reasonably) in such sum as
Parent may direct, or otherwise indemnify Parent and Company in a manner
satisfactory to Parent and Company, acting reasonably, against any claim that
may be made against Parent, AcquisitionCo, Purchaser and Company with respect
to the certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

 



 

(e) Parent, AcquisitionCo, Purchaser, Company or the Depositary shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from any amount payable to any Person under
the Plan of Arrangement, such amounts as Parent, AcquisitionCo, Purchaser,
Company or the Depositary are required to deduct and withhold with respect to
such payment under the Tax Act, the _United States Internal Revenue Code of
1986_, as amended, or any provision of any other applicable Law in respect of
Taxes (a " ** _Withholding Obligation_** "). To the extent that amounts are so
withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes hereof as
having been paid to the Person in respect of which such withholding was made,
provided that such amounts are actually remitted to the appropriate taxing
authority. To the extent that any amount so required to be deducted or
withheld from any payment to any Person exceeds the amount of cash otherwise
payable to such Person, Parent, AcquisitionCo, Company or the Depositary shall
also have the right to withhold such number of Parent Shares otherwise
issuable to such Person pursuant to this Plan of Arrangement as would be
necessary to produce sale proceeds (after deducting reasonable commissions
payable to the broker and other reasonable costs and expenses) sufficient to
fund any Withholding Obligation in respect of such Person; provided that
Parent, the Company, AcquisitionCo or the Depositary, as applicable, shall
notify the holder thereof and remit any unapplied balance of the net proceeds
of such sale; and provided, further, that no sales of any such Parent Shares
shall occur in any jurisdiction in which such sales are not permitted under
applicable Law.

 



 

(f) Any exchange or transfer of Company Shares pursuant to this Plan of
Arrangement shall be free and clear of any Liens or other claims of third
parties of any kind.

 



 

(g) No dividend or other distribution declared or made after the Effective
Time with respect to Parent Shares with a record date after the Effective Time
shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered certificate that, immediately
