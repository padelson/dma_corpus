to cause Parent and Merger Sub to satisfy their covenants and obligations under this Agreement and
to cause the Merger and the transactions contemplated by the Merger to be consummated on the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement. Each of the parties hereby waives (i)
any defenses in any action for specific performance, including the defense that a remedy at law

prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief. If, prior to the Outside Date, any party brings any

Court has granted an award of damages for such alleged breach against Parent or Merger Sub, the
Company may enforce such award and accept damages for such alleged breach only if, within five (5)
days following such determination, the Company confirms to Parent in writing that it is prepared
and willing to consummate the Merger in accordance with this Agreement, and Parent is not willing
to consummate the Merger within such five (5)&nbsp;day period in accordance with the terms and
conditions hereof. In addition, the Company agrees to cause any legal action or proceeding still
pending to be dismissed with prejudice at such time as Parent and Merger Sub consummate the Merger,
except for claims against the Surviving Corporation as set forth and contemplated by <U>Section
5.8</U>. Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that in the event of any breach, or wrongful
repudiation or termination, of this Agreement by Parent or Merger Sub, the damages incurred by the
Company for purposes of determining any remedy at law or equity under this Agreement shall not be
limited to reimbursement of expenses or out of pocket costs and would include any damages incurred
by the Company&#146;s shareholders in the event such shareholders would not receive the benefit of the
bargain negotiated by the Company on their behalf as set forth in this Agreement (taking into
consideration relevant matters, including other combination opportunities and the time value of
