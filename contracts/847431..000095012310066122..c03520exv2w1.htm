the New York Business Corporation Law (the " _NYBCL_ "), at the Effective
Time, Merger 

 

    ##### 

  

  

Sub shall be merged with and into the Company, and the separate corporate
existence of Merger Sub shall thereupon cease, and the Company shall be the
surviving corporation in the Merger (the " _Surviving Corporation_ "). 

  

SECTION 1.2. _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall
take place at the offices of Weil, Gotshal and Manges LLP, 767 Fifth Avenue,
New York, New York 10153 at 10:00 a.m. (New York City time) on a date to be

subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions at such time), or
at such other place, date and/or time as may be agreed to in writing by the
Company and Parent. The date on which the Closing actually occurs is referred
to in this Agreement as the " _Closing Date_." 

  

SECTION 1.3. _Effective Time_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, as
soon as practicable on the Closing Date, the parties shall file with the
Department of State of the State of New York a certificate of merger,
executed in accordance with, and in such form as complies with, the relevant
provisions of the NYBCL (the " _Certificate of Merger_ "). The Merger
shall become effective upon the filing of the Certificate of Merger or at
such later time as is agreed to by the parties and specified in the
Certificate of Merger (the time at which the Merger becomes effective is
referred to in this Agreement as the " _Effective Time_ "). 

  

SECTION 1.4. _Effects of the Merger_. From and after the Effective Time, the
Merger shall have the effects set forth in the applicable provisions of the
NYBCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto,
at the Effective Time, all of the properties, rights, privileges, powers and
franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the
Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company
and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the
Surviving Corporation. 

  

SECTION 1.5. _Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws of the Surviving
Corporation_. The certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Company, as
in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the certificate
of incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter
amended as provided therein or by Law. 

   

SECTION 1.6. _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation_. 

  

(a) Each of the parties hereto shall take all necessary action to cause the
directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time to be the
directors of the Surviving Corporation immediately following the Effective
Time, to hold office until their respective successors are duly elected or
appointed and qualified or their earlier death, resignation or removal in
accordance with the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving
Corporation. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall take all 

  

    ##### 

  

   

reasonable action necessary to cause the directors of the Company to resign as

resignation or removal in accordance with the certificate of incorporation
and by-laws of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

ARTICLE II 

   

 _EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK_  

   

SECTION 2.1. _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of
common stock, par value $1.00 per share, of the Company (" _Company Shares_
") or any shares of capital stock of Merger Sub: 

  

(a) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each share of capital stock of Merger Sub
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable
share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving
Corporation and shall constitute the only shares of capital stock of the
Surviving Corporation. 

  

(b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock_. Any Company
Shares that are owned by the Company as treasury stock, and any Company
Shares owned by Parent or Merger Sub, shall be automatically canceled and
shall cease to exist and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange
therefor. Each Company Share which is owned by any Subsidiary of the Company
shall remain outstanding, with appropriate adjustment to the number thereof
to preserve such SubsidiaryÂ’s relative ownership percentage in the Company. 

  

(c) _Conversion of Company Shares_. Each Company Share issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares to be
canceled or to remain outstanding in accordance with _Section 2.1(b)_) shall
be converted into the right to receive $25.75 in cash, without interest (the
" _Merger Consideration_ "). As of the Effective Time, all such Company
Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and
shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate (a " _Certificate_ "),
or un-certificated book-entry shares (" _Book-Entry Shares_ "), which
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such Company Shares
shall thereafter cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except
the right to receive the Merger Consideration to be paid in consideration
therefor upon surrender of such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares in
accordance with _Section 2.3(b)_, without interest. 

  

SECTION 2.2. _No Appraisal Rights_. In accordance with Section 910 of the
NYBCL, no appraisal rights shall be available to holders of Company Shares in
connection with the Merger. 

 

    ##### 

  

   

SECTION 2.3. _Exchange of Certificates_. 

  

(a) _Paying Agent_. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit
with a bank or trust company as may be designated by Parent and reasonably
acceptable to the Company (the " _Paying Agent_ "), for the benefit of the
holders of Company Shares converted at the Effective Time into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.1(c)_ , the aggregate
Merger Consideration to which such holders shall become entitled pursuant to
_Section 2.1(c)_ (the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The Exchange Fund shall, pending
its disbursement to such holders, be invested by the Paying Agent as directed
by Parent in short-term direct obligations of the United States or for which
the full faith and credit of the United States is pledged to provide for the
payment of principal and interest. Any net profit resulting from, or interest
or income produced by, such amounts on deposit with the Paying Agent will be
payable to Parent or as Parent otherwise directs. 

  

(b) _Procedures_. Promptly, and in any event no later than three (3) Business
Days, after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall
cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of Company Shares
converted pursuant to _Section 2.1(c)_ into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration a letter of transmittal and related instructions which shall
(i) specify that the delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title
shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates (or book-entry
transfer of the Book-Entry Shares) to the Paying Agent and (ii) otherwise be
in customary form and include customary provisions (including with respect to
delivery of an "agentÂ’s message" regarding the book-entry transfer of Book-
Entry Shares) for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates and
Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of
a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent, together with such letter
of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions (or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares, receipt of an "agentÂ’s
message" by the Paying Agent or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as
the Paying Agent may reasonably request), the holder of such Certificate (or
Book-Entry Shares, as applicable) shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor the Merger Consideration, without interest, for each Company
Share formerly represented by such Certificate (or Book-Entry Shares, as
applicable), and the Certificate (or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable) so
surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. If any portion of such consideration
is to be issued and paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name
the surrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Shares were registered, it shall be
a condition to such issuance and payment that (i) the Certificate so
surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form
for transfer or such Book-Entry Share shall be properly transferred and (ii)
the Person requesting such issuance shall have paid any transfer and other
Taxes required by reason of the issuance and payment of such consideration to
a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry
Shares surrendered or shall have established to the reasonable satisfaction
of the Paying Agent and the Surviving Corporation that such Tax either
has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this
_Section 2.3_, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration as contemplated by this _Article II_, without
interest. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, a
holder of Book-Entry 

  

    ##### 

  

   

Shares shall not be required to deliver a Certificate to the Paying Agent to
receive the consideration to which such holder is entitled pursuant to this
_Article II _in respect of such Book-Entry Shares. 

  

(c) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Company Shares_. The
Merger Consideration issued and paid in respect of Company Shares represented
by Book-Entry Shares, or upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates, in
accordance with the terms of this _Article II_ shall be deemed to have been
issued and paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Company
Shares previously represented by such Book-Entry Shares and Certificates
(as applicable), and at the close of business on the day on which the
Effective Time occurs, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be
closed and, thereafter, there shall be no further registration of transfers
on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the
Company Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.
From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Book-Entry Shares or
Certificates that evidenced ownership of Company Shares outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with
respect to such Company Shares, except as otherwise provided for in this
Agreement or by Law. Subject to the last sentence of _Section 2.4_, if, at
any time after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the
Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged
as provided in this _Article II_. 

  

(d) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact
by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and,
if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such
reasonable amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that
may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent
will issue and pay, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate, the applicable Merger Consideration to be issued and paid in
respect of the Company Shares formerly represented by such Certificate,
as contemplated by this _Article II_. 

  

SECTION 2.4. _Termination of Fund_. At any time following the nine
(9)-month anniversary of the Closing Date, Parent or the Surviving
Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it
any instruments and funds (including any interest received with respect
thereto) that had been made available to the Paying Agent and which have not
been disbursed to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, and
thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look only to the Surviving
Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) as
general creditors thereof with respect to the payment of any Merger
Consideration that may be payable upon surrender of any Certificates or
transfer of any Book-Entry Shares held by such holders, as determined
pursuant to this Agreement, without any interest thereon. The
Surviving Corporation shall pay all charges and expenses, including those of
the Paying Agent, in connection with the exchange of Company Shares for the
Merger Consideration, except for charges and expenses of holders of Company
Shares. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by such holders at such time at which
such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental
Authority shall become, to 

  

    ##### 

  

   

the extent permitted by Law, the property of Parent, free and clear of all
claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. 

  

SECTION 2.5. _No Liability_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement
to the contrary, none of the parties hereto, the Surviving Corporation or the
Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person for Merger Consideration delivered
to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat
or similar Law. 

  

SECTION 2.6. _Withholding Taxes_. Each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation
and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this _Article II_ such amounts
as are required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of
such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "
_Code_ "), or under any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the
extent amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing
authority, the withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made. 

   

SECTION 2.7. _Company Stock Plans_. 

  

(a) _Company Options_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take
all actions under the NYMAGIC, INC. 1991 Stock Option Plan, the NYMAGIC, INC.
2002 Nonqualified Stock Option Plan as amended and restated and the NYMAGIC,
INC. 2004 Amended and Restated Long-Term Incentive Plan (together, the "
_Company Stock Plans_ ") and otherwise necessary to provide that
the unexercised portion of each option outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time that represents the right to acquire Company Shares (each, a "
_Company Option_ ") shall at the Effective Time vest in full, to the extent
unvested, and then be canceled, terminated and converted at the Effective
Time into the right to receive a cash amount equal to the Option Consideration
for each Company Share then subject to the Company Option; _provided_ ,
however, that no action taken by the Company or any holder of a Company
Option shall be required to be irrevocable until immediately prior to the
Effective Time. Such actions shall include the CompanyÂ’s use of its
best efforts to obtain the consent of the holders of any Underwater Option to
cancel and terminate the Underwater Option without receipt of any Option
Consideration. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Option Consideration_ "
means, with respect to any Company Share subject to a particular Company
Option, an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (i) the Merger Consideration
over (ii) the exercise price payable in respect of such Company Shares
subject to such Company Option and any required withholding Taxes. It is
understood for the avoidance of doubt that a Company Option for which such
exercise price equals or exceeds such Merger Consideration (" _Underwater
Option_ ") per share shall be canceled and terminated without the receipt of
any Option Consideration. The Option Consideration shall be paid as soon as
practicable after the Closing Date, but in no event later than three (3)
Business Days after the Closing Date. 

  

(b) _Company RSUs, Company DSUs and Company PSUs_. Prior to the Effective
Time, the Company shall take all actions under the Company Stock Plans and
otherwise as necessary to provide that each restricted stock unit, whether
vested or 

  

    ##### 

  

   

unvested (" _Company RSU_ "), each deferred stock unit (" _Company DSU_ "),
and each performance stock unit for which the performance targets have been
achieved (" _Company PSU_ "), issued by the Company under the Company Stock
Plans pursuant to which Company Shares may be issued, shall at the Effective
Time be canceled and converted into the right to receive an amount of cash,
equal to (A) the number of Company Shares issuable upon conversion of such
Company RSU, Company DSU or Company PSU multiplied by the Merger
Consideration, _plus_ (B) in accordance with the terms of the Company Stock
Plans and applicable award agreements, any interest and the value of any
dividend rights credited with respect to any such Company RSU, Company DSU
or Company PSU _minus_ (C) any required withholding Taxes. Such amounts shall
be paid as soon as practicable after the Closing Date in accordance with the
terms and conditions of the applicable plans and award agreements, but in no
event later than three (3) Business Days after the Closing Date. 

  

(c) All amounts payable pursuant to this _Section 2.7_ shall be subject to
any required withholding Taxes or proof of eligibility for exemption
therefrom, in accordance with _Section 2.6_. 

  

SECTION 2.8. _Adjustments_. Notwithstanding any provision of this _Article
II_ to the contrary (but without limiting the covenants in _Section 5.3_),
if between the date hereof and the Effective Time the outstanding Company
Shares shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a
different class by reason of the occurrence or record date of any stock
dividend, stock split, reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or
similar transaction, the Merger Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted
to reflect such stock dividend, stock split, reclassification, combination,
exchange of shares or similar transaction. 

  

ARTICLE III

the business conducted by it or the character or location of the properties

"). 

  

(b) Section 3.1(b)(i) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth the name
of each Subsidiary owned (whether directly or indirectly) by the Company and

any payment becoming due to any employee, director or individual independent

benefits otherwise payable under any Company Plan, (iii) require any
contributions or payments to fund any obligations under any Company Plan, or

(b) The Company shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable after the Proxy
Statement is cleared by the SEC for mailing to the shareholders of the

SECTION 5.2. _Takeover Proposals; Board Recommendation; Etc_. 

  

(a) Except as otherwise permitted by this _Section 5.2_, the Company shall
not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and the CompanyÂ’s and its SubsidiariesÂ’
respective officers and directors not to, and shall direct the CompanyÂ’s and
its SubsidiariesÂ’ employees, advisors, investment bankers, agents and
representatives (collectively, " _Representatives_ ") not to, directly or
indirectly, (i) solicit, knowingly facilitate or knowingly encourage
(including by way of furnishing non-public information) the making of, or any
inquiries regarding, a Takeover Proposal or (ii) engage in, continue or
otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations with any third party
regarding a Takeover Proposal or any inquiry or proposal that would
reasonably be expected to lead to a Takeover Proposal; _provided_ that if the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective Representatives
receives, after the date hereof and prior to receipt of the Company
Shareholder Approval, a written Takeover Proposal (which was unsolicited
and not involving a breach of this _Section 5.2_) that the Company Board
determines in good faith constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead
to a Superior Proposal, then the Company and its Representatives may, prior
to receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval and subject to compliance with
the CompanyÂ’s obligations under this _Section 5.2_, (A) furnish, pursuant to
an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, any information with respect to the
Company and its Subsidiaries to the Person (or group of Persons) making such
Takeover Proposal (provided that the 

  

    ##### 

  

   

Company shall concurrently provide to Parent all non-public information
concerning the Company or its Subsidiaries that is provided to any Person
given such access which was not previously provided to Parent or its
Representatives), and (B) engage and participate in discussions and
negotiations with such Person (or group of Persons) regarding such Takeover
Proposal. The Company shall not enter into any confidentiality agreement with
any Person which prohibits the Company from complying with its obligations to
Parent under this _Section 5.2_. 

  

(b) Neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) (A)
withdraw, qualify or change, or propose to withdraw, qualify or change, in a
manner adverse to Parent, the Company Recommendation or (B) approve or
recommend a Takeover Proposal or any proposal that would reasonably be
expected to lead to a Takeover Proposal (any action described in this clause
(i), an " _Adverse Recommendation Change_ "), or (ii) authorize or permit the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into any merger, acquisition,
share exchange or other agreement with respect to any Takeover Proposal
(other than a confidentiality agreement in accordance with this  _Section
5.2_) (each, a " _Company Acquisition Agreement_ "). 

  

(c) Notwithstanding _Section 5.2(b)_, prior to receipt of the Company
Shareholder Approval, if the Company receives a Takeover Proposal which the
Company Board determines in good faith after consultation with outside legal
counsel and an outside financial advisor, constitutes a Superior Proposal
(after giving effect to all of the adjustments to the terms of this
Agreement which may be offered by Parent including pursuant to this _Section
5.2(c)_), the Company Board may, if it determines in good faith after
consultation with such outside legal counsel that failure to take such action
would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the CompanyÂ’s shareholders
under applicable Law: (i) make an Adverse Recommendation Change in response to
such Superior Proposal, (ii) approve or recommend such Superior Proposal
and/or (iii) terminate this Agreement to enter into a Company Acquisition
Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal in accordance with _Section
7.1(d)(ii_); _provided_ that, in the case of clause (iii), the Company shall
pay to Parent the Company Termination Fee pursuant to _Section
7.3(a)(iii)_ (and any purported termination without such payment shall be
void and of no force or effect);  _provided_ _further_ that the Company Board
may not take any of the actions contemplated by clauses (i)-(iii), in each
case, (A) if the Superior Proposal resulted from a breach by the Company of
this _Section 5.2_ or (B) until after the third (3rd) Business Day following
ParentÂ’s receipt of written notice from the Company advising Parent that the
Company Board intends to take any such action, which notice (x) specifies the
material terms and conditions of (and the identity of the Person or group of
Persons making) the Superior Proposal and (y) includes copies of all
information described in _Section 5.2(e)(ii)_ (it being understood
and agreed that any amendment to the financial terms or other material terms
or conditions of such Superior Proposal shall require a new notice to Parent
and a new three (3) Business Day period). During any such three (3) Business
Day period, if requested by Parent, the Company shall engage in good
faith negotiations with Parent to amend this Agreement in a manner such that
the failure by the Company Board to take any such action would not be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the CompanyÂ’s shareholders under
applicable Law. In determining whether to take any such action (and whether
the relevant Takeover Proposal still constitutes a 

  

    ##### 

  

   

Superior Proposal), the Company Board shall take into account any changes to
the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent. 

  

(d) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.2_ or elsewhere in this Agreement
shall be deemed to prohibit the Company or the Company Board from complying
with its disclosure obligations under applicable Law with regard to a
Takeover Proposal, including taking and disclosing to the CompanyÂ’s
shareholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item
1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, nothing in this  _Section 5.2(d)_ shall in any way affect the
determination of whether there has been an Adverse Recommendation Change;
_provided_ that in no event shall any "stop, look and listen" or similar
communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act
be deemed to be an Adverse Recommendation Change. 

   

(e) In addition to the other obligations set forth in this _Section 5.2_: 

   

(i) the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and Representatives
to, cease immediately and cause to be terminated any and all existing
discussions or negotiations with any third party or its representatives or
financing sources conducted prior to the date hereof with respect to any
Takeover Proposal or any proposal that could reasonably be expected to lead
to a Takeover Proposal; and 

   

(ii) in addition to the other obligations set forth in this _Section 5.2_,
the Company shall as promptly as reasonably practicable advise Parent in
writing, and in no event later than twenty four (24) hours after receipt, if
any proposal, offer or inquiry is received by, any information is requested
from, or any discussions or negotiations are sought to be initiated or
continued with, the Company or its Subsidiaries or Representatives in respect
of a Takeover Proposal or potential Takeover Proposal, and shall, in such
notice to Parent, indicate the identity of the Person or group of
Persons making such proposal, offer, inquiry or request and the material
terms and conditions of such proposal or offer and the nature of such inquiry
or request (and shall include with such notice copies of any draft agreements
and financing commitment letters) and thereafter shall promptly keep Parent
informed of all material developments affecting the status and terms and
conditions of such proposal, offer, inquiry or request (and the Company
shall provide Parent with copies of any additional draft agreements and
financing commitment letters) and of the status of discussions or
negotiations. 

   

(f) For purposes of this Agreement: 

   

(i) " _Superior Proposal_ " means any bona fide written Takeover Proposal
(with all of the percentages included in the definition of Takeover Proposal
increased to fifty percent (50%)) on terms which the Company Board
determines in good faith after consultation with outside legal counsel and an
outside financial advisor (i) to be more favorable from a financial point of
view to the holders of Company Shares (other than Parent and its
Subsidiaries) than the 

  

    ##### 

  

   

Merger, taking into account all the terms and conditions of such proposal
(including price, form of consideration, closing conditions and the
likelihood and timing of consummation thereof based upon, among other things,
the availability of financing and the expectation of obtaining required
approvals) and this Agreement (including any changes to the terms of this
Agreement committed to by Parent to the Company in writing) and (ii) is
reasonably capable of being completed on the terms proposed. 

   

(ii) " _Takeover Proposal_ " means any inquiry, proposal or offer from any
third party relating to, in a single transaction or series of related
transactions, any (i) acquisition of assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries (including securities of Subsidiaries) equal to twenty percent
(20%) or more of the CompanyÂ’s consolidated assets or to which twenty percent
(20%) or more of the CompanyÂ’s revenues or earnings on a consolidated basis
are attributable, (ii) acquisition of beneficial ownership (within
the meaning of Section 13 under the Exchange Act) of twenty percent (20%) or
more of the outstanding Company Shares or any other class of equity
securities of the Company, (iii) tender offer or exchange offer that if
consummated would result in any Person (or "group," as defined under Section
13 of the Exchange Act) beneficially owning twenty percent (20%) or more of
the outstanding Company Shares or (iv) merger, consolidation, share
exchange, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or
similar transaction involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; in each
case, other than the Transactions.

properties and personnel as Parent may reasonably request. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not be obligated to
disclose any information that, in the reasonable judgment of the Company,
would result in the loss of attorney-client privilege with respect to such
information; _provided_  that the Company shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to develop an alternative to providing such information
and/or enter into a joint defense agreement if doing so would
reasonably permit the disclosure of such information without jeopardizing
such attorney-client privilege. Parent shall schedule and coordinate all
inspections with the Company and shall give the Company at least twenty-four
(24) hours prior written notice thereof, setting forth the inspection or
materials that Parent or its representatives intend to conduct or review, as
applicable. The Company shall be entitled to have representatives present at

disrupt or interfere with the operations of the Company or any Subsidiary of
the Company. The information provided shall be subject to the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement. No investigation, or information
received, pursuant to this _Section 5.7_ will modify any of the
representations and warranties of the Company.

at the Effective Time is, or at any time prior to the Effective Time was, a
director or officer of the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company (each, an "
_Indemnitee_ " and, collectively, the " _Indemnitees_ ") with respect to all
claims, liabilities, losses, damages, judgments, fines, penalties, costs
(including amounts paid in settlement or compromise) and expenses (including
fees and expenses of legal counsel) in connection with any claim, suit,
action, proceeding or investigation (whether civil, criminal, administrative
or investigative), whenever asserted, based on or arising out of, in whole or
in part, (A) the fact that an Indemnitee was a director, officer or employee
of the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company or (B) acts or omissions by an
Indemnitee in the IndemniteeÂ’s capacity as a director, officer or employee of
the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company or taken at the request of the
Company or a Subsidiary of the Company (including in connection with serving
at the request of the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company as a director,
officer, employee, agent, trustee or fiduciary of another Person (including
any employee benefit plan)), in each case under (A) or (B), at, or at any
time prior to, the Effective Time (including any claim, suit,
action, proceeding or investigation relating in whole or in part to the
Transactions), to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law and (ii)
assume all obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries to the Indemnitees
in respect of advancement of expenses, and indemnification and exculpation
from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time, as provided in (A) the Company Charter Documents and the Subsidiary
Documents as in effect on the date hereof and (B) the indemnification
agreements listed on Section 5.8(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, which
indemnification agreements shall survive the Transactions and continue in
full force and effect in accordance with their respective terms, in each
case, whether or not insurance covers such costs. 

  

(b) Without limiting the foregoing, from and after the Effective Time, Parent
shall cause the organizational documents of the Surviving Corporation to
contain provisions no less favorable to the Indemnitees with respect to
limitation of liabilities of directors and officers, indemnification and
advancement of expenses than are set forth as of the date hereof in the
Company Charter Documents, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or
otherwise modified in a manner that would adversely affect the rights
thereunder of the Indemnitees. In addition, from and after the Effective
Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, pay all
expenses (including fees and expenses of legal counsel) of each Indemnitee
under this _Section 5.8_ (including in connection with enforcing the
indemnity and other obligations referred to in this _Section 5.8_ ) as
incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law; _provided_  

  

    ##### 

  

   

that the person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to
repay such advances to the extent required by applicable Law. 

  

(c) Parent shall cause the individuals serving as officers and directors of
the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time who are then covered by
the directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’ liability insurance policy currently maintained
by the Company (a correct and complete copy of which has heretofore been
delivered to Parent) to be covered for a period of six (6) years from
the Effective Time by such policy (provided that Parent may substitute
therefor policies of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms
and conditions that are not less advantageous in any material respect than
such policy) with respect to acts or omissions occurring prior to
the Effective Time that were committed by such officers and directors in
their capacity as such;  _provided_ that in no event shall Parent be required
to expend per year of coverage more than 300% of the amount currently
expended by the Company per year of coverage as of the date of this Agreement

hereto. If Parent is unable to maintain or obtain the insurance called for by
this _Section 5.8(c)_, Parent shall obtain as much comparable insurance as
available for the Maximum Amount. The Indemnitees may be required to make
reasonable application and provide reasonable and customary representations
and warranties to applicable insurance carriers for the purpose of obtaining
such insurance. 

  

(d) The Indemnitees to whom this _Section 5.8_ applies shall be third

derivative securities related thereto) by each individual who is a director
or officer of the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under
the Exchange Act in accordance with the interpretative guidance set forth by

Governmental Authority in connection with the Transactions, (b) any notice or
other communication received by such party from any Person alleging that the
consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the
Transactions, if the subject matter of such communication or the failure of
such party to obtain such consent would have a Company Material Adverse
Effect or a Material Adverse Effect on Parent, (c) any material
actions, suits, claims, investigations or proceedings commenced or, to such
partyÂ’s Knowledge, threatened against, relating to or involving or otherwise
affecting such party or any of its Subsidiaries which relate to the
Transactions, (d) the discovery of any fact or circumstance that, or the
occurrence or non-occurrence of any event the occurrence or non-occurrence of
which, would cause any representation or warranty made by such party contained
in this Agreement (i) that is qualified as to materiality or Material Adverse
Effect to be untrue and (ii) that is not so qualified to be untrue in any
material 

  

    #####

_Section 5.10_ shall not (x) cure any breach of, or non-compliance with, any
other provision of this Agreement or (y) limit the remedies available to the
party receiving such notice;  _provided_ , _further_ , that a failure to
comply with this _Section 5.10_ will not result in the failure of any
condition set forth in _Article VI_ to be satisfied, unless the underlying
circumstance would independently cause a condition to not be satisfied. 

   

SECTION 5.11. _Employee Matters_. 

  

(a) At ParentÂ’s written request provided to the Company no later than five (5)
days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall take all actions reasonably
necessary so that each employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is
fully vested in his or her entire account balance in any of the CompanyÂ’s
pension plans identified by Parent immediately prior to the Closing and
to terminate such pension plan effective on the Closing Date. 

  

(b) Parent shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, recognize the service of
each employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with the Company or
its Subsidiaries (and their predecessors) prior to the Closing Date as
service with Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates in
connection with, and pursuant to the terms of, any tax-qualified pension
plan, 401(k) savings plan, severance plan, welfare benefit plan (including
any plan or arrangement relating to vacation, paid time off or holidays), and
any other compensation or employee benefits plan maintained by Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates in which such employee
participates, or which are made available by Parent, the Surviving Corporation
or any of their Affiliates following the Closing Date for purposes of any
waiting period, vesting, eligibility and benefit entitlement (but excluding
benefit accruals); _provided_ that with respect to any defined benefit
pension plan maintained by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
Affiliates in which such employee participates following the Closing Date,
such service credit shall be measured from the earliest date that such
employee commenced participation in a tax-qualified pension or savings plan
maintained by the Company or one of its Affiliates.

shall cause its Affiliates to, (i) waive any pre-existing condition
limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and waiting periods
under any employee welfare benefit plans maintained by Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their Affiliates in which employees of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time who remain employed
following the Closing by the Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of
their Affiliates (" _Company Employees_ ") participate from and after the
Closing Date, to the extent such pre-existing condition limitations,
exclusions, active-at-work requirements and waiting period requirements would
not apply under the corresponding Company Plans immediately prior to the
Effective Time; and (ii) credit the dollar amount incurred by each Company
Employee (and his or her eligible dependents) during such calendar year
for purposes of satisfying such yearÂ’s deductibles, co-pays and 

  

    ##### 

  

   

similar expenses under such employee welfare benefit plans maintained by
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates in which such
Company Employee participates from and after the Closing Date. 

  

(d) Without limiting the generality of _Section 8.6_, this _Section 5.11_
shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of each of the parties
to this Agreement, and nothing in this _Section 5.11_, expressed or implied,
is intended to confer upon any other person any rights or remedies of any

of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in respect of continued employment
(or resumed employment) or service or any other matter. 

  

SECTION 5.12. _Securityholder Litigation_. In the event any securityholder
litigation related to this Agreement, the Merger or the other Transactions is
brought against the Company and/or its directors, the Company shall have the
right to control the defense of such litigation;  _provided_ that no
settlement shall be agreed to without ParentÂ’s prior written consent (not to
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). The Company shall keep
Parent reasonably informed of the status of all such litigation, including
with respect to any settlement discussions relating thereto, unless, in the
reasonable judgment of the Company, doing so would result in the loss of
attorney-client privilege. 

  

SECTION 5.13. _Redemption Requests_. Following the date hereof, the Company
shall submit to each fund set forth on Section 5.13 of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, in accordance with Section 5.13 of the Company Disclosure Schedule,

expenses) incurred in connection with such suit and shall pay interest on the
amount of the payment at the prime rate as published in _The Wall Street

SECTION 8.8. _Specific Enforcement_. (a) The parties agree that irreparable
damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement

The right for specific enforcement shall include the right of the Company to
cause Parent and Merger Sub to satisfy their covenants and obligations under
this Agreement and to cause the Merger and the transactions contemplated by
the Merger to be consummated on the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement. Each of the parties hereby waives (i) any defenses
in any action for specific performance, including the defense that a remedy at
law would be adequate and (ii) any requirement under any Law to post a bond
or other security as a prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief. If, prior
to the Outside Date, any party brings any action to enforce specifically the
performance of the terms and provisions hereof by any other party, the
Outside Date shall automatically be extended by (x) the amount of time during
which such action is pending, plus twenty (20) Business Days or (y) such
other time period established by the Agreed Court presiding over such
action. 

  

(b) The Company hereby agrees that specific performance shall be its sole and
exclusive remedy with respect to breaches by Parent or Merger Sub or any
other Person or otherwise in connection with this Agreement or the
Transactions and, except as provided in _Section 8.8(c)_, that it may not
seek or accept any other form of relief that may be available for breach under
this Agreement or otherwise in connection with this Agreement or the

(c) If the Agreed Courts have declined to specifically enforce the obligations
of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the Merger pursuant to this _Section

equity, including monetary damages. If an Agreed Court has granted an award
of damages for such alleged breach against Parent or Merger Sub, the Company

accordance with this Agreement, and Parent is not willing to consummate the
Merger within such five (5) day period in accordance with the terms

action or proceeding still pending to be dismissed with prejudice at such
time as Parent and Merger Sub consummate the Merger, except for claims
against the Surviving Corporation as set forth and contemplated by
_Section 5.8_. Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that in the event
of any breach, or wrongful repudiation or termination, of this Agreement by
Parent or Merger Sub, the damages incurred by the Company for purposes of
determining any remedy at law or equity under this Agreement shall not
be limited to reimbursement of expenses or out of pocket costs and would
include any damages incurred by the CompanyÂ’s shareholders in the event such
shareholders would not receive the benefit of the bargain negotiated by the
Company on their behalf as set forth in this Agreement (taking
into consideration relevant matters, including other combination
opportunities and the time value of money).
