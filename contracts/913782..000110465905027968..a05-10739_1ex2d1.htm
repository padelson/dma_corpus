all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the
Company Common Shares, Company Series C-1 Preferred Shares, Company Series D
Preferred Shares, Company Series Z Preferred Shares, Company Share Options or
Existing Units in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by
the Surviving Entity, the Surviving Partnership or the Paying Agent, as

consummation of any such offers shall in no way delay or otherwise affect the
Closing and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.
MergerCo and Parent shall conduct such offers in accordance with the
requirements of Regulation 14D and Regulation 14E under the Exchange Act, to

the MergerCo Series Z Preferred Shares issued in the Merger in exchange

  



  

11   

     
   

  



  

for Company Series Z Preferred Shares. In the event that the Surviving Entity
calls for redemption all of the MergerCo Series Z Preferred Shares,
then, notwithstanding the provisions of Section 2.3, Parent shall not be
required to deposit the Company Series Z Preferred Share Merger Consideration
with the Paying Agent and instead, upon surrender in accordance with the
notice of redemption delivered by the Surviving Entity of the Certificate or
Certificates formerly representing Company Series Z Preferred Shares that
were converted into MergerCo Series Z Preferred Shares in the Merger
(properly endorsed or assigned for transfer), the former holders of Company
Series Z Preferred Shares that were converted into MergerCo Series Z
Preferred Shares in the Merger shall be entitled to receive on the redemption
date specified such notice of the redemption price for their MergerCo Series
Z Preferred Shares as determined in accordance with the provisions of the

Returns for the Company and those Subsidiaries set forth in Section 3.10(a)

taxable year ending December 31, 1994 through December 31, 2004 has been
subject to taxation as a real estate investment trust (a " _REIT_ ") within
the meaning of Section 856 of the Code and has satisfied all requirements to
qualify as a REIT for such years, (ii) has operated since December 31, 2004

for the taxable year of the Company that will end with the Merger (and if the
Merger is not consummated prior to January 1, 2006, for the taxable year that
will end on December 31, 2005). No challenge to the Companys status as a
REIT is pending or has been threatened in writing. No Company Subsidiary is a
corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, other than a corporation
that qualifies as a "qualified REIT subsidiary," within the meaning of
Section 856(i)(2) of the Code, or as a "taxable REIT subsidiary," within the
meaning of Section 856(l) of the Code;

  



  

(c) Each Company Subsidiary that is a partnership, joint venture, or limited

was timely reported on the Tax Returns of the Company;

"taxable REIT subsidiary" or any subsidiary of a "taxable REIT subsidiary")
has engaged at any time in any "prohibited transactions" within the meaning
of Section 857(b)(6) of the Code.  To the knowledge of the Company, neither
the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has engaged in any transaction that
would give rise to "redetermined rents, redetermined deductions and excess
interest" described in section 857(b)(7) of the Code. To the knowledge of
the Company, no event has occurred, and no condition or circumstance

  



  

20

preceding sentences will be imposed upon the Company;

(h) The Company and the Company Subsidiaries have complied in all material
respects with all applicable laws, rules and regulations relating to the
payment and withholding of Taxes (including withholding of material Taxes
pursuant to Sections 1441, 1442, 1445, 1446, 3121 and 3402 of the Code or
similar provisions under any foreign laws) and have duly and timely withheld
and have paid over to the appropriate taxing authorities all material amounts
required to be so withheld and paid over on or prior to the due date thereof
under all applicable Laws;

the Company or any such Company Subsidiary is or may be subject to taxation
by that jurisdiction;

  



  

(j) Neither the Company nor any other Person on behalf of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary has requested any extension of time within which to file

Company Subsidiary has paid or is obligated to pay all or part of

Except as set forth in the disclosure schedules delivered at or prior to the
execution hereof to the Company (the " _Parent Disclosure Schedule_ "), which
schedule shall identify any exceptions to the representations, warranties and
covenants contained in this Agreement and any item disclosed on any schedule
therein shall be deemed to be fully disclosed with respect to all schedules
under which such item may be relevant as and to the extent it is reasonably
clear on

  



  

31   

     
   

  



  

the face of such Parent Disclosure Schedule that such item applies to such
other schedule, each of the Parent, MergerCo and the Merger
Partnership, jointly and severally, represents and warrants to the Company
and the Partnership as follows:

  



  

4.1 _Existence; Good Standing; Authority; Compliance with Law_.

  



  

### (a) Parent is a limited partnership duly organized, validly existing and
in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware. Except as set forth
in Section 4.1(a) of Parent Disclosure Schedule, Parent is duly qualified or
licensed to do business as a foreign corporation and is in good standing
under the laws of any other jurisdiction in which the character of the
properties owned, leased or operated by it therein or in which the
transaction of its business makes such qualification or licensing necessary,
except where the failure to be so qualified or licensed would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect. Parent has all requisite corporate power
and authority to own, operate, lease and encumber its properties and carry on
its business as now conducted.

  

### 

  

### (b) Each of the Parents Subsidiaries is listed in Section 4.1(b) of the
Parent Disclosure Schedule (the " _Parent Subsidiaries_ "), and each such
entity is a corporation, partnership or limited liability company duly
incorporated or organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation or organization, has the requisite
corporate power or other power and authority to own its properties and to
carry on its business as it is now being conducted, and is duly qualified or
licensed to do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which
the ownership of its property or the conduct of its business requires such
qualification or licensure, except for jurisdictions in which such failure to
be so qualified or to be in good standing would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.
Parent has no other Subsidiaries other than Parent Subsidiaries.

  

### 

  

### (c) Except as set forth in Section 4.1(c) of the Parent Disclosure
Schedule, neither Parent nor any of Parent Subsidiaries is in violation of
any order of any court, governmental authority or arbitration board or
tribunal, or any law, ordinance, governmental rule or regulation to which
Parent or any Parent Subsidiary or any of their respective properties or
assets is subject, except where such violation, alone or together with all
other violations, would not reasonably be likely to have a Parent Material
Adverse Effect. Parent and Parent Subsidiaries have obtained all licenses,
permits and other authorizations and have taken all actions required by
applicable law or governmental regulations in connection with
their businesses as now conducted, except where the failure to obtain any
such license, permit or authorization or to take any such action, alone or
together with all other such failures, would not reasonably be likely to have
a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

  

### 

  

### (d) Parent has previously provided or made available to the Company true
and complete copies of the certificate of incorporation and bylaws and the
other charter documents, bylaws, organizational documents and partnership,
limited liability company and joint venture agreements (and in each such
case, all amendments thereto) of Parent as in effect on the date of this
Agreement.

authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby and perform its obligations
hereunder and thereunder.  The execution, delivery and performance by each of
Parent, MergerCo and Merger Partnership of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly
authorized by all necessary organizational action on behalf of each of
Parent, MergerCo and Merger Partnership. No other organizational proceedings
on the part of Parent, MergerCo, Merger Partnership, or any of their
respective subsidiaries, are necessary to authorize this Agreement or to
consummate the Merger, the Partnership Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby. This Agreement, assuming the due authorization,
execution and delivery hereof by each of the Company and the
Partnership, constitutes a valid and legally binding obligation of each of
Parent, MergerCo and Merger Partnership, enforceable against each of Parent,
MergerCo and Merger Partnership in accordance with its terms, subject to
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium or other similar laws relating
to creditors rights and general principles of equity. The respective Board
of Directors or general partners of Parent, MergerCo and Merger Partnership
each have, by unanimous vote, if applicable, duly and validly authorized the
execution and delivery of this Agreement and approved the consummation of the
Merger, the Partnership Merger and the transactions contemplated thereby, and
taken all corporate action required to be taken by each of them to consummate
the Merger, the Partnership Merger and the transactions contemplated thereby.

license, contract, agreement or other instrument or obligation to which
Parent, MergerCo or Merger Partnership is a party or by which it or any of
its properties or assets may be bound, or (iv) violate any order, writ,
injunction, decree, statute, rule or regulation applicable to Parent,
MergerCo, Merger Partnership or any of its properties or assets, excluding
from the foregoing clauses (ii), (iii) and (iv) such filings, notices,
permits, authorizations, consents, approvals, violations, breaches or
defaults which would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
likely to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

firm which may result in the obligation of such entity or the Company to pay
any finders fees, brokerage or agents commissions or other like payments in

that was unsolicited or that did not otherwise result from a breach of this
Section 6.5(a), the Company may furnish, or cause to be furnished, non-public
information with respect to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to the
Person who made such Acquisition Proposal (a " _Third Party_ ") and may
participate in discussions and negotiations regarding such Acquisition
Proposal if (A) the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with outside legal counsel, that failure to do so would be
inconsistent with its duties to the Company or its shareholders under
applicable law, (B) prior to taking such action, the Company enters into a
confidentiality agreement with respect to such Acquisition Proposal that
contains provisions that are no less restrictive on the Person making such
Acquisition Proposal than the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement
dated as of May 17, 2005 between the Company and ING Clarion Partners, LLC
(the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), and (C) the Company Board determines
in good faith, after consultation with its outside financial advisor, that
such Acquisition Proposal is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior
Proposal. The Company shall provide prompt (but in no event less than twenty-
four hours following the Companys initial receipt of any Acquisition
Proposal) oral and written notice to Parent of (a) the receipt of any such
Acquisition Proposal, and any modification or amendment to any such
Acquisition Proposal, by the Company, any Company Subsidiary or any Company
Representative, (b) the material terms and conditions of such Acquisition
Proposal (c) the identity of such person or entity making any such
Acquisition Proposal and (d) the Companys intention to furnish information
to, or enter into discussions or negotiations with, such person or entity.
The Company shall continue to keep Parent informed of the status and details
of any such Acquisition Proposal or inquiry (including any material changes
to the status or material terms thereof).

  



  

### (b) The Company Board may not (i) withdraw, qualify or modify, in a
manner adverse to Parent or MergerCo, the approval or recommendation of the
Company Board, or if applicable, the approval or recommendation of any
committee of the Company Board, of the Merger, (ii) approve or recommend, or
propose publicly to approve or recommend, an Acquisition Proposal (any action
described in clauses (i) or (ii) being referred to as an " _Adverse
Recommendation Change_ ") or (iii) authorize or permit the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries to enter into any agreement (each, an " _Acquisition
Agreemen_ _t_ ") contemplating an Acquisition Proposal. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, at any time prior to receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval,
the Company Board may take one of the actions described in clauses (i) or
(ii) of the previous sentence in response to a Superior Proposal if the
Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal
counsel, that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its
duties to the Company or its shareholders under applicable law (a "
_Subsequent Determination_ ") but only at a time that is after the third
(3rd) Business Day following Parents receipt of written notice from the
Company that the Company Board is prepared to approve or recommend such
Superior Proposal, or the applicable amendment to a Superior Proposal, and
subject to the Companys compliance with this subsection (b). Any such
written notice shall specify the material terms and conditions of such
Superior

### Proposal, identify the person making such Superior Proposal and state
that the Board otherwise intends to make a Subsequent Determination (subject
to compliance with this subsection (b)) During such three (3) Business Day
period, the Company shall permit the Parent to propose to the Companys Board
adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement with a view to
enabling the Company to proceed with its recommendation to its shareholders
without a Subsequent Determination.

  

### 

  

(c) Upon execution of this Agreement, the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries shall cease immediately and cause to be terminated any and all
existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any parties conducted
heretofore with respect to an Acquisition Proposal by or on behalf of the
Company or any of the Company Representatives and shall inform each of the
Company Representatives of its obligations under this Section 6.5 and
instruct each of them to act in a manner consistent with such obligations.
The Company shall promptly request each Person with whom is has executed a
confidentiality agreement within the twenty-four months prior to the date
hereof in connection with its consideration of any Acquisition Proposal to
return or destroy all confidential or other non-public information heretofore
furnished to such Person by or on behalf of the Company or any of the Company
Representatives.

  



  

### (d) Subject to Section 6.5(b), the Company may at any time take and
disclose to its holders of Company Common Shares a position contemplated by
Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or making any
disclosure required by Rule 14a-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act or Item
1012(a) of Regulation M-A.

6.6 _Officers  and Directors Indemnification_.

  



  

### (a) In the event of any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, demand,
proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal or administrative,
including, without limitation, any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation in which any person who is now, or has been at any time prior
to the date hereof, or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a trustee,
director or officer of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries (each,
an " _Indemnified Party_ " and collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ")
is, or is threatened to be, made a party based in whole or in part on, or
arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to (i) the fact that he or
she is or was a trustee, director, officer, employee, or agent of the Company
or any of the Company Subsidiaries, or is or was serving at the request of
the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries as a trustee, director,
officer, employee, or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint
venture, trust or other enterprise, or (ii) the negotiation, execution or
performance of this Agreement, any agreement or document contemplated hereby
or delivered in connection herewith, or any of the transactions contemplated
hereby, or thereby whether in any case asserted or arising at or before or
after the Effective Time, the parties hereto agree to cooperate and use their
reasonable best efforts to defend against and respond thereto. It is
understood and agreed that the Company shall indemnify and hold harmless, and
after the Effective Time, the Surviving Entity (together with the Company,
the " _Indemnitors_ "), shall indemnify and hold harmless, as and to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each Indemnified Party against
any losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs, expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees and expenses), judgments, fines and

  



  

42   

     
   

  



  

### amounts paid in settlement in connection with any such threatened or
actual claim, action, suit, demand, proceeding or
investigation (collectively, " _Indemnifiable Amounts_ "), and in the event
of any such threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation (whether asserted or arising before or after the Effective
Time), (A) the Indemnitors, shall promptly (but in any event within 10
calendar days of written request) pay expenses in advance of the final
disposition of any such threatened or actual claim, action, suit, demand,
proceeding or investigation to each Indemnified Party to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law; (B) the Indemnitors shall have the right to
defend each Indemnified Party in any proceeding which may give rise to the
payment of Indemnifiable Amounts hereunder; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Indemnitors shall notify such Indemnified Party of any such decision to
defend within ten (10) calendar days of receipt of notice of any such
proceeding, and, _provided further_ , that the Indemnitors shall not, without
the prior written consent of such Indemnified Party, consent to the entry of
any judgment against such Indemnified Party or enter into any settlement or
compromise which (I) includes an admission of fault of such Indemnified Party
or (II) does not include, as an unconditional term thereof, the full release
of such Indemnified Party from all liability in respect of such proceeding,
which release shall be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to such
Indemnified Party and (C) notwithstanding clause (B) above, if in a
proceeding to which an Indemnified Party is a party by reason of the
Indemnified Partys service as a trustee, director, officer, employee, or
agent of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, (I) such Indemnified
Party reasonably concludes that he or she may have separate defenses or
counterclaims to assert with respect to any issue which may not be consistent
with the position of other defendants in such proceeding, (II) a conflict of
interest or potential conflict of interest exists between such Indemnified
Party and the Indemnitors, or (III) if the Indemnitors fail to assume the
defense of such proceeding in a timely manner, such Indemnified Party shall
be entitled to be represented by separate legal counsel of such Indemnified
Partys choice at the expense of the Indemnitors; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,
that none of the Indemnitors shall be liable for any settlement effected
without its prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed); and _provided_ _further_  that the
Indemnitors shall have no obligation hereunder to any Indemnified Party when
and if a court of competent jurisdiction shall ultimately determine, and such
determination shall have become final and non-appealable,
that indemnification by such entities of such Indemnified Party in the
manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by applicable law. Any Indemnified
Party wishing to claim indemnification under this Section 6.6, upon learning
of any such threatened or actual claim, action, suit, demand, proceeding or
investigation, shall promptly notify the Company and, after the Effective
Time, the Surviving Entity thereof; _provided_ that the failure to so notify
shall not affect the obligations of the Company and the Surviving Entity
except to the extent, if any, such failure to promptly notify materially and
adversely prejudices such party.

  

### 

  

### (b) Parent and MergerCo each agree that all rights to indemnification or
exculpation existing in favor of, and all limitations on the personal
liability of, each present and former director and officer of the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries provided for in the respective charters or bylaws
(or other applicable organizational documents) or otherwise in effect as of
the date hereof shall survive the Merger and

  



  

43   

     
   

  



  

### continue in full force and effect for a period of six (6) years from the
Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that all rights to indemnification
in respect of any claims (each a " _Claim_ ") asserted or made within such
period shall continue until the final disposition of such Claim. From and
after the Effective Time, the Surviving Entity shall indemnify and hold
harmless the present and former officers and directors of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries in respect of acts or omissions occurring prior to the
Effective Time to the extent provided in any written indemnification
agreements between the Company and/or one or more Company Subsidiaries and
such officers and directors as listed in Section 6.6(b) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule (a form of which is publicly available through EDGAR

### (c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall purchase a non-
cancelable extended reporting period endorsement under the Companys existing
directors and officers liability insurance coverage for the Companys
directors and officers in the same form as presently maintained by the
Company, which shall provide such directors and officers with coverage for
six (6) years following the Effective Time of not less than the existing
coverage under, and have other terms not less favorable to, the insured
persons than the directors and officers liability insurance
coverage presently maintained by the Company; _provided_ , _however_ , that
in no event shall the Company be required to expend pursuant to this Section
6.6(c) more than an amount per year of coverage equal to one hundred and
fifty percent (150%) of current annual premiums paid by the Company for such
insurance. In the event that, but for the proviso to the immediately
preceding sentence, the Company would be required to expend more than one
hundred and fifty percent (150%) of current annual premiums, the Company
shall obtain the maximum amount of such insurance obtainable by payment of
annual premiums equal to one hundred and fifty percent (150%) of
current annual premiums. Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Entity
to, maintain such policies in full force and effect, and continue to honor
all obligations thereunder.

  

### 

  

### (d) The obligations under this Section 6.6 shall not be terminated or
modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any indemnitee to whom this
Section 6.6 applies without the consent of such affected indemnitee (it being

be third party beneficiaries of this Section 6.6 and shall be entitled to
enforce the covenants contained herein).

respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in

case may be, assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.6.

  

### 

  

### (f) The Company shall give Parent the opportunity to participate in the
defense or settlement of any shareholder or partner litigation against the
Company, its directors or officers, the General Partner or the Partnership
relating to the Asset Sale, the Mergers or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ ,

  



  

44   

     
   

  



  

### that no such settlement shall be agreed to without Parents consent if
such settlement, either individually or together with all other settlements
of such shareholder or partner litigation would require aggregate payments by
the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries in excess of $1,500,000 or
impose any material obligation or restriction on the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries after the Effective Time.

  

### 

  

6.7 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_. From the date hereof until the
Effective Time, the Company shall, and shall cause each of the Company
Subsidiaries and each of the Companys and Company Subsidiaries directors,

Company Subsidiaries and (b) the officers and employees of the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall obtain

accessed prior to any such visits or access. The Company shall furnish Parent
such financial, operating and other data and information as Parent may
reasonably request. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and MergerCo shall
hold in confidence all such information on the terms and subject to the
conditions contained in the Confidentiality Agreement.

  



  

6.8 _Public Announcements_. The Company and Parent shall consult with each
other before issuing any press release or otherwise making any
public statements with respect to this Agreement or the Mergers and shall not
issue any such press release or make any such public statement without the
prior consent of the other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed; _provided_ , _however_ , that a party
may, without the prior consent of the other party, issue such press release
or make such public statement as may be required by law or the applicable
rules of any stock exchange or quotation system if the party issuing such
press release or making such public statement has used its reasonable best
efforts to consult with the other party and to obtain such partys consent
but has been unable to do so in a timely manner. In this regard, the parties
shall make a joint public announcement of the Mergers contemplated hereby no

Partnership shall prepare and file with the SEC an information statement on
the appropriate form (the " _Partnership Information Statement_ ") and the
Partnership shall use its reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as
practicable to any comments of the SEC with respect thereto. Parent, MergerCo

Partnership agree to use their reasonable best efforts to take all actions
necessary and advisable to effect the foregoing.

  

### 

  

6.11 _Certain Tax Matters_. Neither Parent, the Surviving Entity nor their
respective Affiliates shall take any action following the Merger that is
inconsistent with the Companys qualification as a REIT prior to the
Effective Time, and Parent, Surviving Entity and their respective Affiliates
will take all necessary and desirable actions to preserve the Companys
status as a REIT for periods prior to the Effective Time. Nothing in this
Section 6.11 shall be construed to limit the ability of the Parent or its
Affiliates from causing the Company to seek a "closing agreement," within the
meaning of Section 7121 of the Code, with the IRS if it is reasonably
determined that the Company or a Company Subsidiary engaged in any action or
failed to take any action that jeopardized the Companys status as a REIT
prior to the Effective Time.

  



  

6.12 _Asset Sale_. After the date hereof but prior to the Effective Time,
Parent intends to cause a limited partnership or other entity to be formed ("
_Acquisition Partnership_ "), which will be an Affiliate of the Parent and
will enter into a Real Estate Purchase Agreement reasonably acceptable to the
Company and the Partnership (the " _Real Estate Purchase Agreement_ ") with
the Partnership and certain of its subsidiaries. Pursuant to the Real Estate
Purchase Agreement, Acquisition Partnership would purchase, and the
Partnership and certain subsidiaries would sell, certain real estate assets
and equity interests specified by Acquisition Partnership therein (the "
_Asset Sale_ ") on the terms and subject to the conditions specified by
Acquisition Partnership therein. The closing of the Asset Sale would occur
immediately prior to the Effective Time. Each of the Company and the
Partnership agree to take, or cause to be taken, all reasonable

  



  

47   

     
   

  



  

actions and to do, or cause to be done, all reasonable things as may
be necessary to consummate and make the Asset Sale effective immediately
prior to the Effective Time, including, without limitation, execution and
delivery of an acceptable Real Estate Purchase Agreement and execution and
delivery of appropriate amendments to this Agreement to give effect to such
Asset Sale; _provided_  that, in no event, shall the Company or the
Partnership be obligated to incur liability, pay costs or other monies or
take any irrevocable action prior to the Effective Time. Any indebtedness of
the Acquisition Partnership to the Partnership in connection with such Asset
Sale shall be on arms length terms. Parent shall ensure that any
consideration received by the Partnership in connection with the Asset Sale
consists of either cash or "real estate assets" within the meaning of Section
856(c) of the Code and does not jeopardize the Companys status as a REIT.

Date: (i) a declaration of a banking moratorium or any suspension of payments

Agreement shall be true and correct in all material respects both as of the
date of this Agreement and as of Closing as though made on the Closing Date
(except to the extent such representations and warranties expressly relate to
an earlier date, in which case such representations and warranties shall be
true and correct in all material respects on and as of such earlier date) and
(ii) the representations and warranties of Parent, MergerCo and Merger
Partnership in this Agreement (other than the representations and warranties

true and correct on and as of such earlier date), except where the failure of
the representations and warranties to be so true and correct (without giving
effect to any limitation as to "materiality" or "Parent Material Adverse
Effect" set forth therein) does not have, and would not reasonably be likely
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.
The Company shall have received a certificate signed on behalf of Parent,
MergerCo and Merger Partnership by the Chief Executive Officer of Parent,
dated the Closing Date, to the foregoing effect.

  

###

### (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Parent
and MergerCo hereto expressly acknowledge and agree that, with respect to any
termination of this Agreement in circumstances where the Break-up Fee is
payable in accordance with Section 8.2(b), the payment of the Break-up Fee
shall constitute liquidated damages with respect to any claim for damages or
any other claim which Parent or MergerCo would otherwise be entitled to
assert against the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or any of their
respective assets, or against any of their respective directors, officers,
employees, partners, managers, members, shareholders or stockholders, with
respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and shall
constitute the sole and exclusive remedy available to Parent and MergerCo.
 The parties hereto expressly acknowledge and agree that, in light of
the difficulty of accurately determining actual damages with respect to the
foregoing upon any termination of this Agreement in circumstances where the
Break-up Fee is payable in accordance with Section 8.2(b), the rights to
payment under Section 8.2(b): (i) constitute a reasonable estimate of the
damages that will be suffered by reason of any such proposed or actual
termination of this Agreement and (ii) shall be in full and complete
satisfaction of any and all damages arising as a result of the foregoing.
Except for nonpayment of the amounts set forth in Section 8.2(b) and for any
non-payment of the Parent Break-Up Expenses payable under Section 6.4(c),
Parent and MergerCo hereby agree that, upon any termination of this Agreement
in circumstances where the Break-up Fee is payable in accordance with Section
8.2(b), in no event shall Parent or MergerCo (i) seek to obtain any recovery
or judgment against the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or any of
their respective assets, or against any of their respective directors,
officers, employees, partners, managers, members or stockholders or (ii) be
entitled to seek or obtain any other damages of any kind, including, without
limitation, consequential, indirect or punitive damages.

  

### 

  

### (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
if the Company fails to pay to Parent any amounts due under this Section 8.2,
the Company shall pay the costs and expenses (including reasonable legal fees
and expenses) in connection with any action, including the filing of any
lawsuit or other legal action taken to collect payment.

  

### 

  

### (e) The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in Section
8.2(b) are an integral part of the transaction contemplated by this
Agreement, and that, without these agreements, Parent would not enter into
this Agreement.

  



  

53   

     
   

  



  

8.3 _Escrow of Company Break-Up Expenses_.

  



  

### (a) In the event that Parent is obligated to pay the Company Break-Up
Expenses set forth in Section 6.5(b), Parent shall pay to the Company from
the Company Break-Up Expenses deposited into escrow in accordance with the
next sentence, an amount equal to the lesser of (i) the Company Break-Up
Expenses and (ii) the sum of (1) the maximum amount that can be paid to the
Company without causing the Company to fail to meet the requirements of
Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code determined as if the payment of such
amount did not constitute income described in Sections 856(c)(2)(A)(H) or
856(c)(3)(A)(I) of the Code (" _Qualifying Income_ "), as determined by the
Companys independent certified public accountants, plus (2) in the event the
Company receives either (A) a letter from the Companys counsel indicating
that the Company has received a ruling from the IRS described in Section
8.3(c) or (B) an opinion from the Companys outside counsel as described in
Section 8.3(c), an amount equal to the Company Break-Up Expenses less the
amount payable under clause (1) above. To secure Parents obligation to pay
these amounts, Parent shall deposit into escrow an amount in cash equal to
the Company Break-Up Expenses with an escrow agent selected by Parent and on
such terms (subject to Section 8.3(c)) as shall be mutually agreed upon by
the Company, Parent and the escrow agent.  The payment or deposit into
escrow of the Company Break-Up Expenses pursuant to this Section 8.3(b) shall
be made at the time Parent is obligated to pay the Company such amount
pursuant to Section 8.3(b) by wire transfer or bank check.

  

### 

  

### (b) The escrow agreement shall provide that the Company Break-Up Expenses
in escrow or any portion thereof shall not be released to the Company unless
the escrow agent receives any one or combination of the following: (i)
a letter from the Companys independent certified public accountants
indicating the maximum amount that can be paid by the escrow agent to the
Company without causing the Company to fail to meet the requirements of
Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code determined as if the payment of such
amount did not constitute Qualifying Income or a subsequent letter from the
Companys accountants revising that amount, in which case the escrow agent
shall release such amount to the Company, or (ii) a letter from the Companys
counsel indicating that the Company received a ruling from the IRS holding
that the receipt by the Company of the Company Break-Up Expenses would either
constitute Qualifying Income or would be excluded from gross income within
the meaning of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code (or alternatively, the
Companys outside counsel has rendered a legal opinion to the effect that the
receipt by the Company of the Company Break-Up Expenses would constitute
Qualifying Income, would be excluded from gross income within the meaning of
Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code or would not otherwise disqualify
Company as a REIT), in which case the escrow agent shall release the
remainder of the Company Break-Up Expenses to the Company. Parent agrees to
amend this Section 8.3 at the request of the Company in order to (x) maximize
the portion of the Company Break-Up Expenses that may be distributed to the
Company hereunder without causing the Company to fail to meet the
requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code, (y) improve the
Companys chances of securing a favorable ruling described in this Section
8.3(b) or (z) assist Parent in obtaining a favorable legal opinion from its
outside counsel as described in this Section 8.3(b). The

  



  

54   

     
   

  



  

### escrow agreement shall also provide that any portion of the Company
Break-Up Expenses held in escrow for five years shall be released by the
escrow agent to Parent.

  

### 

  

8.4 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto by an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto at any
time before or after any approval hereof by the shareholders of the Company;
_provided_ , _however_ , that after any such shareholder approval, no
amendment shall be made which by law requires further approval by such
shareholders without obtaining such approval.

  



  

8.5 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties
hereto may, to the extent legally allowed, (a) extend the time for
the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other
parties hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and
warranties of the other parties contained herein or in any document delivered
pursuant hereto and (c) waive compliance by the other parties with any of the
agreements or conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a
party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth
in a written instrument signed on behalf of the party against which such
waiver or extension is to be enforced. The failure of a party to assert any of
its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of
those rights.

Merger or the Asset Sale (as defined in the Merger Agreement), and (b) any
Capital Transaction, to the extent that such distribution decreases
the Redemption Capital Account of such Unit to an amount that is less than
the Redemption Amount with respect to such Unit immediately prior to
such distribution; _provided_ that any prorated monthly distribution payable
at the Effective Time pursuant to the Merger Agreement shall not

  



  

9

Depreciation (the "Initial Carrying Value").  Furthermore, solely for
purposes of calculating the gain from any Capital Transaction, the
Partnership shall be deemed to recognize gain in connection with (x) any
refinancing of a Partnership property, and such gain shall be equal to the
excess, if any, of (i) the principal amount of the indebtedness incurred in
such refinancing over (ii) the Initial Carrying Value of any
Partnership property secured by such refinanced indebtedness, and (y) any
Capital Contribution, and such gain shall be equal to the excess, if any, of

any adjustment pursuant to Section 1.D of Exhibit B hereof in connection with
such Capital Contribution (or if no such adjustment is made thereunder,
then solely for purposes of maintaining Redemption Capital Accounts an
adjustment shall be made in the same manner as under Section 1.D of Exhibit B
at such time) over (ii) the aggregate Initial Carrying Value of all
Partnership property immediately prior to such Capital Contribution. Any such
gain shall increase the Initial Carrying Value of the applicable Partnership
property for the purpose of determining any gain from any subsequent Capital
Transaction. The definitions of "Capital Transaction," "Initial Carrying
Value," "Redemption Amount" and "Redemption Capital Account are intended to
operate together to produce a reduction in the Redemption Amount with respect
to any Class A Common Unit by the amount, if any, of any distribution or
portion thereof that constitutes a return of the initial $43.50 of capital
deemed contributed with respect to such Unit as of the Effective Time
pursuant to Section 4.1A and not to produce a reduction in the
Redemption Amount with respect to any Class A Common Unit by the amount, if
any, of any distribution or portion thereof that constitutes part of such
Units allocable share of the income and gain of the Partnership. The
definitions of such terms are to be interpreted and applied in a manner

property as set forth in _Exhibit D_ or if no value is set forth in _Exhibit

as it deems reasonable and appropriate to allocate the aggregate of the
704(c) Values of Contributed Properties in a single or integrated transaction
among the separate properties on a basis proportional to their respective

 CAPITAL CONTRIBUTIONS

  

# 

  

Section 4.1. _Capital Contributions of the Partners_

  



  

### A. As of the Effective Time, the Partners shall be deemed to have made
Capital Contributions in the amounts reflected on _Exhibit A_ to
this Agreement. In connection with the Partnership Merger, the Limited
Partners (other than Gables Trust and any of it Subsidiaries) were offered
the opportunity to elect to exchange for cash any Partnership Interest then
held or to exchange all or a portion of such Partnership Interest for
Partnership Interests designated herein as " _Class A Common Units_ ," with
the rights, privileges, powers, duties and other terms set forth in this
Agreement. At the Effective Time, upon the effectiveness of the Partnership
Merger, this Agreement became effective and replaced the Prior Agreement in
its entirety. In connection with the amendments effected by this Agreement,
among other things, the Partnership amended the terms of the Common Units as
reflected herein. As of the Effective Time (after taking into account the
merger of Gables Trust, the Partnership Merger and any Capital Contributions
or redemptions relating thereto as well as the amendments to the terms of the
Common Units), the (i) number and class of Partnership Units held by each
Partner, (ii) Capital Account balance of each Partner(1) and (iii) Percentage
Interest of each Partner are as set forth on _Exhibit A_ , which may be
adjusted on _Exhibit A_ from time to time by the General Partner to the
extent necessary to reflect accurately redemptions, additional
Capital Contributions, the issuance of additional Partnership Units (pursuant
to any merger or otherwise), or similar events having an effect on any
Partners Percentage Interest. To the extent the Partnership acquires any
property by the merger of any other Person into the Partnership, Persons who
receive Partnership Interests in exchange for their interests in the Person
merging into the Partnership shall become Partners and shall be deemed to
have made Capital Contributions as provided in the applicable merger
agreement and as set forth in _Exhibit A_ as amended to reflect such deemed
Capital Contributions. The number of Partnership Units held by the General
Partner (equal to one percent (1%) of all outstanding Partnership Units from
time to time) shall be deemed to be the General Partner Interest. Except as
provided in Sections 4.2 and 10.4 or in any DRO, the Partners shall have no
obligation to make any additional Capital Contributions or loans to the
Partnership.

  

### 

  

### B. The Partners listed on _Exhibit A_  attached hereto have heretofore
been admitted as Partners, and upon the execution of this Agreement or a
counterpart of this Agreement, the Partners listed on _Exhibit A_ attached
hereto shall continue as Partners. The Common Units issued pursuant to
this Agreement and the Partnership Merger Agreement are duly authorized and
validly issued limited partner interests in the Partnership.

  

### 

  

Section 4.2. _Issuances of Additional Partnership Interests_

  



  

### A. The General Partner is hereby authorized to cause the Partnership from
time to time to issue to the Partners (including the General Partner) or
other Persons additional Partnership Units or other Partnership Interests in
one or more classes, or one or more series of any of such classes, with such
designations, preferences and relative, participating, optional or

Effective Time.

### 

  

### other special rights, powers and duties, including rights, powers
and duties senior to Limited Partner Interests, all as shall be determined by
the General Partner in its sole and absolute discretion subject to Delaware
law, including, without limitation, (i) the allocations of items of
Partnership income, gain, loss, deduction and credit to each such class or
series of Partnership Interests; (ii) the right of each such class or series
of Partnership Interests to share in Partnership distributions; and (iii)
the rights of each such class or series of Partnership Interests upon
dissolution and liquidation of the Partnership; _provided_ _that_ any
issuance of Partnership Interests to Gables Trust, the General Partner or any
Affiliates of the General Partner, other than in connection with a
distribution to all Partners in proportion to their respective Percentage
Interests, may be made only in exchange for consideration that the Board of
Directors, in good faith, determines is approximately equal to the fair value
of the Partnership Units or other Partnership Interests being issued. In
making such determination the General Partner shall be entitled, in its
discretion, but is not required, to rely on a third party valuation from a
reputable valuation firm. Solely for purposes of this Section 4.2, the fair
value of any Partnership Interest issued to Gables Trust, the General Partner
or any Affiliate of the General Partner during the 12-month period commencing
with the Effective Time may, in the discretion of the General Partner, be
deemed to be an amount equal to the product of (i) the Redemption Amount as
of the date of issuance multiplied by (ii) the number of Partnership Units
constituting such Partnership Interest. **** In the event that the number of
Class B Common Units outstanding at any time after the date hereof is
increased by a distribution payable in Class B Common Units or by a
subdivision or split-up of Class B Common Units, then, on the date such
distribution is made or such change is effective, the number of outstanding
Class A Common Units shall be appropriately adjusted so that the number of
outstanding Class A Common Units, after giving effect to such adjustments,
remains in the same proportion to outstanding Class B Common Units as
immediately preceding such distribution, subdivision or split-up.
Without limitation of the foregoing, the General Partner is authorized to
cause the Partnership to admit one or more additional General Partners and to
issue to such General Partner Partnership Interests in connection with any
such admissions.

  

###

federal income tax reporting by the Partnership (the "Election Partner") is
hereby authorized and directed to cause the Partnership to make an election

or in accordance with the finally promulgated successor rules to Proposed
Treasury Regulations Section 1.83-3(l) and IRS Notice 2005-43 (collectively,
the "Proposed Rules"). The Election Partner shall cause the Partnership to
make any allocations of items of income, gain, deduction, loss or credit
(including forfeiture allocations and elections as to allocation periods)
necessary or appropriate to effectuate and maintain the Safe Harbor Election,
_provided_ , that such allocations are not reasonably likely to have a
material **** adverse economic effect on the Class A Common LPs as compared
to the allocations that would apply under current law consistent with Rev.
Proc. 93-27 (93-2 C.B. 343) and the existing allocation provisions of this
Agreement, as such allocations may be changed in accordance with Section
8.10.

Interests thereafter made

Harbor Election once made may be revoked by the Election Partner as permitted
by the Proposed Rules or any applicable rule.

  

### 

  

### (3) Each Partner (including any person to whom a Compensatory Interest is
transferred in connection with performance of services), by signing this
Agreement or by accepting such transfer, hereby agrees to comply with all
requirements of the Safe Harbor Election with respect to all Compensatory
Interests transferred while the Safe Harbor Election remains effective;
_provided_ that the General Partner has furnished each Class A Common LP with
reasonable notification and any information necessary to comply with such
requirements.

  

### 

  

### (4) The Election Partner shall file or cause the Partnership to file all
returns, reports and other documentation as may be required to perfect and
maintain the Safe Harbor Election with respect to transfers of Compensatory
Interests covered by such Election.

  

### 

  

### (5) The General Partner is hereby authorized and empowered, without
further vote or action of the Partners, to amend the Agreement as necessary
to comply with the Proposed Rules or any rule, in order to provide for a Safe
Harbor Election and the ability to maintain or revoke the same, and shall
have the authority to execute any such amendment by and on behalf of each
Partner. Any undertakings by the Partners necessary to enable or preserve a
Safe Harbor Election may be reflected in such amendments and to the extent so
reflected shall be binding on each Partner, respectively, _provided_ , that
such amendments are not reasonably likely to have a material **** adverse
effect on the rights and obligations of the Class A Common LPs.

  

### 

  

### (6) Each Partner agrees to cooperate with the Election Partner to perfect
and maintain any Safe Harbor Election, and to timely execute and deliver any
documentation with respect thereto reasonably requested by the Election
Partner.

  

### 

  

### (7) No transfer, assignment or other disposition of any interest in the
Partnership by a Partner shall be effective unless prior to such transfer,
assignment or disposition the transferee, assignee or intended recipient of
such interest shall have agreed in writing to be bound by the provisions of
this Section 4.2B, in form satisfactory to the Election Partner.

  

### 

  

### (8) Costs and expenses incurred by the Election Partner in making and
preserving (or if revoked, revoking) the Safe Harbor Election shall be paid
by the Partnership.

Unit Priority Distribution, _provided however_ , in the event that Available
Cash is less than the aggregate amount distributable to the holders of the
Series C-1 Preferred Units and the Series D Preferred Units pursuant to the
foregoing provision of this Section 5.1.A.1, distributions shall be made to
the holders of the Series C-1 Preferred Units (as a class) and the holders of
the Series D Preferred Units (as a class) pro rata, in the ratio which the
Series C-1 Preferred Unit Priority Distribution or the Series D Preferred
Unit Priority Distribution, as applicable, bears to each other, and within

Series D Preferred Units, as the case may be, held by each such holder; and
_second_ , to the General Partner and Gables Trust (in proportion to the

#### (2) Subject to the preferences of the Preferred Units, the General
Partner shall distribute remaining Available Cash to holders of Common Units,
at such times and in such amounts as the General Partner deems appropriate in
its sole and absolute discretion to Persons who are holders of Common Units
on the applicable Partnership Record Date. Any amounts so distributed shall
be allocated among the holders of Common Units as follows. First, such
Available Cash shall be tentatively allocated among the Limited Partners that
hold Common Units in accordance with their respective Percentage Interests on
such Partnership Record Date. The amount tentatively allocated to a holder
of Class B Common Units shall be distributed to such holder. The amount
tentatively allocated to each Class A Common LP shall be further divided
between such Class A Common LP, on the one hand, and the Promote Partner, on
the other hand, and distributed as follows:

  

#### 

  

##### (i) First, 100% to such Class A Common LP pro rata with respect to each
Class A Common Unit owned by such Class A Common LP until the Initial

##### 

  

##### (iv) Fourth, 80% to the Class A Common LP and 20% to the Promote

any outstanding Gables Trust Series C-1 Preferred Shares, Gables Trust
Series D Preferred Shares and, from and after June 18, 2008, Gables Trust
Series Z Preferred Shares for all past dividend periods and the then current
dividend period have been or contemporaneously are (x) declared and paid in
full or (y) declared and a sum sufficient for the full payment thereof is set
apart for such payment.

  

### 

  

### B. The General Partner shall take such reasonable efforts, as determined
by it in its sole and absolute discretion, to distribute Available Cash to
the Limited Partners so as to preclude any such distribution or portion
thereof from being treated as part of a sale of property to the Partnership
by a Limited Partner under Section 707 of the Code or the Regulations
thereunder; _provided_   _that_ the General Partner and the Partnership shall
not have liability to a Limited Partner under any circumstances as a result
of any distribution to a Limited Partner being so treated.

  

### 

  

### C. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary above, the Partnership shall
cause to be distributed to Gables Trust and the General Partner (in
proportion to the number of Series C-1 Preferred Units and Series D Preferred
Units owned by each) an amount that in the aggregate is equal to the
aggregate amount necessary to redeem any Gables Trust Series C-1 Preferred
Shares or Gables Trust Series D Preferred Shares, as the case may be, which
have been called for redemption by Gables Trust, at such time as is necessary
to facilitate any such redemption and such distribution will cause a
redemption of a like number of Series C-1 Preferred Units or Series D
Preferred Units, as the case may be.

  

### 

  

### D. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary above in Section 5.1.A, (but
subject to the provisions of Section 5.1.C in the event of a redemption of
Series Z Preferred Shares, alone or in connection with a redemption of any
Gables Trust Series C-1 Preferred Shares or Gables Trust Series D Preferred
Shares), the Partnership shall cause to be distributed to Gables Trust and
the General Partner (in proportion to the number of Series Z Preferred Units
owned by each) an amount equal to the aggregate amount necessary to redeem
any Gables Trust Series Z Preferred Shares which have been called for
redemption by the Gables Trust, at such time as is necessary to facilitate
any such redemption. Such distribution will cause a redemption of a like
number of Series Z Preferred Units.

Trust are reduced to zero;

  

#### 

  

#### (7) Seventh, to the General Partner until the General Partners negative
Adjusted Capital Account balance is equal to the excess, if any, of the

_Reimbursement Amount_ " and with respect to all such Limited Partners, the "
_Aggregate Reimbursement Amount_ ");

  

#### 

  

#### (8) Eighth, to the Limited Partners who have agreed to reimburse the
Partnership with respect to any amount of recourse debt referred to in (5)
above, in proportion to each such Limited Partners Reimbursement Amount
until the aggregate amount allocated pursuant to this 6.1.B(8) is equal to
the Aggregate Reimbursement Amount; and

  

#### 

  

#### (9) Thereafter, all Net Losses in excess of the limitations set forth in
this Section 6.1.B shall be allocated to the General Partner.

Nonrecourse Built-in Gain shall be allocated among the Partners in accordance
with their respective interests in Partnership profits, as determined by the
General Partner in its reasonable discretion after taking into account all
relevant facts and circumstances. The General Partner shall use its good
faith efforts to allocate such Nonrecourse

### 

  

### Liabilities of the Partnership to Partners that have "negative
tax capital accounts" in proportion to and to the extent of each such
Partners respective negative tax capital account if the General Partner
determines, in its sole and absolute discretion, that such allocation is in
accordance with the Partners interests in Partnership profits or is
otherwise allowable under Regulations Section 1.752-3(a)(3) and that such
allocation does not adversely affect any other Partner.

  

### 

  

### D. Any gain allocated to the Partners upon the sale or other taxable
disposition of any Partnership asset shall to the extent possible, after
taking into account other required allocations of gain pursuant to _Exhibit
C_, be characterized as Recapture Income in the same proportions and to the
same extent as such Partners have been allocated any deductions directly
or indirectly giving rise to the treatment of such gains as Recapture Income.

  

### 

  

Section 6.2 _UBTI_

  



  

### A. The allocations under _Article 6_ and _Exhibit B_ of this Agreement
are intended to meet the requirements of Code Section 514(c)(9)(E) and the
regulations thereunder, and such allocations shall be adjusted, insofar as
may be necessary in the judgment of the General Partner, to enable any
Partner that is a Qualified Organization to qualify for the exemption under
Code Section 514(c)(9) for UBTI attributable to any real property acquisition
indebtedness of the Partnership. To the extent that the Partnership
determines, based on the advice of its professional tax advisors, that such
allocations do not so comply, the General Partner shall make such other
allocations as are necessary, in the judgment of such tax advisors, to ensure
compliance, provided such other allocations do not materially distort the
economic sharing arrangement of the Partnership as set forth in
this Agreement. If the allocations of any entity in which the Partnership
invests and that is treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes
do not comply with the requirements of Code Section 514(c)(9)(E) and the
Treasury Regulations thereunder, the items of income, gain, loss
and deduction of such entity that are allocated to the Partnership shall
be separately allocated from all other items of the Partnership in accordance
with Section 1.514(c)-2(m)(2), _Ex._ (3) of the Treasury Regulations,
provided such allocations do not materially distort the economic sharing
arrangement of the Partnership as set forth in this Agreement.

  

### 

  

### B. Each Partner hereby agrees to notify the Partnership promptly of any
change or probable future change in circumstances that would cause it to
become a Qualified Organization or, if already a Qualified Organization,
would cause it to cease to be a Qualified Organization.

of State of Delaware as required by the Act. The General Partner shall use
all reasonable efforts to cause to be filed such other certificates or

formation, continuation, qualification and operation of a limited partnership
(or a partnership in which the limited partners have limited liability) in
the State of Delaware and any other state, or the District of Columbia, in
which the Partnership may elect to do business or own property. To
the extent that such action is determined by the General Partner to be
reasonable and necessary or appropriate, the General Partner shall file
amendments to and restatements of the Certificate and do all the things to
maintain the Partnership as a limited partnership (or a partnership in which
the limited partners have limited liability) under the laws of the State of
Delaware and each other state, or the District of Columbia, in which the
Partnership may elect to do business or own property.  Subject to the terms
of Section 8.5.A(4) hereof, the General Partner shall not be required, before
or after filing, to deliver or mail a copy of the Certificate or any
amendment thereto to any Limited Partner.

Limited Partners as may be specifically provided for under a provision of
this Agreement).

Partnership.

other basis as the General Partner may determine in its sole and absolute

_provided_ _that_  the amount of any such reimbursement shall be reduced by
any interest earned by the General Partner with respect to bank accounts or
other instruments or accounts held by it on behalf of the Partnership as

### 

  

### Partners acknowledge that, for purposes of this Section 7.4.B,
all expenses of the General Partner are deemed incurred for the benefit of

reimbursement to the General Partner and/or Gables Trust as a result of
indemnification pursuant to Section 7.7 hereof.

  

### 

  

### C. Subject to Section 8.10, the General Partner, the Promote Partner or
their respective Affiliates may be paid (i) management fees not exceeding two

per property, (iii) equity commitment fees of four percent (4%) of equity
committed by Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (" _LBHI_ ") or its Affiliates and

be reimbursed for all costs and expenses paid or incurred in connection with
the financing of the mergers and other transactions under the Merger
Agreement, including all amounts paid to or incurred with respect to the
Lenders and customary investment banking fees paid to or incurred by LBHI and
its Affiliates.  In addition to certain of the fees expressly provided for in

Promote Partner is hereby given, in consideration for such services, the
interests in the future "profits" of the Partnership provided for in Sections

not providing any services or receiving any compensation provided by or
received by the Lenders.

Section 7.5. _Outside Activities of the General Partner, Gables Trust and
Parent_

  



  

### A. The General Partner shall not directly or indirectly enter into or
conduct any business other than in connection with the ownership, acquisition
and disposition of Partnership Interests as a General Partner or Limited
Partner and the management of the business of the Partnership, and such
activities as are incidental thereto. The assets of the General Partner
shall be limited to Partnership Interests. The General Partner shall not hold
any assets other than Partnership Interests as a General Partner or Limited
Partner, and other than such bank accounts or similar instruments or accounts
as it deems necessary to carry out its responsibilities contemplated under
this Agreement and its organizational documents. The General Partner and any
Affiliates of the General Partner may acquire Limited Partner Interests and
shall be entitled to exercise all rights of a Limited Partner relating to
such Limited Partner Interests.

  

### 

  

### B. The General Partner shall not issue at any time any capital stock
(whether voting or non-voting or common or preferred) or any evidence of
indebtedness except to Gables Trust.

  

### 

  

### 29   

     
   

  

### 

  

### C. Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent Gables Trust, LBHI, Parent or
any of their Affiliates (other than the General Partner) from conducting any
business or activities, whether or not such business or activities are
directly competitive with the business of the Partnership.

  

### 

  

Section 7.6. _Contracts with Affiliates_

  



  

### A. The Partnership may lend or contribute funds or other assets to its
Subsidiaries or other Persons in which it has an equity investment and such
Persons may borrow funds from the Partnership, on terms and conditions
established in the sole and absolute discretion of the General Partner.  The
foregoing authority shall not create any right or benefit in favor of any
Subsidiary or any other Person.

  

### 

  

### B. Except as provided in Section 7.5.A, the Partnership may transfer
assets to joint ventures, other partnerships, corporations or other business
entities in which it is or thereby becomes a participant upon such terms and
subject to such conditions consistent with this Agreement and applicable law
as the General Partner, in its sole and absolute discretion, believes are
advisable.

  

### 

  

### C. Except as expressly permitted by this Agreement, neither the General
Partner nor any of its Affiliates shall sell, transfer or convey any property
to, or purchase any property from, the Partnership, directly or indirectly,
except pursuant to transactions that are determined by the General Partner in
good faith to be fair and reasonable and no less favorable to the Partnership
than would be obtained from an unaffiliated third party. The Partners
expressly acknowledge that Affiliates of LBHI are providing financing to the
Partnership (the " _Lenders_ ") and that Lenders Affiliates are owners of
equity interests, directly or indirectly, in the General Partner and the
Promote Partner (" _LBHI Equity Affiliates_ ").  Notwithstanding any common
ownership or affiliation between any Lender and the LBHI Equity Affiliates:
(i) Lenders, on the one hand, and the LBHI Equity Affiliates, on the other
hand, are separate and distinct legal entities with different investment
goals and objectives; (ii) Lenders may exercise all the rights, privileges
and benefits of the holder of any such indebtedness and enforce all remedies
and other provisions under the applicable document evidencing or describing
such financing without regard to the fact that the LBHI Equity Affiliates may
hold a direct or indirect interest in the General Partner; and (iii) to the
maximum extent permitted by applicable law, (A) the Partners waive any claims
that Partners or the Partnership may have against Lenders arising solely by
reason of the fact that LBHI Equity Affiliates may hold a direct or indirect
interest in the General Partner (but not waiving any claims by reason of a
Lenders capacity as lender) and (B) the Partners waive any claim that the
Partners or the Partnership may have against the LBHI Equity Affiliates and
the General Partner arising solely by reason of the fact that Lenders are
making or holding the indebtedness evidencing such financing (but not waiving
any claims arising by reason of LBHI Equity Affiliates capacity as direct or
indirect Partners or Affiliates of Partners of the Partnership).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
General Partner shall have the sole right, power and authority to act on
behalf of the Partnership in connection with the exercise or enforcement of
any rights or remedies that the Partnership or any Subsidiaries may have
under the documents evidencing the financing against LBHI or any Affiliate
thereof or providing such financing or Lenders.

  

### 

  

### 30   

     
   

  

### 

  

### D. The General Partner, in its sole and absolute discretion and without
the approval of the Limited Partners, may propose and adopt on behalf of the
Partnership employee benefit plans, stock or partnership interest option
plans, shared appreciation rights, equity appreciation plans and similar
plans funded by the Partnership for the benefit of employees of the General
Partner, the Partnership, Subsidiaries of the Partnership or any Affiliate of
any of them in respect of services performed, directly or indirectly, for the
benefit of the Partnership, the General Partner, or any of the Partnerships
Subsidiaries.

  

### 

  

### E. The General Partner is expressly authorized to enter into, in the name
and on behalf of the Partnership, a right of first opportunity arrangement
and other conflict avoidance agreements with various Affiliates of the
Partnership and the General Partner, on such terms as the General Partner, in
its sole and absolute discretion, believes are advisable.

  

### 

  

Section 7.7. _Indemnification_

  



  

### A. The Partnership shall indemnify each Indemnitee from and against any
and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, joint or several, expenses
(including, without limitation, attorneys fees and other legal fees and
expenses), judgments, fines, settlements, and other amounts arising from any
and all claims, demands, actions, suits or proceedings, civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, that relate to the operations of the
Partnership, the General Partner or Gables Trust as set forth in this
Agreement in which such Indemnitee may be involved, or is threatened to be
involved, as a party or otherwise, unless it is established that: (i)
the act or omission of the Indemnitee was material to the matter giving rise
to the proceeding and either was committed in bad faith or was the result of
active and deliberate dishonesty; (ii) the Indemnitee actually received an
improper personal benefit in money, property or services; or (ii) in the case
of any criminal proceeding, the Indemnitee had reasonable cause to believe
that the act or omission was unlawful. Without limitation, the foregoing
indemnity shall extend to any liability of any Indemnitee, pursuant to a loan
guaranty or otherwise, for any indebtedness of the Partnership or any
Subsidiary of the Partnership (including without limitation, any indebtedness
which the Partnership or any Subsidiary of the Partnership has assumed or
taken subject to), and the General Partner is hereby authorized and
empowered, on behalf of the Partnership, to enter into one or more indemnity
agreements consistent with the provisions of this Section 7.7 in favor of any
Indemnitee having or potentially having liability for any such indebtedness.
The termination of any proceeding by judgment, order or settlement does not
create a presumption that the Indemnitee did not meet the requisite standard
of conduct set forth in this Section 7.7.A with respect to the subject matter
of such proceeding. The termination of any proceeding by conviction of an
Indemnitee or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent by an
Indemnitee, or an entry of an order of probation against an Indemnitee prior
to judgment, creates a rebuttable presumption that such Indemnitee acted in a
manner contrary to that specified in this Section 7.7.A. Any indemnification
pursuant to this Section 7.7 shall be made only out of the assets of the
Partnership, and neither the General Partner nor any Limited Partner shall
have any obligation to contribute to the capital of the Partnership or
otherwise provide funds, to enable the Partnership to fund its obligations
under this Section 7.7.

  

### 

  

### B. Reasonable expenses incurred by an Indemnitee who is a party to a
proceeding may be paid or reimbursed by the Partnership in advance of the
final disposition of the proceeding upon receipt by the Partnership of (i) a
written affirmation by the Indemnitee of the

  

### 

  

### 31   

     
   

  

### 

  

### Indemnitees good faith belief that the standard of conduct necessary for
indemnification by the Partnership as authorized in this Section 7.7.A. has
been met, and (ii) a written undertaking by or on behalf of the Indemnitee to
repay the amount if it shall ultimately be determined that the standard
of conduct has not been met.

  

### 

  

### C. The indemnification provided by this Section 7.7 shall be in addition
to any other rights to which an Indemnitee or any other Person may be
entitled under any agreement, pursuant to any vote of the Partners, as a
matter of law or otherwise, and shall continue as to an Indemnitee who has
ceased to serve in such capacity unless otherwise provided in a written
agreement pursuant to which such Indemnities is indemnified.

  

### 

  

### D. The Partnership may, but shall not be obligated to, purchase and
maintain insurance, on behalf of the Indemnitees and such other Persons as
the General Partner shall determine, against any liability that may be
asserted against or expenses that may be incurred by such Person in
connection with the Partnerships activities, regardless of whether the
Partnership would have the power to indemnify such Person against such
liability under the provisions of this Agreement.

  

### 

  

### E. For purposes of this Section 7.7, the Partnership shall be deemed to
have requested an Indemnitee to serve as fiduciary of an employee benefit
plan whenever the performance by it of its duties to the Partnership also
imposes duties on, or otherwise involves services by, it to the plan or
participants or beneficiaries of the plan; excise taxes assessed on an
Indemnitee with respect to an employee benefit plan pursuant to applicable
law shall constitute fines within the meaning of Section 7.7; and actions
taken or omitted by the Indemnitee with respect to an employee benefit plan
in the performance of its duties for a purpose reasonably believed by it to
be in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries of the plan shall be
deemed to be for a purpose which is not opposed to the best interests of the
Partnership.

  

### 

  

### F. In no event may an Indemnitee subject any of the Partners to personal
liability by reason of the indemnification provisions set forth in this
Agreement.

  

### 

  

### G. An Indemnitee shall not be denied indemnification in whole or in part
under this Section 7.7 because the Indemnitee had an interest in the
transaction with respect to which the indemnification applies if the
transaction was otherwise permitted by the terms of this Agreement.

  

### 

  

### H. The provisions of this Section 7.7 are for the benefit of the
Indemnitees, their heirs, successors, assigns and administrators and shall
not be deemed to create any rights for the benefit of any other Persons. Any
amendment, modification or repeal of this Section 7.7 or any provision hereof
shall be prospective only and shall not in any way affect the limitations on
the Partnerships liability to any Indemnitee under this Section 7.7 as in
effect immediately prior to such amendment, modification, or repeal with
respect to claims arising from or relating to matters occurring, in whole or
in part, prior to such amendment, modification or repeal, regardless of when
such claims may arise or be asserted.

  

### 

  

### 32   

     
   

  

### 

  

Section 7.8. _Liability of the General Partner_

  



  

### A. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
neither the General Partner nor Gables Trust shall be liable for monetary
damages to the Partnership, any Partners or any Assignees for losses
sustained or liabilities incurred as a result of errors in judgment or of any
act or omission if the General Partner acted in good faith.

  

### 

  

### B. The Limited Partners expressly acknowledge that the General Partner is
acting on behalf of the Partnership, Gables Trust, and the direct or
indirect shareholders of Gables Trust collectively, that the General Partner
is under no obligation to consider the separate interests of the Limited
Partners (including, without limitation, the tax consequences to Limited
Partners or Assignees from sales of properties, refinancing of debt, or any
other actions) in deciding whether to cause the Partnership to take (or
decline to take) any actions, and that neither the General Partner nor Gables
Trust shall be liable for monetary damages for losses sustained, liabilities
incurred, or benefits not derived by Limited Partners in connection with such
decisions, provided that the General Partner has acted in good faith pursuant
to its authority under this Agreement.

  

### 

  

### C. Subject to its obligations and duties as General Partner set forth in
Section 7.1.A hereof, the General Partner may exercise any of the powers
granted to it by this Agreement and perform any of the duties imposed upon it
hereunder either directly or by or through its agents.  Neither the General
Partner nor Gables Trust shall be responsible for any misconduct or
negligence on the part of any such agent appointed by the General Partner in
good faith.

  

### 

  

### D. Any amendment, modification or repeal of this Section 7.8 or any
provision hereof shall be prospective only and shall not in any way affect
the limitations on the General Partners liability to the Partnership and
the Limited Partners under this Section 7.8 as in effect immediately prior
to such amendment, modification or repeal with respect to claims arising from
or relating to matters occurring, in whole or in part, prior to such
amendment, modification or repeal, regardless of when such claims may arise
or be asserted.

  

### 

  

Section 7.9. _Other Matters Concerning the General Partner_

  



  

### A. The General Partner may rely and shall be protected in acting or
refraining from acting upon any resolution, certificate, statement,
instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, consent, order, bond,
debenture, or other paper or document believed by it in good faith to be
genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties.

  

### 

  

### B. The General Partner may consult with legal counsel, accountants,
appraisers, management consultants, investment bankers, architects,
engineers, environmental consultants and other consultants and advisers
selected by it, and any act taken or omitted to be taken in reliance upon the
opinion of such Persons as to matters which such General Partner reasonably
believes to be within such Persons professional or expert competence shall
be conclusively presumed to have been done or omitted in good faith and in
accordance with such opinion.

  

### 

  

### C. The General Partner shall have the right, in respect of any of its
powers or obligations hereunder, to act through any of its duly authorized
officers and a duly appointed attorney or attorneys-in-fact. Each such
attorney shall, to the extent provided by the General

  

### 

  

### 33   

     
   

  

### 

  

### Partner in the power of attorney, have full power and authority to do and
perform all and every act and duty which is permitted or required to be done
by the General Partner hereunder.

  

### 

  

### D. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement or the Act, any
action of the General Partner on behalf of the Partnership or any decision of
the General Partner to refrain from acting on behalf of the Partnership,
undertaken in the good faith belief that such action or omission is necessary
or advisable in order (i) to protect the ability of Gables Trust to continue
to qualify as a REIT or (ii) to avoid Gables Trust incurring any taxes under
Section 857 or Section 4981 of the Code, is expressly authorized under this
Agreement and is deemed approved by all of the Limited Partners.

  

### 

  

Section 7.10. _Title to Partnership Assets_

  



  

Title to Partnership assets, whether real, personal or mixed and whether
tangible or intangible, shall be deemed to be owned by the Partnership as an
entity, and no Partner, individually or collectively, shall have any
ownership interest in such Partnership assets or any portion thereof. Title
to any or all of the Partnership assets may be held in the name of the
Partnership, the General Partner or one or more nominees, as the General
Partner may determine, including Affiliates of the General Partner.  The
General Partner hereby declares and warrants that any Partnership assets for
which legal title is held in the name of the General Partner or any nominee
or Affiliate of the General Partner shall be held by the General Partner for
the use and benefit of the Partnership in accordance with the provisions of
this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that the General Partner shall use
its best efforts to cause beneficial and record title to such assets to be
vested in the Partnership as soon as reasonably practicable. All Partnership
assets shall be recorded as the property of the Partnership in its books and
records, irrespective of the name in which legal title to such Partnership
assets is held.

  



  

Section 7.11. _Reliance by Third Parties_

  



  

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any Person
dealing with the Partnership shall be entitled to assume that the General
Partner has full power and authority, without consent or approval of any
other Partner or Person to encumber, sell or otherwise use in any manner any
and all assets of the Partnership and to enter into any contracts on behalf
of the Partnership, and take any and all actions on behalf of the Partnership
and such Person shall be entitled to deal with the General Partner as if the
General Partner were the Partnerships sole party in interest, both legally
and beneficially.  Each Limited Partner hereby waives any and all defenses or
other remedies which may be available against such Person to contest, negate
or disaffirm any action of the General Partner in connection with any such
dealing. In no event shall any Person dealing with the General Partner or its
representatives be obligated to ascertain that the terms of this Agreement
have been complied with or to inquire into the necessity or expedience of any
act or action of the General Partner or its representatives. Each and every
certificate, document or other instrument executed on behalf of the

thereunder that (i) at the time of the execution and delivery of such
certificate, document or instrument, this Agreement was in full force and
effect, (ii) the Person executing and delivering such certificate, document
or instrument was duly authorized and empowered to do so for and on behalf of
the Partnership and (iii) such certificate, document or

 RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF LIMITED PARTNERS

  

# 

  

Section 8.1. _Limitation of Liability_

  



  

The Limited Partners shall have no liability under this Agreement except as
expressly provided in this Agreement, including Section 10.4 hereof, or under
the Act.

  



  

Section 8.2. _Management of Business_

  



  

No Limited Partner or Assignee (other than the General Partner or any
officer, director, employee, partner, agent or trustee of the General Partner
or the Partnership, in his, her, or its capacity as such) shall take part in
the operation, management or control (within the meaning of the Act) of the
Partnerships business, transact any business in the Partnerships name or
have the power to sign documents for or otherwise bind the Partnership.
The transaction of any such business by the General Partner or any
officer, director, employee, partner, agent or trustee of the General Partner
or the Partnership, in his, her, or its capacity as such, shall not affect,
impair or eliminate the limitations on the liability of the Limited Partners
or Assignees under this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
provided herein, the Promote Partner and its Affiliates shall provide the
management services and property disposition services set forth in Section
7.4(c), the provision of which services shall not affect the limitation on
liability of the Promote Partner in accordance with Section 8.1 or constitute
"taking part in the operation, management or control" of the Partnerships
business within the meaning of the Act.

  



  

Section 8.3. _Outside Activities of Limited Partners_

  



  

Subject to any agreements entered into pursuant to Section 7.6.E hereof and
any other agreements entered into by a Limited Partner or its Affiliates with
the Partnership or a Subsidiary, any Limited Partner (including the Promote
Partner and Gables Trust) and any officer, director, employee, agent,
trustee, Affiliate or shareholder of any Limited Partner (including
the Promote Partner and Gables Trust) shall be entitled to and may have
business interests and engage in business activities in addition to those
relating to the Partnership, including business interests and activities that
are in direct competition with the Partnership or that are enhanced by the
activities of the Partnership. Neither the Partnership nor any Partners
shall have any rights by virtue of this Agreement in any business ventures of
any Limited Partner or Assignee.  None of the Limited Partners nor any other
Person shall have any rights by virtue of this Agreement or the partnership
relationship established hereby in any business ventures of any other Person
and such Person shall have no obligation pursuant to this Agreement to offer
any interest in any such business ventures to the Partnership, any Limited
Partner or any such other Person, even if such opportunity is of a character
which, if presented to the Partnership, any Limited Partner or such other
Person, could be taken by such Person.

Section 8.4. _Return of Capital_

  



  

Except pursuant to the right of redemption set forth in Section 8.6, no
Limited Partner shall be entitled to the withdrawal or return of its Capital
Contribution, except to the extent of distributions made pursuant to this
Agreement or upon termination of the Partnership as provided herein. Except
to the extent provided by  _Exhibit C_ hereof or as permitted by Section
4.2.A, or otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, no Limited Partner
or Assignee shall have priority over any other Limited Partner or Assignee
either as to the return of Capital Contributions or as to profits, losses or
distributions.

  



  

Section 8.5. _Rights of Limited Partners Relating to the Partnership_

  



  

### A. In addition to other rights provided by this Agreement or by the Act,
and except as limited by Section 8.5.C hereof, each Limited Partner shall
have the right, for a purpose reasonably related to such Limited Partners
interest as a limited partner in the Partnership, upon written demand with a
statement of the purpose of such demand and at such Limited Partners own
expense (including such copying and administrative charges as the General
Partner may establish from time to time):

  

### 

  

#### (1) to obtain a copy of the Partnerships federal, state and local
income tax returns for each Partnership Year;

  

#### 

  

#### (2) to obtain a current list of the name and last known business,
residence or mailing address of each Partner;

  

#### 

  

#### (3) to obtain a copy of this Agreement and the Certificate and all
amendments thereto, together with executed copies of all powers of attorney
pursuant to which this Agreement, the Certificate and all amendments thereto
have been executed; and

  

#### 

  

#### (4) to obtain true and full information regarding the amount of cash and
a description and statement of any other property or services contributed by
each Partner and which each Partner has agreed to contribute in the future,
and the date on which each became a Partner.

  

#### 

  

### B. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 8.5, the General
Partner may keep confidential from the Limited Partners, for such period of
time as the General Partner determines in its sole and absolute discretion to
be reasonable, any information that (i) the General Partner reasonably
believes to be in the nature of trade secrets or other information the
disclosure of which the General Partner in good faith believes is not in the
best interests of the Partnership or could damage the Partnership or is
business or (ii) the Partnership is required by law or by agreements with an
unaffiliated third party to keep confidential.

  

### 

  

Section 8.6. _Redemption Right_

  



  

### A. Subject to Sections 8.6.B and 8.6.C, at or after the Effective Time
and prior to the fourth anniversary of the Effective Time, each holder of
Class A Common Units shall have the right (the " _Redemption Right_ ") to
require the Partnership to redeem on a Specified Redemption Date all or a
portion of their Class A Common Units at a redemption price equal to and in
the

  



  

36   

     
   

  



  

### form of the Redemption Amount to be paid by the Partnership.  The
Redemption Right shall be exercised pursuant to a Notice of Redemption
delivered to the Partnership (with a copy to the General Partner) by the
Limited Partner who is exercising the Redemption Right (the "
_Redeeming Partner_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that the Partnership shall
not be obligated to satisfy such Redemption Right if Gables Trust and/or
the General Partner elects to purchase the Class A Common Units subject to
the Notice of Redemption pursuant to Section 8.6.B.  A Limited Partner may
not exercise the Redemption Right for less than one thousand (1,000) Class A
Common Units or, if such Limited Partner holds less than one thousand (1,000)
Class A Common Units, all of the Class A Common Units held by such Partner.
The Redeeming Partner shall have no right, with respect to any Class A Common
Units so redeemed, to receive any distributions paid on or after the
Specified Redemption Date (except to the extent such Redemption is not
actually consummated on such date). The Assignee of any Limited Partner may
exercise the rights of such Limited Partner pursuant to this Section 8.6, and
such Limited Partner shall be deemed to have assigned such rights to such
Assignee and shall be bound by the exercise of such rights by such Assignee.
In connection with any exercise of such rights by such Assignee on behalf of
such Limited Partner, the Redemption Amount shall be paid by the Partnership
directly to such Assignee and not to such Limited Partner.

  

### 

  

### B. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 8.6.A, a Limited Partner
that exercises the Redemption Right shall be deemed to have offered to sell
the Class A Common Units described in the Notice of Redemption to the General
Partner and Gables Trust, and either of the General Partner or Gables Trust
(or both) may, in its sole and absolute discretion, elect to purchase
directly and acquire such Class A Common Units by paying to the Redeeming
Partner the Redemption Amount, as elected by the General Partner or Gables
Trust (in its sole and absolute discretion), on the Specified Redemption
Date, whereupon the General Partner or Gables Trust shall acquire the Class A
Common Units offered for redemption by the Redeeming Partner, the Class A
Common Units so acquired shall automatically be converted into a like number
of Class B Common Units, and the General Partner or Gables Trust, as the case
may be, shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as the owner of
such Class B Common Units. If the General Partner and/or Gables Trust shall
elect to exercise its right to purchase Class A Common Units under
this Section 8.6.B with respect to a Notice of Redemption, they shall so
notify the Redeeming Partner within five Business Days after the receipt by
the General Partner of such Notice of Redemption.  Unless the General
Partner and/or Gables Trust (in its sole and absolute discretion) shall
exercise its right to purchase Class A Common Units from the Redeeming
Partner pursuant to this Section 8.6.B, neither the General Partner nor
Gables Trust shall have any obligation to the Redeeming Partner or
the Partnership with respect to the Redeeming Partners exercise of the
Redemption Right. In the event the General Partner or Gables Trust shall
exercise its right to purchase Partnership Units with respect to the exercise
of a Redemption Right in the manner described in the first sentence of this
Section 8.6.B, the Partnership shall have no obligation to pay any amount to
the Redeeming Partner with respect to such Redeeming Partners exercise of
such Redemption Right, and each of the Redeeming Partner, the Partnership,
and the General Partner or Gables Trust, as the case may be, shall treat the
transaction between the General Partner or Gables Trust, as the case may be,
and the Redeeming Partner for federal income tax purposes as a sale of the
Redeeming Partners Partnership Units to the General Partner or Gables Trust,
as the case may be.

### C. In connection with a redemption by Gables Trust of any or all of
Gables Trust Series C-1 Preferred Shares, the General Partner shall have the
right to cause the Partnership to redeem all or a portion of the Series C-1
Preferred Units that Gables Trust and/or the General Partner holds, and such
redemption proceeds shall be distributed to Gables Trust and/or the General
Partner, as applicable, pursuant to the provisions of Section 5.1.C.

  

### 

  

### D. In connection with a redemption by Gables Trust of any or all of the
Gables Trust Series D Preferred Shares, the General Partner shall have the
right to cause the Partnership to redeem all or a portion of the Series D
Preferred Units that Gables Trust and/or the General Partner holds, and such
redemption proceeds shall be distributed to Gables Trust and/or the General
Partner, as applicable, pursuant to the provisions of Section 5.1.C.

  

### 

  

### E. In connection with a redemption by Gables Trust of any or all of the
Gables Trust Series Z Preferred Shares, the General Partner shall have the
right to cause the Partnership to redeem all or a portion of the Series Z
Preferred Units that the Gables Trust and/or the General Partner holds, and
such redemption proceeds shall be distributed to the Augusta Trust and/or the
General Partner, as applicable, pursuant to the provisions of Section 5.1.D.

  

### 

  

### F. (1) If at any time the General Partner and Gables Trust propose to
sell a majority of their collective Class B Common Units to any Person other
than an Affiliate of the General Partner for consideration per unit having an
aggregate value in excess of the aggregate amount that would be payable for
each Class B Common Unit if such units were redeemed at the Redemption Amount
then in effect, the Limited Partners (other than Gables Trust and the General
Partner) shall have the right, at the election of the General Partner, in its
sole discretion, to either (i) have all or part of their Class A Common Units
redeemed by the Partnership (the " _Tag-Along Redemption Right_ ") in cash
for an amount per Class A Common Unit equal to the fair value of the
consideration paid by such Person for each such Class B Common Unit (the "
_Tag-Along Redemption Amount_ ") upon consummation of such sale or (ii) sell
all or part of their Class A Common Units to the proposed purchaser of the
Class B Common Units for the same price and on the same terms as the General
Partner or Gables Trust (the " _Tag-Along Sale Right_ "), in each case
subject to reduction pursuant to Section 8.8.

  

### 

  

At least 30 days prior to the proposed closing date of the sale of the Class
B Common Units, the General Partner will give written notice to the
Limited Partners of the proposed sale, providing a summary of terms and
conditions thereof and advising the Limited Partners whether the General
Partner has elected to provide the Limited Partners with the Tag-Along
Redemption Right or the Tag-Along Sale Right. If the Limited Partners are
provided the Tag-Along Redemption Right, the redemption shall be conditioned
upon the closing of the sale of the General Partners and Gables Trusts
Class B Common Units to the third-party purchaser. Each Limited Partner may
exercise its Tag-Along Redemption Right or Tag-Along Sale Right by delivering
a written notice to the General Partner, within 15 days of receipt of the
General Partners notice, stating the number of Class A Common Units that
such Limited Partner wishes redeemed or sold, as applicable, and including
with the notice the certificate or certificates representing the Class A
Common Units and a limited power of attorney authorizing the

  



  

38   

     
   

  



  

transfer of such Class A Common Units on the terms set forth in the notice.
The General Partner may condition the Limited Partners participation in the
redemption or the sale upon the Limited Partners execution and delivery of
required agreements, instruments of transfer, or other documents determined
in good faith by the General Partner to be necessary or appropriate to effect
the sale or transfer; _provided_ that no Limited Partner shall be required to
make any representations or warranties in connection with such transfer other
than as to (i) ownership of Class A Common Units free and clear of all liens,
claims and encumbrances, (ii) such Limited Partners power and authority to
effect such transfer and (iii) such matters pertaining to compliance with
securities laws as reasonably required. Delivery of the notice with such
certificate or certificates and limited power of attorney shall constitute an
irrevocable acceptance of the offer by the Limited Partner.  If the third-
party sale does not occur, the documents shall be promptly returned to the
Limited Partner.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if a
Limited Partner fails to notify the General Partner within 15 days after the
notice given by the General Partner pursuant hereto, it shall be deemed to
have irrevocably waived its rights with respect to such sale, in each case
subject to Section 8.8.

  



  

If a Limited Partner gives written notice indicating that it desires to
participate in the redemption or sale, as the case may be, (i) if the Tag-
Along Redemption Right is provided, the Partnership shall redeem that number
of Class A Common Units specified in the Limited Partners acceptance notice
for the Tag-Along Redemption Amount simultaneously with the closing of the
sale of Gable Trusts and the General Partners sale of Class B Common Units
to the third-party purchaser, or (ii) if the Tag-Along Sale Right is
provided, the Person acquiring the Class B Common Units (or an Affiliate of
such Person) shall purchase the Class A Common Units specified in the Limited
Partners acceptance notice, which Class A Common Units shall automatically,
without any further action on the part of the Limited Partner, convert into
Class B Common Units upon the closing of the sale to the third-party
purchaser, for the same price and on the same terms as those given to the
General Partner and Gables Trust, in each case simultaneously with the
closing of the General Partners and Gables Trusts sale of Class B Common
Units to the third-party purchaser.

  



  

#### (2) If at any time the Parent and its Affiliates propose to sell a
majority of their shares of common stock in Gables Trust, other than in
connection with the initial syndication to equity investors of interests in
Parent occurring at any time, to any Person other than an Affiliate of the
General Partner, for consideration per share having an aggregate value in
excess of the aggregate amount that would be payable for each Class B Common
Unit if such unit were redeemed at the Redemption Amount then in effect, the
Tag-Along Redemption Right shall apply to such sale and the Limited Partners
(other than Gables Trust) shall have the right to have all or part of their
Class A Common Units redeemed by the Partnership in cash for an amount per
Class A Common Unit equal to the Tag-Along Redemption Amount, subject to
reduction pursuant to Section 8.8, upon consummation of such sale.

  



  

39   

     
   

  



  

At least 30 days prior to the proposed closing date of the sale of the shares
of common stock of Gables Trust, the General Partner will give written notice
to the Limited Partners (other than Gables Trust) of the Tag-Along
Redemption Right, providing a summary of the terms and conditions thereof.
The General Partner shall condition the redemption upon the closing of the
sale of the Parents and its Affiliates shares of common stock of Gables
Trust to the third-party purchaser. Each Limited Partner may exercise
its Tag-Along Redemption Right by delivering a written notice to the General
Partner, within 15 days of receipt of the General Partners notice, stating
the number of Class A Common Units that such Limited Partner wishes redeemed
and including with the notice the certificate or certificates representing
the Class A Common Units. The General Partner may condition the Limited
Partners participation in the redemption or the sale upon the Limited
Partners execution and delivery of required agreements, instruments
of transfer, or other documents determined in good faith by the General
Partner to be necessary or appropriate to effect the sale or transfer;
_provided_  that no Limited Partner shall be required to make any
representations or warranties in connection with such transfer other than as
to (i) ownership of Class A Common Units free and clear of all liens, claims
and encumbrances, (ii) such Limited Partners power and authority to effect
such transfer and (iii) such matters pertaining to compliance with securities
laws as reasonably required. Delivery of the notice with such certificate or
certificates shall constitute an irrevocable acceptance of the offer by the
Limited Partner. If the third-party sale does not occur, the documents shall
be promptly returned to the Limited Partner. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, if a Limited Partner fails to notify the General Partner
within 15 days after the notice given by the General Partner pursuant hereto,
it shall be deemed to have irrevocably waived its rights with respect to such
sale. If a Limited Partner gives written notice indicating that it desires to
exercise its Tag-Along Redemption Right, the Partnership shall redeem that
number of Class A Common Units specified in the Limited Partners acceptance
notice for the Tag-Along Redemption Amount simultaneously with the closing of
the Parents and its Affiliates sale of shares of common stock of Gables
Trust to the third-party purchaser, subject to Section 8.8.

  



  

Section 8.7. _Drag-Along Right_

  



  

### A. In the event that the General Partner and Gables Trust, with respect
to the Partnership, or the Parent and its Affiliates, with respect to Gables
Trust, propose to (i) engage in a sale, transfer, merger or other disposition
of a majority of their Class B Common Units in the Partnership or of a
majority of their shares of common stock in Gables Trust, as the case may be
(other than in connection with the initial syndication to equity investors of
interests in Parent occurring at any time) or (ii) engage in a sale, transfer
or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the
Partnership or Gables Trust (each of (i) and (ii) being referred to as a "
_Drag-Along Sale_ " and in each case to a Person other than an Affiliate of
the General Partner), then the General Partner, Gables Trust, Parent, and
their Affiliates, as the case may be, may require all, but not less than all,
holders of Class A Common Units to participate in such Drag-Along Sale by
selling or transferring all, but not less than all, of their Class A Common
Units and/or voting their Class A Common Units in favor of such Drag-Along
Sale.

  



  

40   

     
   

  



  

### B. At least 30 days prior to the proposed date of any Drag-Along Sale,
the General Partner shall provide each Limited Partner written notice, which
notice shall set forth: (i) the name of the proposed transferee in the Drag-
Along Sale, (ii) the proposed amount of consideration to be delivered in
respect of the securities or assets included in the Drag-Along Sale and the
terms and conditions of payment offered by the proposed transferee (which
consideration, terms and conditions shall be the same on a per-unit basis as
given to the General Partner, Gables Trust, Parent, and their Affiliates, as
the case may be, except that such consideration shall be subject to reduction
pursuant to Section 8.8) and (iii) a statement that the General Partner,
Gables Trust, Parent, and their Affiliates, as the case may be, intend to
exercise their rights under this Section 8.7. Upon receipt of such notice,
each holder of Class A Common Units shall become obligated to sell, transfer
or dispose of his Class A Common Units pursuant to the terms of, or vote his
Class A Common Units in favor of, such Drag-Along Sale. At the closing of the
Drag-Along Sale, each holder of Class A Common Units shall deliver
certificates for all Class A Common Units to be sold by such holder and a
limited power of attorney authorizing the transfer of such Class A Common
Units on the terms set forth in the notice; _provided_ , that if a Limited
Partner does not deliver such certificate or certificates or limited power of
attorney, the certificate or certificates held by such Limited Partner shall
automatically be cancelled and represent solely the right to the
consideration received per unit (subject to Section 8.8) and subject to the
same obligations as the other Limited Partners, including with respect to any
indemnification of the purchaser.

  

### 

  

### C. In furtherance of this Section 8.7, each Limited Partner hereby
appoints the General Partner, with full power of substitution, as its true
and lawful proxy and attorney-in-fact to vote any and all Class A Common
Units held by such Limited Partner in accordance with the provisions of this
Section 8.7.

  

### 

  

### D. If the right to cause the holders of Class A Common Units pursuant to
this Section 8.7 is exercised, Section 8.6 shall be inapplicable and the
provisions of this Section 8.7 shall control.

  

### 

  

Section 8.8. _Promote Payable Upon Certain Dispositions of Class A Common
Units_

  



  

Upon the exercise by a holder of Class A Common Units of Tag-Along Redemption
Rights or Tag-Along Sale Rights, or the disposition of Class A Common Units
pursuant to a Drag-Along Sale under Section 8.7 or the disposition of Class A
Common Units in a merger involving the Partnership, the gross proceeds that
would otherwise be received by the holder of such Class A Common Units shall
be reduced by the amount that would hypothetically be distributed to the
Promote Partner if the amount of such gross proceeds were the applicable
Class A Common Unit holders tentative share of distributions pursuant to
Section 5.1.A.2 and such tentative share was divided between such Class A
Common Unit holder, on the one hand, and the Promote Partner, on the other
hand, pursuant to the provisions of clauses (i) through (iv) Section 5.1.A(2)
(taking into account all previous distributions pursuant to
Section 5.1.A(2)). An amount equal to such reduction shall be distributed or
paid to the Promote Partner. The General Partner shall implement
payment procedures to give effect to this Section 8.8.

  



  

41   

     
   

  



  

Section 8.9. _Option of Class A Common LPs to Guarantee Debt_.

  



  

If the Partnership and an existing holder that elects to receive any Class A
Common Units in the Partnership Merger have entered into a special loss
allocation and deficit restoration obligation ("DRO") that is in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, such DRO will continue in effect
after the Effective Time, unless such Class A Common LP otherwise notifies
the Partnership within 90 days prior to the Effective Time. The DRO of any
existing holder who does not elect to receive any Class A Common Units shall
terminate as of the Effective Time. In addition, each Class A Common LP
shall be given the reasonable opportunity, prior to the Effective Time,
to elect (at its option) either (x) to enter into a new DRO with respect
to its Class A Common Units or (y) to enter into a guarantee or indemnity
("Guaranty Agreement") on a "bottom dollar" basis (whether individually or as
part of a group of partners) of either recourse indebtedness of the
Partnership or non-recourse indebtedness of the Partnership secured by assets
that initially shall have a gross fair market value equal to at least two and
one half (2.5) times the aggregate amount of all "bottom dollar guarantees"
of such indebtedness by other partners and at least 120% of the principal
amount of indebtedness secured by such assets.  Each Guaranty Agreement
shall remain in effect for the time that the debt guaranteed thereunder
remains outstanding.  In the event that such debt is repaid or refinanced
within four years of the closing of the Partnership Merger, the Partnership
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to offer to the Unit holders who
executed such Guaranty Agreements the opportunity to enter into replacement
Guaranty Agreements on comparable terms and conditions for the balance of the
four-year period following the closing of the Partnership Merger. Neither the
Partnership nor the General Partner nor its affiliates shall have any
liability because a Guaranty Agreement is not effective to cause a Unit
holder executing such Guaranty Agreement to be considered to be allocated
debt for purposes of computing its basis in its Units for federal income tax
purposes. If and to the extent that debt is required to be guaranteed by the
General Partner and/or its affiliates, the Guaranty Agreement shall include
an undertaking to indemnify such guarantors on the same terms as the
guaranteeing Unit holder would have had direct liability to the lender under
such Guaranty Agreement.  The General Partner shall provide within a
reasonable time after request such information as a Limited Partner may
reasonably request regarding the nature and amount of debt allocated to such
Partner for federal income tax purposes.

  



  

Section 8.10. _Revision of Carried Interest to Promote Partner and Fees and
Other Compensation to General Partner and Affiliates_.

  



  

Section 5.1A(2) sets out a methodology under which the Promote Partner is
entitled to a "carried interest" with respect to holders of Class A Common
Units. Section 6.1 sets forth allocation provisions consistent therewith.
Section 7.4C sets forth certain fees, expense reimbursements and other
compensation ("Fees and Other Compensation") which may be paid to the General
Partner and its Affiliates. The parties acknowledge that Affiliates
of Clarion and LBHI will seek to raise equity capital from investors that
will be invested, directly or indirectly, in part, in Gables Trust or its
assets. If any such investor (other than an Excluded Investor) that invests
and/or commits to invest, within the one-year period commencing at the
Effective Time, an amount equal to exactly $50 million (without regard to
notional interest ) in such syndication (or if no such investor invests
and/or commits to invest exactly $50 million, the investor making the next
highest amount of investment or commitment in excess of $50 million but not
in excess of $100 million, if any, in each case without regard to notional
interest) obtains a Total

  



  

42   

     
   

  



  

Economic Package (without regard to notional interest) more favorable to such
investor than the Total Economic Package provided to the holders of Class A
Common Units under this Agreement, the General Partner, without the consent
of the Limited Partners, shall unilaterally amend this Agreement to provide
the Class A Common Units with a Total Economic Package determined by the
General Partner which **,** per dollar of investment, is substantially
equivalent to (but not necessarily the same as) the Total Economic Package
provided to such syndication investor. In this regard, the General Partner
may conclusively rely upon (and shall not be subject to any claims or causes
of action of any kind based on such reliance) any third-party independent
valuation opinion of the respective Total Economic Packages provided to the
Class A Common Units (as same may be amended) and such syndication investor.
 The General Partner may, in its discretion, elect to offer a Total Economic
Package (the "Alternative Total Economic Package") to the Class A Common LPs
if, in the judgment of the General Partner, it is unclear whether the
Alternative Total Economic Package is more favorable than the Total Economic
Package provided to Class A Common LPs at such time (the "Existing Total
Economic Package"). In such case, the General Partner shall recommend to the
Class A Common LPs either the Existing Total Economic Package or the
Alternative Total Economic Package. Upon the affirmative vote of sixty-six
and two-thirds percent (66 2/3%) of the Class A Common LPs for either the
Existing Total Economic Package or the Alternative Total Economic Package,
the General Partner shall unilaterally amend this Agreement to provide the
Class A Common LPs with such Total Economic Package. If the affirmative vote
of sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66 2/3%) of the Class A Common LPs for
either the Existing Total Economic Package or the Alternative Total Economic
Package is not obtained within 90 days after the recommendation of a Total
Economic Package by the General Partner, the Total Economic
Package recommended by the General Partner shall be the Total Economic
Package provided to the Class A Common LPs, and the General Partner shall
unilaterally amend this Agreement, if necessary, so to provide.  As used
herein, "Total Economic Package" means all of the economic rights, benefits
and obligations of a Person, including without limitation, the right to
distributions and allocations, the obligation to pay "carried interest," the
entitlement to any "clawback" payment or similar arrangement, fees and other
compensation set forth in Section 7.4.C and similar amounts and all costs
borne directly or indirectly by such Person, but excluding (i) the
consideration paid by the applicable investor and the value of any other
assets owned by the Parent in addition to its indirect interest in
the Partnership and (ii) any decision-making, veto or control rights.
In determining the Total Economic Package, the General Partner shall (i)
make such adjustments in good faith as are necessary to take into account the
fact that the investors will make their investment in the Partnership, and
may pay fees and other amounts, indirectly through one or more intermediary
entities so that the Total Economic Package received by the Class A Common
LPs shall be substantially equivalent to that received by the applicable
third party investors and (ii) make determinations of economic rights,
benefits and obligations based on the estimated value of the Partnerships
assets and liabilities as of the Effective Time. As used herein, an
"Excluded Investor" means any employee (or group of employees) of Clarion,
LBHI and their Affiliates and any fund organized, arranged, managed or
controlled by Clarion, LBHI or their Affiliates solely for the benefit
of their respective employees. For purposes of this paragraph, "notional
interest" refers to an interest equivalent or similar amount that is paid by
an investor to reflect the carrying cost of an investment (between the
Effective Time and the date on which the capital contribution is actually
made) and which is computed in a manner similar to the computation of
interest.

Section 10.3. _Tax Matters Partner_

  



  

### A. The General Partner shall be the "tax matters partner" of the

the Code, upon receipt of notice from the IRS of the beginning of an
administrative proceeding with respect to the Partnership, the tax matters
partner shall furnish the IRS with the name, address, taxpayer identification
number, and profit interest of each of the Limited Partners and the

### 

  

### B. The tax matters partner is authorized, but not required,

  

### 

  

#### (1) to enter into any settlement with the IRS with respect to any
administrative or judicial proceedings for the adjustment of Partnership
items required to be taken into account by a Partner for income tax purposes
(such administrative proceedings being referred to as a " _tax audit_ " and
such judicial proceedings being referred to as " _judicial review_ "), and in

such agreement shall bind all Partners, except that such settlement agreement
shall not bind any Partner (i) who (within the time prescribed pursuant to
the Code and Regulations) files a statement with the IRS providing that the
tax matters partner shall not have the authority to enter into a settlement
agreement on behalf of such Partner or (ii) who is a " _notice partner_ " (as
defined in Section 6231(a)(8) of the Code) or a member of a " _notice group_
" (as defined in Section 6223(b)(2) of the Code);

  

#### 

  

#### (2) in the event that a notice of a final administrative adjustment at
the Partnership level of any item required to be taken into account by a
Partner for tax purposes (a " _final adjustment_ ") is mailed to the tax
matters partner, to seek judicial review of such final adjustment, including
the filing of a petition for readjustment with the Tax Court or the filing of

Section 10.4. _Withholding_

federal, state, local, or foreign taxes that the General Partner determines
that the Partnership is required to withhold or pay with respect to any
amount distributable or allocable to such Limited Partner pursuant to
this Agreement, including, without limitation, any taxes required to be
withheld or paid by the Partnership pursuant to Sections 1441, 1442, 1445, or
1446 of the Code. Any amount paid on behalf of or with respect to a Limited
Partner shall constitute a loan by the Partnership to such Limited Partner,
which loan shall be repaid by such Limited Partner within fifteen (15) days
after notice from the General Partner that such payment must be made unless
(i) the Partnership withholds such payment from a distribution which would
otherwise be made to the Limited Partner or (ii) the General Partner
determines, in its sole and absolute discretion, that such payment may be
satisfied out of the available funds of the Partnership which would, but for
such payment, be distributed to the Limited Partner. Any amounts withheld
pursuant to the foregoing clauses (i) or (ii) shall be treated as having
been distributed to such Limited Partner.  Each Limited Partner hereby
unconditionally and irrevocably grants to the Partnership a security

  



  

46   

     
   

  



  

interest in such Limited Partners Partnership Interest to secure
such Limited Partners obligation to pay to the Partnership any amounts
required to be paid pursuant to this Section 10.4.  In the event that a
Limited Partner fails to pay any amounts owed to the Partnership pursuant to
this Section 10.4 when due, the General Partner may, in its sole and absolute
discretion, elect to make the payment to the Partnership on behalf of such
defaulting Limited Partner, and in such event shall be deemed to have loaned
such amount to such defaulting Limited Partner and shall succeed to all
rights and remedies of the Partnership as against such defaulting Limited
Partner. Without limitation, in such event the General Partner shall have the
right to receive distributions that would otherwise be distributable to such
defaulting Limited Partner until such time as such loan, together with all
interest thereon, has been paid in full, and any such distributions so
received by the General Partner shall be treated as having been distributed
to the defaulting Limited Partner and immediately paid by the defaulting
Limited Partner to the General Partner in repayment of such loan. Any amounts
payable by a Limited Partner hereunder shall bear interest at the lesser of
(A) the greater of (i) the base rate on corporate loans at large United
States money center commercial banks, as published from time to time in the
_Wall Street Journal_ , plus four (4) percentage points, and (ii)
the Partnerships current cost of financing, or (B) the maximum lawful rate
of interest on such obligation, such interest to accrue from the date such
amount is due ( _i.e_., fifteen (15) days after demand) until such amount is
paid in full. Each Limited Partner shall take such actions as the Partnership
or the General Partner shall request in order to perfect or enforce the
security interest created hereunder.

Partnership Unit.

  

### 

  

### D. No transfer by a Limited Partner of its Partnership Units may be made

_established securities market_ " or a " _secondary market_ (or the
substantial equivalent thereof)" with the meaning of Section 7704 of the
Code.

48   

     
   

  



  

### Substituted Limited Partner, which consent may be given or withheld by
the General Partner in its sole and absolute discretion. The General

become a Substituted Limited Partner shall not give rise to any cause of
action against the Partnership or any Partner.

  

### 

  

### B. A transferee who has been admitted as a Substituted Limited Partner in
accordance with this Article 11 shall have all the rights and powers and be
subject to all the restrictions and liabilities of a Limited Partner under

vote (such Partnership Units being deemed to have been voted on such matter
in the same proportion as all other Partnership Units held by Limited
Partners are voted). In the event any such transferee desires to make a
further assignment of any such Partnership Units, such transferee shall be
subject to all the provisions of this Article 11 to the same extent and in
the same manner as any Limited Partner desiring to make an assignment
of Partnership Units.

all other items attributable to such interest for such Partnership Year shall
be divided and allocated between the transferor Partner and the transferee
Partner by taking into account their varying interests during the
Partnerships year in accordance with Section 706(d) of the Code, using the
interim closing of the books method. Solely for purposes of making such
allocations, each of such items for the calendar month in which the transfer
or assignment occurs shall be allocated to the transferee Partner, and none
of such items for the calendar month in which a redemption occurs shall
be allocated to the Redeeming Partner. All distributions of Available Cash

Section 13.2. _Winding Up_

  



  

### A. Upon the occurrence of a Liquidating Event, the Partnership shall
continue solely for the purposes of winding up its affairs in an orderly
manner, liquidating its assets, and satisfying the claims of its creditors
and Partners. No Partner shall take any action that is inconsistent with, or
not necessary to or appropriate for, the winding up of the Partnerships
business and affairs.  The General Partner or, in the event there is no
remaining General Partner, any Person elected by a majority in interest of
the Limited Partners (the General Partner or such other Person being referred
to herein as the " _Liquidator_ "), shall be responsible for overseeing the
winding up and dissolution of the Partnership and shall take full account of
the Partnerships liabilities and property and the Partnership property shall
be liquidated as promptly as is consistent with obtaining the fair value
thereof, and the proceeds therefrom (which may, to the extent determined by
the General Partner, include shares of stock in the General Partner) shall be
applied and distributed in the following order:

  

### 

  

#### (1) First, to the payment and discharge of all of the Partnerships
debts and liabilities to creditors other than the Partners;

  

#### 

  

#### (2) Second, to the payment and discharge of all of the Partnerships
debts and liabilities to the other Partners;

  

#### 

  

#### (3) Third, to the payment and discharge of all of the Partnerships
debts and liabilities to the General Partner and Gables Trust; and

  

#### 

  

#### (4) Fourth, to the Partners holding Series C-1 Preferred Units and
Series D Preferred Units, each as a class, with respect to each such class,
pro rata, in the ratio which the Series C-1 Liquidation Preference or the
Series D Liquidation Preference, as applicable, bears to each other (each as
defined below), and within each such class, pro rata, in proportion to the
ratio in which each such Partner holds Series C-1 Preferred

  



  

52   

     
   

  



  

#### Units or Series D Preferred Units, as the case may be. The Series C-1
Liquidation Preference shall mean an aggregate amount equal to the aggregate
liquidation preference with respect to the Gables Trust Series C-1 Preferred
Shares plus any accrued but unpaid dividends with respect to such shares (the
" _Series C-1 Liquidation Preference_") and the Series D Liquidation
Preference shall mean an aggregate amount equal to the aggregate liquidation
preference with respect to the Gables Trust Series D Preferred Shares plus
any accrued but unpaid dividends with respect to such shares (the " _Series
D Liquidation Preference_");

  

#### 

  

#### (5) Fifth, to the Partners holding Series Z Preferred Units, pro rata,

periods.

  

#### 

  

The General Partner shall not receive any additional compensation for any
services performed pursuant to this Article 13.

  



  

### B. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 13.2.A hereof which require
liquidation of the assets of the Partnership, but subject to the order of
priorities set forth therein, if prior to or upon dissolution of the
Partnership the Liquidator determines that an immediate sale of part or all
of the Partnerships assets would be impractical or would cause undue loss to
the Partners, the Liquidator may, in its sole and absolute discretion, defer
for a reasonable time the liquidation of any assets except those necessary to
satisfy liabilities of the Partnership (including to those Partners as
creditors) and/or distribute to the Partners, in lieu of cash, as tenants in
common and in accordance with the provisions of Section 13.2.A hereof,
undivided interests in such Partnership assets as the Liquidator deems not
suitable for liquidation. Any such distributions in kind shall be made only
if, in the good faith judgment of the Liquidator, such distributions in kind
are in the best interest of the Partners, and shall be subject to
such conditions relating to the disposition and management of such properties
as the Liquidator deems reasonable and equitable and to any agreements
governing the operation of such properties at such time.  The Liquidator
shall determine the fair market value of any property distributed in kind
using such reasonable method of valuation as it may adopt.

  

### 

  

### C. In the discretion of the Liquidator, a pro rata portion of the
distributions that would otherwise be made to the General Partner and Limited
Partners pursuant to this Article 13 may be:

  

### 

  

#### (1) distributed to a trust established for the benefit of the General
Partner and Limited Partners for the purposes of liquidating Partnership
assets, collecting amounts owed to the Partnership, and paying any contingent
or unforeseen liabilities or obligations of the Partnership or the General
Partner arising out of or in connection with the Partnership. The assets of
any such trust shall be distributed to the General Partner and Limited
Partners from time to time, in the reasonable discretion of the Liquidator,
in

  



  

53   

     
   

  



  

#### the same proportions as the amount distributed to such trust by the
Partnership would otherwise have been distributed to the General Partner and
Limited Partners pursuant to this Agreement; or

  

#### 

  

#### (2) withheld or escrowed to provide a reasonable reserve for Partnership
liabilities (contingent or otherwise) and to reflect the unrealized portion
of any installment obligations owed to the Partnership, _provided that_
such withheld or escrowed amounts shall be distributed to the General Partner
and Limited Partners in the manner and order of priority set forth in Section
13.2.A as soon as practicable.

  

#### 

  

Section 13.3. _Compliance with Timing Requirements of Regulations_

  



  

In the event the Partnership is " _liquidated_ " within the meaning of
Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(g), distributions shall be made
pursuant to this Article 13 to the General Partner and Limited Partners who
have positive Capital Accounts in compliance with Regulations Section
1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(b)(2). If the General Partner has a deficit balance in its
Capital Account (after giving effect to all contributions, distributions and
allocations for all taxable years, including the year during which
such liquidation occurs), such Partner shall contribute to the capital of
the Partnership the amount necessary to restore such deficit balance to zero
in compliance with Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(b)(3). If
any Limited Partner enters into a DRO, such agreement shall be incorporated
herein for all purposes of this Agreement.

  



  

Section 13.4. _Rights of Limited Partners_

  



  

Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, each Limited Partner shall
look solely to the assets of the Partnership for the return of its Capital
Contributions and shall have no right or power to demand or receive property
other than cash from the Partnership. Except as otherwise provided in
this Agreement, no Limited Partner shall have priority over any other Partner
as to the return of its Capital Contributions, distributions, or allocations.

  



  

Section 13.5. _Notice of Dissolution_

  



  

In the event a Liquidating Event occurs or an event occurs that would, but
for the provisions of an election or objection by one or more Partners
pursuant to Section 13.1, result in a dissolution of the Partnership, the
General Partner shall, within thirty (30) days thereafter, provide written
notice thereof to each of the Partners.

  



  

Section 13.6. _Termination of Partnership and Cancellation of Certificate of
Limited Partnership_

  



  

Upon the completion of the liquidation of the Partnership cash and property
as provided in Section 13.2 hereof, the Partnership shall be terminated, a
certificate of cancellation shall be filed, and all qualifications of the
Partnership as a foreign limited partnership in jurisdictions other than the
State of Delaware shall be canceled and such other actions as may be
necessary to terminate the Partnership shall be taken.

  



  

54   

     
   

  



  

Section 13.7. _Reasonable Time for Winding-Up_

  



  

A reasonable time shall be allowed for the orderly winding-up of the business
and affairs of the Partnership and the liquidation of its assets pursuant to
Section 13.2 hereof, in order to minimize any losses otherwise attendant upon
such winding-up, and the provisions of this Agreement shall remain in effect
between the Partners during the period of liquidation.

  



  

Section 13.8. _Waiver of Partition_

  



  

Each Partner hereby waives any right to partition of the Partnership
property.

Units). Following such proposal, the General Partner shall submit any
proposed amendment to the Limited Partners. The General Partner shall seek the

appropriate. For purposes of obtaining a written vote, the General Partner
may require a response within a reasonable specified time, but not less than
fifteen (15) days, and failure to respond in such time period shall
constitute a vote which is consistent with the General
Partners recommendation with respect to the proposal.  Except as provided
in Section 7.3.A, 7.3.B, 13.1.C, 14.1.B, 14.1.C or 14.1.D, a proposed
amendment shall be adopted and be effective as an amendment hereto if it is
approved by the General Partner and it receives the Consent of Partners

(including Limited Partner Interests held by the General Partner and Gables
Trust, but not including any interest on account of the Preferred Units).

  

### 

  

### B. Notwithstanding Section 14.1.A, the General Partner shall have the

right or power granted to the General Partner or any Affiliate of the General
Partner for the benefit of the Limited Partners;

  

#### 

  

#### (2) to reflect the admission, substitution, termination, or withdrawal
of Partners in accordance with this Agreement;

Section 4.2.B(5);

  



  

55      
   



  

#### (4) to reflect a change that is of an inconsequential nature and is not
reasonably likely to adversely affect the rights and obligations of Limited
Partners in any material respect, or to cure any ambiguity, correct or
supplement any provision in this Agreement not inconsistent with law or with
other provisions, or make other changes with respect to matters arising under
this Agreement that will not be inconsistent with law or with the provisions
of this Agreement; and

  

#### 

  

#### (5) to satisfy any requirements, conditions, or guidelines contained in
any order, directive, opinion, ruling or regulation of a federal or state
agency or contained in federal or state law.

  

#### 

  

The General Partner shall provide notice to the Limited Partners when any
action under this Section 14.1.B is taken.

  



  

### C. Notwithstanding Section 14.1.A and 14.1.B hereof, this Agreement shall
not be amended without the Consent of each Partner whose rights and
obligations are reasonably likely to be adversely affected if such amendment
would (i) convert a Limited Partners interest in the Partnership into a
general partner interest, (ii) modify the limited liability of a Limited
Partner in a manner adverse to such Limited Partner, (iii) alter rights of
the Partner to receive distributions pursuant to Article 5 or Article 13, the

Common LP pursuant to Section 8.10, (iv) alter or modify Section 8.6, and the
related definitions, in a manner adverse to such Partner, or (v) amend this
Section 14.1.C. Further, no amendment may alter the restrictions on the
General Partners authority set forth in Section 7.3 without the Consent
specified in that section.

  

### 

  

### D. Notwithstanding Section 14.1.A or Section 14.1.B hereof, the General
Partner shall not amend Sections 4.2, 6.1.C, 7.5, 7.6, 7.7, 8.7, 8.8, 8.9,

shall be called upon the receipt by the General Partner of a written request
by Limited Partners holding twenty percent (20%) or more of the Partnership
Interests (not including any interest on account of the Preferred Units). The
call shall state the nature of the business to be transacted. Notice of
any such meeting shall be given to all Partners not less than seven (7) days
nor more than thirty (30) days prior to the date of such meeting. Partners
may vote in person or by proxy at such meeting. Whenever the vote or Consent
of the Partners is permitted or required under this Agreement, such vote or
Consent may be given at a meeting of the Partners or may be given
in accordance with the procedure prescribed in Section 14.1.A hereof. Except
as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, (i) the Consent of holders
of a majority of the Percentage Interests held by Limited Partners (including
Limited Partnership Interests held by Gables Trust and the General Partner),
voting as a single class, shall control.

  



  

56   

     
   

  



  

### B. Any action required or permitted to be taken at a meeting of the
Partners may be taken without a meeting if a written consent setting forth
the action so taken is signed by 75% of the Percentage Interests of the
Partners (or such other percentage as is expressly required by this
Agreement). Such consent may be in one instrument or in several instruments,
and shall have the same force and effect as a vote of 75% of the Percentage
Interests of the Partners (or such other percentage as is expressly required
by this Agreement).  Such consent shall be filed with the General Partner. An
action so taken shall be deemed to have been taken at a meeting held on the
effective date so certified.

  

### 

  

### C. Each Limited Partner may authorize any Person or Persons to act for
him by proxy on all matters in which a Limited Partner is entitled to
participate, including waiving notice of any meeting, or voting or
participating at a meeting. Every proxy must be signed by the Limited Partner
or his attorney-in-fact. No proxy shall be valid after the expiration of
eleven (11) months from the date thereof unless otherwise provided in the
proxy.  Every proxy shall be revocable at the pleasure of the Limited
Partner executing it, such revocation to be effective upon the Partnerships
receipt of or written notice such revocation from the Limited Partner
executing such proxy.

  

### 

  

### D. Each meeting of the Partners shall be conducted by the General Partner
or such other Person as the General Partner may appoint pursuant to such
rules for the conduct of the meeting as the General Partner or such other
Person deems appropriate.

  

### 

  

### E. The Series C-1 Preferred Units do not have any voting rights with
respect to the Partnership, except that any action which would alter the
economic rights or preferences of the Series C-1 Preferred Units in a manner
which, if done with respect to the Gables Trust Series C-1 Preferred Shares
would require a separate class vote of such shares, shall only be taken if
such separate class of shares approves of such action by a vote taken in
accordance with applicable law.

  

### 

  

### F. The Series D Preferred Units do not have any voting rights with
respect to the Partnership, except that any action which would alter the
economic rights or preferences of the Series D Preferred Units in a manner
which, if done with respect to the Gables Trust Series D Preferred Shares
would require a separate class vote of such shares, shall only be taken if
such separate class of shares approves of such action by a vote taken in
accordance with applicable law.

  

### 

  

### G. The Series Z Preferred Units do not have any voting rights with
respect to the Partnership, except that any action which would alter the
economic rights or preferences of the Series Z Preferred Units in a manner
which, if done with respect to the Gables Trust Series Z Preferred Shares
would require a separate class vote of such shares, shall only be taken if
such separate class of shares approves of such action by a vote taken in
accordance with applicable law.

  

### 

  

### H. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, neither the
holders of the Class A Common Units nor the holders of Class B Common Units
shall be entitled to vote as a separate class on any matter or have a right
to consent with respect to any matter requiring the vote or consent of the
Partners under this Agreement, including with respect to a merger or sale of
all or substantially all of the assets of the Partnership, unless the
resolution of such matter is reasonably likely to have a material adverse
effect on the rights and obligations of such holders as a class.  Nothing
contained in the "unless" clause of the preceding sentence shall be deemed to
restrict or limit in any way the exercise of any rights granted to the
General Partner, Gables Trust or any of their Affiliates under any provision
of this Agreement and, further, the provisions of such clause shall not apply
to the exercise by the General Partner, Gables Trust, or any of
their Affiliates of their right to effect any transaction pursuant to Section
8.7.

EXHIBIT B

  



  

CAPITAL ACCOUNT MAINTENANCE

  



  

1. _Capital Accounts of the Partners_

  



  

A. The Partnership shall maintain for each Partner a separate Capital Account
in accordance with the rules of Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv). Such
Capital Account shall be increased by (i) the amount of all Capital
Contributions and any other deemed contributions made by such Partner to the
Partnership pursuant to this Agreement and (ii) all items of Partnership
income and gain (including income and gain exempt from tax) computed in
accordance with Section 1.B hereof and allocated to such Partner pursuant to
Section 6.1.A of the Agreement and _Exhibit C_ hereof, and decreased by (x)
the amount of cash or Agreed Value of all actual and deemed distributions of
cash or property made to such Partner pursuant to this Agreement and (y) all
items of Partnership deduction and loss computed in accordance with Section
1.B hereof and allocated to such Partner pursuant to Section 6.1.B of the
Agreement and _Exhibit C_ hereof.

  



  

B. For purposes of computing the amount of any item of income, gain,
deduction or loss to be reflected in the Partners Capital Accounts, unless
otherwise specified in this Agreement, the determination, recognition and
classification of any such item shall be the same as its determination,
recognition and classification for federal income tax purposes determined in
accordance with Section 703(a) of the Code (for this purpose all items of
income, gain, loss or deduction required to be stated separately pursuant to
Section 703(a)(1) of the Code shall be included in taxable income or loss),
with the following adjustments:

  



  

(1) Except as otherwise provided in Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m),
the computation of all items of income, gain, loss and deduction shall be
made without regard to any election under Section 754 of the Code which may
be made by the Partnership, provided that the amounts of any adjustments to
the adjusted bases of the assets of the Partnership made pursuant to Section
734 of the Code as a result of the distribution of property by the
Partnership to a Partner (to the extent that such adjustments have not
previously been reflected in the Partners Capital Accounts) shall be
reflected in the Capital Accounts of the Partners in the manner and subject
to the limitations prescribed in Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m)(4).

  



  

(2) The computation of all items of income, gain, and deduction shall be made
without regard to the fact that items described in Sections 705(a)(1)(B)
or 705(a)(2)(B) of the Code are not includable gross income or are
neither currently deductible nor capitalized for federal income tax purposes.

  



  

(3) Any income, gain or loss attributable to the taxable disposition of any
Partnership property shall be determined as if the adjusted basis of such
property as of such date of disposition were equal in amount to the
Partnerships Carrying Value with respect to such property as of such date.

  



  

1   

     
   

  



  

(4) In lieu of the depreciation, amortization, and other cost recovery
deductions taken into account in computing such taxable income or loss, there
shall be taken into account Depreciation for such fiscal year.

  



  

(5) In the event the Carrying Value of any Partnership Asset is adjusted
pursuant to Section 1.D hereof, the amount of any such adjustment shall be
taken into account as gain or loss from the disposition of such asset.

  



  

(6) Any items specifically allocated under Section 2 of _Exhibit C_ hereof
shall not be taken into account.

  



  

C. A transferee (including an Assignee) of a Partnership Unit shall succeed
to a pro rata portion of the Capital Account of the transferor.

  



       

D.

    |  

(1) Consistent with the provisions of  Regulations Section
1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(f), and as provided in Section 1.D(2),  the Carrying Value
of all Partnership assets shall be adjusted upward or  downward to reflect
any Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss attributable to  such Partnership
property, as of the times of the adjustments provided in  Section 1.D(2)
hereof, as if such Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss had been  recognized on
an actual sale of each such property and allocated pursuant to  Section 6.1
of the Agreement.

    
---|--- 
   



  

(2) Such adjustments shall be made as of the following times: (a) immediately
prior to the acquisition of an additional interest in the Partnership by any
new or existing Partner in exchange for more than a de minimis Capital
Contribution; (b) immediately prior to the distribution by the Partnership to
a Partner of more than a de minimis amount of property as consideration for
an interest in the Partnership; and (c) immediately prior to the liquidation
of the Partnership within the meaning of Regulations Section
1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(g), _provided_ , _however_ , that adjustments pursuant to
clauses (a) and (b) above shall be made only if the General Partner
determines that such adjustments are necessary or appropriate to reflect the
relative economic interests of the Partners in the Partnership.

  



  

(3) In accordance with Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(e), the Carrying
Value of Partnership assets distributed in kind shall be adjusted upward or
downward to reflect any Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss attributable to
such Partnership property, as of the time any such asset is distributed.

  



  

(4) In determining Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss for purposes of this
_Exhibit B_, the aggregate cash amount and fair market value of all
Partnership assets (including cash or cash equivalents) shall be determined
by the General Partner using such reasonable method of valuation as it may
adopt, or in the case of a liquidating distribution pursuant to Article 13 of
the Agreement, shall be determined and allocated by the

  



  

2   

     
   

  



  

Liquidator using such reasonable methods of valuation as it may adopt. The
General Partner, or the Liquidator, as the case may be, shall allocate such
aggregate value among the assets of the Partnership (in such manner as it
determines in its sole and absolute discretion to arrive at a fair market
value for individual properties).

  



  

E. The provisions of this Agreement (including this _Exhibit B_ and
other Exhibits to this Agreement) relating to the maintenance of Capital
Accounts are intended to comply with Regulations Section 1.704-1(b), and
shall be interpreted and applied in a manner consistent with such
Regulations. In the event the General Partner shall determine that it is
prudent to modify (i) the manner in which the Capital Accounts, or any debits
or credits thereto (including, without limitation, debits or credits relating
to liabilities which are secured by contributed or distributed property or
which are assumed by the Partnership, the General Partner, or the Limited
Partners) are computed or (ii) the manner in which items are allocated among
the Partners for federal income tax purposes in order to comply with such
Regulations or to comply with Section 704(c) of the Code, the General Partner
may make such modification without regard to Article 14 of the Agreement,
provided that it is not reasonably likely to have a material effect on the
amounts distributable to any Person pursuant to Article 13 of the Agreement
upon the dissolution of the Partnership. The General Partner also shall (i)
make any adjustments that are necessary or appropriate to maintain equality
between the Capital Accounts of the partners and the amount of Partnership
capital reflected on the Partnerships balance sheet, as computed for book
purposes, in accordance with Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(q), and
(ii) make any appropriate modifications in the event unanticipated events
might otherwise cause this Agreement not to comply with Regulations Section
1.704-1(b). In addition, the General Partner may adopt and employ such
methods and procedures for (i) the maintenance of book and tax capital
accounts, (ii) the determination and allocation of adjustments under Sections
704(c), 734 and 743 of the Code, (iii) the determination of Net Income, Net
Loss, taxable income, taxable loss and items thereof under this Agreement and
pursuant to the Code, (iv) the adoption of reasonable conventions and methods
for the valuation of assets and the determination of tax basis, (v) the
allocation of asset value and tax basis, and (vi) conventions for the
determination of cost recovery, depreciation and amortization deductions, as
it determines in its sole discretion are necessary or appropriate to execute
the provisions of this Agreement and to comply with federal and state tax
laws.

  



  

2. _No Interest_

  



  

No interest shall be paid by the Partnership on Capital Contributions or on
balances in Partners Capital Accounts.

  



  

3. _No Withdrawal_

  



  

No Partner shall be entitled to withdraw any part of his Capital Contribution
or his Capital Account or to receive any distribution from the Partnership,
except as provided in Articles 4, 5, 7 and 13 of the Agreement.

EXHIBIT C

  



  

SPECIAL ALLOCATION RULES

  



  

1. _Special Allocation Rules_

  



  

Notwithstanding any other provision of the Agreement or this _Exhibit C_,
the following special allocations shall be made in the following order:

  



  

A. _Minimum Gain Chargeback_. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 6.1
of the Agreement or any other provisions of this _Exhibit C_, if there is a
net decrease in Partnership Minimum Gain during any Partnership taxable year,
each Partner shall be specially allocated items of Partnership income and
gain for such year (and, if necessary, subsequent years) in an amount equal
to such Partners share of the net decrease in Partnership Minimum Gain, as
determined under Regulations Section 1.704-2(g). Allocations pursuant to the
previous sentence shall be made in proportion to the respective amounts
required to be allocated to each Partner pursuant thereto. The items to be
so allocated shall be determined in accordance with Regulations Section
1.704-2(f)(6). This Section 1.A is intended to comply with the minimum gain
chargeback requirements in Regulations Section 1.704-2(f) and shall be
interpreted consistently therewith. Solely for purposes of this Section 1.A,
each Partners Adjusted Capital Account Deficit after any allocations made
under this Section 1.A shall be determined prior to any other allocations
pursuant to Section 6.1 during such Partnership taxable year.

  



  

B. _Partner Minimum Gain Chargeback_.  Notwithstanding any other provision
of Section 6.1 of this Agreement or any other provisions of this _Exhibit C_
(except Section 1.A hereof), if there is a net decrease in Partner Minimum
Gain attributable to a Partner Nonrecourse Debt during any Partnership
taxable year, each Partner who has a share of the Partner Minimum Gain
attributable to such Partner Nonrecourse Debt, determined in accordance with
Regulations Section 1.702-2(i)(5), shall be specially allocated items of
Partnership income and gain for such year (and, if necessary, subsequent
years) in an amount equal to such Partners share of the net decrease in
Partner Minimum Gain attributable to such Partner Nonrecourse Debt,
determined in accordance with Regulations Section 1.704-2(i)(5). Allocations
pursuant to the previous sentence shall be made in proportion to the
respective amounts required to be allocated to each Partner pursuant thereto.
The items to be so allocated shall be determined in accordance with
Regulations Section 1.704-2(i)(4). This Section 1.B is intended to comply
with the minimum gain chargeback requirement in such Section of the
Regulations and shall be interpreted consistently therewith. Solely for
purposes of this Section 1.B, each Partners Adjusted Capital Account Deficit
shall be determined prior to any other allocations pursuant to Section 6.1 of
the Agreement or this Exhibit with respect to such Partnership taxable year,
other than allocations pursuant to Section 1.A hereof.

  



  

C. _Qualified Income Offset_. In the event any Partner unexpectedly receives
any adjustments, allocations or distributions described in Regulations
Sections 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(4), 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(5), or
1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(6), and after giving effect to the allocations required
under Sections 1.A and 1.B hereof, such Partner has an Adjusted Capital
Account Deficit, items of Partnership income and gain (consisting of a pro
rata portion of each item of Partnership income, including gross income and
gain for the Partnership taxable year)

  



  

1   

     
   

  



  

shall be specifically allocated to such Partner in an amount and
manner sufficient to eliminate, to the extent required by the Regulations,
its Adjusted Capital Account Deficit created by such adjustments, allocations
or distributions as quickly as possible.

  



  

D. _Nonrecourse Deductions_. Nonrecourse Deductions for any Partnership
taxable year shall be allocated to the Partners in accordance with their
respective Percentage Interests.  If the General Partner determines in its
good faith discretion that the Partnerships Nonrecourse Deductions must be
allocated in a different ratio to satisfy the safe harbor requirements of the
Regulations promulgated under Section 704(b) of the Code, the General Partner
is authorized, upon notice to the Limited Partners, to revise the prescribed
ratio to the numerically closest ratio for such Partnership taxable year
which would satisfy such requirements.

  



  

E. _Partner Nonrecourse Deductions_. Any Partner Nonrecourse Deductions for
any Partnership taxable year shall be specially allocated to the Partner who
bears the economic risk of loss with respect to the Partner Nonrecourse Debt
to which such Partner Nonrecourse Deductions are attributable in accordance
with Regulations Section 1.704-2(i).

  



  

F. _Code Section 754 Adjustments_. To the extent an adjustment to the
adjusted tax basis of any Partnership asset pursuant to Section 734(b) or
743(b) of the Code is required, pursuant to Regulations Section
1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m), to be taken into account in determining Capital
Accounts, the amount of such adjustment to the Capital Accounts shall be
treated as an item of gain (if the adjustment increases the basis of the
asset) or loss (if the adjustment decreases such basis), and such item of
gain or loss shall be specially allocated to the Partners in a
manner consistent with the manner in which their Capital Accounts are
required to be adjusted pursuant to such Section of the Regulations.

  



  

G. _Curative Allocations_. The allocations set forth in Section 1.A through
F of this _Exhibit C_ (the " _Regulatory Allocations_ ") are intended to
comply with certain requirements of the Regulations under section 704(b) of
the Code.  The Regulatory Allocations may not be consistent with the manner
in which the Partners intend to divide Partnership distributions.
Accordingly, the General Partner is hereby authorized to divide other
allocations of income, gain, deduction and loss among the Partners so as to
prevent the Regulatory Allocations from distorting the manner in which
Partnership distributions will be divided among the Partners. In general, the
Partners anticipate that this will be accomplished by specially allocating
other items of income, gain, loss and deduction among the Partners so that
the net amount of the Regulatory Allocations and such special allocations to
each person is zero. However, the General Partner will have discretion to
accomplish this result in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that no
allocation pursuant to this Section 1.G shall cause the Partnership to fail
to comply with the requirements of Regulations sections 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)
_(d)_ , -2(e) or -2(i).

  



  

H. _Certain Disproportionate Allocations_. In the event taxes are imposed
upon the Partnership by any state or local taxing authority in connection
with the ownership, operation, sale or disposition of any of the
Partnerships businesses or properties and the General Partner determines in
its reasonable discretion that such expenses are properly borne by the
Partners in a manner which is other than in proportion to their respective
Percentage Interests, then, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, items of deduction and loss in such fiscal year (and, to
the extent necessary, succeeding fiscal years) shall be specially allocated

  



  

2   

     
   

  



  

among the Partners in the same amount and ratio in which the General Partner
withholds distributions from Partners pursuant to the provisions of Section
10.4 in connection with such expenses.  This Section 1.H shall be effective
with respect to all fiscal years after the fiscal year ended December 31,
1999.

  



  

2. _Allocations for Tax Purposes_

  



  

A. Except as otherwise provided in this Section 2, for federal income tax
purposes, each item of income, gain, loss and deduction shall be allocated
among the Partners in the same manner as its correlative item of " _book_ "
income, gain, loss or deduction is allocated pursuant to Section 6.1 of the
Agreement and Section 1 of this _Exhibit C_.

  



  

B. In an attempt to eliminate Book-Tax Disparities attributable to a
Contributed Property or Adjusted Property, items of income, gain, loss, and
deduction shall be allocated for federal income tax purposes among the
Partners as follows:

  



       

(1)

    |  



    |  

(a)

    |  



    |  

In the case of a Contributed Property, such items  attributable thereto shall
be allocated among the Partners consistent with  the principles of Section
704(c) of the Code and the Regulations thereunder  to take into account the
variation between the Carrying Value of such  property and its adjusted basis
at the time of contribution; and

    
---|---|---|---|--- 
     



    |  



    |  



    |  



    |  



    
     



    |  



    |  

(b)

    |  



    |  

any item of Residual Gain or Residual Loss  attributable to a Contributed
Property shall be allocated among the Partners  in the same manner as its
correlative item of " _book_ " gain or loss is  allocated pursuant to Section
6.1 of the Agreement and Section 1 of this  _Exhibit C_.

    
     



    |  



    |  



    |  



    |  



    
     

(2)

    |  



    |  

(a)

    |  



    |  

In the case of an Adjusted Property, such items  shall

    
     



    |  



    |  



    |  



    |  



    
     



    |  



    |  



    |  



    |
