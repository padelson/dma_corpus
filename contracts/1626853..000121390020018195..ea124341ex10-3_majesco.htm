(" _TB Exec_ "), each a Delaware limited partnership (including its
respective Affiliates (as defined in the Merger Agreement) who are
permitted assignees hereunder) (each of the foregoing a " _Guarantor_ " and
collectively, the " _Guarantors_ "), is in favor of Majesco, a California
corporation (the " _Company_ "). Reference is hereby made to the Agreement
and Plan of Merger (as it may be amended, supplemented or otherwise modified
from time to time, the " _Merger Agreement_ "), dated as of the date hereof,
among the Company, Magic Intermediate, LLC, a Delaware limited liability
company (" _Parent_ "), and Magic Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware limited
liability company and a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent ("
_Merger Sub_ "). Capitalized terms used herein but not otherwise defined
shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Merger Agreement.

  



  

1\. _Limited Guaranty_. To induce the Company to enter into the Merger
Agreement, the Guarantors, in accordance with their respective Pro Rata
Percentages (as hereinafter defined), hereby expressly, absolutely,
irrevocably and unconditionally guarantee to the Company, subject to the terms
and conditions hereof, the due and punctual observance, performance and
discharge of payment of (a) the aggregate amount of the Parent Termination
Fee solely if and when any of the Parent Termination Fee is payable pursuant
to Section 9.5(c) of the Merger Agreement, (b) the expense reimbursement
obligations of Parent pursuant to Section 7.13(e)(ii) of the Merger Agreement
and (c) any amounts due by Parent pursuant to Section 9.5(d)(ii) (the Parent
Termination Fee described in clause (a) hereof and the obligations described
in clauses (b) and (c) hereof, collectively the " _Guaranteed Obligations_
"); _provided_ , that this Limited Guaranty will expire and will have no
further force or effect, and the Company will have no rights hereunder,
upon termination of the obligations and liabilities of the Guarantor
hereunder in accordance with Section 6 hereof. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Limited Guaranty, the maximum aggregate liability of the
Guarantors under this Limited Guaranty shall not exceed $42,563,701.75 (the "
_Maximum Amount_ "); it being agreed by Parent that this Limited Guaranty may
not be enforced against the Guarantors without giving effect to the Maximum
Amount. The Company (on behalf of its controlled Affiliates, directors and
officers) hereby agrees that (i) the Guarantors shall in no event
collectively be required to pay more than the Maximum Amount (or, in the case
of each Guarantor, its Pro Rata Percentage (as hereinafter defined) of the
Maximum Amount) or make any payment (other than payment of the Guaranteed
Obligations) pursuant to this Limited Guaranty (with it being understood and
agreed that, in circumstances where the Parent Termination Fee is due
and payable by Parent, Parent shall have no other payment obligations to the
Company, to the extent so provided in the Merger Agreement and subject to
Section 9.5(d)(ii) thereof, and this Limited Guaranty shall be construed
accordingly), (ii) that no Guarantor or any of its Guarantor Affiliates (as
hereinafter defined) shall have any obligation or liability to any Person
relating to, arising out of or in connection with, this Limited Guaranty
(other than for the Guaranteed Obligations), and (iii) this Limited
Guaranty may not be enforced against the Guarantors without giving effect to
these limitations (with it being understood and agreed that such limitations
are an integral part of each Guarantor executing and delivering this Limited
Guaranty and no Guarantor would have delivered this Limited Guaranty if such
limitations were not given full force and effect); _provided_ , that
notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the foregoing shall not limit
the Company's rights under the Equity Commitment Letter (subject to the
limitations set forth therein).

  



  

 _All payments hereunder shall be made in lawful money of the United States,
in immediately available funds. The Company may not bring a claim against
any Guarantor under or in respect of this Limited Guaranty unless and until
the Merger Agreement has been terminated in accordance with Article IX of the
Merger Agreement in the manner set forth therein. If Parent fails to pay all
or any portion of the Guaranteed Obligations when due under the Merger
Agreement, then the Guarantor 's liability to the Company hereunder in respect
of such applicable Guaranteed Obligations shall, at the Company's option,
become immediately due and payable, and the Company may at any time and from
time to time, at the Company's option, take any and all actions available
hereunder or under applicable law to collect the Guaranteed Obligations from
the Guarantor._

  



  

   

 



    

2\. _Terms of Limited Guaranty_.

  



  

(a) This Limited Guaranty is an absolute, unconditional, irrevocable and
continuing guaranty of performance and payment, not collection, and a
separate action or actions may be brought and prosecuted against any or all of
the Guarantors to enforce this Limited Guaranty up to an amount equal to the
Guaranteed Obligations, irrespective of whether any action is brought against
Parent or Merger Sub or whether Parent or Merger Sub are joined in any such
action or actions.

  



  

(b) Except as otherwise provided herein and without amending or limiting the
other provisions of this Limited Guaranty, the liability of the Guarantors
under this Limited Guaranty shall, to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable law, be absolute and unconditional irrespective of:

  



  

(i) the value, genuineness, regularity, illegality or enforceability of the
Merger Agreement, any financing commitment letters or any other agreement or
instrument referred to herein or in the Merger Agreement;

  



  

(ii) any change in the corporate existence, structure or ownership of Parent
or Merger Sub or any Guarantor or any other Person, or any insolvency,
bankruptcy, reorganization, moratorium or other similar proceeding affecting
Parent or Merger Sub or the Guarantors or any other Person or any of their
respective assets;

  



  

(iii) any waiver, amendment or modification of the Merger Agreement, the
Equity Commitment Letter or any financing commitment letters or any other
agreement evidencing, securing or otherwise executed in connection with any of
the Guaranteed Obligations, in each case, in accordance with its terms, or
change in the time, manner, place or terms of payment or performance, or any
change or extension of the time of payment or performance of, renewal or
alteration of, any Guaranteed Obligation, any escrow arrangement or
other security therefor, any liability incurred directly or indirectly in
respect thereof, or any agreement entered into by the Company or any of its
Affiliates, on the one hand, and Parent and/or Merger Sub or any of their
Affiliates, on the other hand, in connection therewith;

  



  

(iv) except as specified in Section 2(e), the existence of any claim, set off
or other right that any Guarantor may have at any time against Parent, Merger
Sub, the Company, or any of their Affiliates, whether in connection with any
Guaranteed Obligation or otherwise;

  



  

(v) the failure or delay on the part of the Company to assert any claim or
demand or to enforce any right or remedy against Parent or Merger Sub or any
Guarantor or any other Person;

  



  

(vi) the addition, substitution or release of any Person now or hereafter
liable with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations or otherwise interested in
the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, any financing
commitment letters, this Limited Guaranty or any related agreement or
document;

  



  

(vii) the adequacy of any other means the Company may have of obtaining
repayment of any of the Guaranteed Obligations; and

  



  

   

2

 



    



  

(viii) any other defense that might operate as a legal or equitable discharge
of a guarantor or surety.

  



  

(c) The Guarantors hereby waive any and all notice of the creation, renewal,
extension or accrual of any of the Guaranteed Obligations and notice of or
proof of reliance by the Company upon this Limited Guaranty or acceptance of
this Limited Guaranty. All of the Guaranteed Obligations, and any of them,
shall conclusively be deemed to have been created, contracted or incurred in
reliance upon this Limited Guaranty, and all dealings between Parent, Merger
Sub or the Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other, shall
likewise be conclusively presumed to have been had or consummated in reliance
upon this Limited Guaranty. This Limited Guaranty is a primary obligation of
the Guarantors and is not merely the creation of a surety relationship. When
pursuing its rights and remedies hereunder against any Guarantor, the Company
shall be under no obligation to pursue such rights and remedies it may have
against Parent or Merger Sub or any other Person for the Guaranteed
Obligations or any right of offset with respect thereto, and any failure by
the Company to pursue such other rights or remedies or to collect any payments
from Parent or Merger Sub or any such other Person or to realize upon or to
exercise any such right of offset shall not relieve any Guarantor of
any liability hereunder.

  



  

(d) The Company shall not be obligated to file any claim relating to any
Guaranteed Obligation in the event that Parent or Merger Sub becomes subject
to a bankruptcy, reorganization or similar proceeding, and the failure of the
Company to so file such claim shall not affect any Guarantor's obligations
hereunder (and notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any bar to the
payment, or collection, of any Guaranteed Obligations as a result of any such
proceeding shall not discharge the obligations of such Guarantor
hereunder). In the event that any payment to the Company in respect of any
Guaranteed Obligation is rescinded or must otherwise be returned for any
reason whatsoever, the Guarantors shall remain liable hereunder with respect
to the Guaranteed Obligation as if such payment had not been made.

  



  

(e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Limited Guaranty, the Company
hereby agrees on its own behalf and on behalf of its controlled
Affiliates, directors and officers, that (i) each Guarantor may assert, as a
defense to, or release or discharge of, any payment or performance by such
Guarantor under this Limited Guaranty or any claim, set-off, deduction,
defense or release that Parent could assert against the Company under the
terms of, or with respect to, the Merger Agreement and (ii) any failure by the
Company to comply with the terms of the Merger Agreement, including, without
limitation, any breach by the Company or the Principal Stockholder of any
representation, warranty or covenant contained therein or in any of the
agreements, certificates and other documents required to be delivered by the
Company pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement (whether such breach
results from willful misconduct, fraud, intentional misrepresentation or
otherwise), that would relieve Parent of its obligations under the Merger
Agreement shall likewise automatically and without any further action on the
part of any Person relieve the Guarantors of their obligations under this
Limited Guaranty.

  



  

3\. _Waiver of Acceptance, Presentment; Etc._. Without amending or limiting
the other provisions of this Limited Guaranty, each Guarantor expressly and
irrevocably waives any and all rights and defenses arising under any
applicable law that would otherwise require any election of remedies by the
Company, promptness, diligence, notice of the acceptance of this Limited
Guaranty and of any Guaranteed Obligations, presentment, demand and protest,
any defenses that might be available under any valuation, stay, moratorium or
similar applicable law, and any notice of any kind not provided for herein or
not required to be provided to Parent or Merger Sub under or in connection
with the Merger Agreement, any right to require the marshalling of assets of
Parent, Merger Sub or any other Person interested in the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement, and all suretyship defenses
generally, other than defenses that are available to Parent or Merger Sub (a)
under the Merger Agreement, (b) in respect of a breach by the Company of this
Limited Guaranty and (c) in respect of fraud or Willful Breach by the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the Merger Agreement, this
Limited Guaranty or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. Each
Guarantor acknowledges that it will receive substantial direct and indirect
benefits from the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and
that the waivers set forth in this Limited Guaranty are knowingly made in
contemplation of such benefits.

its directors, officers, Affiliates and Subsidiaries that Parent does not

Guarantors have any obligations hereunder and that, notwithstanding that the
Guarantors may be limited partnerships, the Company has no remedy, recourse or
right of recovery under this Limited Guaranty against, or contribution from,
any former, current or future general or limited partner, stockholder, holder
of any equity, partnership or limited liability company interest, officer,
member, manager, director, employee, agent, controlling person, any lender or
prospective lender, lead arranger, arranger, agent or Representative of or to

piercing of the corporate, limited partnership or limited liability company
veil or similar action, by the enforcement of any assessment or by any legal
or equitable proceeding, by virtue of any statute, regulation or applicable
law, by or through a claim by or on behalf of the Guarantors, Parent or
Merger Sub against the Guarantors or any Guarantor Affiliate, or otherwise,

(c) The Company hereby covenants and agrees that it shall not institute, and

arising under, or in connection with, this Limited Guaranty, the Merger
Agreement, the Equity Commitment Letter or the transactions contemplated
thereby, against (i) any Guarantor Affiliate or against (ii) any

Guaranty (the " _Retained Guaranty Claims_ "), (B) claims by the Company

Letter and Section 10.6 of the Merger Agreement, subject to all the terms,
conditions and limitations herein and therein, claims by the Company
against Parent seeking to cause Parent to enforce the Equity Commitment
Letter in accordance with its terms (the " _Retained Equity Commitment
Claims_ "), and (D) against the parties to the Confidentiality Agreement,
subject to the terms and conditions therein (the " _Retained Confidentiality
Agreement Claims_ " and together with the Retained Equity Commitment

(d) Recourse (i) against each Guarantor solely with respect to the Retained
Guaranty Claims, (ii) against the parties to the Confidentiality Agreement
solely with respect to the Retained Confidentiality Agreement Claims and (iii)
against Parent and Merger Sub, as applicable, solely with respect to the
Retained Merger Agreement Claims and the Retained Equity Commitment Claims,
shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Company and all of its
Affiliates against the Guarantors, any of their respective Guarantor
Affiliates, Parent or Merger Sub in respect of any liabilities or obligations
arising under, or in connection with, the Merger Agreement, the
Confidentiality Agreement, the Equity Commitment Letter, this Limited
Guaranty or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, and such
recourse shall be subject to the limitations described herein and therein.

  



  

5\. _Merger Subrogation_. The Guarantors will not exercise any rights of
subrogation or contribution against Parent or Merger Sub, whether arising by
contract or operation of Law (including, without limitation, any such right
arising under bankruptcy or insolvency Laws) or otherwise, by reason of any
payment by any of them pursuant to the provisions of _Section 1_
hereof unless and until the Guaranteed Obligation has been paid in full

Agreement in accordance with its terms, other than a termination pursuant to
which the Company would be entitled to the Parent Termination Fee pursuant to
Section 9.5 of the Merger Agreement, in which case the Limited Guaranty shall
terminate 90 days after such termination unless the Company shall have
delivered a written notice with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations prior
to such 90th day; _provided_ that if the Merger Agreement has been so
terminated and such notice has been provided, the Guarantors shall have no
further liability or obligation under this Limited Guaranty from and after

Guaranty that are for the benefit of any Guarantor Affiliate (including the
provisions of _Sections 4_ ,  _6_ , _8_ and _10_ ) shall survive
indefinitely any termination of this Limited Guaranty and shall be enforceable
by the Guarantor Affiliates. In the event that the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective controlled Affiliates, directors or
officers institutes any suit, action or other proceeding or makes any claim
(A) asserting that the provisions of this _Section 6_ or  _Sections 1_ , _2_
, _4_ ,  _7_ , _10_ , _14_ ,  _19_ , _20_ , _22_ or  _23_ hereof are
illegal, invalid or unenforceable in whole or in part, that any Guarantor is
liable in excess of or to a greater extent than its Pro Rata Percentage of the
Maximum Amount, (B) arising under, or in connection with, this Limited
Guaranty, the Merger Agreement, the Equity Commitment Letter or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, other than a Retained Claim, or
(C) in respect of a Retained Claim in any court other than a Chosen Court
(as defined below), then (w) all of the obligations of the Guarantors under
this Limited Guaranty shall terminate ab initio and be null and void, (x) if
the Guarantor has previously made any payments under this Limited Guaranty,
the Guarantors shall be entitled to recover such payments from the Company,
and (y) none of the Guarantors, Parent nor any Guarantor Affiliate shall have
any liability to the Company, its securityholders or any of their respective
Representatives under this Limited Guaranty or with respect to the Merger
Agreement, the Equity Commitment Letter or the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby.

  



  

   

5

 



    



  

7\. _Continuing Guaranty_. Except to the extent that the obligations and
liabilities of any Guarantor are terminated pursuant to the provisions of
_Section 6_ hereof, this Limited Guaranty is a continuing one and shall
remain in full force and effect until the indefeasible payment and
satisfaction in full of the Guaranteed Obligations, shall be binding upon each
Guarantor, its successors and assigns, and shall inure to the benefit of, and
be enforceable by, the Company and its respective successors and permitted
transferees and assigns. All obligations to which this Limited Guaranty
applies or may apply under the terms hereof shall be conclusively presumed to
have been created in reliance hereon. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Limited Guaranty, the Company hereby agrees that to the
extent that Parent and Merger Sub are relieved of any of their
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in the Merger
Agreement so as to render any continuing liability or obligations arising in
connection with the Merger Agreement inapplicable, each Guarantor shall be
similarly relieved of its applicable Guaranteed Obligation under this Limited
Guaranty solely to the extent that Parent or Merger Sub are relieved of such
obligations.

  



  

8\. _Entire Agreement_. This Limited Guaranty, together with the Merger
Agreement and the agreements and instruments described therein, the
Confidentiality Agreement and the Equity Commitment Letter, constitutes the
entire agreement between the Guarantors and the Company with respect to the
subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior discussions, negotiations,
proposals, undertakings, agreements and understandings, both written
and oral, between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof.

  



  

9\. _Amendments and Waivers_. No amendment or waiver of any provision of this
Limited Guaranty will be valid and binding unless it is in writing and
signed, in the case of an amendment, by the Guarantors and the Company, or in
the case of waiver, by the party against whom the waiver is to be effective.
No waiver by any party of any breach or violation of, or default under, this
Limited Guaranty, whether intentional or not, will be deemed to extend to any
prior or subsequent breach, violation or default hereunder or affect in any
way any rights arising by virtue of any prior or subsequent such occurrence.
No delay or omission on the part of any party in exercising any right, power
or remedy under this Limited Guaranty will operate as a waiver thereof. The
Company shall not have any obligation to proceed at any time or in any manner
against, or exhaust any or all of the Company's rights against, Parent or
Merger Sub prior to proceeding against any Guarantor hereunder.

  



  

10\. _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except for the provisions of this
Limited Guaranty which reference Guarantor Affiliates (each of which shall be
for the benefit of and enforceable by each Guarantor Affiliate), the
parties hereby agree that their respective representations, warranties and
covenants set forth herein are solely for the benefit of the other parties
hereto, in accordance with and subject to the terms of this Limited Guaranty,
and this Limited Guaranty is not intended to, and does not, confer upon any
Person other than the parties hereto and any Guarantor Affiliates any rights
or remedies hereunder, including the right to rely upon the representations
and warranties set forth herein.

  



  

11\. _Counterparts_. This Limited Guaranty may be executed in any number of
counterparts, each of which will be deemed an original, but all of
which together will constitute one and the same instrument. This Limited
Guaranty will become effective when duly executed by each party hereto.

  



  

12\. _Delivery by Electronic Transmission_. This Limited Guaranty and any
signed agreement or instrument entered into in connection with this Limited
Guaranty, and any amendments or waivers hereto or thereto, to the
extent signed and delivered by means of e-mail delivery of a ".pdf" format
data file (or similar electronic delivery), shall be treated in all manner
and respects as an original agreement or instrument and shall be considered to
have the same binding legal effect as if it were the original signed version
thereof delivered in person. No party hereto or to any such agreement
or instrument shall raise the use of e-mail delivery of a ".pdf" format data
file (or similar electronic delivery) to deliver a signature to this Limited
Guaranty or any amendment hereto or the fact that any  _signature_ or
agreement or instrument _was transmitted or communicated through the use of
e-mail delivery of a ".pdf" format data file (or similar electronic delivery)
as a defense to the formation of a contract and each party hereto forever
waives any such defense. All parties hereto acknowledge that each party and
its counsel have participated in the drafting and negotiation of this Limited
Guaranty and that any rules of construction to the effect that any ambiguities
are to be resolved against the drafting party shall not be employed in the
interpretation of this Limited Guaranty._
