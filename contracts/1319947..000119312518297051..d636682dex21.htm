Estimated Tax Gross-Up Amount, in a manner consistent with the Audited
Financial Statements (the " _Audit Methods_ "), in accordance with the

statements and work papers) of the Sellers and the Acquired Companies that
relate to, as well as access to personnel of the Sellers and the Acquired
Companies that were involved in, the calculation or determination of the items
included in the Estimated Closing Statement, in each case, as is reasonably
necessary in order for Buyers to respond to or evaluate the calculations
contained in the Estimated Closing Statement. Sellers shall consider in good
faith any comments of HoldCo (with respect to Estimated Closing Cash Payments
relevant to HoldCo) and of Buyer IPCo (with respect to the Estimated Closing
Cash Payments relevant to Buyer IPCo) and shall revise the Estimated Closing
Statement to reflect any such comments that are agreed among the Parties (and,
in any event, shall revise the Estimated Closing Statement to correct any
manifest error identified by Buyers); _provided_ that any failure of Buyers
to comment on the Estimated Closing Statement prior to the Closing Date shall
not preclude Buyers from exercising any other rights under this Agreement. For
the avoidance of doubt, payment by Buyers in the Estimated Closing Cash
Payments of any amount set forth in the Estimated Closing Statement shall not
be deemed to be an acceptance by Buyers of Sellers application of the Audit
Methods, the Agreed Accounting Principles or the Tax Gross-Up Principles in
the Estimated Closing Statement or of Sellers calculations therein or waiver
of any of Buyers rights under this Agreement.

 

(b) No later than ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, Buyers shall cause

amount of the Closing Date Cash and Closing Date IP Cash; (iii) the amount of
the Closing Date Debt and Closing Date IP Debt; (iv) the amount of the Closing
Date Sellers Transaction Expenses; (iv) the amount of the Tax Gross-Up
Amount; and (v) the resulting (A) Final CG OpCo Purchase Price, (B) Final CCI
OpCo Purchase Price and (C) Final IPCo Purchase Price. The Preliminary Closing
Statement shall be prepared (i) other than with respect to the Tax Gross-Up
Amount, based upon the Books and Records of the Acquired Companies in a manner
consistent with the Audit Methods, in accordance with the definitions as
provided in this Agreement, and in accordance with the Agreed Accounting
Principles; _provided_ that in the event of any conflict between the Audit
Methods and the Agreed Accounting Principles, the Agreed Accounting
Principles shall control, and (ii) with respect to the Tax Gross-Up Amount,
in accordance with the Tax Gross-Up Principles. Sellers will have the
opportunity to review the Preliminary Closing Statement for forty-five (45)
days following its receipt of the Preliminary Closing Statement (the " _Review
Period_ "). During the Review Period, at the request of Sellers, Sellers and
their Representatives will, during normal business hours, be provided with
such access to the Books and Records of the Acquired Companies and other
information (including financial statements and work papers) of the Acquired
Companies that relate to, as well as access to personnel of the Acquired
Companies and Buyers that were involved in, the calculation or determination

 Price to those assets of Consulting to which such an allocation would be
required in determining, in accordance with the Tax Gross-Up Principles, the
Tax Gross-Up Amount (such allocation, the " _Gross-Up Allocation_") and (III)
Sellers, the Camuto Owners and their Representatives shall provide the Buyers
with such documentation and workpapers as the Buyers may reasonably request
to calculate or substantiate the Tax Gross-Up Amount. Buyers calculation of
the amounts of the Closing Date Net Working Capital, the Closing Date Net
Working Capital Adjustment, the Closing Date Cash, the Closing Date IP Cash,
the Closing Date Debt, the Closing Date IP Debt, the Closing Date Sellers
Transaction Expenses, the Tax Gross-Up Amount and the Final Closing Cash
Payment (allocated among the Final CG OpCo Purchase Price, Final CCI OpCo
Purchase Price and Final IPCo Purchase Price) derived therefrom will become
final, conclusive and binding on the Parties unless, prior to the end of the
Review Period, Sellers notify Buyers in writing of Sellers objection(s) to
such calculation (an " _Objection Notice_ "), identifying, separately, in
reasonable detail, each disputed line item in each of the Closing Date Net
Working Capital, the Closing Date Net Working Capital Adjustment, the Closing
Date Cash, the Closing Date IP Cash, the Closing Date Debt, the Closing Date
IP Debt, the Closing Date Sellers Transaction Expenses, the Tax Gross-Up

Sellers dispute(s). If Sellers deliver an Objection Notice to Buyers prior to
the end of the Review Period, Buyers and Sellers will negotiate in good faith
to resolve Sellers objections set forth in the Objection Notice within
thirty (30) days following delivery of the Objection Notice. If Buyers and
Sellers resolve some or all of such objections within such time period, they
will document their resolution in a writing signed by each of them, and
such resolution will be final, conclusive and binding on the Parties. If
Buyers and Sellers are unable to resolve all of Sellers objections within the
30-day time period following the delivery of the Objection Notice, the
Parties will promptly refer any items and amounts set forth on the Objection
Notice that remain still in dispute for resolution as provided in _Section_ __
_ 1.3(c)_. For avoidance of doubt, the amount set forth in clause (l) of the
definition of Closing Date IP Debt shall not be subject to adjustment pursuant
to this _Section_ __ _ 1.3_.

 

(c) Any unresolved dispute concerning the Preliminary Closing Statement as
identified in the Objection Notice pursuant to the procedures set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 1.3(b)_ will be referred for resolution to Grant Thornton LLP,
who will be jointly retained by Buyers and Sellers. If the Parties are unable
to engage Grant Thornton LLP for any reason, then Buyers and Sellers will
cooperate in good faith to mutually agree to and designate another nationally
recognized independent accounting firm with which no Party has any current
professional relationship (Grant Thornton LLP or any other
designated accounting firm is referred to in this Agreement as the "
_Accounting Firm_ "). The fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm will be
allocated fifty percent (50%) to Sellers (jointly and severally) and fifty
percent (50%) to the applicable Buyer. The Accounting Firm will act as a
neutral arbitrator and will resolve only the disputed items that have been
referred to it pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 1.3(c)_ and solely in
accordance with the procedures (including any relevant defined terms) set
forth in this Agreement and, with respect to the Tax Gross-Up Amount, in
accordance with the Tax Gross-Up Principles. Any resolution of a disputed
item by the Accounting Firm must be (x) within the range of the differences
between Buyers position in the Preliminary Closing Statement and Sellers
position in the Objection Notices with respect to such disputed item and (y)
in accordance with the Tax Gross-Up Principles. The Parties will provide the
Accounting Firm

 with all Books and Records and other information and documentation in their
possession reasonably relevant to the determinations to be made by it as may
be requested by the Accounting Firm. No Party or any Affiliate or
Representative of a Party will meet or discuss any substantive matters with
the Accounting Firm without Buyers and Sellers and their respective
Representatives present or having the opportunity following at least five (5)
Business Days prior written notice to be present, either in person or by
telephone. The Accounting Firm will have the power to require a Party to
provide to it such Books and Records and other information it deems reasonably
relevant to the resolution of the dispute, and to require a Party to answer
questions that it deems reasonably relevant to the resolution of the dispute.
All Books and Records and other information (including answers to questions
from the Accounting Firm) submitted to the Accounting Firm must be
concurrently delivered to each Other Party. All disputes with respect to the
application of Audit Methods, Agreed Accounting Principles or the Tax Gross-Up
Principles or to the mathematical calculation of any disputed components of
the Preliminary Closing Statement that have been referred to the Accounting
Firm pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 1.3(c)_ will be resolved exclusively by
the Accounting Firm. The determination of the Accounting Firm with respect to
disputes to be resolved by it hereunder, absent fraud or manifest error, will
be final, conclusive and binding upon the Parties. The amounts of the Closing
Date Net Working Capital, the Closing Date Net Working Capital Adjustment,
the Closing Date Cash, the Closing Date IP Cash, the Closing Date Debt, the
Closing Date IP Debt, the Closing Date Sellers Transaction Expenses, the
Tax Gross-Up Amount and the resulting Final Closing Cash Payment (allocated
among the Final CG OpCo Purchase Price, Final CCI OpCo Purchase Price and
Final IPCo Purchase Price), in each case, as finally determined in accordance
with this _Section_ __ _ 1.3_ (whether as a result of a failure to timely
deliver an Objection Notice, mutual resolution of the Parties pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 1.3(b)_ or otherwise, determination by the Accounting Firm in
accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 1.3(c)_, or any combination thereof),
will be used for purposes of any adjustments to the Estimated Closing Cash
Payments pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 1.3(d)_.

(d) Following Closing:

 

(i) if any of (x) the Estimated CG OpCo Purchase Price is lower than the Final
CG OpCo Purchase Price, (y) the Estimated CCI OpCo Purchase Price is lower
than the Final CCI OpCo Purchase Price, or (z) the Estimated IPCo Purchase
Price is lower than the Final IPCo Purchase Price (any difference pursuant to
this  _Section_ __ _ 1.3(d)(i)_, an " _Underpayment_ " and, the sum of any
such amounts in the aggregate, the " _Underpayment Amount_ "), then within
three Business Days following the determination of the Final Closing Cash
Payment, HoldCo or Buyer IPCo, as applicable, will pay its applicable portion
of the Underpayment Amount (if applicable, reduced pursuant to _Section_ __ _
1.3(d)(ii)(B)(I)_) to the applicable Seller(s) by wire transfer of

within three Business Days following the determination of the Final Closing
Cash Payment:

(A) if the Overpayment Amount is less than or equal to the Adjustment
Escrow Amount, then the Buyers and Sellers shall deliver a joint written
instruction to the Escrow Agent to (I) release to HoldCo and/or Buyer IPCo, as
applicable, out of the Adjustment Escrow Account, an amount equal to the
applicable portion of the Overpayment Amount and (II) transfer to the

(B) if the Overpayment Amount is greater than the Adjustment Escrow Amount,
then (I) Buyers shall, if Sellers so elect, net any Underpayment Amount (or
any portion thereof) against the Overpayment Amount, such that the Overpayment
Amount shall be reduced dollar-for-dollar by reduction of the Underpayment
Amount by an amount not to exceed the Underpayment Amount (and the Overpayment
Amount shall in no event be less than zero (0)) (any remaining Overpayment
Amount, after giving effect to the netting adjustment pursuant to this clause
(I), the " _Netted Overpayment Amount_ "), (II) if the Netted Overpayment
Amount is less than or equal to the Adjustment Escrow Amount, then the Buyers
and Sellers shall deliver a joint written instruction to the Escrow Agent to

Escrow Account, an amount equal to the applicable portion of the Netted
Overpayment Amount and (y) transfer to the Indemnity Escrow Account to
become part of the Indemnity Escrow Funds, an amount equal to the balance
remaining in the Adjustment Escrow Account after the payment specified in the
preceding clause (x), and (III) if the Netted Overpayment Amount is greater
than the Adjustment Escrow Amount or the Sellers elect not to net the
Underpayment Amount, then Sellers, on a several and not joint basis, and the
Camuto Owners, in accordance with the Liability Basis, will deliver to HoldCo
and/or Buyer IPCo, as applicable, by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to an account designated by each such Buyer cash in the amount equal to
such Buyers portion of the Netted Overpayment Amount or such Buyers
Overpayment Amount, as applicable, _minus_ the Adjustment Escrow Amount due
to such Buyer and (y) Buyers and Sellers Representative shall deliver a joint
written instruction to the Escrow Agent to release to each Buyer, as
applicable, the applicable portion of the Adjustment Escrow Funds in the
Adjustment Escrow Account.

(e) Promptly following the completion of, and after giving effect to, the
payments to be made pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.3(d)_, Buyers and Sellers
shall deliver a joint written instruction to the Escrow Agent to transfer all
of the Adjustment Escrow Funds then remaining in the Adjustment Escrow
Account, if any, to the Indemnity Escrow Account to become part of the

in this Agreement to the contrary, for purposes of calculating the Estimated
Closing Cash Payments, the Estimated CG OpCo Purchase Price, the Estimated CCI
OpCo Purchase Price, the Estimated IPCo Purchase Price, the Final Closing
Cash Payment, the Final CG OpCo Purchase Price, the Final CCI OpCo Purchase

Tax Returns, or any documents or reports that Sellers or its Affiliates are
required to file with any Governmental Body, or to respond to inquiries,
investigations or audits of a Governmental Body; _provided_ that Buyers shall
be entitled to designate a Representative to be present for any such meeting
or discussion between Sellers and any such employee. Notwithstanding the

reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to result in a
Business Material Adverse Effect. It is specifically agreed that the Sellers
Disclosure Schedule may be supplemented, amended and/or added to, reflect any
items so disclosed. No disclosure in any such amendment or supplement shall be
deemed to have cured any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or
warranty contained in this Agreement unless Buyers agree in writing otherwise;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Buyers shall have the right, pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 7.1(b)_ (without regard to any cure period set forth therein
that might apply) to terminate this Agreement within three (3) Business Days
of their receipt of any such amendment or supplement. If Buyers fail to
terminate this Agreement, Buyers shall be deemed to have irrevocably waived
any right to terminate this Agreement with respect to such matter and,
further, shall have irrevocably waived their right to indemnification from
Sellers or the Camuto Owners under _Section_ __ _ 8.2_ with respect to such
matter.

or CCI OpCos title to any Owned Real Property.

 

(b) Each of the Buyers and the Sellers shall furnish, and shall cause their
respective Affiliates to furnish, to the other such necessary information and
reasonable assistance as the other may request in connection with any filing

any communications with, and any inquiries or requests for additional

counsel to cooperate with each other regarding, and (ii) to use its respective

each Other Party prior reasonable notice of the meeting or discussion, and, to
the extent permitted by the relevant Governmental Body, the opportunity to
attend and participate at the meeting or discussion (which, at the request of
any Party, shall be limited to outside antitrust counsel only).

(c) Without limiting the generality of  _Sections_ __ _ 5.4(a)_ through
_(b)_ , but subject to _Section_ __ _ 5.4(d)_, Buyers shall, and shall cause
their respective Subsidiaries, to use their respective reasonable best efforts
to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective the

resolve such objections, if any, as any Governmental Body (including for the
avoidance of doubt, as applicable, the United States Department of Justice or
the United States Federal Trade Commission) or Person may assert under the HSR
Act or Foreign Antitrust Law with respect to the Transactions, and to avoid
or eliminate each and every impediment under any such Law that may be asserted
by any Governmental Body or Person with respect to the Transactions so as to
enable Closing to occur as soon as reasonably possible (and in any event no
later than the Outside Date), including (x) proposing, negotiating, committing
to and effecting, by consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise, the
sale, divestiture or disposition of any assets or businesses of Buyers or any
of their respective Subsidiaries (including the Acquired Companies after the
Closing) and (y) otherwise taking or committing to take any actions that
after, the Closing would limit the freedom of Buyers or any of their
respective Subsidiaries (including the Acquired Companies after the Closing)
with respect to, or their ability to retain, one or more of their businesses,
product lines or assets, in each case as may be required in order to avoid the
entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any Order that would otherwise
have the effect of preventing the Closing or delaying the Closing beyond the
Outside Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that neither Sellers nor any Acquired
Company shall become subject to, or be required to consent or agree to or

understanding, agreement or order, unless such requirement, condition,

Closing occurs.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, none of the
Buyers, Buyer Parents, Sellers nor any of their respective Subsidiaries or
other Affiliates engaged in the Business shall be required to (i) enter into
litigation against any Governmental Body (including for the avoidance of
doubt, as applicable, the United States Department of Justice or the United
States Federal Trade Commission); (ii) take or agree to take any action or
actions that would have, or would reasonably be expected to have, individually
or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on the Acquired Companies or
the applicable Buyer or Sellers; or (iii) hold separate, sell, divest or
dispose of any assets or businesses of Buyers, Buyer Parents, Sellers or

 



-41-

Acquired Companies after the Closing) or to take or commit to take any actions
that would limit the freedom of Buyers, Buyer Parents, Sellers or any of
their respective Subsidiaries (including the Acquired Companies after the
Closing) with respect to their assets or businesses.

 

(e) After Closing, Buyers and Sellers will take all actions, execute and
deliver all further documents and do all other acts and things as the other
may reasonably request to carry out and document the intent of this Agreement
and the other Transaction Documents.

(i) To the extent that any Owned Acquired Company Intellectual Property is
subject to any form of Encumbrance (other than a Permitted Encumbrance), each

remove such Encumbrance (other than a Permitted Encumbrance) in such Acquired

such actions with respect to such Owned Acquired Company Intellectual
Property as a result of such cooperation and assistance in connection with

_Section_ __ _ 5.4(f)(i)_; _provided_ , _however_ , that neither Buyer IPCo
nor, following the Closing, CCI IPCo will incur filing expenses pursuant to
this third sentence of _Section_ __ _ 5.4(f)(i)_, individually or in the
aggregate, in excess of $5,000 for which it shall seek reimbursement from the
Sellers, without the prior written consent of the Sellers Representative
(not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); _provided_ ,
_further_ , that this third sentence of _Section_ __ _ 5.4(f)(i)_ shall not
limit the Sellers and the Acquired Companies obligations pursuant to the
first and second sentences of this _Section_ __ _ 5.4(f)(i)_.

 

(ii) From and after the date hereof, to the extent that any Owned Acquired
Company Intellectual Property or any Transitioning Trademark is not in the
current legal name of an Acquired Company or is subject to a chain of title
defect, Buyers shall prepare, execute, file and record all instruments and
documents necessary to cure such title defects and provide for
current ownership of the asset by the applicable Acquired Company in such
Owned Acquired Company Intellectual Property or Transitioning Trademark. From
and after the date hereof, each Seller shall, and prior to the Closing shall
cause each Acquired Company to, use its reasonable best efforts to cooperate
with and assist Buyers in the preparation, execution, filing and recordation
of all instruments and documents necessary to cure such title defects and
provide for current ownership of the asset by the applicable Acquired Company
in such Owned Acquired Company Intellectual Property or Transitioning
Trademark. The Buyers shall be responsible for and pay the expenses incurred

Company pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5.4(f)_; _provided_ , _however_ ,

Indemnified Party from and against, or reimburse any Seller Indemnified Party

the provisions of this  _Section_ __ _ 5.4(f)_ if Sellers do not comply with
Buyers reasonable written requests within a reasonable time after any Buyer
makes such a request.

 

Section 5.5 _Restrictive Covenants_. In consideration of the consummation of
the Transactions and other valuable consideration:

(a) For a period of four years from the Closing Date, without the prior
written consent of each Buyer, each of the Sellers and Camuto Owners (the "
_Restricted Persons_ ") will not, and will not permit their Affiliates to,
anywhere in the world, directly or indirectly, for or for the benefit of
itself or any other Person, engage in, own, operate, manage, consult for,
render services to, control or invest in any business in competition with the
Business, as conducted immediately prior to Closing; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that (i) a Restricted Person shall not be prohibited from owning up to five
percent (5%) of the outstanding stock of a corporation that is publicly traded
on a national securities exchange or in the over-the-counter market so long
as such Restricted Person has no active participation in connection with the
business of such corporation and (ii) nothing in this  _Section_ __ _
5.5(a)_ shall prohibit a Restricted Person from using any of the Excluded
Assets.

(b) For a period of two years from the Closing Date (the " _Non-Solicitation
Period_"), each of the Restricted Persons will not, and will not permit their
Affiliates to, directly or indirectly (including through representatives),
for or for the benefit of itself or any other Person, solicit for employment,
employ, engage, induce to leave, hire or retain (as an employee or independent
contractor or otherwise) any employee of any Acquired Company employed in a
position of "director" or a higher position as of the date hereof; _provided_
, _however_ , that nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 5.5(b)_ will prohibit the
Restricted Persons from: (i) conducting general mass solicitations of
employment and generalized employee searches through headhunter/search firms
(in either case not targeted, directed or indirectly, at employees of any
Acquired Company); or (ii) hiring or inducing or assisting any other
Person in hiring any individual that was an employee of any Acquired Company
after such individual (1) has been involuntarily terminated (other than for
cause (based on the definition of "cause" in the applicable employment
agreement, if so defined therein)) by any Acquired Company or any of its
Affiliates and (2) who has not been employed by an Acquired Company or any
Affiliate thereof for a period of six months. The Non-Solicitation Period for
each Restricted Person shall be extended for an additional period of time
equal to any period during which such Restricted Person is in breach of its
obligations under this _Section_ __ _ 5.5(b)_.

 



-43- 

    

(c) From and after the Closing Date, each Restricted Person will not, and will
cause their Affiliates and Representatives not to, use or disclose to any
Person any Confidential Information of the Acquired Companies or other non-
public information of or relating to the Business as currently conducted or
the Acquired Companies, except (i) to the extent necessary in connection with
any Proceeding, (ii) if required to do so by applicable Law or legal process,
only to the extent such disclosure is required, (iii) to the extent that such
Confidential Information enters the public domain other than in accordance
with the following sentence and (iv) for internal use of any such Confidential
Information solely for financial, tax or accounting purposes. If a Restricted
Person is required by applicable Law or legal process to disclose any such
Confidential Information of the Acquired Companies or other non-public
information of or relating to the Business as currently conducted or the
Acquired Companies, such Restricted Person will: (x) to the extent
practicable, give each Buyer prompt written notice of such requirement so that
Buyers may seek an appropriate protective order or other remedy; and (y)
upon Buyers request and at Buyers cost, cooperate with Buyers to obtain
such protective order or other remedy. In the event that such protective order
or other remedy is not obtained, such Restricted Person will furnish only that
portion of such Confidential Information or non-public information that, on
the advice of its counsel, is legally required to be disclosed and, upon
Buyers request, use reasonable best efforts to seek confidential treatment
(to the extent available) of such information.

(d) The Camuto Owners acknowledge and agree that their obligations under
this  _(f)_ are an essential element of this Agreement and that, but for the
agreements of the Camuto Owners in the foregoing _clause_ __ _ (a)_ of this
_(f)_ , Buyers would not have entered into this Agreement. Accordingly, the
Camuto Owners agree that if a court of competent jurisdiction finds that the
time period of any of the foregoing covenants is too lengthy or that the
geographic coverage or scope of any of the covenants is too broad, the
restrictive time period will be deemed to be the longest period permissible
under applicable Law and the geographic coverage and scope will be deemed to
comprise the largest coverage and scope permissible under applicable Law, in
each case, with such modification of the provisions of this _(f)_ to only
apply with respect to the operation of this _(f)_ in the particular
jurisdiction of such court. It is the Parties intent to protect and preserve
the Business as currently conducted and the goodwill of the Acquired
Companies, and the Camuto Owners agree that the time period, the geographic
coverage and scope of the covenants set forth in this _(f)_ are reasonable.
If a Restricted Person breaches or threatens to breach any of the foregoing
covenants, Buyers will be entitled to injunctive relief in addition to any
other remedies that may be available under applicable Law, without the
necessity of proving actual harm or posting a bond or other
security therefor.

Section 5.6 _Public Announcements_. Each Party will, and will cause its
Affiliates and Representatives (including in the case of Buyers following
Closing, the Acquired Companies) to, maintain the confidentiality of the terms
of this Agreement and will not, and will cause its Affiliates and
Representatives not to, issue or cause the publication of any press release
or other public announcement with respect to this Agreement or the
Transactions without the prior written consent of each Other Party, which
consent will not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or 

 



-44- 

    

 conditioned; _provided_ , _however_ , that a Party may, without the prior
written consent of each Other Party, issue or cause publication of any such
press release or public announcement to the extent that such Party reasonably
determines, after consultation with legal counsel, such action to be required
by applicable Law or by the rules of any applicable self-regulatory
organization, in which event such Party will use reasonable best efforts to
allow each Other Party reasonable time to comment on such press release or
public announcement in advance of its issuance.

 

Section 5.7 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) No later than ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing, ABG will make
offers of employment to each employee of the Sellers and the Acquired
Companies set forth in Section 5.7(a) of the Sellers Disclosure Schedule
(each, an " _ABG Employee_ "). From the Closing Date through December 31,
2019, ABG will provide or cause one of its Affiliates to provide each ABG
Employee who accepts ABGs offer of employment, for so long as they remain
employed by ABG or one of its Affiliates during such period, with (i) an
annual base salary or wage rate, as applicable, that is no less than the
annual base salary or wage rate provided to the ABG Employee immediately
prior to Closing and (ii) all other compensation and employee benefits
(excluding base salaries and wage rates) that are no less favorable than those
provided to similarly situated employees of ABG and its Affiliates. In
addition, through December 31, 2019, ABG and its Affiliates shall cause each
ABG Employee who accepts ABGs offer of employment that is terminated without
cause to receive those severance benefits set forth in Section 5.7(b) of the
Sellers Disclosure Schedules. For the avoidance of doubt, any ABG Employee who
does not accept ABGs offer of employment or continued service prior to the
Closing shall be considered an "Excluded Employee" for purposes of this
Agreement and, except as set forth on Section 5.7(a) of the Sellers Disclosure
Schedule, in no event shall Buyers or any Affiliate of either Buyer make any
offer of employment or other consulting or similar arrangement to any such
Excluded Employee for a period of two (2) years following the Closing Date.

(b) From the Closing Date through December 31, 2019, HoldCo will provide or
cause one of its Affiliates (including the Acquired Companies) to provide each
employee of CG OpCo, CCI OpCo or one of their respective Subsidiaries as of
immediately prior to the Closing, for so long as they remain employed by
HoldCo or one of its Affiliates (including any Acquired Company) during such
period (the " _Continuing Employees_ "), with (i) an annual base salary or
wage rate, as applicable, that is no less than the annual base salary or wage
rate provided to the Continuing Employee immediately prior to Closing, (ii)
target and maximum annual bonus opportunities that are no less that the target
and maximum bonus opportunities that the Continuing Employee was eligible for
immediately prior to the Closing and (iii) all other compensation and employee
benefits (excluding base salaries, wage rates and annual bonus opportunities)
that are no less favorable in the aggregate than those provided to Continuing
Employees as of immediately prior to the Closing (it being understood that the
Continuing Employees may commence participation in the employee benefit plans,
policies and arrangements of HoldCo and its Affiliates at such times as
are determined by HoldCo _provided_ that such employee benefit plans,
policies and arrangements satisfy the requirements of this _Section_ __ _
5.7(b))_. In addition, through December 31, 2019, HoldCo and its Affiliates
shall cause each Continuing Employee that is terminated without cause to
receive those severance benefits set forth in Section 5.7(b) of the Sellers
Disclosure Schedules.

 



-45- 

    

(c) HoldCo shall provide, or shall cause one of its Affiliates (including any
Acquired Companies) to provide, to each Continuing Employee credit for all
purposes (including, but not limited to, severance) under any "employee
benefit plan" (within the meaning of ERISA) or any other compensation or
benefit arrangement (a " _Buyer Plan_ ") for such Continuing Employees
service prior to the Closing with any Acquired Company or any of their
Affiliates; _provided_ that such service shall not be credited (A) for
purposes of vesting under any equity-based compensation award that may be
granted by DSW or one of its Affiliates or benefit accrual under any defined
benefit pension or retiree medical plans of HoldCo and its Affiliates covering
the Continuing Employees, (B) to the extent such credit would result in any
duplication of compensation or benefits or the funding thereof or (C) for
purposes of any benefit plan that is frozen or provides grandfathered
benefits. HoldCo shall, or shall cause its applicable Affiliate to, use
commercially reasonable efforts to (x) cause each Continuing Employee and his
or her eligible dependents to be covered on and after the Closing by a group
health plan or plans maintained by HoldCo or any of its Affiliates (including
the Employee Benefit Plans) that do not limit or exclude coverage on the
basis of any preexisting condition of such Continuing Employee or dependent
(other than any limitation already in effect under the applicable group health
Employee Benefit Plan) or on the basis of any other exclusion or waiting
period not in effect under the applicable group health Employee Benefit Plan
and (y) provide each Continuing Employee full credit under HoldCos or its
applicable Affiliates group health plans, for the year in which the Closing
Date occurs, for any deductible or co-payment already incurred by the
Continuing Employee under the applicable group health Employee Benefit Plan
and for any other out-of-pocket expenses that count against any maximum out-
of-pocket expense provision of the applicable group health Employee Benefit
Plan or HoldCos or its Affiliates group health plans.

(d) Sellers shall, prior to the Closing, (a) solicit a waiver from each
"disqualified individual" (as defined in Section 280G(c) of the Code) entitled
to receive an "excess parachute payment" (as defined in Section 280G(b)(5) of
the Code) of such individuals right to receive such payment and (b) solicit
shareholder (or similar interest holder) approval of the right of any
"disqualified individual" (as defined in Section 280G(c) of the Code) who
executed a waiver under clause (a) to receive any and all payments and other
benefits contingent on the consummation of the Transactions (within the
meaning of Section 280G(b)(2)(A)(i) of the Code) so that in the event of the
applicable approval, no payment received or which could be received by such
"disqualified individual" would be an "excess parachute payment" under Section
280G(b) of the Code. Before any such submission to shareholder (or similar
interest holder) approval, Sellers will provide disclosure to the applicable
shareholders (or similar interest holders) in a manner intended to comply with
Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder.
The parties hereto acknowledge that Sellers cannot compel any disqualified
individual to waive any existing rights under a contract with the Acquired
Companies and Sellers shall not be deemed in breach of this _Section_ __ _
5.7(d)_ with respect to any disqualified individual who refuses to waive any
such right after the Sellers have used their reasonable best efforts to obtain
such waiver from such disqualified individual; _provided_ , that for the
avoidance of doubt, such reasonable efforts shall not include the payment of
any additional amounts to such individual. All materials produced by Sellers
in connection with this _Section_ __ _ 5.7(d)_ shall be submitted to Buyers
at least ten (10) Business Days in advance for Buyers review and comment and
Sellers shall consider any of Buyers requested changes or comments in good
faith and not unreasonably omit them.

 



-46- 

    

(e) Sellers and their Affiliates shall pay or reimburse and otherwise
indemnify and hold harmless Buyers and their Affiliates for any Transaction
Severance Liabilities. HoldCo and its Affiliates shall use reasonable efforts
not to encourage Continuing Employees in jurisdictions outside of the United
States to reject or oppose their transfer of employment to Buyers and request
severance payments from Sellers in connection with such transfer.

(f) At or prior to the Closing, Sellers and their Affiliates shall transfer
to one of the Acquired Companies each Employee Benefit Plan set forth on
Section 5.7(f) of the Sellers Disclosure Schedule.

 

(g) Sellers and their Affiliates and Buyers and their Affiliates agree to the
covenants set forth on Section 5.7(g) of the Sellers Disclosure Schedule.

(h) The Parties hereby agree that no provision of this _Section_ __ _ 5.7_ is
intended to, and that no such provision does, confer upon any Person other
than the Parties any right to or remedies hereunder, including the right to
enforce any obligations of any Party contained herein. Except as set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 5.1_, nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, will be
construed to prevent a Party or any of its Affiliates (including Seller or any
Acquired Company) from: (i) terminating, or modifying the terms of employment
of, any employees of any Acquired Company; or (ii) terminating or modifying
to any extent any Employee Benefit Plan, Buyer Plan or any other employee
benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement that any Party or any of its
Affiliates (including any Acquired Company) currently maintains or may
establish or maintain. Nothing in this Agreement will be construed as an
amendment to any Employee Benefit Plan or any other compensation or benefit
plans maintained for or provided to directors, employees or independent
contractors of Buyers, Seller, any Acquired Company or any of their respective
Affiliates prior to or following the Closing Date.

 

Section 5.8 _Payoff Letters_ _; Transaction Expense Invoices_ _;
Financing Cooperation_.

(a) At least three Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Sellers will
deliver or cause to be delivered to Buyers pay-off letters with respect to all
Closing Date Debt and Closing Date IP Debt of the Acquired Companies ("
_Payoff Letters_ ") executed by all financial institutions and other Persons
to which such Indebtedness is owed, or the applicable agent, trustee or other
representative on behalf of each Person, together with appropriate executed
lien release documentation (the " _Lien Release Documentation_ "), which
Payoff Letters shall (i) indicate the total amount required to be paid to
fully satisfy all principal, interest, prepayment premiums, penalties,
breakage costs or other similar obligations related to such Indebtedness as of
immediately prior to the Closing (such amount set forth in each Payoff
Letter, the " _Payoff Amount_ "); and (ii) state that all obligations
(including guarantees) in respect thereof (other than those contingent
indemnification obligations that customarily remain following termination of
a credit agreement) and Encumbrances in connection therewith on the Assets
shall be, concurrently with the receipt of the Payoff Amount on the Closing
Date by the Person holding such Indebtedness, released. Each of HoldCo and
Sellers shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause to be delivered on or
prior to the Closing Date amendments to each of the Factoring Arrangements
substantially in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit 5.8_ , with such changes
as HoldCo and Sellers shall reasonably agree in good faith (the " _Factoring
Arrangement Amendments_ "), executed by all financial institutions party
thereto.

 



-47- 

    

(b) At least three Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Sellers will
deliver or cause to be delivered to Buyers invoices and payment instructions
with respect to all Sellers Transaction Expenses (" _Transaction Expense
Invoices_ ") payable by the Acquired Companies or Sellers executed by each
Person, or the applicable agents, trustees or other representatives on behalf
of such Person, which Transaction Expense Invoices shall (i) indicate that
total amount required to be paid to fully satisfy the fees, costs and payments
due from the Acquired Companies to such Person; and (ii) provide the payment
instructions for making the payments with respect to the foregoing.

(c) Sellers shall (and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries (including,
without limitation, the Acquired Companies) to) use reasonable best efforts to
provide all customary cooperation (and to cause their respective
Representatives to provide all customary cooperation), including provision of
customary financial information, that is reasonably requested by any Buyer in
connection with such Buyer and/or its applicable Buyer Parent obtaining any
third-party debt financing for the purpose of financing the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) no such
cooperation shall be required to the extent it would require the Sellers or
any of their respective Subsidiaries to incur any fees, out-of-pocket expenses
or other liability (contingent or otherwise) prior to the Closing for which
they are not promptly reimbursed or simultaneously indemnified (except
to arising from the bad faith, gross negligence, willful misconduct or breach
of this Agreement by any such Person) and (ii) the Sellers and their
respective Subsidiaries (other than, at or after the Closing, the Acquired
Companies) shall not be required to execute any credit or security
documentation or similar agreement (other than customary representation or
authorization letters).

 

Section 5.9 _Tax Matters_.

 

(a) _Transaction Tax Treatment_.

 

(i) For all U.S. federal (and applicable state and local) income Tax purposes,
Sellers and Buyers shall (and shall cause their respective Affiliates to)
treat (A) each of (I) the CG OpCo Acquisition, (II) the CCI OpCo Acquisition
and (III) the IPCo Acquisition as a taxable purchase by the applicable Buyer
and taxable sale by the applicable Selling Entity of (x) the assets of CG
OpCo and Overseas NewCo, (y) the assets of CCI OpCo, and (z) the assets of CCI
IPCo and the Transferred Chaus IPCo Interests (and, in each case of clause
(x), (y) and (z), other than with respect to Chaus IPCo, of the assets of any
entity treated as disregarded as separate from it for U.S. federal income tax
purposes), respectively and (B) the transactions contemplated by the SS IP
Asset Purchase Agreement as a taxable purchase by Buyer IPCo and taxable sale
by SSGI of assets for U.S. federal income tax purposes (such treatment, the "
_Acquisition Tax Treatment_ ").

 

(ii) HoldCo may, in its sole discretion, make (and/or cause its applicable
Affiliates to make) an election under Section 338(g) of the Code and the
Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder (and any corresponding elections
under any

 



-48- 

    

 applicable state or local Tax Law) with respect to the acquisition or deemed
acquisition (under the Acquisition Tax Treatment) of any Non-U.S.
Subsidiary of CG OpCo, Overseas NewCo or CCI OpCo (each, a " _Section_ __ _
338(g) Election_"). Each of HoldCo, the Sellers Representative, the Camuto
Owners, Overseas and the Sellers shall (and shall cause their Affiliates
to) cooperate with respect to the Section 338(g) Election(s) and in the
preparation of any forms, attachments, schedules, or filings necessary to
effectuate the Section 338(g) Election(s) in a manner consistent with the PRC
Acquired Company Value and the Final Allocation. None of the Camuto Owners,
Sellers, Overseas or the Sellers Representative shall, and each shall cause
its respective Affiliates not to, take or agree to take any action that would
prevent or impede, or would reasonably be expected to prevent or impede, the
making of any Section 338(g) Election. For all U.S. federal (and applicable
state and local) income Tax purposes, Sellers, Overseas, Camuto Owners, the
Sellers Representative and HoldCo shall (and shall cause their respective
Affiliates to) treat the acquisition or deemed acquisition (under the
Acquisition Tax Treatment) of any Non-U.S. Subsidiary of CG OpCo, Overseas
NewCo or CCI OpCo with respect to which a Section 338(g) Election is made
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5.9(a)(ii)_ in accordance with Treasury
Regulations Section 1.338-1 (the " _Section_ __ _ 338(g) Election Tax
Treatment_," and, together with the Acquisition Tax Treatment, the "
_Transaction Tax Treatment_ ").

 

(iii) If any Acquired Company that is treated as a partnership for U.S.
federal income purposes (including, for the avoidance of doubt, Chaus IPCo)
does not have in effect a valid election under Section 754 of the Code (a "
_Section_ __ _ 754 Election_") that would be applicable for the taxable year
of such Acquired Company that ends on or includes the Closing Date, Sellers,
the Sellers Representative, the Camuto Owners and Buyers agree to, and shall
cause such Acquired Company to, (x) attach to the Acquired Companys Tax
Return for such taxable year a properly completed Section 754 Election
statement making a valid Section 754 Election effective for such taxable
period and (y) make any similar election under any applicable state, local or
foreign Law for such taxable period.

 

(b) _Purchase Price Allocation_.

 

(i) For Tax purposes, each of the Sellers, Buyers, Camuto Owners, Overseas and
the Sellers Representative shall allocate and, as applicable, shall cause
their relevant Affiliates to allocate, (i) the Final CG OpCo Purchase Price
(and any other items that are treated as additional consideration in respect
of CG OpCo and Overseas NewCo for Tax purposes as of the Closing Date) among
the assets of CG OpCo and Overseas NewCo (and of the assets of any entity
treated as disregarded as separate from CG OpCo or Overseas NewCo for U.S.
federal income tax purposes); (ii) the Final CCI OpCo Purchase Price (and
any other items that are treated as additional consideration in respect of
CCI OpCo for Tax purposes as of the Closing Date) among the assets of CCI OpCo
(and of the assets of any entity treated as disregarded as separate from CCI
OpCo for U.S. federal income tax purposes); (iii) the Final IPCo Purchase
Price (and any other items that are treated as additional consideration in
respect of CCI IPCo and Chaus IPCo for Tax purposes as of the Closing Date)
among the assets of CCI IPCo (and of the assets of any entity treated as
disregarded as separate from CCI IPCo for U.S. federal income tax

 



-49- 

    

 purposes) and the Transferred Chaus IPCO Interests and (iv) the Purchase
Price (as defined in the SS IP Asset Purchase Agreement) among the Acquired SS
Assets; in each case, in accordance with the Gross-Up Allocation, the
Specified Asset Allocation, the PRC Acquired Company Value and the Final
Allocation (as described below).

 

(ii) No later than ninety (90) days after the date on which the Purchase Price
is finally determined pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 1.3_, (x) HoldCo shall
deliver to Sellers Representative a proposed allocation of the Final CG OpCo
Purchase Price and the Final CCI OpCo Purchase Price (and any other items that
are treated as additional consideration in respect of CG OpCo, Overseas NewCo
and CCI OpCo for Tax purposes of the Closing Date), and (y) Buyer IPCo shall
deliver to Sellers Representative a proposed allocation of the Final IPCo
Purchase Price (and any other items that are treated as additional
consideration in respect of CCI IPCo and the Transferred Chaus IPCo Interests
for Tax purposes as of the Closing Date), in the case of each of clauses (x)
and (y), determined in a manner consistent with the Transaction Tax
Treatment, the Specified Asset Allocation, the Gross-Up Allocation, the PRC
Acquired Company Value and Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury
Regulations promulgated thereunder (collectively, the " _Buyers_ __
_Allocation_ "). If within forty-five (45) days after such delivery of Buyers
Allocation, Sellers Representative shall not have objected in writing to
Buyers Allocation, Buyers Allocation shall become the Final Allocation. If
Sellers Representative objects in writing to the Buyers Allocation within
forty-five (45) days after delivery thereof (" _Sellers_ __ _ Representative
Objection_ "), the relevant Buyer(s) and Sellers Representative shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to attempt to resolve any such disagreement.
If such Buyer(s) and Sellers Representative are unable to reach agreement on
any disputed issues within thirty (30) days of the delivery of Buyers
Allocation, the relevant Buyer(s) and Sellers Representative shall promptly
submit such disputed items to the Accounting Firm for resolution.
Any allocation determined by the Accounting Firm shall incorporate, reflect
and be consistent with the Transaction Tax Treatment, the Specified Asset
Allocation, the Gross-Up Allocation and the PRC Acquired Company Value. The
Buyers Allocation if no timely Sellers Representative Objection has been
given, as adjusted to reflect any agreement between the relevant Buyer(s) and
Sellers Representative or any determination by the Accounting Firm (in a
manner that incorporates, reflects and is consistent with the Transaction Tax
Treatment, the PRC Acquired Company Value, the Specified Asset Allocation and
the Gross-Up Allocation) shall be final and binding upon the Parties (the "
_Final Allocation_ "). Sellers Representative (on behalf of Sellers), on the
one hand, and the applicable Buyer(s), on the other, shall pay one half (50%)
of the fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm. The Parties shall make
appropriate adjustments to the Final Allocation to reflect adjustments to the
Final CG OpCo Purchase Price, the Final CCI OpCo Purchase Price or the Final
IPCo Purchase Price, as applicable.

 

(c) _Transaction Tax Reporting_. No Party shall (and each Party shall cause
its Affiliates not to) take any position that is inconsistent with the
Transaction Tax Treatment, the PRC Acquired Company Value, the Specified Asset
Allocation, the Gross-Up Allocation or the Final Allocation on any Tax Return,
in connection with any Tax Proceeding or otherwise, in each case, except to
the extent otherwise required pursuant to a "determination" within the meaning
of Section 1313(a) of the Code (or any corresponding provision of state, local
or foreign Law).

 



-50- 

    

(d) _Tax Indemnification by Sellers_. Subject to  _Section_ __ _ 5.9(l)_,
Sellers (on a several but not joint basis) shall pay or cause to be paid, and
shall indemnify the Buyers and their respective Affiliates (including, after
the Closing, the Acquired Companies) (collectively, the " _Buyer Tax
Indemnified Parties_ ") and hold each Buyer Tax Indemnified Party harmless
from and against, and the Camuto Owners (in accordance with the Liability
Basis) shall pay or cause to be paid and shall indemnify the Buyer
Tax Indemnified Parties and hold each Buyer Tax Indemnified Party harmless
from and against, without duplication, (i) any and all Taxes imposed on or
with respect to any Acquired Company or with respect to the Acquired SS Assets
for or in respect of any Pre-Closing Period (including, for the absence of
doubt, any Taxes resulting from any action taken or transaction effected
pursuant to, or in connection with, _Section_ __ _ 5.11(b)_ (Intercompany
Arrangements) or _Section_ __ _ 5.12_ (Pre-Closing Transactions)); (ii) any
and all Taxes of any of the Sellers or of any of the Camuto Owners; (iii) any
and all Taxes (A) imposed on an Acquired Company as a transferee or successor
as a result of an event or transaction occurring prior to the Closing, (B) for
which an Acquired Company is liable pursuant to any Tax indemnity, Tax
sharing, Tax allocation or any similar agreement or arrangement, or any other
contractual obligation to pay the Tax obligation of another Person or make any
payments to any other Person in respect of any tax attributes or benefits, in
each case, except for (x) customary provisions contained in commercial
contracts entered into in the ordinary course of business and not primarily
related to Taxes and (y) agreements entered into after the Closing, or (C) for
which an Acquired Company is liable under Treasury Regulations Section
1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state, local, or foreign Law) as a
result of an event or transaction occurring prior to the Closing; (iv) any
Taxes arising out of or relating to any breach of any covenant or agreement
of any Seller, the Sellers Representative or any of the Camuto Owners that is
contained in _Section_ __ _ 5.1(a)(ix)_, this  _Section_ __ _ 5.9_ or
_Section_ __ _ 5.12_ (Pre-Closing Transactions) or that is related to the
Estimated Tax Gross-Up Amount or the Tax Gross-Up Amount (including, without
limitation, _Section_ __ _ 1.2_ and _Section_ __ _ 1.3_); (v) any Taxes
imposed on or with respect to any Excluded Assets, (vi) any Taxes arising out
of or relating to any breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty
contained in _Section_ __ _ 2.11_ ( _provided_ that, other than those
representations and warranties contained in  _Sections_ __ _ 2.11(d)_,
_2.11(e)_ , _2.11(h)_ (last sentence only), _2.11(l)_ , _2.11(m)_ , _2.11(o)_
or _2.11(p)_ , no representation or warranty contained in _Section_ __ _
2.11_ shall apply with respect to any Post-Closing Period), (vii) any Foreign
Transfer Taxes, (viii) any Specified Foreign Taxes and (ix) any costs and
expenses, including reasonable legal fees and expenses, and any other Losses,
attributable to any item described in clauses (i) through (viii) above;
_provided_ , that, Sellers shall not be liable for any Tax under this
_Section_ __ _ 5.9(d)_ to the extent (1) the amount of such Tax was taken
into account as a liability for purposes of calculating the Final CG OpCo
Purchase Price, the Final CCI OpCo Purchase Price or the Final CCI IPCo
Purchase Price, as applicable, pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.3_, or (2) such
Tax is a Transfer Tax for which Buyers are liable pursuant to _Section_ __ _
5.9(i)_.

(e) _Straddle Periods_. For purposes of this Agreement, the portion of Taxes
attributable to the income, property or operations of the Acquired Companies
for any taxable period that begins on or before the Closing Date and ends
after the Closing Date (a " _Straddle Period_ ") will be apportioned between
the portion of the Straddle Period that begins on or before the Closing Date
and ends on and includes the Closing Date (the " _Pre-Closing Straddle
Period_") 

 



-51- 

    

 and the portion of the Straddle Period that begins the day after the Closing
Date and ends at the end of the Straddle Period (the " _Post-Closing Straddle
Period_ ") in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 5.9(e)_. In the case of
any Straddle Period, the portion of Taxes for such Straddle Period that is
attributable to the Pre-Closing Straddle Period will: (i) in the case of
personal property, real property, and other Taxes that are not transaction-
based, be deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for the entire Straddle Period
multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the
Pre-Closing Straddle Period and the denominator of which is the number of days
in such entire Straddle Period and (ii) in the case of any other Taxes, be
calculated as if the applicable taxable period ended on and included the
Closing Date ( _provided_ that exemptions, allowances or deductions that are
calculated on an annual basis shall be apportioned on a daily basis);
_provided_ that any Taxes described in clause (i) above imposed with respect
to any asset not held by any Acquired Company prior to the Closing shall be
attributable solely to the Post-Closing Straddle Period. The portion of Taxes
attributable to a Post-Closing Straddle Period will be calculated in a
corresponding manner; _provided_ that any Taxes described in clause (i) above
imposed with respect to any Excluded Asset or other asset not held by any
Acquired Company at the Closing shall be attributable solely to the Pre-
Closing Straddle Period. Each Acquired Company that is classified as a
partnership or "flow-through" entity for Tax purposes shall be treated for
purposes of this Agreement as if its taxable year ended on the Closing Date
and Taxes attributable to the income and gain of each such entity through the
Closing Date shall be considered to be attributable to the Pre-Closing
Straddle Period.

 

(f) _Tax Returns_.

 

(i) Except as specifically provided in _Section_ __ _ 5.9(i)_ (Transfer
Taxes), Sellers Representative shall prepare or cause to be prepared all Tax
Returns of the Acquired Companies that are required to be filed with respect
to any taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date (the " _Pre-Closing
 Period Returns_"). The Pre-Closing Period Returns prepared and filed by
Sellers Representative shall be prepared in a manner that is consistent with
the prior practice of the applicable Acquired Company (including prior Tax
elections and accounting methods or conventions made or utilized by the
Acquired Company) (" _Prior Practice_ "), except as otherwise required by Law.
Sellers Representative shall timely file or cause to be timely filed Pre-
Closing Period Returns due (including valid extensions) on or before the
Closing Date. With respect to Pre-Closing Period Returns due (taking
into account valid extensions) after the Closing Date, Sellers
Representative shall deliver such Pre-Closing Period Returns to the relevant
Buyer (which, for purposes of this  _Section_ __ _ 5.9(f)_ and _Section_ __
_ 5.9(h)_ shall mean HoldCo, in the case of any Tax Return, Taxes or Tax
Proceedings of or with respect to CG OpCo, any Subsidiary of CG OpCo, Overseas
NewCo, any Subsidiary of Overseas NewCo, CCI OpCo or any Subsidiary of CCI
OpCo, and Buyer IPCo, in the case of any Tax Return, Taxes or Tax Proceedings
of or with respect to CCI IPCo, any Subsidiary of CCI IPCo, Chaus IPCo or any
Subsidiary of Chaus IPCo) for review and comment at least 30 days prior to
such due date (except where such due date is within 30 days after the Closing,
in which case as soon as practical). Within 10 days of receiving a draft of
such Tax Return (except where the relevant due date was within 30 days after
the Closing, in which case as soon as practical), the relevant Buyer may
provide written comments to the Sellers Representative. Sellers
Representative and the relevant Buyer shall cooperate in good faith to
resolve any dispute prior to the due date of any such Pre-Closing Period
Return.

 



-52- 

    

 If Sellers Representative and the relevant Buyer cannot resolve any
disputed item, the item in question shall be resolved by the Accounting Firm
as promptly as practicable. The fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm in
connection with its work pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5.9(f)(i)_ shall be
paid fifty percent (50%) by Sellers Representative and fifty percent (50%) by
the relevant Buyer. For the absence of doubt, the filing of any Pre-Closing
Period Return shall not be delayed beyond its due date (taking into account
valid extensions) on account of any unresolved disagreement between
Sellers Representative and the relevant Buyer; _provided_ , that the Parties
shall promptly amend any such previously-filed Pre-Closing Period Return to
reflect the Accounting Firms subsequent determination pursuant to this
paragraph. Except as may be determined by the Accounting Firm or as otherwise
provided by this Agreement, without the consent of Sellers Representative
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed) neither Buyer nor any Acquired Company will (i) amend, or cause to
be amended, any Pre-Closing Period Return or (ii) make any Tax election that
has retroactive effect with respect to any Pre-Closing Period.

(ii) The relevant Buyer will prepare or cause to be prepared and timely file
or cause to be timely filed Straddle Period Returns required to be filed by
any Acquired Company. The relevant Buyer will prepare and file the Straddle
Period Returns that it is required to file pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _
5.9(f)(ii)_ in a manner that is consistent with Prior Practice, except as
otherwise required by Law. Each Buyer shall deliver all income and other
material Straddle Period Returns that it is responsible for
preparing pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5.9(f)(ii)_ to Sellers
Representative for review and comment at least 30 days prior to the due date
(taking into account valid extensions) for filing such Tax Returns (except
where such due date is within 30 days after the Closing, in which case as
soon as practical). Within 10 days of receiving a draft of such Tax Return
(except where the relevant due date was within 30 days after the Closing, in
which case as soon as practical), Sellers Representative may provide written
comments to the relevant Buyer. The relevant Buyer shall revise such Tax
Returns to reflect any written comments received from Sellers Representative
at such Buyers reasonable discretion. 

(g) _Cooperation_. The Parties will, and will cause their respective
Affiliates to, provide each other with such assistance as may reasonably be
requested in connection with (i) the preparation and filing of any Tax Return
of any Acquired Company or otherwise relating to the transactions contemplated
hereby, (ii) the conduct of any Tax Proceeding relating to Taxes of or with
respect to any Acquired Company, or (iii) the determination of any
responsibility for, or indemnification obligation in respect of, any Taxes, or
entitlement to any refund of Taxes. Notwithstanding  _Section_ __ _ 5.2(b)_,
the Parties and their respective Affiliates will retain for the full period of
any statute of limitations, and upon reasonable request will provide each
Other Party with, any records or information that may be relevant to such
preparation, filing, Tax Proceeding or determination.

(h) _Audits_. If any Taxing Authority issues to any Seller, any Acquired
Company, any Buyer, any Camuto Owner or any of their respective Affiliates a
written notice of its intent to audit, examine or conduct a Tax Proceeding
with respect to Taxes or Tax Returns of any Acquired Company for a taxable
period ending on or before the Closing Date or a Straddle Period, in each
case, for which any Other Party may be liable pursuant to this Agreement (a "
_Tax_

 



-53- 

    

  _Claim_ "), the Party receiving such notice will give prompt notice to the
Other Parties of such Tax Claim following receipt; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that any failure by the relevant Buyer to timely notify Sellers
Representative will not relieve Sellers or the Camuto Owners from any of their
respective obligations or liability hereunder (including this _Section_ __ _
5.9_), except to the extent the Sellers or the Camuto Owners are actually and
materially prejudiced as a consequence of such failure. If amounts (other than
immaterial amounts) are then remaining in the Indemnity Escrow Fund, Sellers
Representative shall have the right to control, at the sole cost and expense
of the Sellers and the Camuto Owners, any Tax Proceeding (or portion thereof)
against an Acquired Company that is solely in respect of a taxable period
ending on or before the Closing Date to the extent relating solely to a Tax
Claim for which Sellers or the Camuto Owners may be liable hereunder (a "
_Seller s Tax Contest_"); _provided_ that if the Buyer is unable to, after
using commercially reasonable efforts to do so, sever such Tax Proceeding
such that the Sellers Representative is able to control solely the relevant
portion of such Tax Proceeding relating solely to such Tax Claim, such Tax
Proceeding shall be a Buyers Tax Contest; _provided_ ,  _further_ , that (i)
the relevant Buyer will have the right to participate in such Sellers Tax
Contest, (ii) Sellers Representative will provide the relevant Buyer with
copies of all written documents received from or submitted to a Taxing
Authority in connection with such Sellers Tax Contest and consult with the
relevant Buyer with respect thereto and consider in good faith any comments
from the relevant Buyer with respect thereto and (iii) if such Sellers Tax
Contest would, or would reasonably be expected to, have a material adverse
effect on any Buyer or any of its respective Affiliates, Sellers
Representative shall not settle, compromise or abandon such Sellers Tax
Contest without the prior written consent of the relevant Buyer (not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). The relevant Buyer will
control any Tax Proceeding (or portion thereof) against any Acquired Company
that is not a Sellers Tax Contest, including any Tax Proceeding that arises
at a time in which no amounts (or immaterial amounts) remain in the Indemnity
Escrow Fund (a " _Buyer s Tax Contest_"); _provided_ that, in the case of any
Buyers Tax Contest for a Straddle Period or a taxable period ending on or
before the Closing Date, (x) if such Buyers Tax Contest would, or would
reasonably be expected to, have a material adverse effect on any Sellers or
Camuto Owners, Sellers Representative, at its sole cost and expense, will
have the right to participate in such Buyers Tax Contest, (y) the relevant
Buyer will provide Sellers Representative with copies of all written
documents received from or submitted to a Taxing Authority in connection with
such Buyers Tax Contest, consult with Sellers Representative with respect
thereto and consider in good faith any comments from Sellers Representative
with respect thereto and (z) if such Buyers Tax Contest would, or would
reasonably be expected to, have a material adverse effect on any Sellers or
Camuto Owners, the relevant Buyer shall not settle, compromise or abandon any
such Buyers Tax Contest without the prior written consent of the Sellers
Representative (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). In
the event that Sellers Representative fails to assume the defense of any
Sellers Tax Contest with respect to which it has received notice pursuant to
this _Section_ __ _ 5.9(h)_, Buyers shall not be required to assume the
control of such Tax Proceeding. For the avoidance of doubt, Sellers
Representatives failure to assume the defense of any Sellers Tax Contest
(or failure to participate in any Buyers Tax Contest) shall not relieve
Sellers or the Camuto Owners of any of their respective obligations or
liability under this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, any Tax
Proceedings in existence as of the Closing Date shall be subject to the same
procedures set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 5.9(h)_ that apply to Tax
Proceedings arising after the Closing Date.

 



-54- 

    

(i) _Transfer Taxes_.

 

(i) All transfer, documentary, sales, use, excise, stamp, registration,
filing, recordation, value-added and other similar Taxes that may be imposed
on the OpCo Acquisition or the IPCo Acquisition, other than Foreign Transfer
Taxes (" _Transfer Taxes_ "), will be borne one half by the Sellers (on a
several but not joint basis) and the Camuto Owners (in accordance with the
Liability Basis), on the one hand, and one half by the relevant Buyer, on the
other, and will be paid to the appropriate Taxing Authority promptly when due
by the Person having the primary obligation to remit such Transfer Tax under
applicable Law. The relevant Buyer may recover Transfer Taxes to be borne by
Sellers or the Camuto Owners directly from such Sellers or Camuto Owners or,
at such Buyers election, from the Adjustment Escrow Funds. Any Tax Returns
that must be filed in connection with Transfer Taxes will be prepared by the
Party primarily or customarily responsible under applicable Law for filing
such Tax Returns, and such Party will use commercially reasonable efforts to
provide such Tax Returns to each Other Party at least ten (10) Business Days
prior to the date such Tax Returns are due to be filed. Buyers, the Camuto
Owners, Sellers and Sellers Representative (and their respective Affiliates)
will cooperate in the timely completion and filing of all such Tax Returns.

(ii) The Parties agree to report to the competent PRC Taxing Authority
the indirect transfer of the PRC Acquired Company in the CG OpCo Acquisition
and to file, within thirty days following the date hereof, any required
documentation with respect thereto pursuant to SAT Public Notice [2015] No. 7
(the " _Notice 7 Filing_ "). The Parties shall in good faith cooperate to
expeditiously prepare and file the Notice 7 Filing in accordance herewith, and
agree that the Sellers Representative (or its designee) shall manage such
preparation and filing in its reasonable discretion; _provided_ , that
Sellers Representative shall in good faith consult with HoldCo and keep
HoldCo informed with respect to such preparation and filing and shall consider
in good faith any comments provided by HoldCo with respect to such filing.
Each of the Camuto Owners, Sellers, Overseas and the Sellers Representative
shall, and each shall cause its Affiliates to, (x) promptly deliver to HoldCo
(or its designee) such records or documentation as HoldCo may reasonably
request with respect to the Notice 7 Filing and (y) notify HoldCo promptly,
but in no event later than five (5) days, after receipt of any query or
request received from any PRC Taxing Authority with respect to the Notice 7
Filing. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, (1) each of HoldCo
and Sellers Representative shall inform the other in advance of, and shall
have the right to participate in, all communications and proceedings with
the competent PRC Taxing Authority relating to the Notice 7 Filing and (2)
for purposes of this Agreement and the Notice 7 Filing, and for all other
purposes (including any communications with or submissions to the competent
PRC Taxing Authority with respect to the Prior PRC Acquisition), the Parties
agree that the value of the PRC Acquired Company shall be determined in
accordance with Section 5.9(i)(ii) of the Sellers Disclosure Schedule (the "
_PRC Acquired Company Value_ "), and the Notice 7 Filing shall be prepared in
a manner consistent with the PRC Acquired Company Value.

 



-55- 

    

(iii) If each of the Camuto Owners, Sellers, Overseas and the
Sellers Representative complies with _Section_ __ _ 5.9(i)(ii)_, then (x)
HoldCo shall be responsible for and shall pay, and shall indemnify Sellers,
the Camuto Owners and Overseas for, 50% of the amount of any Taxes imposed by
the competent PRC Taxing Authority with respect to the indirect transfer of
the PRC Acquired Company in the CG OpCo Acquisition and (y) if the competent
PRC Taxing Authority imposes any Taxes with respect to Overseass acquisition
of the PRC Acquired Company in the Prior PRC Acquisition, HoldCo shall be
responsible for and shall pay, and shall indemnify Sellers, the Camuto Owners
and Overseas for, 50% of the amount of such Taxes (but excluding any
penalties, interest or additions thereto). For the avoidance of doubt, the
Camuto Owners, Sellers and Overseas shall be solely responsible for and shall
pay, and shall indemnify the Buyer Tax Indemnified Parties for, any penalties,
interest or additions to Tax imposed by any competent PRC Taxing Authority in
respect of the Prior PRC Acquisition. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, Holdco shall be entitled to any refund, credit or
offset of, or attributable to, any Taxes in respect of which HoldCo paid an
amount pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5.9(i)(iii)_.

(j) _Tax Sharing_. All Tax indemnity, Tax sharing, Tax allocation or similar
agreements or arrangements between or among, one or more Acquired Companies,
on the one hand, and one or more of the Sellers, Camuto Owners or the Camuto
Heirs, on the other hand (other than this Agreement) will be terminated as of
the Closing Date and, after the Closing Date, no Acquired Company will be
bound thereby or have any Liability thereunder for any past or future period.

 

(k) _FIRPTA_. On the Closing Date, each Selling Entity shall deliver to Buyers
(i) a duly executed certificate of non-foreign status substantially in the
form of the sample certification set forth in Treasury Regulations Section
1.1445-2(b)(2)(iv)(B) in respect of such Selling Entity (collectively, the "
_FIRPTA Certificates_ ") and (ii) a properly completed and executed IRS Form
W-9.

 

(l) _Timing and Condition of Payments; Survival; Coordination_.

 

(i) Any indemnification payments required pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 5.9(d)_
shall be made within ten (10) Business Days of written demand therefor from
the applicable Buyer Tax Indemnified Party, subject to and in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 8.9(b)_; _provided_ , that in the case of Taxes that are not
yet due and payable, no indemnification payment shall be required earlier
than five (5) days prior to the date on which such Taxes are required to be
paid to the applicable Taxing Authority.

 

(ii) For purposes of calculating the amount of any Taxes relating to a breach
or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty set forth in _Section_ __ _
2.11_, and whether there is any breach or inaccuracy of such representation or
warranty, any materiality limitations or qualifications (including the terms
"material" or "materially") set forth therein will be disregarded.

(iii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
the representations and warranties in _Section_ __ _ 2.11_ shall survive the
Closing Date in full force and effect until 60 calendar days following the
expiration of all applicable statutes of limitations; _provided_ that any
such representation or warranty that is the subject of any

 



-56- 

    

 claim under _Section_ __ _ 5.9(d)_ with respect to which a notice is
delivered by a Buyer Tax Indemnified Party prior to the expiration of the
survival period set forth in this  _Section_ __ _ 5.9(l)(iii)_ shall survive
solely for purposes of resolution of such claim until such claim is fully and
finally resolved.

 

(iv) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
indemnification with respect to Taxes that are the subject of  _Section_ __ _
5.9(d)_, and all procedures relating to Taxes, Tax matters and indemnification
in respect thereof, shall be governed exclusively by this _Section_ __ _
5.9_, _Section_ __ _ 8.1_ (Survival), _Section_ __ _ 8.5(a)_ (Obligation to
Seek Insurance Proceeds), _Section_ __ _ 8.5(b)_ (Losses Determined Net of
Eligible Insurance Proceeds), _Section_ __ _ 8.5(e)(iv)_ (Caps),  _Section_
__ _ 8.5(e)(vi)_ (Caps), _Section_ __ _ 8.5(e)(vii)_ (Caps), _Section_ __ _
8.5(f)_ (Fraud), _Section_ __ _ 8.7_ (Adjusted Purchase Price) and 
_Section_ __ _ 8.9_ (Escrow Release and Satisfaction of Claims), and the
provisions of _Article_ __ _ 8_ (other than the provisions specifically
listed in this sentence) shall not apply.

 

(m) _Refunds_. With respect to any refunds of Taxes (including any refunded
interest thereon) for any Pre-Closing Period received by an Acquired Company
(" _Pre-Closing Tax Refunds_"), the applicable Buyer shall promptly pay, or
cause to paid, (x) to the Indemnity Escrow Fund any Pre-Closing Tax Refunds
received before the Final Escrow Release Time and (y) to the Sellers
Representative (for distribution to the Camuto Article X Trusts and
the Camuto Estate) any Pre-Closing Tax Refunds received after the Final
Escrow Release Time but before the Retention 50% Time, in the case of each of
(x) and (y), only to the extent such Tax refund was not taken into account as
an asset (or an offset to a liability) for purposes of calculating the Final
CG OpCo Purchase Price, the Final CCI OpCo Purchase Price or the Final CCI
IPCo Purchase Price, as applicable, pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 1.3_. For
the absence of doubt, the preceding sentence shall not apply to any Tax
refunds received after the Retention 50% Time, and such Tax refunds shall be
retained by the applicable Buyer. Each Buyer shall, in good faith, timely
apply for any Pre-Closing Tax Refunds known by such Buyer to be available. The
" _Retention 50% Time_ " means the first point at which, in the reasonable
good faith judgment of the applicable Buyer, the amount of the Restricted
Proceeds is less than 50% of the Final Closing Cash Payment.

 

Section 5.10 _Releases_. Effective upon Closing, each Camuto Owner and Seller,
on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, successors and assigns, irrevocably
and unconditionally waives, releases and forever discharges the Acquired
Companies, Buyers and their respective Affiliates, directors, officers,
employees, successors and assigns from any and all rights, claims, debts,
Liabilities, causes of action, obligations and Losses of any nature or kind,
whether direct or indirect, known or unknown, matured or contingent, accrued
or unaccrued, liquidated or unliquidated or due or to become due, whether for
compensatory, special, consequential, incidental or punitive damages or
equitable relief, whether based on fraud, Contract or any other basis, and
whether arising in Law, in equity or otherwise, based upon facts,
circumstances, occurrences or omissions existing, occurring or arising on or
prior to Closing; _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing release does not
cover the following matters (and, for purposes of clarity, such matters are
not hereby released or discharged): (a) accrued but unpaid compensation for
employment services and vested benefits under any Employee Benefit Plan (if
applicable); (b) claims or rights arising under this Agreement (including
_Article_ __ _ 8_ of this Agreement) or under any other Transaction
Document; (c) the obligations of any Acquired

 



-57- 

    

 Company to indemnify, defend and hold harmless its directors, managers,
officers and employees in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 5.17_; (d) the
obligations of any insurer under any Insurance Policy or (e) claims or rights
arising under any Contract or arrangement set forth in Section 5.10 of the
Sellers Disclosure Schedule (the " _Surviving Related Party Agreements_ ").

 

Section 5.11 _Related Party Agreements_ _; Intercompany Arrangements_.

 

(a) At or prior to the Closing, Sellers shall cause the Acquired Companies to
terminate, or otherwise amend to exclude the applicable Acquired Company as a
party thereto and to obtain a full and unconditional release of all claims
related thereto, past, present and future, known and unknown, liquidated and
contingent, without cost or expense to the Acquired Companies, all Related
Party Agreements set forth in Section 2.19 of the Sellers Disclosure Schedule
(other than the Surviving Related Party Agreements), and no amounts will be
owed by, or owing to, any Acquired Company pursuant to any such Related Party
Agreements and no Acquired Company shall have any Liability under any such
Related Party Agreement, whether arising prior to or after the Closing or in
connection with such termination or amendment or otherwise.

 

(b) The Sellers agree to provide Buyers with a complete and accurate schedule
of Liabilities between any Seller or any of its Subsidiaries or other equity
investments (other than any Acquired Company), on the one hand, and any
Acquired Company, on the other hand (collectively, " _Intercompany
Liabilities_ "), no later than five (5) Business Days after the date
hereof. Promptly following the date of this Agreement, Sellers shall consult
and cooperate with Buyers in developing a transaction step plan designed to
eliminate the Intercompany Liabilities while minimizing, to the extent
possible, any Taxes arising from the consummation of the steps in such plan,
and Sellers agree to use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause such
steps to be consummated prior to or in connection with the Closing. Sellers
shall consult with Buyers, and incorporate Buyers reasonable comments, in
preparing the documentation with respect to the consummation of such step
plan. Unless otherwise consented to by Holdco, (a) with respect to any
Intercompany Liability payable to any Acquired Company that is not wholly
owned, directly or indirectly, by Sellers, Sellers shall cause such
Intercompany Liability to be paid in full, and (b) with respect to any
Intercompany Liability payable by any Acquired Company that is not wholly
owned, directly or indirectly by Sellers, Sellers shall cause the right to
receive payment in respect of such Intercompany Liability to be contributed to
CG OpCo or CCI OpCo (or an Acquired Company that will be, following the
consummation of the Pre-Closing Transactions, a wholly owned Subsidiary
thereof), in each case, such that following the consummation of such step, the
applicable Intercompany Liability ceases to be an Intercompany Liability.

 

Section 5.12 _Pre-Closing __Transactions_. Prior to the Closing, the Sellers
and the Camuto Owners shall effect, and shall cause the Acquired Companies to
effect, pursuant to documentation reasonably acceptable to Buyers, Sellers and
the Camuto Owners, the restructuring and other transactions set forth in
Section __ 5.12 of the Sellers Disclosure Schedule (the " _Pre-Closing T_
_ransactions_ _"_ _)._ Sellers shall in good faith, and on a prompt and timely
basis, consult with each Buyer and keep each Buyer reasonably apprised of the
implementation of the Pre-Closing Transactions and the execution of any
transaction documentation related thereto, including the execution of the CCI
IP Contribution Agreement substantially in the form set forth 

 



-58- 

    

 on _Exhibit_ __ _ 5.12(a)_, the BCI IP Contribution Agreement substantially
in the form set forth on _Exhibit_ __ _ 5.12(b)_, the Chaus IPCo
Membership Interest Transfer Agreement substantially in the form set forth on
_Exhibit_ __ _ 5.12(c)_ and the SSI IP Asset Purchase Agreement substantially
in the form set forth on _Exhibit_ __ _ 5.12(d)_.

 

Section 5.13 _Post-Closing Securities Filings_. Following the Closing, the
Camuto Owners will, and will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
auditors of Sellers to, cooperate with HoldCo, as reasonably requested by
HoldCo, in the preparation of financial information, including Acquired
Company pro forma financial information and audited annual and interim
quarterly financial statements for the Acquired Companies, to be filed by DSW
following the consummation of the Transactions on a Current Report on Form 8-K
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as it may be amended, and will
instruct and use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the auditors of the
Acquired Companies to provide all consents as needed in connection with such
filing. HoldCo shall be responsible for, and shall pay, all reasonable out-
of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by the Camuto Owners in connection with
the cooperation required by or requested pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _
5.13_.

Section 5.14 _Lease Modifications, Terminations and Renewals_ _; Estoppel
Letters; Consents_.

(a) From the date of this Agreement until the Closing, Sellers shall,
and shall cause the Acquired Companies to, cooperate reasonably with HoldCo,
as HoldCo shall request in writing and at HoldCos expense, to seek extensions
or renewals of each of the Leases identified on Section 5.14 of the Sellers
Disclosure Schedule, it being understood that Sellers shall not exercise any
option to extend or any Lease or Sublease or otherwise extend or renew any
Leases or Subleases without HoldCos prior written consent (not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). In furtherance and not in
limitation of the foregoing, Sellers and the Acquired Companies shall (i)
consult in good faith with HoldCo with respect to the manner in which such
extensions or renewals may be sought; (ii) without HoldCos prior consent,
not communicate with any landlord or schedule or participate in any meeting
with any landlord, in either case regarding any extension or renewal, and
HoldCo shall have the right to join any such meeting by telephone or in
person; _provided_ that Sellers shall provide reasonable advance notice to,
and invite HoldCo to join, any meeting with any landlord concerning the Leases
identified on Section 5.14 of the Sellers Disclosure Schedule; and (iii)
consult with HoldCo prior to creating or responding to, and provide HoldCo in
advance copies of, all drafts of any renewal or extension documents and a
reasonable opportunity to comment before negotiating or executing such
documents. Without the prior written consent of HoldCo (not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed), Seller shall not, and shall cause the
Acquired Companies not to, agree to any renewals or extensions, amendments,
modifications, terminations, releases or financing arrangements (including
with respect to any guaranties), with respect to any Leases or Subleases, or
enter into any new leases, subleases or concessions or other occupancy
agreements with respect to any real property, or purchase or acquire any
interest in any real property, or enter into any agreement to do so with
respect to any of the foregoing.

(b) From the date of this Agreement to the Closing, subject to the further
provisions of _Section_ __ _ 5.14(c)_, Sellers shall, and shall cause the
Acquired Companies to, cooperate with HoldCo, at HoldCos request and at
HoldCos expense, in obtaining estoppel letters from

 



-59- 

    

 landlords under each Lease set forth under the heading "Category I Lease
Consents" on Section 5.14 of the Sellers Disclosure Schedule and the tenants
under the Subleases, with respect to those matters as may be provided in the
respective Leases or Subleases with respect to such estoppel letters (or if
there are no such provisions, with respect to the current annual fixed rent,
additional rent, expiration date and renewal terms, and whether to the
landlords or tenants knowledge, there are any outstanding defaults).

(c) From the date of this Agreement to the Closing, Sellers shall, and shall
cause the Acquired Companies to, use their commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain and deliver to HoldCo a written consent to the Transactions, the Pre-
Closing Transactions and the Estate Transactions (including a waiver of any
right to terminate or recapture, as the case may be) with respect to (i) each
Lease set forth under the heading "Category I Leases" on Section 5.14 of the
Sellers Disclosure Schedule; and (ii) at least five (5) of the Leases set
forth under the heading "Category II Leases" on Section 5.14 of the
Sellers Disclosure Schedule, in each case in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to HoldCo and Sellers.

Section 5.15  _Change-of-Control and Customers_. From the date of this
Agreement until Closing, Sellers shall (and shall cause the Acquired Companies
to) cooperate reasonably with HoldCo to obtain any consents required from
third parties in connection with the consummation of the Transaction pursuant
to all Contracts between the Acquired Companies and the vendors, suppliers,
customers, service providers or consultants thereof (" _Consent Contracts_
"), Leases and Licenses. In furtherance and not in limitation of the
foregoing, Sellers and the Acquired Companies shall (a) consult in good faith
with HoldCo with respect to the manner in which such consents or waivers are
to be sought, (b) invite HoldCo to participate in any meetings with third
parties concerning any Consent Contract, Lease, or License and make available
appropriate members of the management of the Acquired Companies to attend or
participate in such meetings, and (c) upon the written request of HoldCo,
provide Buyers with drafts of, and a reasonable opportunity to comment on, the
form of any waiver or consent to be sought pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _
5.15_. In addition, upon the reasonable request of HoldCo, Sellers shall (and
prior to Closing, shall cause the Acquired Companies to) cooperate reasonably
with HoldCo to make introductions to the vendors, suppliers, customers,
service providers and consultants of the Acquired Companies to facilitate the
transition of the Business to HoldCo at and after Closing. If Buyers elect to
proceed with the Closing prior to obtaining any of the consents contemplated
by this _Section_ __ _ 5.15_, Buyers and Sellers shall be equally
responsible for and pay such reasonable expenses as are necessary in
connection with the solicitation or receipt of any such consent after the
Closing; _provided_  that neither Buyers nor Sellers shall agree to the
payment of any such expenses without the prior written consent of the other
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 

Section 5.16 _Release of Guarantees_ _and Certain Other Obligations_. From and
after the date hereof, Sellers and HoldCo shall use their reasonable best
efforts to cause Sellers, their Affiliates (other than the Acquired Companies)
and the Representatives to be fully released (or, with respect to the Seller
Guarantees, otherwise made whole to their reasonable satisfaction), on or
prior to the Closing Date, in respect of all obligations under any guarantees,
letters of credit, letters of comfort, bid bonds or performance or surety
bonds or cash or other collateral obtained or given by Sellers or their
Affiliates (other than the Acquired Companies) relating to the Acquired
Companies, the Assets or the Business which are set forth in Section 5.16 of
the Sellers

 



-60- 

    

 Disclosure Schedule (collectively, the " _Sellers Guarantees_ ") and the
leases set forth on Section 5.16(b) of the Sellers Disclosure Schedule
(collectively, " _Released Leases_ "); _provided_ that the Parties shall not
condition the obtaining of any consents pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 5.14(c)_
on the granting by any counterparty of a release pursuant to this  _Section_
__ _ 5.16_. With respect to each Sellers Guarantee or Released Lease for
which Sellers and HoldCo do not obtain such release prior to the Closing,
HoldCo or an Affiliate of Holdco shall, concurrently with the Closing, enter
into a hold harmless agreement with respect to each such Sellers Guarantee or
Released Lease in a form reasonably acceptable to Sellers and HoldCo. After
the Closing Date, HoldCo will not, and will not permit any of its Affiliates
to, renew or extend, or amend or supplement in any way that increases or
extends the obligations of HoldCo or any Acquired Company thereunder, any
Contract or other obligation that is covered by a Sellers Guarantee or
Released Lease without providing Sellers with evidence reasonably
satisfactory to it that the Sellers Guarantee or Released Lease, and any cash
or other collateral posted by Sellers or their Affiliates with respect
thereto, has either been released in full or Seller and its Affiliates
have otherwise been made whole in respect thereof to their reasonable
satisfaction. Any cash or other collateral posted by Sellers or their
Affiliates in respect of any Sellers Guarantee or Released Lease that is
released pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 5.16_ shall be delivered to
Sellers within two (2) Business Days of such release.

 

Section 5.17 _Indemnification of Directors and Officers_.

 

(a) Buyers agree that all rights to indemnification for acts or omissions
occurring prior to the Closing now existing in favor of the current or former
directors, managers, officers and employees (or persons holding similar
positions) of any Acquired Company who have the right to indemnification by
such Acquired Company (collectively, the " _Covered Persons_ ") as provided
in such Acquired Companys Organizational Documents, indemnity or
indemnification agreements, as provided under Law shall survive the
transactions contemplated hereby and shall continue in full force and effect
in accordance with their terms for a period of not less than six (6) years
from the Closing. Without limiting the foregoing, for a period of not less
than six (6) years from the Closing, Buyers shall not, and shall not permit
the Acquired Companies to, amend, modify or terminate any Organizational
Document or Contract regarding or related to such indemnification matters.

(b) The provisions of this  _Section_ __ _ 5.17_ are: (i) intended to be for
the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Covered Person and each
other Person entitled to indemnification or coverage under a policy referenced
in this  _Section_ __ _ 5.17_, and each such Persons heirs, legatees,
representatives, successors and assigns, it being expressly agreed that such
Persons shall be third party beneficiaries of this  _Section_ __ _ 5.17_,
and (ii) in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to
indemnification or contribution that any such Person may have by Contract or
otherwise.

 

(c) If any Buyer or its successors or assigns: (i) shall consolidate with or
merge into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) shall transfer
all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and
in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of such Buyer shall assume all of the obligations of such Buyer set
forth in this _Section_ __ _ 5.17_.

 



-61- 

    

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this  _Section_ __
_ 5.17_, no Buyer nor any Acquired Company (or any of their successors or
assigns) shall be required or obligated to make any indemnification payment
(or advancement of expenses) in respect of any matter to which a Buyer
Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification under _Article_ __ _ 8_ and,
which respect to which matter such Covered Person had knowledge of, or should
have had knowledge of, the facts and circumstances giving rise to such right
to indemnification in favor of such Buyer Indemnified Party (for this purpose,
ignoring any limitations set forth in _Article_ __ _ 8_, the application of
which, would result in no indemnification payment being made to a Buyer
Indemnified Party).

Section 5.18 _Fleet Street License Agreement_. Sellers shall pay to
Buyer IPCo its pro rata share of the net recovery for the period commencing
on April 1, 2018 through the end of the term of the Fleet Street License
Agreement, if any, promptly following actual receipt thereof by Sellers. For
the purposes of this  _Section_ __ _ 5.18_, (a) the "pro rata share of the
net recovery" shall be equal to (i) the net recovery, _multiplied by_ (ii) the
ratio of (x) the total days from and including the Closing to the end of the
term of the Fleet Street License Agreement to (y) the total days from and

only.

Section 8.5 _Certain Limitations_. The rights of the Buyer Indemnified
Parties to indemnification pursuant to this _Article_ __ _ 8_ are subject to
the following limitations:

(a)  _Obligation to Seek Insurance Proceeds_.

(i) Except with respect to Expressly Excluded Claims, no Buyer
Indemnified Party shall be permitted to bring a Claim against the Seller
Indemnifying Parties under _Section_ __ _ 8.2(a)_, _Section_ __ _ 8.3(a)_ or
_Section_ __ _ 5.9(d)_ (other than  _Section_ __ _ 5.9(d)(iv)_) unless the
applicable Buyer has (A) first sought to recover for the related Losses or
Taxes under the RandW Insurance Policy and (B) been denied coverage with respect
to such Losses or Taxes as a result of the determination by the Primary
Underwriter that such Claim is not covered (including by reason of the
application of the Exclusion Provisions) under the RandW Insurance Policy, which
denial is affirmed pursuant to Article XI (Governing Law; Arbitration) of the
RandW Insurance Policy (such Claims, " _Determined Exclusion Claims_ " and,
together with Expressly Excluded Claims, the " _Excluded Claims_ ");
_provided_ , that from the date that is 30 days prior to the expiration of
the applicable survival period set forth in _Section_ __ _ 8.1_, a Buyer
Indemnified Party shall be permitted to bring a Claim against the Seller
Indemnifying Parties under  _Section_ __ _ 8.2(a)_, _Section_ __ _ 8.3(a)_
or _Section_ __ _ 5.9(d)_ without being subject to the foregoing limitations
if, simultaneously with bringing such Claim, the same Claim is also made
under the RandW Insurance Policy. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this _Section_
__ _ 8.5(a)(i)_ shall not prevent any Buyer Indemnified Party from bringing a
Claim against the Seller Indemnifying Parties under  _Section_ __ _ 8.2(a)_,
_Section_ __ _ 8.3(a)_ or _Section_ __ _ 5.9(d)_ for any Excluded Claim.
Without limiting the foregoing, the Buyer Indemnified Parties and the Seller
Indemnified Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to collect any
amounts available under insurance policies, including the Insurance Policies
(with respect to the Buyer Indemnified Parties), or recoverable from non-
Affiliated Persons with respect to Losses incurred by such Buyer Indemnified
Party or such Seller Indemnified Party.

 

(ii) If a Buyer Indemnified Party recovers insurance proceeds from the Primary
Underwriter under the RandW Insurance Policy for a Claim pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 8.2(a)_ or _Section_ __ _ 8.3(a)_ and the amount of such recovery is
less than such Buyer Indemnified Partys determination of its Loss with
respect to such Claim, then the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall not have the
right to make a claim against the Seller Indemnifying Parties for the
remaining portion of such Loss not so recovered from the Primary Underwriter;
_provided_ , _however_ , that, with respect to a Claim arising out of or
resulting from a breach or inaccuracy of any Seller Fundamental
Representation, if the amount of the recovery of the applicable Buyer
Indemnified Party is less than such Buyer 

 



-68- 

    

 Indemnified Partys determination of its Loss with respect to such claim as
a result of the application of the total policy limit under the RandW Insurance
Policy, then the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall have the right to make a
claim against the Seller Indemnified Parties for the remaining portion of such
Loss in excess of the total policy limit under the RandW Insurance Policy.

 

(iii) If any Claim brought by a Buyer Indemnified Party pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 8.2(a)_ or  _Section_ __ _ 8.3(a)_ for breach of a representation or
warranty is denied under the RandW Insurance Policy (A) solely on the basis of
the Primary Underwriters determination that the Loss is not covered under
the RandW Insurance Policy because the Loss did not arise out of or result from
a breach of such representation or warranty and (B) without reference to any
Exclusion Provisions as a basis for denial of such Claim, then the Buyer
Indemnified Parties shall not have the right to seek indemnification pursuant
to _Section_ __ _ 8.2(a)_ or _Section_ __ _ 8.3(a)_ for the same Loss
suffered or incurred by the Buyer Indemnified Parties arising out of
or resulting from such alleged breach of such representation or warranty.

(iv) Notwithstanding anything in this  _Section_ __ _ 8.5(a)_ to the
contrary, the Buyer Indemnified Parties may simultaneously submit a Claim
against the Seller Indemnifying Parties and submit a claim under the RandW
Insurance Policy until the retention limitation under the RandW Insurance
Policy has been exceeded. For the avoidance of doubt, this _Section_ __ _
8.5(a)(iv)_ shall not limit the applicability of _Section_ __ _ 8.5(d)_.

 

(b) _Losses Determined Net of Eligible Insurance Proceeds_. With respect to
the indemnification obligations of the Indemnifying Parties hereunder, the
amount of all Losses shall be determined net of (i) any proceeds actually
received by the applicable Indemnified Party under any insurance coverage
(including, in the case of a Buyer Indemnified Party pursuant to the
RandW Insurance Policy) and (ii) any amount received by such Indemnified Party
from any non-Affiliated Person alleged to be responsible for any Losses, in
each case of (i) and (ii), net of any costs actually incurred by the
Indemnified Parties in seeking to collect such proceeds (" _Eligible Insurance
Proceeds_ "). In any case where any Indemnified Party has recovered Eligible
Insurance Proceeds in respect of any amount of Losses for which any
Indemnifying Party has actually indemnified such Indemnified Party pursuant to
this _Article_ __ _ 8_ or _Section_ __ _ 5.9(d)_, such Indemnified Party
shall promptly pay over to the applicable Indemnifying Party such Eligible
Insurance Proceeds (after deducting therefrom the amount of expenses incurred
in by it in procuring such recovery), but not in excess of (i) any amount
previously paid by the Indemnifying Party to or on behalf of the applicable
Indemnified Party or Buyer Tax Indemnified Party in respect of such Losses and
(ii) any amount expended by the Indemnifying Party in pursuing or defending
any claim in respect of such Losses; _provided_ , that the amount of any Loss
applied against the retention limitation under the RandW Insurance Policy shall
not reduce the amount of any Loss with respect to which such the Buyer
Indemnified Parties are entitled to indemnification.

 

(c) _Qualifying Losses_. No Indemnified Party shall be entitled to recover for
any particular Loss pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 8.2(a)_, _Section_ __ _
8.3(a)_ or _Section_ __ _ 8.4(a)_, as applicable, unless the amount of such
Loss (or series of related Losses) equals or exceeds $50,000 (each Loss
(or series of related Losses) in excess of such amount, a " _Qualifying Loss_
"); _provided_ , _however_ , that this limitation shall not apply to Losses
arising out of or resulting from any Seller Fundamental Representation,
any Buyer Fundamental Representation or any Specified Representation.

 



-69- 

    

(d) _Indemnification Basket_. The Sellers and the Camuto Owners shall have no
liability pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.2(a)_ or _Section_ __ _ 8.3(a)_ with
respect to Losses except to the extent that the aggregate amount of Qualifying
Losses suffered by the Buyer Indemnified Parties, in the aggregate, exceeds
$1,500,000 (the " _Basket_ "), in which event the Buyer Indemnified Parties
shall be entitled to recover all Qualifying Losses in excess of the Basket;
_provided_ , _however_ , that this limitation shall not apply to Losses
arising out of or resulting from any Seller Fundamental Representation or any
Specified Representation. Buyers shall have no liability pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 8.4(a)_ with respect to Losses except to the extent that the aggregate
amount of Qualifying Losses suffered by the Sellers and the Camuto Owners, in
the aggregate, exceeds the Basket; _provided_ , _however_ , that this
limitation shall not apply to Losses arising out of or resulting from any
Buyer Fundamental Representation.

(e) _Indemnification Caps_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this 
_Article_ __ _ 8_, except as provided in _Section_ __ _ 8.5(f)_ with respect
to fraud or willful misconduct, the following limitations with respect to the
maximum amount of the Losses subject to indemnification under this _Article_
__ _ 8_ shall apply:

to _Section_ __ _ 8.2(a)_ or _Section_ __ _ 8.3(a)_ in an aggregate amount
greater than $1,500,000; _provided_ , _however_ , that the limitation set
forth in this  _Section_ __ _ 8.5(e)(i)_ shall not limit the obligations of
the Indemnifying Parties with respect to any Claim arising out of or resulting
from (A) any breach or inaccuracy of the representations and warranties set
forth in the Specified IP Representations, which obligations are subject to
the limitation set forth in _Section_ __ _ 8.5(e)(ii)_, (B) any Excluded
Claim or any breach or inaccuracy of any Specified Representation, which
obligations are subject to the limitations set forth in _Section_ __ _

Representation (other than the Specified IP Representations), which
obligations are subject to the limitation set forth in _Section_ __ _
8.5(e)(iv)_;

(ii) the Sellers and the Camuto Owners shall not have any liability pursuant
to _Section_ __ _ 8.2(a)_ with respect to breaches or inaccuracies of the

existence of any inaccuracy or breach of the representations and warranties

party with respect to such Losses, in each case net of all costs of recovery
(including any increased insurance premiums attributable to any such
insurance recovery); _provided_ , that the amount of any Loss applied against

Section 8.6 _Indemnification Procedures_.

 

(a) _Third-Party Proceedings_.

 

(i) Reasonably promptly, but in no event more than ten (10) days, following
receipt by a Person entitled to be indemnified under this _Article_ __ _ 8_
(an " _Indemnified Party_ ") of notice of the commencement of a Proceeding by
a third party (including a

 



-71- 

    

 Governmental Body) against him, her or it (a " _Third-Party Proceeding_ "),
such Indemnified Party will, if a claim for indemnification is to be made
against a Party (an " _Indemnifying Party_ ") under this _Article_ __ _ 8_,
give written notice to the Indemnifying Party of the commencement of such
Third-Party Proceeding for which indemnification is sought. Any such written
notice shall set forth in reasonable detail the facts giving rise to such
Third-Party Proceeding (to the extent known by the Indemnified Party) and the
amount or estimated amount (to the extent reasonably estimable) of Losses
arising out of such Third-Party Proceeding, any other remedy sought
thereunder and, to the extent known by the Indemnified Party, any other
material details pertaining thereto (a " _Claim Notice_ "). Subject to
_Section_ __ _ 8.1_, the failure to timely notify the Indemnifying Party
will not relieve the Indemnifying Party of any obligation that the
Indemnifying Party may have to an Indemnified Party hereunder except to the
extent that the defense of such Third-Party Proceeding was actually and
materially prejudiced by the Indemnified Partys failure to provide timely
notice or such information. Thereafter, the Indemnified Party shall deliver to
the Indemnifying Party, promptly following the Indemnified Partys receipt
thereof, copies of all notices and documents (including court papers) received
by the Indemnified Person relating to the Third-Party Claim.

 

(ii) The Indemnifying Party will be entitled to participate in any Third-Party
Proceeding with respect to which indemnification has been or will be sought
hereunder and, to the extent that the Indemnifying Party wishes, to assume the
defense of such Third-Party Proceeding (with counsel of its choice that is
reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party) by notifying
the Indemnified Party of its election to do so within thirty (30) days of
receipt of notice of such Proceeding pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.6(a)(i)_;
_provided_ that the Indemnifying Party shall have acknowledged in writing to
the Indemnified Party its obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party
hereunder in respect of Losses suffered by the Indemnified Party in connection
with such Third-Party Proceedings if the same is adversely determined.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnifying Party will not be permitted
to assume the defense of a Third-Party Proceeding if: (A) such Third-Party
Proceeding arises in connection with any criminal proceeding, action,
indictment, criminal allegation or criminal investigation of the Indemnified
Party or its Affiliates; (B) the Indemnified Party is advised in writing by
outside counsel chosen by it that there are one or more legal or equitable
defenses available to the Indemnified Party that the Indemnifying Party
cannot assert on behalf of the Indemnified Party (assuming the full
cooperation of the Indemnified Party in asserting such defenses); or (C) it is
reasonably likely that the Losses arising or resulting from such Third-
Party Proceeding will exceed the Indemnity Escrow Funds then remaining in the
Indemnity Escrow Account. Following an assumption of defense of a Third-Party
Proceeding by an Indemnifying Party hereunder, the Indemnifying Party will
have no liability for any fees of legal counsel or other expenses
subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with such
Proceeding. If an Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a Third-Party
Proceeding, no compromise or settlement of the underlying claims may be
effected by it without the Indemnified Partys consent (not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed). If an Indemnifying Party assumes the
defense of a Third-Party Proceeding, the Indemnified Party will not settle
such Proceeding without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnified Party will have the right to
settle any such Proceeding

 



-72- 

    

 without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party if the
Indemnified Party first waives any right to indemnity under this Agreement
with respect to such Proceeding. If an Indemnified Party controls the defense
of a Third-Party Proceeding, the Indemnifying Party may participate in such
Proceeding with counsel of its own choice and the Indemnified Party will not
settle such Proceeding without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying
Party; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnified Party will have the right
to settle any such Proceeding without the prior written consent of the
Indemnifying Party if the Indemnified Party first waives any right
to indemnity under this Agreement with respect to such Proceeding.

(iii) Except to the extent it would cause a waiver of a privilege, each Party
will make available to each Other Party and each Other Partys Representatives
all of its Books and Records and, as applicable, employees relating to a
Third-Party Proceeding as may be reasonably requested by each Other Party,
and each Party will reasonably cooperate to ensure the proper and adequate
defense of such Third-Party Proceeding.

(b) _Other Claims_. A claim for indemnification for any matter not involving
a Third-Party Proceeding must be asserted by a Claim Notice meeting the
requirements of _Section_ __ _ 8.6(a)_ to the Indemnifying Party prior to
the expiration of the applicable period as provided in _Section_ __ _ 8.1_.
The Indemnifying Party shall have no Liability with respect to any
unreasonable expenses incurred by the Indemnifying Party prior to the time the
Claim Notice is received by the Indemnifying Party.

(c) _Determination of Losses_. After the giving of a Claim Notice under this 
_Article_ __ _ 8_, the amount of Losses to which an Indemnified Party shall
be entitled under this _Article_ __ _ 8_ shall be determined (i) by written
agreement between Sellers and Buyers, (ii) by a Final Order or (iii) by any
other means as to which Sellers and Buyers shall agree in writing.

Section 8.7  _Adjusted Purchase Price_. Any payment of a claim for
indemnification under _Section_ __ _ 5.9_ or this _Article_ __ _ 8_ will be
accounted for as an adjustment to the Final CG OpCo Purchase Price, the Final
CCI OpCo Purchase Price or the Final IPCo Purchase Price, as applicable, for
all Tax purposes, in each case, except to the extent otherwise required by
applicable Law.

 

Section 8.8 _Exclusive Remedy_. Except for the matters covered by _Section_ __
_ 1.3_, a Partys right to seek specific performance or other equitable
relief pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 10.11_, and remedies expressly contemplated
by any Transaction Documents, following the Closing,  _Section_ __ _ 5.9_
and this _Article_ __ _ 8_ constitute the sole and exclusive remedy of each
Party, its Affiliates and their respective Representatives with respect to any
matters arising under or with respect to this Agreement or relating to or
arising from the transactions contemplated in this Agreement, and each Party
hereby irrevocably waives from and after Closing, to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Law, any and all rights, claims and causes of
action that it may have or may in the future have against the Other Parties
relating to the Transactions.

 

Section 8.9 _Escrow Release_ _and Satisfaction of Claims_. Subject to any
other limitations set forth herein and any applicable terms and conditions
set forth in the Escrow Agreement:

later other time as the Indemnified Party shall agree), the Indemnifying
Party shall pay to the applicable Indemnified Party (except in the case where
payment has been already effected from the Indemnity Escrow Funds) an amount
equal to the amount of such Losses by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to the bank account or accounts designated by the Indemnified
Party in a notice to the Indemnifying Party not less than two (2) Business
Days prior to the anticipated date of such payment.

 

(b) The Seller Indemnifying Parties shall only be required to satisfy their
respective indemnification obligations pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 8.2(a)_
(other than with respect to any Loss arising out of or related to any Seller
Fundamental Representation) from the Indemnity Escrow Funds. With respect to
any other indemnification obligations arising under  _Section_ __ _ 8.2_ or
_Section_ __ _ 8.3_ or with respect to any indemnification obligations
arising under _Section_ __ _ 5.9_, the Buyers may elect (but shall not be
required to) to first satisfy any Claim from the Indemnity Escrow Funds then
remaining in the Escrow Account and, if the Indemnity Escrow Funds then
remaining in the Escrow Account are not adequate to satisfy any such Claim in
full, (x) the Sellers agree to satisfy any such Claims on a several and not
joint basis and (y) the Camuto Owners agree to satisfy any such Claims in
accordance with the Liability Basis, in the case of each of clauses (x) and
(y), up to, in the aggregate, the applicable cap set forth in _Section_ __ _
8.5(e)_. With respect to any Claim for indemnification (or any portion
thereof) to be satisfied from the Indemnity Escrow Funds then remaining in the
Escrow Account, each Buyer and the Sellers Representative shall deliver a
joint written instruction to the Escrow Agent to release such amount (
_provided_ that such amount shall not exceed the amount of Losses or Taxes
with respect to which the applicable Buyer Indemnified Party is entitled to
indemnification with respect to the applicable Claim).

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, with respect
to any Losses or Taxes submitted for coverage under the RandW Insurance Policy
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.5(a)_, the applicable Buyer may submit a Claim
Notice to Sellers and the Camuto Owners in respect of the potential Claim in
respect thereof, which Claim Notice shall include the amount of such Loss as
submitted under the RandW Insurance Policy (a " _Reserved Amount_ ").

 

(d) At 5:00 p.m. (New York time) on the date that is the eighteen (18) month
anniversary of the Closing Date (the " _Initial Escrow Release Time_ "), each
Buyer and the Sellers Representative shall deliver a joint written
instruction to the Escrow Agent to release to Sellers and/or the Camuto Owners
an amount from the Indemnity Escrow Funds then remaining in the Escrow
Account such that, after giving effect to such release, the amount of the
Indemnity Escrow Funds equals the sum of (i) $12,500,000, _plus_ (ii) the
aggregate Reserved Amount in respect of Losses and Taxes with respect
to which coverage under the RandW Insurance Policy has not been determined,
_plus_ (iii) any other amount subject to a then-pending claim for
indemnification pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.2_, Section 8.3 or  _Section_
__ _ 5.9(d)_. With respect to any Loss or Tax submitted for coverage under
the RandW Insurance Policy that has been accepted and paid out by the Primary
Underwriter, each Buyer and the Sellers Representative shall deliver a joint
written instruction to the Escrow Agent to release an amount from the
Indemnity Escrow Funds equal to the Reserved Amount in respect of such Loss or
Tax; _provided_ , that in no event shall any such release result in the
amount of the Indemnity Escrow Funds, after giving effect to such

 



-74- 

    

 release, equaling less than the sum of (i) $12,500,000, _plus_ (ii) the
aggregate Reserved Amount in respect of Losses and Taxes with respect to which
coverage under the RandW Insurance Policy has not been determined, _plus_ (iii)
any other amount subject to a then-pending claim for indemnification pursuant
to _Section_ __ _ 8.2_, Section 8.3 or _Section_ __ _ 5.9(d)_. 

(e) At 5:00 p.m. (New York time) on the date that is the thirty (30) month
anniversary of the Closing Date (the " _Final Escrow Release Time_ "), each
Buyer and the Sellers Representative shall deliver a joint written
instruction to the Escrow Agent to release to Sellers and/or the Camuto Owners
any portion of the Indemnity Escrow Funds remaining in the Escrow Account
that is not a Reserved Amount or subject to a then-pending claim for
indemnification pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.2_ or _Section_ __ _ 5.9(d)_.
At any time following the Final Escrow Release Time, to the extent the then-
remaining Indemnity Escrow Funds exceed the aggregate Reserved Amounts and
amounts claimed by the Buyer Indemnified Parties pursuant to Claims made prior
to the Final Escrow Release Time, each Buyer, within two (2) Business Days of
a written request by the Sellers Representative, and the Sellers
Representative shall deliver a joint written instruction to the Escrow Agent
to release to Sellers and/or the Camuto Owners the excess funds.
The allocation of such released amount as between each Seller shall be
determined equitably, based on the relative values of the Final CG OpCo
Purchase Price, the Final CCI OpCo Purchase Price and the Final IPCo Purchase
Price, and taking into account the satisfaction of specific indemnification
obligations from the Indemnity Escrow Funds pursuant hereto.

(f) Buyers and Sellers will execute the necessary documents instructing the
Escrow Agent to make the applicable payments in accordance with the Escrow
Agreement, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the
Escrow Agreement.

 

(g) None of the amounts released from the Escrow Account pursuant _Section_ __
_ 8.9(d)_ or  _Section_ __ _ 8.9(e)_ shall be Restricted Proceeds or Estate
Restricted Proceeds.

Section 8.10  _Post-Closing Actions of Sellers_. For the avoidance of doubt,
it is understood that no provision of this Agreement restricts Sellers from
distributing to the Camuto Owners the proceeds of the Final Closing Cash
Payment and any adjustments thereto received by Sellers or from dissolving
and liquidating in accordance with applicable law.

 

Section 8.11 _Post-Closing Retention of Proceeds_.

respective Camuto Trustees on their behalf, shall hold as principal of such
Camuto Trusts, and the respective Camuto Trustees shall not distribute,
transfer or loan to any Person, eighty percent (80%) of such Camuto Trusts
share of the Non-Escrow Proceeds actually received by such Camuto Trust (the

within three (3) Business Days following the Closing) and shall be released

managing, investing and reinvesting the Restricted Proceeds, provided that the
Restricted Proceeds are invested in cash or a commercially diversified
portfolio of marketable securities, (B) the distribution and/or other proper
disposition of income earned from the Restricted Proceeds, (C) the

Article X Trusts), (D) the payment from the Restricted Proceeds of bona fide
and reasonably necessary administration expenses from principal incurred with
respect to the Restricted Proceeds, not to exceed in any year one percent (1%)

than the excess of (x) the Camuto Trusts share of the Non-Escrow Proceeds
over (y) Restricted Proceeds), or (G) the payment from the Restricted Proceeds
of amounts owed to the Camuto Estate under the Trust Borrowing, which amounts
then received and held by the Camuto Estate shall be subject to _Section_ __ _

"), which Camuto Estate Proceeds shall be deposited in a segregated account
promptly following the Closing (and in any event within three (3) Business
Days following the Closing) or, with respect to any Restricted Proceeds paid
to the Camuto Estate pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 8.11(a)(G)_, upon such
payment, and shall be released from such segregated account only as follows:

The foregoing restriction shall not prohibit (A) the Camuto Estate from
managing, investing and reinvesting the Estate Restricted Proceeds, provided
that the Estate Restricted Proceeds are invested in cash or a commercially
diversified portfolio of marketable securities, (B) the distribution and/or
other proper disposition of income earned from the Estate Restricted
Proceeds, (C) the distribution and/or other proper disposition of principal

Residuary Trust Bank of America, N.A., or a successor trustee reasonably

Section 10.1 _Binding Effect; Benefits; Assignment_. The terms of this
Agreement and the other Transaction Documents executed by a Party will be
binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by and against such
Party and its legal representatives, successors and authorized assigns.
Except: (a) as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement or another
Transaction Document; and (b) for the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 5.9(d)_
and _Article_ __ _ 8_, which are intended to be for the benefit of, and will
be enforceable by, the Sellers Indemnified Parties and the Buyer Indemnified
Parties, nothing in this Agreement or such other Transaction Document, express
or implied, is intended to confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies
under or by reason of this Agreement or such other Transaction Document, this
Agreement and the other Transaction Documents being for the exclusive benefit
of the Parties and their respective legal representatives, successors and
authorized assigns. No Party may assign any of its rights or obligations
under this Agreement or any other Transaction Document to any other Person
without the prior written consent of the Other Parties to this Agreement or
the other parties to such other Transaction Documents, as applicable, and any
such attempted or purported assignment will be null and void; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Buyer Parents and Buyers may, without consent, assign all or
part of its rights under this Agreement or other Transaction Document to one
or more of their Affiliates, which assignment will not relieve Buyer Parents
and/or Buyers of any of its obligations under this Agreement or such other
Transaction Document.

 

Section 10.2 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, the exhibits and schedules to
this Agreement (including the Disclosure Schedule), the Confidentiality
Agreements and the other Transaction Documents set forth the entire agreement
and understanding of the Parties in respect

 



-101- 

    

 of the Transactions or other Transaction Documents, as applicable, and
supersede all prior Contracts, letters of intent, arrangements and
understandings relating to the subject matter hereof and thereof. No
representation, promise, inducement or statement of intention has been made by
any Party in connection with the Transactions or other Transaction Document
that is not embodied in this Agreement or such other Transaction Document,
as applicable, and no Party will be bound by or liable for any alleged
representation, promise, inducement or statement of intention not so embodied.

 

Section 10.3 _Amendment and Waiver_. This Agreement may be amended, modified,
superseded or canceled, and any of its provisions may be waived, only by a
written instrument executed by the Parties or, in the case of a waiver, by the
Party waiving compliance. The failure of a Party at any time to require
performance of any provision of this Agreement will in no manner affect the
right of that Party at a later time to enforce such provision. No waiver by a
Party of any provision of this Agreement or the breach of any provision of
this Agreement, in any one or more instances, will be deemed to be or
construed as a further or continuing waiver of such provision or breach, or
any other provision of this Agreement.

 

Section 10.4 _Governing Law; Exclusive Jurisdiction_. This Agreement and any
dispute about which this Agreement is a subject will be governed by and
construed in accordance with the applicable Laws of the State of Delaware,
without regard to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of
the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the
application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.
In addition, each of the Parties hereto irrevocably (i) submits to the
personal jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of Chancery in and for New Castle
County, or in the event (but only in the event) that such Delaware Court of
Chancery does not have subject matter jurisdiction over such dispute, the
United States District Court for the District of Delaware, or in the event
(but only in the event) that such United States District Court also does not
have jurisdiction over such dispute, any Delaware State court sitting in New
Castle County, in the event any dispute (whether in contract, tort or
otherwise) arises out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby, (ii) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal
jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such court, (iii)
waives any objection to the laying of venue of any Proceeding relating to
this Agreement, the Transaction or the other transactions contemplated hereby
in such court, (iv) waives and agrees not to plead or claim in any such court
that any Proceeding relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby brought in any such court has been brought in an
inconvenient forum, and (v) agrees that it will not bring any Proceeding
relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby in any
court other than the Delaware Court of Chancery in and for New Castle County,
or in the event (but only in the event) that such Delaware Court of Chancery
does not have subject matter jurisdiction over such Proceeding, the United
States District Court for the District of Delaware, or in the event (but only
in the event) that such United States District Court also does not have
jurisdiction over such Proceeding, any Delaware State court sitting in New
Castle County. Each party agrees that service of process upon such party in
any Proceeding shall be effective if notice is given in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 10.6_.

 



-102- 

    

Section 10.5 _WAIVER OF TRIAL BY JURY_. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES
THAT ANY CONTROVERSY THAT MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE
COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES AND THEREFORE EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE
LAW, ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY
PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT
OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

A Party may change its address, facsimile number or e-mail address by prior
written notice to each other Party provided as set forth in this _Section_ __
_ 10.6_.

 

Section 10.7 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed by original
signature or by facsimile, digital or other electronic signature and in one
or more counterparts, each of which will be deemed an original and together
will constitute one and the same instrument.

 

Section 10.8 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this
Agreement, Sellers, on one hand, and Buyers, on the other hand, will pay all
of their own expenses, costs and fees (including legal and other professional
fees and costs) incurred in connection with the negotiation, preparation,
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents
and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby
(whether the Transactions are consummated or not).

 

Section 10.9 _Headings; Construction; Time of Essence_. The headings of the
articles, sections and paragraphs in this Agreement have been inserted for
convenience of reference only and will not restrict or otherwise modify any of
the provisions of this Agreement. Unless otherwise expressly provided, the
words "including," "include" or "includes," or other similar words, whenever
used in this Agreement will be deemed to be immediately followed by the words
"without limitation." The words "herein," "hereby," "hereof," "hereunder" and
words of similar import refer to this Agreement as a whole (including any
exhibits and schedules hereto) and not merely to any particular section,
subsection or paragraph contained in this Agreement. All references in this
agreement to Sections, Schedules or Exhibits are references to Sections of,
and Exhibits and Schedules to, this Agreement, unless the context otherwise
requires. References in this Agreement to any gender include references to
all genders, and references to the singular include references to the plural
and vice versa. Neither this Agreement nor any other Transaction Document (nor
any uncertainty or ambiguity herein or therein) will be construed against a
Party under any rule of construction or otherwise based on any presumption
against that Partys involvement in the drafting thereof. No Party will be
considered the

 



-105- 

    

 draftsman of this Agreement or any other Transaction Document. The
provisions of this Agreement have been negotiated by and chosen by the Parties
to express their mutual intent, and no rule of strict construction will be
applied against a Party. All references to "dollars" or "$" in this Agreement
or any other Transaction Document are to U.S. Dollars. Final Closing Cash
Payment is to be determined without duplication of amounts taken into account
in the calculation thereof. Each reference herein to a statute means such
statute as amended from time to time and includes any successor legislation
thereto and any regulations promulgated thereunder.

 

Section 10.10 _Partial Invalidity_. Whenever possible, each provision of this
Agreement and each other Transaction Document will be interpreted in such
manner as to be effective and valid under applicable Law, but in case any one
or more of the provisions contained in this Agreement or other Transaction
Document is, for any reason, held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be
invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity, illegality
or unenforceability will not affect any other provision of this Agreement or
other Transaction Document, as applicable, which will otherwise remain in
full force and effect. Upon any such determination that any provision of this
Agreement or other Transaction Document is invalid, illegal or unenforceable,
the Parties will negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement or
other Transaction Document, as applicable, by replacing the invalid, illegal
or unenforceable provisions with legal, valid and enforceable provisions the
effect of which comes as close as practicable to the original intent of the
Parties in order that the Transactions are consummated as originally
contemplated to the greatest extent possible.

Section 10.11  _Specific Performance_. The Parties agree that irreparable
damage could occur to the non-breaching Party if any provision of this
Agreement were not performed by a Party in accordance with the terms hereof.
Accordingly, the Parties agree that, subject to the limitations set forth in
this _Section_ __ _ 10.11_, prior to the valid termination of this Agreement
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.1_, in addition to any other remedy to which a
non-breaching Party is entitled at Law or in equity, the non-breaching Party
will be entitled to seek injunctive relief to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and will be entitled to specifically enforce the performance of the
provisions hereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary
in this Agreement, (i) Sellers will be entitled to seek and obtain specific
performance of the Closing if and only if (a) the conditions set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 6.1_ have been satisfied; (b) Buyers have failed to consummate
the Closing in breach of  _Section_ __ _ 1.5_; (c) Sellers have delivered an
irrevocable written notice to Buyers certifying that, if Buyers performs its
obligations hereunder, the Closing will occur; and (d) Sellers have elected
not to terminate this Agreement pursuant to the terms of _Section_ __ _ 7.1_
and (ii) Buyers will be entitled to seek and obtain specific performance of
the Closing if and only if (a) the conditions set forth in  _Section_ __ _
6.2_ have been satisfied; (b) Sellers have failed to consummate the Closing in
breach of _Section_ __ _ 1.5_; (c) Buyers have delivered an irrevocable
written notice to Sellers certifying that, if Sellers performs its
obligations hereunder, the Closing will occur; and (d) Buyers have elected not
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to the terms of _Section_ __ _ 7.1_.
Each Party agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction,
specific performance and other equitable relief on the basis that each other
Party has an adequate remedy at Law or an award of specific performance is not
an appropriate remedy for any reason at Law or equity. Any Party seeking an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement will not be required
to provide any bond or other security in connection with any such order
or injunction.

 



-106- 

    

Section 10.12 _Disclosure Schedules_.

 

(a) The Disclosure Schedules have been arranged for purposes of convenience in
separate sections corresponding to the sections of this Agreement; however,
information disclosed on one section of the Disclosure Schedules shall be
deemed to be disclosed on another section of the Disclosure Schedules, or be
deemed to be an exception to another representation and warranty in
this Agreement, in each case, if the relevance of such information to such
other representation or warranty is reasonably apparent on its face, and, for
the avoidance of doubt, without reference to the text of any document referred
to therein. Capitalized terms used in the Disclosure Schedules and not
otherwise defined therein have the meanings given to them in this Agreement.
This Agreement (including all of the individual sections contained herein) is
qualified in its entirety by reference to specific provisions of the
Disclosure Schedules and the information and disclosures contained therein are
not intended to constitute, and shall not be construed as constituting,
representations or warranties of any Party, except as and to the extent
provided in this Agreement. In addition, the information and disclosures
contained in the Disclosure Schedules are intended only to qualify and limit
the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of Sellers and the
Camuto Owners contained in this Agreement and shall not be deemed to expand
in any way the scope or effect of any such representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements.

 

(b) Neither the specification of any dollar amount in any representation or
warranty contained in this Agreement nor the inclusion of any specific item
in any section of the Disclosure Schedules is intended to imply that such
amount, or higher or lower amounts, or the item so included or other items,
are or are not material, and no Party shall use the fact of the setting forth
of any such amount or the inclusion of any such item in any dispute or
controversy between the Parties as to whether any obligation, item or matter
not described in this Agreement or included in any section of the Disclosure
Schedules is or is not material for purposes of this Agreement. Neither the
specification of any item or matter in any representation or warranty
contained in this Agreement nor the inclusion of any specific item in any
section of the Disclosure Schedules is intended to imply that such item or
matter, or other items or matters, are or are not in the Ordinary Course of
Business, and no Party shall use the fact of the setting forth or the
inclusion of any such item or matter in any dispute or controversy between the
Parties as to whether any obligation, item or matter not described herein or
included in any section of the Disclosure Schedule is or is not in the
Ordinary Course of Business for purposes of this Agreement.

 

(c) Matters reflected in any section of the Disclosure Schedules are not
necessarily limited to matters required by this Agreement to be so reflected.
Such additional matters are set forth for informational purposes and do not
necessarily include other matters of a similar nature. No reference to or
disclosure of a possible breach or violation of any Contract or Law in any
section of the Disclosure Schedules shall be construed as an admission or
indication by any Party to any third party that any breach or violation exists
or actually occurred.

 

Section 10.13 _Lease Termination Indemnity_. HoldCo and DSW, jointly and
severally, agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Sellers and their
respective Affiliates from and against any Loss, and release Sellers from any
Transaction Severance Liability, arising out of or resulting from Sellers
delivery of a notice of termination under the Playa Court Lease pursuant

 



-107- 

    

 to Section 5.20 and any resultant termination of the Playa Court Lease
(collectively, " _Lease Losses_ "), _provided_ , _however_ , that HoldCo and
DSW shall not be required to indemnify, defend or hold harmless Sellers or
their respective Affiliates from and against any Transaction Severance
Liability unless the Sellers have complied in all material respects with
Section 5.20. HoldCo and DSW, jointly and severally, agree to promptly pay or
reimburse the amount of any Lease Losses for which any Seller or any of its
Affiliates provides written notice and evidence reasonably satisfactory to
HoldCo that such Person has actually paid all or any portion of such Lease
Losses. HoldCo and DSW agree that their obligations under this _Section_ __ _
10.13_ are independent of, and separate and apart from, the remainder of this
Agreement. Sellers shall not submit a claim to HoldCo and/or DSW under this
_Section_ __ _ 10.13_ prior to the earliest to occur of (a) the Closing, (b)
the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms and (c) the
Outside Date.

 

Section 10.14 _Buyer Parents Guarantee_ _s_. Each of ABG and DSW hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees to Sellers, pro rata based on its
Percentage Interest in Buyer IPCo and HoldCo, as applicable, as primary
obligor and not merely as a surety, the full and timely payment and
performance of each and every covenant, agreement, liability and obligation
of Buyer IPCo or HoldCo, as applicable, under this Agreement and each
Transaction Document, including the obligations of Buyer IPCo or HoldCo, as
applicable, under _Section_ __ _ 1.2_,  _Section_ __ _ 5.2(c)_, and
_Section_ __ _ 5.4_ (collectively, the " _Guaranteed Obligations_ ") subject
to Buyers right of offset for any Losses. This is a guarantee of payment and
performance, and not merely of collection, and each Buyer Parent acknowledges
and agrees that this guarantee is full and unconditional, and no amendment,
modification, release or extinguishment of Buyers obligations or liabilities,
whether by decree in any bankruptcy proceeding or otherwise, shall affect the
continuing validity and enforceability of this guarantee. Buyer Parents and
Buyers hereby waive, for the benefit of Sellers, (a) any right to require
Sellers, as a condition of payment or performance by Buyer Parents, to
proceed in any Proceeding against Buyers or pursue any other remedies
whatsoever and (b) to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any
defenses or benefits that may be derived from or afforded by any Law that
limit the liability of or exonerate guarantors or sureties, other than defense
of payment and performance in full of the Guaranteed Obligations. Each Buyer
Parent understands and acknowledges that Sellers are relying on this guarantee
and the representations and warranties set forth in the immediately following
sentence in entering into this Agreement. Each Buyer Parent hereby represents
and warrants that (i) it has all requisite power and authority to execute and
deliver this Agreement and to perform its obligations hereunder, (ii) the
execution and delivery by such Buyer Parent of this Agreement, and the
performance by such Buyer Parent of its obligations hereunder, have been duly
authorized by all requisite organizational action and (iii) this Agreement
has been duly executed and delivered by such Buyer Parent, and constitutes the
valid and legally binding obligation of such Buyer Parent, enforceable against
such Buyer Parent in accordance with its terms and conditions, except as may
be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other
similar Laws relating to or affecting the rights of creditors generally and
except as such enforceability is subject to the application of general
principles of equity (regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in
equity or at law). The foregoing representations and warranties of Buyer
Parents shall survive in perpetuity and shall not terminate.

 



-108- 

    

Section 10.15 _Sellers_ __ _ Representative_. Each Seller hereby irrevocably
appoints the Sellers Representative as its representative, attorney-in-fact
and agent, with full power of substitution to act in the name, place and
stead of such Seller with respect to the Transaction Documents, including with
respect to the Escrow Agreement, and to act on behalf of such Seller in any
amendment of or litigation or arbitration in connection therewith and to do
or refrain from doing all such further acts or things, and to execute all such
documents, as such Sellers Representative shall deem necessary or appropriate
in connection therewith, including the power (a) to negotiate, execute and
deliver all ancillary agreements, statements, certificates, notices,
approvals, extensions, waivers, undertakings, amendments and other documents
required or permitted to be given in connection with the
Transaction Documents, and (b) to give and receive all notices and
communications given or received under the Escrow Agreement with respect to
Sellers and to receive such service of process in connection with any claims
under the Escrow Agreement against any or all of the Sellers. In the event
Sellers Representative resigns, is removed or is otherwise unable to continue
to serve, Sellers shall provide prompt written notice to Buyers of (i) such
resignation, removal or inability to serve and (ii) such other Person
designated by Sellers to succeed as Sellers Representative under this
Agreement.

 

Section 10.16 _Liability of the Camuto Owners_. With respect to any obligation
of, or any payment to be made by, any Camuto Owner pursuant to this
Agreement, the Camuto Owners and, if in existence at the applicable time, the
Residuary Trusts, shall be liable for, and shall be required to satisfy the
applicable obligation or make the applicable payment in accordance with the
following provisions:

(a) as between the Camuto Estate, on the one hand, and each Camuto Trust, on
the other hand, (i) the Camuto Estate shall be jointly and severally liable
with each Camuto Trust, individually, for the full amount of any obligation
of, or payment to be made by, such Camuto Trust, and (ii) each Camuto Trust
shall be liable only for its Applicable Portion of any obligation of, or
payment to be made by, the Camuto Estate, on a joint and several basis solely
with respect to such Applicable Portion of such obligation or payment; and

 

(b) as among the Camuto Trusts, each Camuto Trust shall be liable only for its
Applicable Portion of such obligation or payment, on a several and not joint
basis.
