ARTICLE 3 
 EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK 
 OF THE CONSTITUENT COMPANIES; 
 EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES 

   

 Section 3.1 Effect on Capital Stock. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders of any of the Company Shares, the following shall occur: 

  

 (a) _Cancellation of Treasury Shares_. All Company Shares that are owned directly or indirectly by the Company as treasury stock shall be canceled, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. 

   

 (b) _Conversion of Company Shares_. Subject to the provisions of Sections 3.1(a), 3.1(c), 3.1(d) and 3.4, each Company Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (excluding Company Shares cancelled pursuant to Section 3.1(a)) shall be converted into the right to receive (collectively, the " _Merger Consideration_ "): 

    

 (i) $14.50 in cash; and 

   

 (ii) .452 shares of Parent Common Stock. 

   ##### 

  

 

All such Company Shares, when so converted, shall no longer be outstanding and
shall automatically be canceled and retired and each holder of a Certificate
representing any such shares shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive certain dividends and
other distributions as contemplated by Section 3.3, the Cash Consideration,
shares of Parent Common Stock and any cash, without interest, in lieu of
fractional shares to be issued or paid in consideration therefor upon the
surrender of such Certificate in accordance with Section 3.2. 

   

 (c) _Treatment of Company Stock Options_. 

   

 (i) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall cause each Company Class A Stock Option to be vested and shall cancel each such Company Class A Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time for consideration payable by Parent at or as promptly as practicable following the Closing equal to the Company Class A Option Value, and all such options shall terminate immediately prior to the Effective Time. The Company Class A Option Value with respect to each Company Stock Option shall be paid as follows: $14.50 of the Company Class A Option Value shall be paid in cash and the remainder of the Company Class A Option Value shall be paid in shares of Parent Common Stock. The number of shares of Parent Common Stock to be paid in respect of the Company Class A Stock Options shall be determined by dividing (i) the amount of the Class A Option Value to be paid in the form of Parent Common Stock by (ii) the Parent Common Stock Closing FMV. 

  

 (ii) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall cause each Company Class B Stock Option to be vested and shall cancel each such Company Class B Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time for consideration payable by Parent at or as promptly as practicable following the Closing equal to the Company Class B Option Value, and all such options shall terminate immediately prior to the Effective Time. The Company Class B Option Value with respect to each Company Stock Option shall be paid in shares of Parent Common Stock. The number of shares of Parent Common Stock to be paid in respect of the Company Class B Stock Options shall be determined by dividing (i) the amount of the Class B Option Value to be paid by (ii) the Parent Common Stock Closing FMV. 

  

 (iii) The Board of Directors of the Company (or an appropriate committee thereof) shall adopt such resolutions or take such other actions as may be required prior to the Effective Time to cause all restrictions on the then outstanding Company Restricted Stock Units to lapse as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and to cause the Company Shares issuable upon vesting of the outstanding Company Restricted Stock Units to be issued immediately prior to the Effective Time. Each holder of Company Restricted Stock Units shall be treated as a holder of Company Shares issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time. 

  

 (iv) As of the Effective Time, except as provided in this Section 3.1, all rights under any Company Stock Option or Company Restricted Stock Unit and any provision of any Company Stock Plans providing for the issuance or grant of any other interest in respect of the capital stock of the Company shall be cancelled. The Company shall ensure that, as of and after the Effective Time, except as provided in this Section 3.1, no Person shall have any rights under any Company Stock Plan. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (v) Any amounts payable pursuant to this Section 3.1(c) shall be subject to any required withholding of taxes and shall be paid without interest. 

  

 (d) _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Company Shares that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by dissenting stockholders of the Company (the " _Dissenting Stockholders_ ") who shall have perfected dissenters rights in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into or represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration (but instead shall be converted into the right to receive payment from the Surviving Company with respect to such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the DGCL), unless and until such Dissenting Stockholder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such Dissenting Stockholders rights to appraisal under the DGCL. If any such Dissenting Stockholder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such holders rights to appraisal of such Company Shares under the DGCL, such Dissenting Stockholders Company Shares shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted into and to have become exchangeable for, at the Effective Time, the right to receive, upon surrender as provided above, the Merger Consideration for the Certificate or Certificates that formerly evidenced such Company Shares. The Company shall, prior to the Effective Time, use all reasonable efforts to give Parent and Merger Sub prompt notice of any written demands for payment of the fair value of any Company Shares, withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments served on the Company pursuant to the DGCL received by the Company relating to stockholders rights of appraisal. Except with the prior written consent of Parent and Merger Sub, the Company shall not voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal, or settle or offer to settle any such demands. 

   

 Section 3.2 Surviving Company to Make Certificates Available. 

  

 (a) _Exchange of Certificates_. The Company and Parent shall authorize American Stock Transfer and Trust Company (or such other Person or Persons as shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company and Parent) to act as exchange agent hereunder (the " _Exchange Agent_ "). As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, the Surviving Company shall deposit with the Exchange Agent for the benefit of the holders of certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented Company Shares (the " _Certificates_ "), the Cash Consideration and certificates representing the shares of Parent Common Stock (such Cash Consideration and shares of Parent Common Stock, together with any dividends or distributions with respect thereto payable as provided in Section 3.3, being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ ") issuable pursuant to Section 3.1(c) in exchange for outstanding Company Shares. 

   

 (b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall mail or deliver to each holder of record of a Certificate whose shares were converted pursuant to Section 3.1 into shares of Parent Common Stock a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon actual and proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall contain instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Cash Consideration and certificates representing shares of Parent Common Stock and shall be in such form and contain such other provisions as the Company and Parent may reasonably specify). 

    ##### 

  

 

Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent,
together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such
Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the
Cash Consideration and a certificate representing that number of whole shares
of Parent Common Stock which such holder has the right to receive pursuant to
this Article 3, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be
canceled. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 3.2, each
Certificate shall, at and after the Effective Time, be deemed to represent
only the right to receive, upon surrender of such Certificate, the Cash
Consideration, the certificate representing the appropriate number of shares
of Parent Common Stock, cash in lieu of fractional shares, if any, as
provided in Section 3.4 and certain dividends and other distributions as
contemplated by Section 3.3. 

   

 Section 3.3 Dividends; Transfer Taxes. No dividends or other distributions that may be declared on or after the Effective Time on Parent Common Stock or are payable to the holders of record thereof on or after the Effective Time will be paid to Persons entitled by reason of the Merger to receive certificates representing Parent Common Stock until such Persons surrender their Certificates, as provided in Section 3.2, and no Cash Consideration or cash payment in lieu of fractional shares shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to Section 3.4 until such holder of such Certificate shall so surrender such Certificate. Subject to the effect of applicable law, there shall be paid to the record holder of the certificates representing such Parent Common Stock (a) at the time of such surrender or as promptly as practicable thereafter, the amount of any dividends or other distributions theretofore paid with respect to whole shares of such Parent Common Stock and having a record date on or after the Effective Time and a payment date prior to such surrender and (b) at the appropriate payment date or as promptly as practicable thereafter, the amount of dividends or other distributions payable with respect to whole shares of Parent Common Stock and having a record date on or after the Effective Time but prior to surrender and a payment date subsequent to surrender. In no event shall the Person entitled to receive such dividends or other distributions be entitled to receive interest on such dividends or other distributions. If any cash or certificate representing shares of Parent Common Stock is to be paid to or issued in a name other than that in which the Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a condition of such exchange that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the issuance of certificates for such shares of Parent Common Stock in a name other than that of the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or shall establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or is not applicable. 

  

 Section 3.4 No Fractional Shares. No certificates representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates pursuant to this Article 3, and no Parent dividend or other distribution or stock split or combination shall relate to any fractional security, and such fractional interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights of a security holder of Parent. In lieu of any such fractional shares, each holder of Company Shares who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after taking into account all Company Shares then held of record by such holder) shall receive cash (without interest) in an amount equal to the product of such fractional part of a share and the average closing sale price of Parent Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange, as reported by Bloomberg Financial Markets or such other service as the 

   ##### 

  

    

parties may agree in writing, for the ten (10) consecutive trading days
immediately preceding the third trading day before the Closing. 

  

 Section 3.5 Return of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the former stockholders of the Company for one year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand of Parent, and any former stockholders of the Company who have not theretofore complied with this Article 3 shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of their claim for Parent Common Stock, Cash Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock and any dividends or distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock. None of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving Company shall be liable to any holder of Company Shares for shares (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) or cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. 

  

 Section 3.6 Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock. All shares of Parent Common Stock issued upon the surrender of Certificates for exchange in accordance with the terms hereof (including any cash paid pursuant to Sections 3.3 or 3.4) shall be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Company Shares, subject, however, to the Surviving Companys obligation to pay any dividends or make any other distribution with a record date prior to the Effective Time which may have been declared or made by the Company on Company Shares in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. 

  

 Section 3.7 Closing of the Companys Transfer Books. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and no transfer of Company Shares shall thereafter be made. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Company, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article 3. 

  

 Section 3.8 Withholding Rights. Parent and Surviving Company shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any holder of the Company Shares, Company Stock Options or Company Restricted Stock Units pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or under any provision of Federal, state or local tax law. To the extent amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority by Parent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holders of Company Shares, Company Stock Options or Company Restricted Stock Units in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent. 

  

 Section 3.9 Adjustments. 

  

 (a) _Stock Split, Stock Dividend, Recapitalization_. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Article III to the contrary (but without limiting the covenants set forth in Article V hereof), if between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock shall be changed into a different number of shares or a different class by reason of the occurrence or record date of any stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, stock split, combination, exchange of shares or similar transaction, then the exchange ratio provided for in Section 3.1(b)(ii), the Company Class A Option Value and the Company Class B Option Value shall be appropriately and proportionately 

    ##### 

  

 

adjusted to reflect such stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification,
recapitalization, stock split, combination, exchange of shares or similar
transaction. 

   

 (b) _Merger_. In the event that, prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall consummate a merger, consolidation, share exchange or other reorganization, or any other transaction pursuant to which the holders of Parent Common Stock receive or become entitled to receive securities, cash or other assets or any combination thereof, each holder of Company Shares as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be entitled to receive at the Effective Time for each Company Share, the amount of cash included in the Merger Consideration plus the amount of securities, cash or other assets that such holder would have been entitled to receive or become entitled to receive had such holder been the record holder of the number of shares of Parent Common Stock issuable to such holder of Company Shares pursuant to Section 3.1(b) had the Effective Time occurred immediately prior to the consummation of such transaction.

 Section 9.1 Takeover Defenses of The Company. The Company shall take such action as may be necessary or required to cause any anti-takeover provisions contained in the Company Charter Documents or afforded to the Company by applicable law to become or remain inapplicable to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

 Section 9.2 No Solicitation. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (a) The Company shall not, and shall not authorize any officer, director or employee of, or any investment banker, attorney or other advisor, agent or representative of, the Company (" _Company Representatives_ ") to, and shall instruct the Company Representatives not to, and use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Company Representatives not to, and on becoming aware of will take all reasonable actions to stop any such Person from continuing to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or encourage or otherwise intentionally facilitate (including by way of furnishing information) the making of any Acquisition Proposal (as defined below), (ii) enter into any agreement (other than confidentiality and standstill agreements in accordance with the immediately following proviso) with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, or (iii) participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any Person any information with respect to, or take any other action to facilitate any inquiries or the making of any proposal that constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal; provided, however, that in the case of this clause (iii), to the extent required by the fiduciary obligations of the Board of Directors of the Company, determined in good faith by the members thereof, after consultation with outside legal counsel, the Company may at any time prior to Company Stockholder Approval (the " _Applicable Period_ "), but not thereafter if the Merger is approved thereby, and subject to the Company providing written notice to Parent of its decision to take such action in response and only in response to an Acquisition Proposal received without any initiation, encouragement, discussion or negotiation by the Company or any Company Representative and without contravention by the Company or any of its Representatives of this Section 9.2(a)), (A) furnish information to any Person or "group" (within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) pursuant to a confidentiality agreement on substantially the same terms as provided in the Confidentiality Agreement and otherwise enter into discussions and negotiations with such Person or group as to any Acquisition Proposal that the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith has the good faith intent to proceed with negotiations that are reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal (as defined in Section 9.2(c)) such Person or group has made and (B) in the event that the Board of Directors is unable to determine whether such Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal, make inquiry of such Person or group of such information as would enable the Board of Directors to determine whether or not such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal. Without limiting the foregoing, it is understood that any violation of the restrictions set forth in the preceding sentence by the Company or any Company Representative, whether or not such Person is purporting to act on behalf of the Company or otherwise, shall be deemed to be a material breach of this Agreement by the Company. The Company immediately shall cease and shall cause to be terminated any existing solicitation, initiation, encouragement, activity, discussion or negotiation with any parties conducted prior to the date hereof by the Company or any Company Representatives with respect to any Acquisition Proposal existing on the date hereof. The Company promptly will notify Parent of the pendency of any negotiations respecting, or the receipt of, any Acquisition Proposal. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means (i) any proposal, other than a proposal by Parent or any of its Affiliates, for a merger or other business combination involving the Company, (ii) any proposal or offer, other than a proposal or offer by Parent or any of its Affiliates, to acquire from the Company or any of its Affiliates in any manner, directly or indirectly, twenty percent (20%) or more of the equity interest in the Company, twenty percent (20%) or more of the voting securities of the Company or twenty percent (20%) or more of the assets of the Company, or (iii) any proposal or offer, other than a proposal or offer by Parent or any of its Affiliates, to acquire from the stockholders 

    #####

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall have the right, prior to the expiration of the third business day following its receipt of a Notice of Superior Proposal to agree to amend the terms of this Agreement such that they are no less favorable than the terms of such Superior Proposal. The Company may only terminate this Agreement pursuant to the second sentence of this Section 9.2(b) prior to the date of the Stockholder Meeting and following payment to Parent of the fee set forth in Section 9.3(a). Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company from taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act following the Companys receipt of an Acquisition Proposal or from making any disclosure to the Companys stockholders required by applicable law. 

   

 (c) For purposes of this Agreement, a " _Superior Proposal_ " means any bona fide Acquisition Proposal to acquire, directly or indirectly, for consideration consisting of cash, securities or a combination thereof, all or substantially all of the Company Shares then outstanding or all or substantially all the assets of the Company, which a majority of the disinterested members of the Board of Directors of the Company determines in its good faith reasonable judgment (after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors) is (i) reasonably likely to be consummated taking into account the Person making such Acquisition Proposal and all legal, financial, regulatory and other relevant aspects of such Acquisition Proposal, and (ii) more favorable to the Companys stockholders from a financial point of view than the Merger and which it intends to recommend that the stockholders of the Company approve. 

     ##### 

  

     

 Section 9.3 Fee and Expense Reimbursements.

 (i) a transaction is consummated, which transaction, if offered or proposed, would constitute an Acquisition Proposal; provided, that all references in the definition of Acquisition Proposal to 20% shall be deemed references to 50% for purposes of this Section 9.3(b)(i); 

  

 (ii) a definitive agreement (the execution and delivery of which has been authorized by the Board of Directors of the Company) that would if consummated constitute an Acquisition Proposal is entered into; provided, that all references in the definition of Acquisition Proposal to 20% shall be deemed references to 50% for purposes of this Section 9.3(b)(ii); or 

  

 (iii) (A) any Person acquires beneficial ownership or the right to acquire beneficial ownership of, or any "group" (as such term is defined under Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated hereunder), shall have been formed that beneficially owns, or has the right to acquire beneficial ownership of, outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company then representing 50% or more of the combined power to vote generally for the election of directors, and (B) the Companys Board of Directors has taken any action for the benefit of such person, that facilitates the acquisition by such person or group of such beneficial ownership. 

  

 (c) The Company Termination Fee shall be payable pursuant to Section 9.3(b) only if Parent terminates or has terminated this Agreement (i) as permitted by Section 8.1(b)(ii) or Section 8.1(d), in each case at a time when a Company Breach exists as a result of a willful act 

  ##### 

  

    

or omission by the Company or (ii) as permitted by Section 8.1(f)(iii) at a
time that an Acquisition Proposal is pending.
