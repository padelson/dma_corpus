AGREEMENT

 



 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein, and for other good and
valuable consideration, and intending to be legally bound, the parties hereto
agree as follows:

      
 

 



 

ARTICLE I 
THE MERGER

 



 

1.1 _The Merger_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, in
accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law, as amended (the " _DGCL_
") and the South Carolina Business Corporation Act of 1988, as amended (the "
_BCA_ "), at the Effective Time, Company shall merge with and into Parent.
Parent shall be the Surviving Corporation in the Merger and shall continue its
corporate existence under the laws of the State of South Carolina. As of the
Effective Time, the separate corporate existence of Company shall cease.

 



 

1.2 _Effective Time_. The Merger shall become effective upon filing of the
Certificate of Merger (as set forth in Section 252 of the DGCL) and the
Articles of Merger (as set forth in Section 33-11-105 of the BCA)
(collectively, the " _Articles of Merger_ ") with the Secretary of State of
the State of Delaware and the Secretary of State of the State of South
Carolina, respectively. The term " _Effective Time_ " shall be the date and
time when the Merger becomes effective as set forth in the Articles of Merger.

 



 

1.3 _Closing_. On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, the closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place at
10:00 a.m., New York City time, at the offices of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen and
Katz, 51 West 52nd Street, New York, New York, on a date no later than three
(3) Business Days after the satisfaction or waiver (subject to applicable Law)
of the latest to occur of the conditions set forth in Article VII (other than
those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied or waived at the
Closing, but subject to the satisfaction of such conditions and the continued
satisfaction or waiver of all other conditions set forth in Article VII), or
such other date as mutually agreed to by the parties (the " _Closing Date_ ").

 



 

1.4 _Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation_. At
the Effective Time, the articles of incorporation and bylaws of Parent in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time (subject to the Name Change)
shall be the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation
until thereafter amended in accordance with applicable Law.

 



 

1.5 _Tax Consequences_. It is intended that the Merger shall qualify as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and that
this Agreement shall constitute, and is hereby adopted as, a "plan of
reorganization" for purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of the Code. From and
after the date of this Agreement and until the Closing Date, each party hereto
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Merger to qualify as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

 



 

1.6 _Effects of the Merger_. At and after the Effective Time, the Merger shall
have the effects set forth in this Agreement and in the relevant provisions of
the DGCL and the BCA. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and
subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all the property, rights, privileges,
powers and franchises of Company shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and
all debts, liabilities and duties of Company shall become the debts,
liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

 



      
 

 



 

1.7 _Conversion of Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of Parent, Company or the holder of any of the
following securities:

 



 

(a) _No Effect on Parent Common Stock_. Each share of the common stock, par
value $2.50 per share, of Parent (" _Parent Common Stock_ ") outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain issued and outstanding
and shall not be affected by the Merger.

 



 

(b) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Each share of the common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of Company (" _Company Common Stock_ ") issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any Cancelled
Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive 0.4237 shares (the "
_Exchange Ratio_ "), subject to adjustment in accordance with Section 1.7(e),
of validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of Parent Common Stock
(together with any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to
be paid pursuant to Section 2.2(f), the " _Merger Consideration_ ").

 



 

(c) _Series A Preferred Stock_. _ _In the event that each issued and
outstanding share of Fixed Rate Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series
A, par value $0.01 per share (the " _Company Series A Preferred Stock_"),
with a liquidation preference of $1,000 per share, is not converted prior to,
or redeemed prior to or contemporaneously with, the Closing, each share of
Company Series A Preferred Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be automatically converted into and shall thereafter
represent the right to receive one share of preferred stock of the Surviving
Corporation (the " _Parent Preferred Stock_ "), which shall be designated as
Series A Fixed Rate Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per
share, with a liquidation preference of $1,000 per share (the " _Parent Series
A Preferred Stock_"), and otherwise having such other rights, preferences,
privileges, and voting powers, and limitations and restrictions thereof, that,
taken as a whole, are not materially less favorable to the holders thereof
than the rights, privileges and voting powers, and limitations and
restrictions thereof, of the Company Series A Preferred Stock immediately
prior to the Effective Time, taken as a whole (the " _Preferred Stock Merger
Consideration_ ")

 



 

(d) _Cancellation of Certain Shares of Company Stock_. All shares of Company
Common Stock and Company Series A Preferred Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time that are owned directly by Parent or
Company (other than (i) shares held in trust accounts, managed accounts and
the like, or otherwise held in a fiduciary or agency capacity, that are
beneficially owned by third parties and (ii) shares held, directly or
indirectly, by Parent or Company in respect of a debt previously contracted)
shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist and no Merger Consideration,
Preferred Stock Merger Consideration or other consideration shall be delivered
in exchange therefor (such cancelled shares, the " _Cancelled Shares_ ").

 



 

(e) _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. If at any time during the period
between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the
outstanding shares of capital stock of Parent or Company, respectively, shall
occur (or for which the relevant record date will occur) as a result of any
reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including a reverse stock
split) or subdivision or combination or readjustment of shares, or any stock
dividend or stock distribution with a record date during such period, an
appropriate and

 



      
 

 



 

proportionate adjustment shall be made to the Merger Consideration, the
Preferred Stock Merger Consideration, the Exchange Ratio and other dependent
items, as applicable.

 



 

1.8 _Company Options_. Each stock option to acquire shares of Company Common
Stock granted under the Company Stock Plan (each, " _Company Option_ ") which
is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (whether or not then
vested) shall be converted into an obligation of Parent to pay (or cause to be
paid) and a right of the holder to receive, in full satisfaction of any rights
in respect of the Company Option, cash in an amount equal to the product of
(A) the excess, if any, of the closing price per share of Company Common Stock
on the NASDAQ stock exchange on the day immediately prior to the Closing Date
over the per-share exercise price of such Company Option, and (B) the number
of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option, less any
income or employment tax withholding required under the Code or any provision
of applicable Law. In the event that the product obtained by such calculation
with respect to a Company Option is zero or a negative number, then such
Company Option shall, immediately prior to the Effective Time, be cancelled
for no consideration. The amount determined in accordance with the foregoing
shall be paid to the applicable holder of a Company Option as soon as
reasonably practicable following the Closing Date and in no event later than
thirty (30) days following the Closing Date.

 



 

1.9 _Employee Stock Purchase Plan_. The Company shall (a) ensure that no new
offering periods under the Companys 2004 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "
_Company ESPP_ ") will commence during the period from the date of this
Agreement through the Effective Time, (b) ensure that there will be no
increase in the amount of payroll deductions permitted to be made by the
participants under the Company ESPP during the current offering period, and
(c) ensure that no individuals shall commence participation in the Company
ESPP during the period from the date of this Agreement through the Effective
Time. The accumulated contributions of the participants in the current Company
ESPP offering shall be used to purchase shares of Company common stock within
five business days prior to the Effective Time, and the participants purchase
rights under the ongoing offering shall terminate immediately after such
purchase. As of the Effective Time, the Company shall terminate the Company
ESPP.

 



 

1.10 _Bank Merger_. Immediately following the Effective Time, First Federal
Bank, a South Carolina banking corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of
Company (" _First Federal_ "), will merge (the " _Bank Merger_ ") with and
into SCBT, a South Carolina banking corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of
Parent (" _Parent Bank_ "). Parent Bank shall be the surviving entity in the
Bank Merger and, following the Bank Merger, the separate corporate existence
of First Federal shall cease. The parties agree that the Bank Merger shall
become effective immediately after the Effective Time. The Bank Merger shall
be implemented pursuant to a subsidiary plan of merger, in a form to be
specified by Parent in consultation with Company (the " _Subsidiary Plan of
Merger_ "). In order to obtain the necessary Regulatory Approvals for the Bank
Merger, the parties hereto shall cause the following to be accomplished prior
to the filing of applications for such Regulatory Approvals: (x) Company shall
cause First Federal to approve the Subsidiary Plan of Merger; Company, as the
sole shareholder of First Federal, shall approve the Subsidiary Plan of
Merger; and Company shall cause the Subsidiary Plan of Merger to be duly
executed by First Federal and delivered to Parent and (y) Parent shall cause
Parent Bank to approve the Subsidiary Plan of Merger; Parent, as the sole
shareholder of Parent Bank, shall approve the Subsidiary Plan of Merger; and
Parent shall cause Parent Bank to duly execute and deliver the

 



       
 

 



 

Subsidiary Plan of Merger to Company. Prior to the Effective Time, Company
shall cause First Federal, and Parent shall cause Parent Bank, to execute such
articles of merger and such other documents and certificates as are necessary
to make the Bank Merger effective (" _Bank Merger Certificates_ ") immediately
after the Effective Time.

 



 

ARTICLE II 
DELIVERY OF MERGER CONSIDERATION

 



 

2.1 _Deposit of Merger Consideration_. Promptly after the Effective Time,
Parent shall make available to a bank or trust company selected by Parent and
reasonably acceptable to Company (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") pursuant to an
agreement entered into prior to the Closing (the " _Exchange Agent Agreement_
"), for exchange in accordance with this Article II (a) the number of shares
of Parent Common Stock sufficient to deliver the aggregate Merger
Consideration, (b) the number of shares of Parent Series A Preferred Stock
sufficient to deliver the aggregate Preferred Stock Merger Consideration and
(c) to the extent then determinable, any cash payable in lieu of fractional
shares pursuant to Section 2.2(f) (collectively, the " _Exchange Fund_ "), and
Parent shall instruct the Exchange Agent to timely deliver the Merger
Consideration and the Preferred Stock Merger Consideration.

 



 

2.2 _Delivery of Merger Consideration_.

 



 

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the Exchange
Agent shall mail to each holder of record immediately prior to the Effective
Time (collectively, the " _Holders_ ") of certificates representing shares of
Company Common Stock or Company Series A Preferred Stock, as applicable ("
_Certificates_ ") that were converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration or the Preferred Stock Merger Consideration pursuant to Section
1.7 (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to Certificate(s) shall pass only upon
delivery of Certificate(s) (or affidavits of loss in lieu of such
Certificate(s)) to the Exchange Agent and shall be substantially in such form
and have such other provisions as shall be prescribed by the Exchange Agent
and Parent) (the " _Letter of Transmittal_ ") and (ii) instructions for use in
surrendering Certificate(s) in exchange for the Merger Consideration or the
Preferred Stock Merger Consideration, as applicable, and any dividends or
distributions to which such Holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(c).

 



 

(b) Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of its Certificate(s), accompanied by
a properly completed Letter of Transmittal, a Holder of Company Common Stock
or Company Series A Preferred Stock, as applicable, shall be entitled to
receive, promptly after the Effective Time, the Merger Consideration in
respect of the shares of Company Common Stock or the Preferred Stock Merger
Consideration in respect of shares of Company Series A Preferred Stock
represented by its Certificate(s), as applicable. Until so surrendered, each
such Certificate shall represent after the Effective Time, for all purposes,
only the right to receive, without interest, the Merger Consideration or the
Preferred Stock Merger Consideration, as applicable, upon surrender of such
Certificate in accordance with, and any dividends or distributions to which
such Holder is entitled pursuant to, this Article II.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) No dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock or
Parent Series A Preferred Stock (as applicable) shall be paid to the Holder of
any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the shares of Parent Common
Stock or Parent Series A Preferred Stock (as applicable) represented thereby,
in each case unless and until the surrender of such Certificate in accordance
with this Article II. Subject to the effect of applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Laws, following surrender of any such Certificate in
accordance with this Article II, the Holder thereof shall be entitled to
receive, without interest, (i) the amount of dividends or other distributions
with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore payable with respect
to the whole shares of Parent Common Stock or Parent Series A Preferred Stock
represented by such Certificate and not paid and/or (ii) at the appropriate
payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions payable with
respect to whole shares of Parent Common Stock or Parent Series A Preferred
Stock represented by such Certificate with a record date after the Effective
Time (but before such surrender date) and with a payment date subsequent to
the issuance of the Parent Common Stock or Parent Series A Preferred Stock
issuable with respect to such Certificate.

 



 

(d) In the event of a transfer of ownership of a Certificate representing
Company Common Stock or Company Series A Preferred Stock that is not
registered in the stock transfer records of Company, the Merger Consideration
or Preferred Stock Merger Consideration (as applicable) shall be delivered in
exchange therefor to a Person other than the Person in whose name the
Certificate so surrendered is registered if the Certificate formerly
representing such Company Common Stock or Company Series A Preferred Stock (as
applicable) shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for
transfer and the Person requesting such payment or issuance shall pay any
transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason of the payment or issuance
to a Person other than the registered Holder of the Certificate or establish
to the satisfaction of Parent that the Tax has been paid or is not applicable.
The Exchange Agent (or, subsequent to the first anniversary of the Effective
Time, Parent) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any portion of the
Merger Consideration or Preferred Stock Merger Consideration (as applicable)
such amounts as the Exchange Agent or Parent, as the case may be, is required
to deduct and withhold under the Code, or any provision of state, local or
foreign Tax Law, with respect to the making of such payment. To the extent
that the amounts are so withheld by the Exchange Agent or Parent, as the case
may be, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Holder of shares of Company Common Stock
or Company Series A Preferred Stock (as applicable) in respect of whom such
deduction and withholding was made by the Exchange Agent or Parent, as the
case may be.

 



 

(e) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of Company of any shares of Company Common Stock or Company
Series A Preferred Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time other than to settle transfers of Company Common Stock or
Company Series A Preferred Stock that occurred prior to the Effective Time.
If, after the Effective Time, Certificates representing such shares are
presented for transfer to the Exchange Agent, they shall be cancelled and
exchanged for the Merger Consideration or the Preferred Stock Merger
Consideration (as applicable), in accordance with Section 1.7 and the
procedures set forth in this Article II.

 



      
 

 



 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no
certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock
shall be issued upon the surrender of Certificates for exchange, no dividend
or distribution with respect to Parent Common Stock shall be payable on or
with respect to any fractional share, and such fractional share interests
shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a
shareholder of Parent. In lieu of the issuance of any such fractional share,
Parent shall pay to each former stockholder of Company who otherwise would be
entitled to receive such fractional share, an amount in cash (rounded to the
nearest whole cent) determined by multiplying (i) the Parent Share Value by
(ii) the fraction of a share (after taking into account all shares of Company
Common Stock held by such Holder at the Effective Time and rounded to the
nearest one ten-thousandth when expressed in decimal form) of Parent Common
Stock to which such Holder would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to
Section 1.7. The parties acknowledge that payment of the cash consideration in
lieu of issuing fractional shares was not separately bargained-for
consideration but merely represents a mechanical rounding off for purposes of
avoiding the expense and inconvenience that would otherwise be caused by the
issuance of fractional shares.

 



 

(g) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the
stockholders of Company as of the first anniversary of the Effective Time
shall be returned to Parent. Any former stockholders of Company who have not
theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to Parent
with respect to the Merger Consideration and Preferred Stock Merger
Consideration (as applicable) and any unpaid dividends and distributions on
the Parent Common Stock or Parent Series A Preferred Stock deliverable in
respect of each share of Company Common Stock or Company Series A Preferred
Stock (as applicable) such stockholder holds as determined pursuant to this
Agreement, in each case, without any interest thereon. Any Merger
Consideration or Preferred Stock Merger Consideration remaining unclaimed as
of a date which is immediately prior to such time as such amounts would
otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Entity shall, to
the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of Parent free and
clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, Company, the Exchange Agent or
any other Person shall be liable to any former holder of shares of Company
Common Stock or Company Series A Preferred Stock (as applicable) for any
amount delivered in good faith to a public official pursuant to applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws.

 



 

(h) In the event that any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably required
by Parent or the Exchange Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond in such
amount as Parent may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against
any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the
Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect thereof pursuant
to this Agreement.

 



 

(i) Subject to the terms of the Exchange Agent Agreement, Parent, in the
exercise of its reasonable discretion, shall have the right to make all
determinations, not inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement, governing
(i) the validity of any Letter of Transmittal and compliance by any Company
stockholder with the procedures and instructions

 



      
 

 



 

set forth herein and therein, (ii) the issuance and delivery of (A) the whole
number of shares of the Parent Common Stock portion of the Merger
Consideration into which shares of Company Common Stock are converted in the
Merger or (B) the whole number of shares of Parent Series A Preferred Stock
into which shares of Company Series A Preferred Stock are converted in the
Merger and (iii) the method of payment of the cash in lieu of fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock.

 



 

(j) In the case of outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or Company
Series A Preferred Stock (as applicable) that are not represented by
Certificates, the parties shall make such adjustments to Article I and Article
II as are necessary or appropriate to implement the same purpose and effect
that Article I and Article II have with respect to shares of Company Common
Stock or Company Series A Preferred Stock (as applicable) that are represented
by Certificates.

 



 

ARTICLE III

 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF COMPANY

 



 

Except as (a) disclosed in writing in the correspondingly enumerated section
or subsection of the disclosure schedule of Company delivered herewith (the "
_Disclosure Schedule_ ") ( _provided_ that each exception set forth in the
Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to qualify any other representation and
warranty to the extent that the relevance of such exception to such other
representation and warranty is reasonably apparent on the face of the
disclosure (without need to examine underlying documentation)) or (b)
disclosed in any report, schedule, form or other document filed with the SEC
by Company prior to the date hereof and on or after the date on which Company
filed with the SEC its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three months
ended September 30, 2012 (but excluding any risk factor disclosures contained
under the heading "Risk Factors," any disclosure of risks included in any
"forward-looking statements" disclaimer or any other statements that are
similarly non-specific or predictive or forward-looking in nature), Company
hereby represents and warrants to Parent as follows:

 



 

3.1 _Corporate Organization_.

 



 

(a) Company and each of its Subsidiaries is an entity duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing (with respect to jurisdictions that recognize
such concept) under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its organization. The
deposit accounts of First Federal are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation (the " _FDIC_ ") through the Bank Insurance Fund to the fullest
extent permitted by Law, and all premiums and assessments required in
connection therewith have been paid by Company or First Federal when due.
First Federal is a member in good standing of the Federal Home Loan Bank of
Atlanta and owns the requisite amount of stock therein. Company and each of
its Subsidiaries has the requisite corporate power and authority to own or
lease and operate all of its properties and assets and to carry on its
business as it is now being conducted. Company and each of its Subsidiaries is
duly licensed or qualified to do business in each jurisdiction in which the
nature of the business conducted by it or the character or location of the
properties and assets owned or leased by it makes such licensing or
qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so licensed or
qualified would not

 



      
 

 



 

reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material
Adverse Effect. True and complete copies of the Companys Certificate of
Incorporation, as amended (the " _Company Certificate of Incorporation_ "),
and Amended and Restated Bylaws (the " _Company Bylaws_ "), and the articles
or certificate of incorporation and bylaws (or comparable organizational
documents) of each Company Subsidiary, in each case as in effect as of the
date of this Agreement, have previously been furnished or made available to
Parent. Neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is in violation of any of
the provisions of the Company Certificate of Incorporation or Company Bylaws
or such articles or certificate of incorporation and bylaws (or comparable
organizational documents) of such Company Subsidiary, as applicable.

 



 

(b) Section 3.1(b) of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth a complete and
correct list of all the Subsidiaries of Company (each a " _Company Subsidiary_
" and collectively the " _Company Subsidiaries_ "). Section 3.1(b) of the
Disclosure Schedule also sets forth a list identifying the number and owner of
all outstanding capital stock or other equity securities of each such
Subsidiary, options, warrants, stock appreciation rights, scrip, rights to
subscribe to, calls or commitments of any character whatsoever relating to, or
securities or rights convertible into, shares of any capital stock or other
equity securities of such Subsidiary, or Contracts by which such Subsidiary
may become bound to issue additional shares of its capital stock or other
equity securities, or options, warrants, scrip, rights to subscribe to, calls
or commitments for any shares of its capital stock or other equity securities
and the identity of the parties to any such agreements or arrangements. All of
the outstanding shares of capital stock or other securities evidencing
ownership of Company Subsidiaries are validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable and such shares or other securities are owned by Company or
another of its Subsidiaries free and clear of any lien, claim, charge, option,
encumbrance, mortgage, pledge or security interest or other restriction of any
kind (" _Lien_ ") with respect thereto. Except for its interests in Company
Subsidiaries and as set forth in Section 3.1(b) of the Disclosure Schedule,
Company does not as of the date of this Agreement own, directly or indirectly,
any capital stock, membership interest, partnership interest, joint venture
interest or other equity interest in any Person. As used in this Agreement, "
_Subsidiary_ " shall mean, when used with respect to any party, any
corporation, partnership, limited liability company, association, joint

Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code (the "
_Qualified Plans_ "). The IRS has issued a favorable determination letter with
respect to each Qualified Plan and the related trust has not been revoked, and
there are no existing circumstances and no events have occurred that could
reasonably be expected to adversely affect the qualified status of any
Qualified Plan or the related trust. No trust funding any Company Benefit Plan
is intended to meet the requirements of Section 501(c)(9) of the Code.

 



 

(g) No Company Benefit Plan is subject to Title IV or Section 302 of ERISA or
Section 412 or 4971 of the Code nor has Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
ERISA Affiliates in the past maintained an employee benefit plan subject to
Title IV of ERISA.

 



 

(h) (i) No Company Benefit Plan is a "multiemployer plan" within the meaning
of Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA (a " _Multiemployer Plan_ ") or a plan that has
two or

 



      
 

 



 

more contributing sponsors at least two of whom are not under common control,
within the meaning of Section 4063 of ERISA (a " _Multiple Employer Plan_ ");
(ii) none of Company and its Subsidiaries nor any of their respective ERISA
Affiliates has, at any time during the last six (6) years, contributed to or
been obligated to contribute to any Multiemployer Plan or Multiple Employer
Plan; and (iii) none of Company and its Subsidiaries nor any of their
respective ERISA Affiliates has incurred any liability to a Multiemployer Plan
as a result of a complete or partial withdrawal from such Multiemployer Plan,
as those terms are defined in Part I of Subtitle E of Title IV of ERISA.

 



 

(i) Neither Company, nor any of its Subsidiaries, sponsors, has sponsored or
has any obligation with respect to any employee benefit plan that provides for
any post-employment or post-retirement health or medical or life insurance
benefits for retired, former or current employees or beneficiaries or
dependents thereof, except as required by Section 4980B of the Code. Company
and each of its Subsidiaries have reserved the right to amend, terminate or
modify at any time all plans or arrangements providing for retiree health or
life insurance coverage, and no representations or commitments, whether or not
written, have been made that would limit Companys or such Subsidiarys right
to amend, terminate or modify any such benefits.

 



 

(j) Except for the individual amounts (listed by employee or director) set
forth on Section 3.11(j) of the Disclosure Schedule, neither the execution and
delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby will (either alone or in conjunction with any other event)
result in, cause the vesting, exercisability or delivery of, or increase in
the amount or value of, any payment, right or other benefit to any employee,
officer, director or other service provider of Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, or result in any limitation on the right of Company or any of
its Subsidiaries to amend, merge, terminate or receive a reversion of assets
from any Company Benefit Plan or related trust. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, no amount paid or payable (whether in cash, in
property, or in the form of benefits) by Company or any of its Subsidiaries in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby (either solely as a
result thereof or as a result of such transactions in conjunction with any
other event) will be an "excess parachute payment" within the meaning of
Section 280G of the Code. No Company Benefit Plan provides for the gross-up or
reimbursement of Taxes under Section 4999 or 409A of the Code, or otherwise.
True, correct and complete copies of Section 280G calculations (whether or not
final) with respect to any disqualified individual in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby are included in Section 3.11(j) of the
Disclosure Schedule.

 



 

(k) There does not now exist, nor do any circumstances exist that could result
in, any Controlled Group Liability that would be a liability of Company, its
Subsidiaries or any of their ERISA Affiliates following the Closing. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, neither Company nor any of its ERISA
Affiliates has engaged in any transaction described in Section 4069, 4204 or
4212 of ERISA.

 



 

(l) Each of Company and its Subsidiaries are, and have been at all relevant
times, in compliance with Sections 111 and 302 of the Emergency Economic
Stabilization Act of 2008, as amended by the U.S. American Recovery and
Reinvestment Act of 2009, including all guidance issued thereunder by a
Governmental Entity (collectively, " _EESA_ "). Each Company

 



      
 

 



 

employee who is subject to the limitations imposed under EESA has executed a
waiver of claims against Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to limiting
or reducing rights to compensation for so long as the EESA limitations are
required to be imposed.

 



 

(m) There are no pending or threatened claims (other than claims for benefits
in the ordinary course), lawsuits or arbitrations that have been asserted or
instituted, and, to the Knowledge of Company, no set of circumstances exists
that may reasonably give rise to a claim or lawsuit, against the Company
Benefit Plans, any fiduciaries thereof with respect to their duties to the
Company Benefits Plans or the assets of any of the trusts under any of the
Company Benefit Plans that could reasonably be expected to result in any
material liability of Company or any of its Subsidiaries to the Pension
Benefit Guaranty Corporation, the U.S. Department of the Treasury, the U.S.
Department of Labor, any Multiemployer Plan, any Multiple Employer Plan, any
participant in a Company Benefit Plan, or any other party. No Company Benefit
Plan is under audit or the subject of an investigation by the IRS, the U.S.
Department of Labor, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, the SEC or any
other Governmental Entity, nor is any such audit or investigation pending or,
to Companys Knowledge, threatened.

 



 

3.12 _Labor Matters_. There are no agreements with, or pending petitions for
recognition of, a labor union or association as the exclusive bargaining agent
for any of the employees of Company or any of its Subsidiaries and there are
no representation or certification proceedings or petitions seeking a
representation proceeding presently pending or threatened to be brought or
filed with the National Labor Relations Board or any other comparable foreign,
state or local labor relations tribunal or authority. There are no organizing
activities, labor strikes, work stoppages, slowdowns, lockouts, material
arbitrations or material grievances or other material labor disputes, other
than routine grievance matters, now pending or threatened against or involving
Company or any of its Subsidiaries and there have not been any such labor
strikes, work stoppages or other labor troubles with respect to Company or any
of its Subsidiaries at any time within five (5) years of the date of this
Agreement. Company is not a party to, or otherwise bound by, any consent
decree with, or citation by, any Governmental Entity relating to employees or
employment practices; and, except as set forth in Section 3.9 of the
Disclosure Schedule, there is no charge of discrimination in employment or
employment practices for any reason, including age, gender, race, religion or
other legally protected category, which has been asserted against Company or
that is now pending before the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission or
any other Governmental Entity that would result in liability to Company or any
of its Subsidiaries. Company and each of its Subsidiaries is in compliance
with all applicable Laws in respect of employment, employment practices,
including terms and conditions of employment and wages and hours, employment
discrimination, employee classification, workers compensation, family and
medical leave, the Immigration Reform and Control Act and occupational safety
and health requirements. Each individual who renders services to Company or
any of its Subsidiaries who is classified by Company or such Subsidiary, as
applicable, as having the status of an independent contractor, consultant or
other non-employee status for any purpose (including for purposes of taxation
and tax reporting and under Company Benefit Plans) is properly so
characterized.

 



      
 

 



 

3.13 _Compliance with Applicable Law_.

 



 

(a) Company and each of its Subsidiaries and each of their employees hold all
licenses, registrations, franchises, certificates, variances, permits and
authorizations necessary for the lawful conduct of their respective businesses
and properties and are and have been in compliance with all, and are not and
have not been in violation of any, applicable Law, except in each case where
the failure to hold such license, registration, franchise, certificate,
variance, permit or authorization or such noncompliance or violation would not
be material to Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and neither
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has Knowledge of, or has received notice
of, any violations of any of the above, except for such violations that would
not be material to Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

 



 

(b) Except as would not be material to Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as
a whole, Company and each of its Subsidiaries have properly administered all

including accounts for which Company or any of its Subsidiaries serves as a
trustee, agent, custodian, personal representative, guardian, conservator or
investment adviser, in accordance with the terms of the governing documents
and applicable Law in all material respects. None of Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, or any director, officer or employee of Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, has committed any breach of trust with respect to any such
fiduciary account that would be material to Company and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, and the accountings for each such fiduciary account are true
and correct in all material respects and accurately reflect in all material
respects the assets of such fiduciary account.

 



 

(c) Each of Company and First Federal is "well-capitalized" (as such term is
defined at 12 C.F.R. 225.2(r) or the relevant regulation of Companys or First
Federals primary federal bank regulator), and "well managed" (as that term is
defined at 12 C.F.R. 225.2(s) or the relevant regulation of Companys or First
Federals primary federal bank regulator), and the rating of First Federal
under the Community Reinvestment Act of 1997 (" _CRA_ ") is no less than
"satisfactory." Neither Company nor First Federal has been informed that its
status as "well-capitalized," "well managed" or, in the case of First Federal,
for CRA purposes, "satisfactory," will change within one (1) year.

parties thereto, which, with the giving of notice, the lapse of time or the
happening of any other event or condition, would become a default or event of
default thereunder, except where such event of default would not reasonably be
expected to, individually or in the aggregate, be material to Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

 



 

(e) Company and its Subsidiaries have operated the Owned Real Property and the

"forward-looking statements" disclaimer or any other statements that are
similarly non-specific or predictive or forward-looking in nature), Parent
hereby represents and warrants to Company as follows:

 



 

4.1 _Corporate Organization_.

 



 

(a) Parent and each of its Subsidiaries is an entity duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing (with respect to jurisdictions that recognize
such concept) under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its organization. The
deposit accounts of Parent Bank are insured by the FDIC through the Bank
Insurance Fund to the fullest extent permitted by Law, and all premiums and

authority to own or lease and operate all of its properties and assets and to
carry on its business as it is now being conducted. Parent and each of its
Subsidiaries is duly licensed or qualified to do business in each jurisdiction
in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the character or
location of the properties and assets owned or leased by it makes such
licensing or qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so
licensed or qualified would not reasonably be expected to, individually or in
the aggregate, have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. True and complete copies
of Parents Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended (the "
_Parent Articles of Incorporation_ "), and Amended and Restated Bylaws (the "
_Parent Bylaws_ "), in each case as in effect as of the date of this
Agreement, have previously been furnished or made available to Company. Parent

equity securities, or options, warrants, scrip, rights to subscribe to, calls
or commitments for any shares of its capital stock or other equity securities
and the identity of the parties to any such

 



      
 

 



 

agreements or arrangements. All of the outstanding shares of capital stock or
other securities evidencing ownership of Parent Subsidiaries are validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable and such shares or other securities are
owned by Parent or another of its Subsidiaries free and clear of any lien,
claim, charge, option, encumbrance, mortgage, pledge or security interest or
other restriction of any kind Lien with respect thereto. Except for its
interests in Parent Subsidiaries and as set forth in Section 4.1(b) of the

outstanding and no shares were held in treasury and (b) 10,000,000 shares of
Parent Preferred Stock, none of which were issued and outstanding as of the
Parent Capitalization Date. All of the issued and outstanding shares of Parent

Options and (iii) Parents equity compensation plans, there were no
outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants, puts, calls, rights,
exchangeable or convertible securities or other commitments or agreements of
any character relating to the issued or unissued capital stock or other
securities of Parent, or otherwise obligating Parent to issue, transfer, sell,
purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any such securities. As of the Parent
Capitalization Date, no Voting Debt of Parent is issued or outstanding. The
shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the Merger will be duly
authorized and validly issued and, at the Effective Time, all such shares will
be fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive rights.

availability of specific performance, injunctive relief or other equitable

properties, assets or business activities may be bound or affected, except, in
the case of clause (ii) above, for such violations, conflicts, breaches,

last such amendment or superseding filing prior to the date hereof), contained
any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. None of Parents Subsidiaries is required to file with or furnish
to the SEC any forms, reports or other documents.

of "internal controls over financial reporting" (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f)
and 15d-15(f) of the

 



      
 

 



 

Exchange Act) that is sufficient to provide reasonable assurance (i) regarding
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP, (ii) that receipts
and expenditures of Parent and its Subsidiaries are being made only in
accordance with authorizations of management and the board of directors of
Parent and (iii) regarding prevention or timely detection of the unauthorized
acquisition, use or disposition of Parents and its Subsidiaries assets that

(c) Parents "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined in Rules
13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) are designed to ensure that all
information (both financial and non-financial) required to be disclosed by
Parent in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such information is
accumulated and communicated to Parents management as appropriate to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications
of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of Parent required
under the Exchange Act with respect to such reports. Parent has disclosed,
based on its most recent evaluation of such disclosure controls and procedures
prior to the date of this Agreement, to Parents auditors and the audit
committee of the board of directors of Parent and on Section 4.6(c) of the
Parent Disclosure Schedule (i) any significant deficiencies and material
weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls over financial
reporting that could adversely affect in any material respect Parents ability

fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees
who have a significant role in Parents internal controls over financial
reporting.

Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act with respect to the Parent SEC
Reports, and the statements contained in such certifications are true and
accurate in all material respects. Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries
has outstanding (nor has arranged or modified since the enactment of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act) any "extensions of credit" (within the meaning of Section
402 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act) to directors or executive officers (as defined
in Rule 3b-7 under the Exchange Act) of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries.
Parent is otherwise in compliance with all applicable provisions of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act, except for any non-compliance that would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse
Effect.

 



 

(e) The books and records kept by Parent and its Subsidiaries are in all
material respects complete and accurate and have been maintained in the
ordinary course of business and in accordance with applicable Laws and
accounting requirements. The Parent Financial Statements have been prepared

Subsidiaries.

commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet
partnership or any similar contract or arrangement (including any contract or
arrangement relating to any transaction or

 



      
 

 



 

relationship between or among Parent and any of its Subsidiaries, on the one
hand, and any unconsolidated Affiliate, including any structured finance,
special purpose or limited purpose entity or Person, on the other hand, or any
"off-balance sheet arrangement"), where the result, purpose or intended effect
of such contract or arrangement is to avoid disclosure of any material
transaction involving, or material liabilities of, Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries in Parents or such Subsidiarys financial statements.

 



 

4.7 _Undisclosed Liabilities_. The unaudited consolidated balance sheet of
Parent dated as the Balance Sheet Date contained in the Parent SEC Documents

(b) There is no injunction, order, judgment or decree imposed upon Parent that
would reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, have a
Parent Material Adverse Effect.

licenses, registrations, franchises, certificates, variances, permits and
authorizations necessary for the lawful conduct of their respective businesses
and properties and are and have been in compliance with all, and are not and
have not been in violation of any, applicable Law, except in each case where
the failure to hold such license, registration, franchise, certificate,
variance, permit or authorization or such noncompliance or violation would not
be material to Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and neither
Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has Knowledge

trustee, agent, custodian, personal representative, guardian, conservator or
investment adviser, in accordance with the terms of the governing documents
and applicable Law in all material respects. None of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, or any director, officer or employee of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, has committed any breach of trust with respect to any such
fiduciary account that would be material to Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken
as a whole, and the accountings for each such fiduciary account are true and
correct in all material respects and accurately reflect in all material
respects the assets of such fiduciary account.

 



 

(c) Each of Parent and Parent Bank is "well-capitalized" (as such term is

Banks primary federal bank regulator), and "well managed" (as that term is
defined at 12 C.F.R. 225.2(s) or the relevant regulation of Parents or Parent
Banks primary federal bank regulator), and the rating of Parent Bank under
the CRA is no less than "satisfactory." Neither Parent nor Parent Bank has
been informed that its status as "well-capitalized," "well managed" or, in the
case of Parent Bank, for CRA purposes, "satisfactory," will change within one
(1) year.

Merger from qualifying as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Code.

result in the imposition, on Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, of any
liability or obligation arising under any Environmental Law pending or, to the
Knowledge of Parent, threatened against Parent or any of its Subsidiaries,
which liability or obligation would reasonably be expected to, individually or
in the aggregate, be material to Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole. To the Knowledge of Parent, there is no reasonable basis for any such
proceeding, claim, action or governmental investigation that would impose any
liability or obligation that would be or would reasonably be expected to be,
individually or in the aggregate, material to Parent and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole.

 



 

(c) Except as set forth in written third-party environmental reports included

taken as a whole.

 



 

(d) Parent and each of its Subsidiaries are not subject to any agreement,
order, judgment or decree by or with any court, governmental authority,
regulatory agency or third party imposing any liability or obligation with
respect to the foregoing. There has been no written third-party environmental

hazardous materials located on any property owned or leased by Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries that is within the possession or control of Parent and its
Affiliates as of the date of this Agreement that has not been delivered to

date hereof (collectively, the " _Parent Intellectual Property_ ") in the
manner that it is currently used by Parent and any of its Subsidiaries.

 



 

(b) Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has received written notice
from any third party alleging any material interference, infringement,

party and, to the Knowledge of Parent, neither Parent

 



      
 

 



 

nor any of its Subsidiaries has infringed upon, misappropriated or violated
any Intellectual Property rights of any third party. To the Knowledge of

incurred any liability for any brokers fees, commissions or finders fees in

why all regulatory approvals from any Governmental Entity required for the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement should not be
obtained on a timely basis.

 



 

4.17 _Parent Information_. None of the information supplied or to be supplied
by Parent for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Joint Proxy

such press release or such other statement or comment relating to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated herein and shall not issue any such
press release or such other statement or comment prior to such notice except
as may be required by applicable Law. In addition, neither Company nor Parent
shall issue any such press release or such other statement or comment without
the prior approval of the other party (which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), except as may be required by
applicable Law.

 



 

6.5 _Employee Benefit Matters_.

 



 

(a) From the Closing Date through the first anniversary thereof (the "
_Continuation Period_ "), Parent shall maintain or cause to be maintained life
insurance, accidental death and disability and medical benefit plans for the
benefit of employees (as a group) who are actively employed by Company and its
Subsidiaries on the Closing Date and continue to be

 



      
 

 



 

actively employed after the Effective Time (" _Covered Employees_ ") that
provide life insurance, accidental death and disability and medical benefits
(while a Covered Employee is employed during the Continuation Period) that, in
the aggregate, are substantially comparable to the life insurance, accidental
death and disability and medical benefits that are generally made available to
similarly situated employees of Parent or its Subsidiaries (other than Company
and its Subsidiaries), as applicable; _provided_ that until such time as
Parent shall cause Covered Employees to participate in the life insurance,
accidental death and disability and medical benefit plans that are made
available to similarly situated employees of Parent or its Subsidiaries (other
than Company and its Subsidiaries), a Covered Employees continued
participation in life insurance, accidental death and disability and medical
benefit plans of Company and its Subsidiaries shall be deemed to satisfy the
foregoing provisions of this sentence (it being understood that participation
in any different Parent plans may commence at different times). For the
avoidance of doubt, during the Continuation Period, each Covered Employee
shall, subject to meeting the applicable eligibility requirements, be eligible
to receive benefits upon qualifying terminations of employment that are
consistent with the terms of Parents standard severance policy for its
employees (the " _Salary Continuation Policy_ ") (and not pursuant to the
terms of any severance plan or policy maintained by Company) ; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that any Covered Employees who are eligible to receive severance
benefits, change in control benefits or any enhanced payments pursuant to any
individual employment arrangement, change in control arrangement or deferred
compensation plan shall not be eligible to receive severance benefits under
the Salary Continuation Policy.

 



 

(b) To the extent that a Covered Employee becomes eligible to participate in
an employee benefit plan maintained by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
(other than Company or its Subsidiaries), Parent shall cause such employee
benefit plan to recognize the service of such Covered Employee with Company or
its Subsidiaries for purposes of eligibility, participation and vesting under
such employee benefit plan of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, to the same
extent that such service was recognized immediately prior to the Effective
Time under a corresponding Company Benefit Plan in which such Covered Employee
was eligible to participate immediately prior to the Effective Time;
_provided_ that such recognition of service shall not (i) operate to duplicate
any benefits of a Covered Employee with respect to the same period of service,
(ii) apply for purposes of any retiree medical plans or for purposes of
benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension plan or (iii) apply for
purposes of any plan, program or arrangement (A) under which similarly
situated employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries do not receive credit for
prior service or (B) that is grandfathered or frozen, either with respect to
level of benefits or participation. With respect to any health care plan of
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (other than Company and its Subsidiaries) in
which any Covered Employee is eligible to participate for the plan year in
which such Covered Employee is first eligible to participate, Parent shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to (x) cause any preexisting condition
limitations or eligibility waiting periods under such Parent or Subsidiary
plan to be waived with respect to such Covered Employee to the extent that
such limitation would have been waived or satisfied under the Company Benefit
Plan in which such Covered Employee participated immediately prior to the
Effective Time and (y) recognize any health care expenses incurred by such
Covered Employee in the year that includes the Closing Date (or, if later, the
year in which such Covered Employee is first eligible to participate) for
purposes of any applicable deductible and annual out-of-pocket expense
requirements under any such health, dental or vision plan of Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) If requested by Parent in writing delivered to Company not less than ten
(10) Business Days before the Closing Date, the Board of Directors of the
Company (or the appropriate committee thereof) shall adopt resolutions and
take such corporate action as is necessary to terminate the Companys 401(k)
plan (the " _Company 401(k) Plan_") and to ensure that the account balances
of the participants in the Company 401(k) Plan are fully vested upon such plan
termination, in each case effective as of the day prior to the Closing Date.
Following the Effective Time and as soon as practicable following receipt of a
favorable determination letter from the IRS on the termination of the Company
401(k) Plan, the assets thereof shall be distributed to the participants, and
Parent shall, to the extent permitted by Parents 401(k) plan (the " _Parent
401(k) Plan_) "), permit the Company Employees who are actively employed as
of the date immediately following the receipt of a favorable determination
letter to make rollover contributions of "eligible rollover distributions"
(within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code, but not inclusive of
loans), in the form of cash, in an amount equal to the full account balance
(excluding loans) distributed to such Covered Employee from the Company 401(k)
Plan to the Parent 401(k) Plan.

 



 

(d) Without limiting the generality of Section 6.5 or Section 9.11, the
provisions of this Section 6.5 are solely for the benefit of the parties to
this Agreement, and no current or former employee or any other individual
associated therewith shall be regarded for any purpose as a third-party
beneficiary of this Agreement. In no event shall the terms of this Agreement
be deemed to (i) establish, amend or modify any Company Benefit Plan or any
"employee benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, or any other
benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement maintained or sponsored by
Parent, Company or any of their respective Affiliates; (ii) alter or limit the
ability of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (including, after the Closing
Date, Company and its Subsidiaries) to amend, modify or terminate any Company
Benefit Plan, employment agreement or any other benefit or employment plan,
program, agreement or arrangement after the Closing Date; or (iii) confer upon
any current or former employee, officer, director or consultant any right to
employment or continued employment or continued service with Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries (including, following the Closing Date, Company and its
Subsidiaries), or constitute or create an employment agreement with any
employee.

 



 

(e) Parent shall assume and honor the obligations of Company and its
Subsidiaries under all employment, severance, consulting, retirement and other
compensation Contracts in accordance with their terms, except to the extent
such Contract is superseded or modified by an agreement with Parent or plan or
policy maintained by Parent (including the Salary Continuation Policy). Parent
hereby acknowledges that the Merger will constitute a "Change in Control" (or
concept of similar import) in accordance with the provisions of such Contracts
and the Company Benefit Plans.

 



 

6.6 _Additional Agreements_.

 



 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of Company and
Parent agree to cooperate fully with each other and to use reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make
effective, at the time and in the manner contemplated by this Agreement, the
Merger. In case at any time after the Effective Time any further action is

 



      
 

 



 

necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement (including
any merger between a Subsidiary of Parent, on the one hand, and a Subsidiary
of Company, on the other) or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full title
to all properties, assets, rights, approvals, immunities and franchises of
either party to the Merger, the proper officers and directors of each party
and their respective Subsidiaries shall, at Parents sole expense, take all
such necessary action as may be reasonably requested by Parent.

 



 

(b) Company shall, in consultation with Parent, use its best efforts to
repurchase from Treasury the Treasury Warrant in full, effective at or before
the Effective Time, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in Section

(c) Company shall, and shall cause its Advisory Entities to, use reasonable
best efforts to obtain any consents and approvals required or reasonably
necessary under applicable Law or pursuant to the terms of each Advisory
Contract to effect the assignment or continuation of such Advisory Contract in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, and Company agrees to
consult in advance with Parent regarding the timing and content of any notices
or communications in furtherance of the foregoing.

 



 

6.7 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_.

 



 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall indemnify and hold
harmless each person who is now, or who has been at any time before the date
of this Agreement, or who becomes before the Effective Time, a director or
officer of Company (each, a " _Company Indemnified Party_ ") against all
losses, claims, damages, costs, expenses (including reasonable attorneys
fees), liabilities or judgments or amounts that are paid in settlement (which
settlement shall require the prior written consent of Parent, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld) of or in connection with any claim,
action, suit, proceeding, investigation or other legal proceeding, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative or investigation (each, a "
_Claim_ "), in which a Company Indemnified Party is, or is threatened to be
made, a party or witness or arising out of the fact that such person is or was
a director or officer of Company if such Claim pertains to any matter of fact
arising, existing or occurring at or before the Effective Time (including the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby), regardless of whether
such Claim is asserted or claimed before, or after, the Effective Time, to the
fullest extent permitted under the Company Articles of Incorporation or
Company Bylaws to the extent permitted by applicable Law. Parent shall pay
reasonable expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees) in advance of the
final disposition of any such proceeding to each Company Indemnified Party to
the fullest extent permitted by applicable state or federal Law upon receipt
of an undertaking to repay such advance payments if he or she shall be
adjudicated or determined to be not entitled to indemnification under this
Section 6.7(a).

 



 

(b) Any Company Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under
Section 6.7(a), upon learning of any Claim, shall promptly notify Parent
thereof. In the event of any such Claim (whether arising before or after the
Effective Time), (i) Parent shall have the right to assume the defense thereof
and Parent shall not be liable to such Company Indemnified Parties for any
legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred by
such Company Indemnified Parties in connection with the defense thereof,
except that if Parent elects not to assume such defense or counsel for the
Company Indemnified Parties advises that

 



       
 

 



 

there are substantive issues which raise conflicts of interest between Parent
and the Company Indemnified Parties, the Company Indemnified Parties may
retain counsel satisfactory to them, and Parent shall pay all reasonable fees
and expenses of such counsel for the Company Indemnified Parties promptly as
statements therefor are received; _provided_ that Parent shall be obligated
pursuant to this Section 6.7(b) to pay for only one firm of counsel for all
Company Indemnified Parties in any jurisdiction; (ii) the Company Indemnified
Parties will cooperate in the defense of any such Claim; and (iii) Parent
shall not be liable for any settlement effected without its prior written
consent; _provided_ that Parent shall not have any obligation hereunder to any
Company Indemnified Party when and if a court of competent jurisdiction shall
determine, and such determination shall have become final, that the
indemnification of such Company Indemnified Party in the manner contemplated
hereby is prohibited by applicable Law.

 



 

(c) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts (and Company shall cooperate
prior to the Effective Time in these efforts) to maintain in effect for a
period of six (6) years after the Effective Time Companys existing directors
and officers liability insurance policy ( _provided_ that Parent may
substitute therefor (i) policies of at least the same coverage and amounts
containing terms and conditions which are substantially no less advantageous
or (ii) with the consent of Company given prior to the Effective Time, any
other policy) with respect to claims arising from facts or events which
occurred prior to the Effective Time and covering persons who are currently
covered by such insurance; _provided_ , that in no event shall Parent be
required to expend annually in the aggregate an amount in excess of 300% of
the annual premium payment on Companys current policy in effect as of the
date of this Agreement and, if Parent is unable to maintain such policy (or
substitute policy) as a result of this proviso, Parent shall obtain as much
comparable insurance as is available for a period of six years following the
Effective Time by payment of such amount; _provided_ , _further_ , that (i)
Parent may substitute therefor a six (6)-year "tail" prepaid policy the
material terms of which, including coverage and amount, are no less favorable
in any material respect to such directors and officers than Companys existing
policies as of the date hereof, _provided_ that Parent shall not be obligated
to pay, in the aggregate, an amount greater than the " _Maximum Amount_ ," as
set forth on Section 6.7(c) of the Disclosure Schedule, for such "tail" policy
and _provided_ , _further_ , that if the aggregate amount necessary to procure
or maintain such "tail" policy exceeds the Maximum Amount, Parent shall be
deemed to have satisfied its obligations under this Section 6.7(c) so long as
it uses its reasonable best efforts to obtain the most advantageous (in terms
of both duration and coverage) "tail" prepaid policy obtainable for an
aggregate amount equal to the Maximum Amount or (ii) Parent may request that
Company obtain such extended reporting period coverage under Companys
existing insurance programs (to be effective as of the Effective Time).

 



 

(d) The provisions of this Section 6.7 are intended to be for the benefit of,
and shall be enforceable by, each Company Indemnified Party and their
respective heirs and representatives.

 



 

6.8 _Exchange Listing_. Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to list,
prior to the Effective Time, on the NASDAQ, subject to official notice of
issuance, the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the
Merger, and Parent shall give all notices and make all filings with the ****
NASDAQ required in connection with the transactions contemplated herein.

 



      
 

 



 

6.9 _No Solicitation_.

 



 

(a) Each of Company and Parent agrees that neither it nor any of its
Subsidiaries, nor any of its and their respective officers, directors,
employees, agents, investment bankers, financial advisors, attorneys,
accountants and other retained representatives (each, a " _Representative_ ")
shall, and that it shall cause its Subsidiaries, and its and their respective
Representatives, not to, directly or indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit,
knowingly encourage or facilitate any inquiries or the making of any proposal
or offer with respect to, or a transaction to effect, a merger,
reorganization, share exchange, consolidation, sale of assets, sale of shares
of capital stock (including by way of tender offer), business combination,
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, as
applicable, that, if consummated, would constitute an Alternative Transaction
(any of the foregoing inquiries, proposals or offers being referred to herein
as an " _Acquisition Proposal_ "), (ii) participate in any discussions with or
provide any confidential information or data to any Person (or Representative
of such Person) relating to an Acquisition Proposal or Alternative
Transaction, or engage in any negotiations concerning an Acquisition Proposal
or Alternative Transaction, or knowingly facilitate any effort or attempt to
make or implement an Acquisition Proposal or Alternative Transaction, (iii)
approve or execute or enter into any letter of intent, agreement in principle,
merger agreement, asset purchase or share exchange agreement, option agreement
or other Contract related to any Acquisition Proposal or Alternative

board of directors of Parent shall each be permitted, prior to its respective
meeting of stockholders or shareholders to be held pursuant to Section 6.3,
and subject to compliance with the other terms of this Section 6.9 and to

nonpublic information or data to, any Person in response to an unsolicited
_bona fide_ written Acquisition Proposal by such Person first made after the
date of this Agreement (that did not result from a breach of this Section 6.9)
and which the board of directors of Company or Parent, as applicable,
concludes in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel and
financial advisors) constitutes or is reasonably likely to result in a
Superior Proposal, if and only to the extent that the directors of Company or
Parent, as applicable, conclude in good faith (after consultation with their
outside legal counsel) that failure to do so would be reasonably likely to
violate their fiduciary duties under applicable Law. Company and Parent, as
applicable, shall provide the other with a copy of any nonpublic information
or data provided to any Person pursuant to the prior sentence prior to or
simultaneously with furnishing such information to such Person.

 



 

(d) Each party shall notify the other party promptly (but in no event later

that it is considering making, or has made, an Acquisition Proposal, or any
inquiry from any Person seeking to have discussions or negotiations with such
party relating to a possible Acquisition Proposal or Alternative Transaction.
Such notice shall be made orally and confirmed in writing, and shall indicate

thereof shall withhold, withdraw or modify in any manner adverse to the other
party, or propose publicly to withhold, withdraw or modify in any manner
adverse to the other party, the approval, recommendation or declaration of
advisability by the board of directors of Company or Parent, as applicable, or
any such committee thereof with respect to this Agreement or the transactions

 



      
 

 



 

contemplated hereby (a " _Change in Company Recommendation_ " or a " _Change
in Parent Recommendation_ ," respectively).

 



 

(f) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, with respect
to an Acquisition Proposal, the board of directors of Company or Parent, as
applicable, may make a Change in Company Recommendation or a Change in Parent
Recommendation, as applicable, if and only if (A) an unsolicited _bona fide_
written Acquisition Proposal (that did not result from a breach of this
Section 6.9) is made to Company or Parent, as applicable, by a third party,
and such Acquisition Proposal is not withdrawn, (B) the board of directors of
Company or Parent, as applicable, has concluded in good faith (after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors) that such
Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal, (C) the directors of
Company or Parent, as applicable, have concluded in good faith (after
consultation with their outside legal counsel) that failure to do so would be
reasonably likely to violate their fiduciary duties under applicable Law, (D)
five (5) Business Days shall have elapsed since the party proposing to take
such action has given written notice to the other party advising such other
party that the notifying party intends to take such action and specifying in
reasonable detail the reasons therefor, including the terms and conditions of
any such Acquisition Proposal that is the basis of the proposed action (a "
_Notice of Recommendation Change_ ") (it being understood that any amendment
to any material term of such Acquisition Proposal shall require a new Notice
of Recommendation Change, except that, in such case, the (5) Business Day
period referred to in this clause (D) and in clauses (E) and (F) shall be
reduced to three (3) Business Days following the giving of such new Notice of
Recommendation Change), (E) during such five (5) Business Day period, the
notifying party has considered and, at the reasonable request of the other
party, engaged in good faith discussions with such party regarding, any
adjustment or modification of the terms of this Agreement proposed by the
other party, and (F) the directors of the party proposing to take such action,
following such five (5) Business Day period, again reasonably determine in
good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel and its
financial advisors, and taking into account any adjustment or modification of
the terms of this Agreement proposed by the other party) that such Acquisition
Proposal nonetheless continues to constitute a Superior Proposal and that
failure to take such action would violate their fiduciary duties under
applicable Law.

 



 

(g) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Superior Proposal_ " for Company or
Parent means an unsolicited, _bona fide_ written Acquisition Proposal made by
a third Person (or group of Persons acting in concert within the meaning of
Rule 13d-5 under the Exchange Act) to acquire, directly or indirectly,
pursuant to a tender offer, exchange offer, merger, consolidation or other
business combination or acquisition transaction, (A) all or substantially all
of the assets of Company or Parent, as applicable, or (B) all of the
outstanding voting securities of Company or Parent, as applicable, and, which
the board of directors of Company or Parent, as applicable, has in good faith
determined (taking into account, among other things, (1) its consultation with
its outside legal counsel and its financial advisors and (2) the terms and
conditions of such Acquisition Proposal and this Agreement (as it may be
proposed to be amended by Parent or Company, as applicable)), to be more
favorable, from a financial point of view, to Companys stockholders or
Parents shareholders, as applicable, than the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (as it may be proposed to be amended by Parent or Company, as
applicable) and to be reasonably capable of being consummated on the terms
proposed, taking into account all

 



      
 

 



 

other legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of such Acquisition
Proposal and the Person making the proposal.

 



 

(h) Nothing contained in this Section 6.9 shall prohibit either party or its
Subsidiaries from taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position
contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or from
making a statement contemplated by Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A or Rule
14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act, or from issuing a "stop, look and
listen" statement pending disclosure of its position thereunder; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that compliance with such rules shall not in any way limit or
modify the effect that any action taken pursuant to such rules has under any
other provision of this Agreement, including Section 8.1(f) or Section 8.1(h),
as applicable; _provided_ , _further_ , that any such disclosure that
addresses or relates to the approval, recommendation or declaration of
advisability by the board of directors of such party, as applicable, with
respect to this Agreement or an Acquisition Proposal or Alternative
Transaction shall be deemed to be a Change in Company Recommendation or Change
in Parent Recommendation, as applicable, unless the board of directors of such
party, in connection with such communication publicly states that its
recommendation with respect to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby has not changed or refers to the prior recommendation of
such party, without disclosing any Change in Company Recommendation or Change
in Parent Recommendation, as applicable.

 



 

(i) Each of Company and Parent agrees that it (i) will and will cause its
Subsidiaries, and its and their Representatives to, cease immediately and
terminate any and all existing activities, discussions or negotiations with
any third parties conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal or Alternative Transaction and (ii) will not release any third party
from, or waive any provisions of, any confidentiality or standstill agreement
to which it or any of its Subsidiaries is a party with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal or Alternative Transaction. Each of Company and Parent
agrees that it will promptly inform its and its Subsidiaries respective
Representatives of the obligations undertaken in this Section 6.9.

this Agreement or (y) affect any other obligation of the parties under this

WHEREAS, the Member has invaluable knowledge and expertise regarding the
business of First Financial and the Company wishes to appoint the Member to
serve on the South Carolina Advisory Board on the terms and subject to the
conditions specified hereinafter.

 



 

NOW, THEREFORE, for good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the Company and the Member hereby
agree as follows:

 



 

1. _Advisory Period_. The Member shall be appointed to serve on the South Carolina Advisory Board commencing on the Closing Date (as defined in the Merger Agreement) (the " _Effective Date_ ") and shall continue to serve until the third anniversary of the Effective Date, unless terminated earlier as provided herein (the " _Advisory Period_ ").

The Member acknowledges that he is solely responsible for the payment of all Federal, state, local and foreign taxes that are required by applicable laws or regulations to be paid with respect to the Advisory Fees payable hereunder.

 



 

7. _Restrictive Covenants_.

 



 

(a) **Restrictive Covenants**. The Member shall not take any of the following
actions during the period beginning on the Effective Date and ending on the
third anniversary of the Effective Date (the " _Restricted Period_ ").

 



 

(i) Become employed by (as an officer, director, employee, consultant or
otherwise), involved or engaged in, provide service to, or otherwise become
commercially or financially interested in or affiliated with (other than as a
less than 1% equity owner of any corporation traded on any national,
international or regional stock exchange or in the over-the-counter market)
any person or entity that participates in, or proposes to enter the, business
of providing banking, lending, investment advisory, financial planning,
depositary, trust, brokerage or similar services in, or to customers or
clients located in, the Territory (as such term is defined below) (any such

Company;

 



 

(ii) Solicit, divert or take away, or attempt to solicit, divert or take away,
or in association with any other person, solicit, divert or take away or

(collectively " _Company Affiliates_ "), or otherwise induce such customers or
clients or prospective customers or clients to reduce, terminate, restrict or
alter their business relationship with the Company or any Company Affiliate in

Company or Company Affiliate or is or would be a Competing Party.

counties collectively the " _Territory_ ").

 



 

(c) **Member s Representation**. The Member acknowledges and agrees that the
restrictions of this Section 7 are necessary and vital to protect the
legitimate business interests of the Company and its Affiliates, are fair and
reasonable in all respects, and are not overbroad or unduly burdensome to him
or her. If a court determines that this Agreement or any covenant contained
herein is unreasonable, void or unenforceable, for any reason whatsoever, then
in such event the parties hereto agree that the duration, geographical or
other limitation imposed herein should be such as the court determines to be
fair and reasonable; it being the intent of each of the parties hereto be
subject to an agreement that is necessary for the protection of the legitimate
interest of the Company and/or Company Affiliate and its successors or assigns
and that is not unduly harsh in curtailing the legitimate rights of the
Member.

Affiliate will have no adequate means of protecting its rights under this
Agreement other than by securing an injunction. The Member agrees that the
Company or Company Affiliate is entitled to enforce this Agreement by
obtaining a preliminary and permanent injunction and any other appropriate
equitable relief in any court of competent jurisdiction. The Member
acknowledges that the Companys or Company Affiliates recovery of damages
will not be an adequate means to redress a breach of this Agreement. Nothing
contained in this Section 7 shall prohibit the Company or Company Affiliate
from obtaining any appropriate remedies in addition to injunctive relief,
including recovery of damages.

 



 

(e) **Obligations Survive**. The Members obligations under this Section 7
shall survive any early termination of the Advisory Period with the Company.

The parties hereto acknowledge that, regardless of the reason for any such termination, the Member shall continue to receive Advisory Fees through the third anniversary of the Effective Date, and the parties further agree and acknowledge that the Restricted Period shall continue to apply to the Member for the Restricted Period (as defined in Section 7) irrespective of any earlier termination of the Advisory Period; _provided_ , _however_ , that in addition to any other remedy that the Company may seek, the Company shall cease to pay Advisory Fees to the Member upon any breach of Section 7(a) hereof.

 



      
 

 



 

9. _Miscellaneous_.

 



 

(a) _Successors and Assigns_. This Agreement will be binding upon, inure to
the benefit of and be enforceable by, as applicable, the Company and the
Member and their respective personal or legal representatives, executors,
administrators, successors, assigns, heirs, distributees and legatees. This
Agreement is personal in nature and the Member shall not, without the written
consent of the Company, assign, transfer or delegate this Agreement or any
rights or obligations hereunder.

Section 409A of the Code). Nevertheless, the tax treatment of the benefits
provided under the

 



      
 

 



 

Agreement is not warranted or guaranteed. Neither the Company nor its
directors, officers, employees or advisers (other than the Member) shall be
held liable for any taxes, interest, penalties or other monetary amounts owed
by the Member as a result of the application of Section 409A of the Code.

 



 

(b) _Definitional Restrictions_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, to the extent that any amount or benefit that would constitute
non-exempt "deferred compensation" for purposes of Section 409A of the Code ("
_Non-Exempt Deferred Compensation_ ") would otherwise be payable or
distributable hereunder by reason of the Members termination of service, such
Non-Exempt Deferred Compensation will not be payable or distributable to the
Member unless the circumstances giving rise to such termination of service
meet any description or definition of "separation from service" in Section
409A of the Code and applicable regulations (without giving effect to any
elective provisions that may be available under such definition). This
provision does not prohibit the _vesting_ of any Non-Exempt Deferred
Compensation upon a termination of service, however defined. If this provision
prevents the payment or distribution of any Non-Exempt Deferred Compensation,
such payment shall be made on the date on which an event occurs that
constitutes a Section 409A-compliant "separation from service."
