AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER   THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this
"Agreement"), dated as of July 13, 2001, is by and among PerkinElmer, Inc., a
Massachusetts corporation (the "Buyer"), Pablo Acquisition Corp., a Delaware
corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Buyer (the "Transitory
Subsidiary"), and Packard BioScience Company, a Delaware corporation (the
"Company").   WHEREAS, the boards of directors of the Buyer and the Company
deem it advisable and in the best interests of each corporation and their
respective stockholders that the Buyer acquire the Company;   WHEREAS, the
acquisition of the Company shall be effected through a merger (the "Merger")
of the Transitory Subsidiary with and into the Company in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement and the General Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware (the "DGCL"), as a result of which the Company shall become a wholly
owned subsidiary of the Buyer;   WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution
and delivery of this Agreement and as a condition and inducement to the
Buyer\'s willingness to enter into this Agreement, (i) Stonington Capital
Appreciation 1994 Fund, L.P. has entered into a Stockholder\'s Agreement,
dated as of the date of this Agreement, in the form attached hereto as
Exhibit A (the "Stockholder\'s Agreement") and (ii) the individuals and
entities listed in Exhibit B hereto have each entered into Voting Agreements,
in the form attached hereto as Exhibit C (the "Voting Agreements"), pursuant
to which, among other things, such stockholders have agreed to give the Buyer
a proxy to vote all of the shares of capital stock of the Company that such
stockholders own in favor of the Merger; and   WHEREAS, for United States
federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the Merger shall qualify as
a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code");   NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of
the foregoing and the respective representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements set forth below, the Buyer, the Transitory Subsidiary and the
Company agree as follows:   ARTICLE I   THE MERGER   1.1 Effective Time
of the Merger. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, prior to the
Closing, the Buyer shall prepare, and on the Closing Date or as soon as
practicable thereafter the Buyer shall cause to be filed with the Secretary
of State of the State of Delaware, a certificate of merger (the "Certificate
of Merger") in such form as is required by, and executed by the Surviving
Corporation in accordance with, the relevant provisions of the DGCL and shall
make all other filings or recordings required under the DGCL. The Merger
shall become effective upon the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the
Secretary of State of the State of  9   Delaware or at such later time as
is established by the Buyer and the Company and set forth in the Certificate
of Merger (the "Effective Time").   1.2 Closing. The closing of the Merger
(the "Closing") shall take place at 10:00 a.m., Boston time, on a date to be
specified by the Buyer and the Company (the "Closing Date"), which shall be
no later than the second business day after satisfaction or waiver of the
conditions set forth in Article VII (other than delivery of items to be
delivered at the Closing and other than satisfaction of those conditions that
by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, it being understood that
the occurrence of the Closing shall remain subject to the delivery of such
items and the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions at the Closing), at
the offices of Hale and Dorr LLP, 60 State Street, Boston, Massachusetts,
unless another date, place or time is agreed to in writing by the Buyer and
the Company.   1.3 Effects of the Merger. At the Effective Time (i) the
separate existence of the Transitory Subsidiary shall cease and the
Transitory Subsidiary shall be merged with and into the Company (the
Transitory Subsidiary and the Company are sometimes referred to herein as the
"Constituent Corporations" and the Company following the Merger is sometimes
referred to herein as the "Surviving Corporation"), (ii) the Certificate of
Incorporation of the Company as in effect on the date of this Agreement shall
be amended so that Article FOURTH of such Certificate of Incorporation reads
in its entirety as follows: "The total number of shares of all classes of
stock which the Corporation shall have authority to issue is 1,000, all of
which shall consist of common stock, $.01 par value per share," and, as so
amended, such Certificate of Incorporation shall be the Certificate of
Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation, until further amended in
accordance with the DGCL and (iii) the By-laws of the Transitory Subsidiary
as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be amended to
change all references to the name of the Transitory Subsidiary to refer to
the name of the Company, and, as so amended, such By-laws shall be the By-
laws of the Surviving Corporation, until further amended in accordance
with the DGCL. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in Section 259 of
the DGCL.   1.4 Directors and Officers. The directors and officers of
the Transitory Subsidiary immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
the initial directors and officers of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold
office in accordance with the Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws of the
Surviving Corporation.   ARTICLE II   CONVERSION OF SECURITIES   2.1
Conversion of Capital Stock. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of the
capital stock of the Company or capital stock of the Transitory
Subsidiary:   (a) Capital Stock of the Transitory Subsidiary. Each share of
the common stock of the Transitory Subsidiary issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall   -2-  10 be converted into
and become one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, $.01 par
value per share, of the Surviving Corporation.   (b) Cancellation of
Treasury Stock and Buyer-Owned Stock. All shares of common stock, $.002 par
value per share, of the Company ("Company Common Stock") that are owned by
the Company as treasury stock or by any wholly owned Subsidiary of the
Company and any shares of Company Common Stock owned by the Buyer, the
Transitory Subsidiary or any other wholly owned Subsidiary of the Buyer
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and shall cease to
exist and no stock of the Buyer or other consideration shall be delivered
in exchange therefor.   (c) Conversion of Company Common Stock. Subject to
Section 2.2, each share of Company Common Stock (other than shares to be
cancelled in accordance with Section 2.1(b)) issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be automatically converted into
the right to receive 0.311 shares (the "Exchange Ratio") of common stock,
$1.00 par value per share, of the Buyer ("Buyer Common Stock") upon surrender
of the certificate representing such share of Company Common Stock in the
manner provided in Section 2.2. The Exchange Ratio is sometimes referred to
as the "Merger Consideration." As of the Effective Time, all such shares of
Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically
be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate
representing any such shares of Company Common Stock shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration pursuant to this Section 2.1(c) and any cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Buyer Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration
therefor upon surrender of such certificate in accordance with Section 2.2,
without interest.   (d) Adjustments to Exchange Ratio. In the event of
any reclassification, stock split, reverse split, stock dividend (including
any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Buyer Common
Stock or Company Common Stock, as the case may be), reorganization,
recapitalization or other like change with respect to Buyer Common Stock or
Company Common Stock, as the case may be, occurring (or for which a record
date is established) after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time,
the Exchange Ratio shall be proportionately adjusted to reflect fully such
event.   (e) Unvested Stock. At the Effective Time, any
Merger Consideration issued or paid in accordance with Section 2.1(c) with
respect to any unvested shares of Company Common Stock awarded to employees,
directors or consultants pursuant to any of the Company\'s plans or
arrangements and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
remain subject to the same terms, restrictions and vesting schedule as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, except to the extent by their
terms such unvested shares of Company Common Stock vest at the Effective
Time. The Company shall not take or permit any action which would accelerate
vesting of any unvested shares, except to the extent required by their terms
as in effect on the date hereof. Copies of the relevant agreements governing
such shares and the vesting thereof have been made available to the Buyer.
All outstanding rights which the Company may hold immediately prior to the
Effective Time to repurchase unvested shares of Company Common   -3- 
11 Stock shall be assigned to the Buyer in the Merger and shall thereafter
be exercisable by the Buyer upon the same terms and conditions in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that the shares
purchasable pursuant to such rights and the purchase price payable per share
shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect the Exchange Ratio. The Company
shall take all steps necessary to cause the foregoing provisions of this
Section 2.1(e) to occur.   (f) Treatment of Company Stock Options.
Following the Effective Time, Company Stock Options shall be treated in the
manner set forth in Section 6.12.   2.2 Exchange of Certificates. The
procedures for exchanging outstanding shares of Company Common Stock for
Merger Consideration pursuant to the Merger are as follows:   (a) Exchange
Agent. As of the Effective Time, the Buyer shall deposit with a bank or trust
company designated by the Buyer and reasonably acceptable to the Company (the
"Exchange Agent"), for the benefit of the holders of shares of the Company
Common Stock, for exchange in accordance with this Section 2.2, through the
Exchange Agent, (i) certificates representing that number of whole shares of
Buyer Common Stock equal to the aggregate number of shares of Buyer Common
Stock issuable pursuant to Section 2.1(c), (ii) cash in an amount sufficient
to make payments for fractional shares required pursuant to Section 2.2(e)
and (iii) any dividends or distributions to which holders of shares of
Company Common Stock may be entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(c). The shares
of Buyer Common Stock deposited with the Exchange Agent pursuant to clause
(i) above, together with any dividends or distributions with respect thereto
with a record date after the Effective Time, and the cash deposited pursuant
to clause (ii) above being hereinafter referred to as the
"Exchange Fund."   (b) Exchange Procedures. As soon as reasonably
practicable after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each
holder of record of a certificate or certificates which immediately prior to
the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of the Company Common Stock
(the "Certificates") whose shares were converted pursuant to Section 2.1 into
the right to receive Merger Consideration (i) a letter of transmittal (which
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the
Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as
the Buyer may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for effecting the
surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration (plus
cash in lieu of fractional shares, if any, of Buyer Common Stock and any
dividends or distributions as provided below). Upon surrender of a
Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent or to such other agent or
agents as may be appointed by the Buyer, together with such letter of
transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be
required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor (A) a certificate representing that
number of whole shares of Buyer Common Stock which such holder has the right
to receive pursuant to Section 2.1(c), (B) cash in an amount sufficient
to make payments for fractional shares pursuant to the provisions of Section
2.2(e) and (C) any dividends or distributions pursuant to the provisions of
Section 2.2(c), and the Certificate so surrendered shall immediately be
cancelled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock
which is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, (x) a
certificate representing the proper   -4-  12 number of shares of Buyer
Common Stock issuable pursuant to Section 2.1(c), (y) the proper amount of
cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.2(e) and (z) any
dividends or distributions pursuant to Section 2.2(c) may be issued or paid
to a person other than the person in whose name the Certificate so
surrendered is registered, if such Certificate is presented to the
Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect
such transfer and by evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have
been paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.2, each
Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent
only the right to receive upon such surrender (1) the Merger Consideration
issuable or payable pursuant to Section 2.1(c), (2) cash in lieu of
fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.2(e) and (3) any dividends or
distributions pursuant to Section 2.2(c) as contemplated by this Section
2.2.   (c) Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares. No dividends
or other distributions declared or made after the Effective Time with respect
to Buyer Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be
paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate and no cash payment
in lieu of fractional shares shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to
Section 2.2(e) until the holder of record of such Certificate shall surrender
such Certificate. Subject to the effect of applicable laws, following
surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be issued and paid to the
record holder of the Certificate, (i) certificates representing whole shares
of Buyer Common Stock issued in exchange therefor, (ii) at the time of such
surrender, the amount of any cash payable in lieu of a fractional share of
Buyer Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section
2.2(e) and the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date
after the Effective Time previously paid with respect to such whole shares of
Buyer Common Stock, without interest and (iii) at the appropriate payment
date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after
the Effective Time but prior to surrender and a payment date subsequent to
surrender payable with respect to such whole shares of Buyer Common
Stock.   (d) No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock.
All Merger Consideration issued and paid upon the surrender for exchange
of Certificates in accordance with the terms hereof (including any cash
or dividends or other distributions paid pursuant to Sections 2.2(c) or
2.2(e)) shall be deemed to have been issued (and paid) in full satisfaction
of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock, and from and
after the Effective Time there shall be no further registration of transfers
on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of
Company Common Stock which were outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to
the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be
cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Article II.   (e) No Fractional
Shares. No certificate or scrip representing fractional shares of Buyer
Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates,
and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to
vote or to any other rights of a stockholder of the Buyer. Notwithstanding
any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of shares of Company
Common Stock converted pursuant to the Merger who would otherwise have been
entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Buyer Common Stock (after taking
into   -5-  13 account all Certificates delivered by such holder) shall
receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without interest) in an amount equal to such
fractional part of a share of Buyer Common Stock multiplied by the weighted
average of the per share selling prices of the Buyer Common Stock on the New
York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") during the ten consecutive trading days ending
on the last trading day prior to the Effective Time.   (f) Termination of
Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which remains undistributed
to the holders of Company Common Stock for 180 days after the Effective Time
shall be delivered to the Buyer, upon demand, and any holder of Company
Common Stock who has not previously complied with this Section 2.2 shall
thereafter look only to the Buyer, as a general unsecured creditor, for
payment of its claim for Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional
shares of Buyer Common Stock issued pursuant to Section 2.2(e) and any
dividends or distributions issued pursuant to Section 2.2(c).   (g) No
Liability. To the extent permitted by applicable law, none of the Buyer, the
Transitory Subsidiary, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange
Agent shall be liable to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock or
Buyer Common Stock or to any other person for such shares of Buyer Common
Stock (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) delivered in good
faith to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar law. If any Certificate shall not have been
surrendered prior to one year after the Effective Time (or immediately prior
to such earlier date on which any Merger Consideration, and any cash in lieu
of fractional shares payable to the holder of such Certificate pursuant to
Section 2.2(e) or any dividends or distributions payable to the holder of
such Certificate pursuant to Section 2.2(c) would otherwise escheat to or
become the property of any Governmental Entity), all such Merger
Consideration or cash in lieu of fractional shares, dividends or
distributions in respect of such Certificate shall, to the extent permitted
by applicable law, become the property of the Buyer, free and clear of all
claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto.   (h)
Withholding Rights. Each of the Buyer and the Surviving Corporation shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock
such amounts as it reasonably determines that it is required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any
other applicable provision of law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld
by the Surviving Corporation or the Buyer, as the case may be, and timely
paid to the applicable Governmental Entity, such withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
holder of the shares of Company Common Stock in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation or the Buyer,
as the case may be.   (i) Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact
by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and,
if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such person of a
bond in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall   -6-  14 issue in exchange for
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration, any cash
in lieu of fractional shares, and unpaid dividends and distributions on
shares of Buyer Common Stock deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this
Agreement.   (j) Rule 145 Affiliates. Notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary, Certificates surrendered for exchange by any affiliate of the
Company (within the meaning of Rule 145 promulgated under the Securities Act)

Company to the Buyer and the Transitory Subsidiary on or before the date of
this Agreement (the "Company Disclosure Schedule"). The Company Disclosure
Schedule shall be arranged in paragraphs corresponding to the numbered and
lettered paragraphs contained in this Article III and the disclosure in any

standing as a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction where the character of
its properties owned, operated or leased or the nature of its activities

Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (III) conditions, events or circumstances
directly arising out of or directly attributable to (x) a material breach of
this Agreement by the Buyer or the Transitory Subsidiary, or (y) the Merger
or any other transaction involving the parties hereto contemplated by this
Agreement, or (IV) conditions, events or circumstances directly arising out
of or directly attributable to the public announcement of this Agreement or

in a Company Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries nor, to the Company\'s knowledge, any other party to any Company
Material Contract is in violation of or in default under (nor does there

regulations thereunder (including without limitation Section 4980 B of the
Code, Subtitle K, Chapter 100 of the Code and Sections 601 through 608 and
Section 701 et seq. of ERISA) and in accordance with its terms and each
of the Company, the Company\'s Subsidiaries and their ERISA Affiliates has in
all material respects met its obligations with respect to such Company
Employee Plan and has made all required contributions thereto (or reserved
such contributions on the Company Balance Sheet). All material filings and
reports as to each Company Employee Plan required to have been submitted to
the Internal Revenue Service or to the United States Department of Labor have
been timely submitted. With respect to the Company Employee Plans, no event
has occurred, and to the knowledge of the Company, there exists no condition
or set of circumstances in connection with which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries could be subject to any material liability under ERISA, the Code
or any other applicable law.   (d) With respect to the Company Employee
Plans, there are no material benefit obligations for which contributions have

the effect that such Company Employee Plans are qualified and the plans and
trusts related thereto are exempt from federal income taxes under Sections
401(a) and 501(a), respectively, of the Code, no such determination letter
has been revoked and, to the knowledge of the Company, revocation has not
been threatened, and no such Employee Benefit Plan has been amended or
operated since the date of its most recent determination letter
or application therefor in any respect, and no act or omission has occurred,
that would adversely affect its qualification or require corrections that
would result in material liability to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.
Each Company Employee Plan which is required to satisfy Section 401(k)(3) or
Section 401(m)(2) of the Code has been tested for compliance with, and
satisfies in all material respects the requirements of Section 401(k)(3) and
Section 401(m)(2) of the Code, as the case may be, for each plan year ending
prior to the Closing Date.   (f) Neither the Company, any of the Company\'s

Title IV of ERISA or (ii) at any time within the last six years been
obligated to contribute to a "multi-employer plan" (as defined in Section

satisfied in full. No Company Employee Plan is funded by, associated with or
related to a "voluntary employee\'s beneficiary association" within
the meaning of Section 501(c)(9) of the Code. No Company Employee Plan
holds securities issued by the Company, any of the Company\'s Subsidiaries or
any of their ERISA Affiliates.   (g) Each Company Employee Plan, other than
any Company Employee Plan that is an individual agreement or an equity
compensation plan, is amendable and terminable unilaterally by the Company
and any of the Company\'s Subsidiaries party thereto or covered thereby at
any time without material liability, including liability for surrender
charges, deferred sales charges and the like, but excluding benefits accrued
through the date of amendment or termination, to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries as a result thereof and no such Company Employee Plan, plan
documentation or agreement, summary plan description or other written
communication distributed generally to employees by its terms prohibits the
Company or any of the Company\'s Subsidiaries party thereto or covered
thereby from amending or terminating any such Company Employee Plan.   (h)
Except as disclosed in the Company SEC Reports filed prior to the date of
this Agreement, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to
any oral or written (i) agreement with any stockholders, director, executive
officer or other key employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (A)
the benefits of which are contingent, or the terms of which are materially
altered, upon the occurrence of a transaction involving the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries of the nature of any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, (B)   -23-  31 providing any term of employment or
compensation guarantee or (C) providing severance benefits or other benefits

executive officer or key employee; or (ii) agreement or plan binding the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, including any stock option plan, stock
appreciation right plan, restricted stock plan, stock purchase plan or
severance benefit plan, any of the benefits of which shall be increased, or

of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the value of any
of the benefits of which shall be calculated on the basis of any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   (i) None of the Company
Employee Plans promises or provides retiree medical or other retiree welfare
benefits to any person, except as required by applicable law.   (j) There
is no action, suit, proceeding, claim, arbitration, audit or investigation
pending or to the knowledge of the Company, threatened, with respect to any
Company Employee Plan, other than claims for benefits in the ordinary course,
that would reasonably be expected to result in liability to the Company or to
such Company Employee Plan.   (k) Except as would not, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Company Material Adverse
Effect, each Company Employee Plan maintained outside the United States is in
compliance, and the books and records thereof are maintained in compliance,
with all applicable laws, rules and regulations of the jurisdiction in which
such Company Employee Plan is maintained.   (l) Section 3.13(l) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule lists each country in which the Company or any of
its Affiliates has operations and the approximate number of employees in each
such country.   (m) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has made
any payments, is obligated to make any payments, or is a party to any
agreement that could obligate it to make any payments that may be treated as
an "excess parachute payment" as defined in Section 280G of the Code
determined without regard to Section 280G(b)(4) of the Code. The Company has
provided to the Buyer such accurate information as shall be necessary to
enable the Buyer to calculate any excise tax due under Section 4999 of the
Code as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement for which
the Company or the Buyer may directly or indirectly become liable, and the
amount of deductions that may be disallowed under Section 280G of the Code as
a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   3.14
Compliance With Laws. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries have complied
with, are not in violation of, and have not received any notice alleging any
violation with respect to, any applicable provisions of any foreign, federal,
state or local statute, law or regulation applicable to the conduct of its
business, or the ownership or operation of its properties or assets, except
for such failures to comply, violations and notices as would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a
Company Material Adverse Effect.   -24-  32   3.15 Permits. The Company
and each of its Subsidiaries have all permits, licenses and franchises from
Governmental Entities necessary for the conduct of their businesses (the
"Company Permits"), except for such permits, licenses and franchises the
failure to have which would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
be expected to result in a Company Material Adverse Effect. Except as would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a
Company Material Adverse Effect, (i) the Company and each of its Subsidiaries
are in compliance with the terms of the Company Permits, and (ii) no Company
Permit shall cease to be effective as a result of the consummation of
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   3.16 Labor Matters. Neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or otherwise bound by
any collective bargaining agreement, contract or other agreement or
understanding with a labor union or labor organization. To the Company\'s
knowledge, there is no material pending or threatened (i) labor strike, or
(ii) dispute, walkout, work stoppage, slow-down, lockout or organizational
effort involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.   3.17 Insurance.
To the Company\'s knowledge, each of the Company and its Subsidiaries
maintains insurance policies (the "Insurance Policies") with reputable
insurance carriers against all risks of a character and in such amounts as
are usually insured against by similarly situated companies in the same or
similar businesses. Section 3.17 of the Company Disclosure Schedule
sets forth the insurance coverages maintained by the Company and its
Subsidiaries and a history of any claims made and claims paid since January
1, 1998. Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to result in a Company Material Adverse Effect, (i) each Insurance
Policy is in full force and effect and is valid, outstanding and enforceable,
and all premiums due thereon have been paid in full, (ii) none of the
Insurance Policies shall terminate or lapse (or be affected in any other
adverse manner) by reason of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
(iii) the Company and each of its Subsidiaries have complied with the
provisions of each Insurance Policy under which it is the insured party, (iv)
no insurer under any Insurance Policy has canceled or generally disclaimed
liability under any such policy or indicated any intent to do so or not to
renew any such policy and (v) all claims under the Insurance Policies have
been filed in a timely fashion.   3.18 Warranty. The Company has no reason
to believe that the warranty costs of it and its Subsidiaries will materially
increase as a percentage of their consolidated revenues in the future
(assuming that management of the Company and its Subsidiaries following the
Closing will be undertaken in a manner consistent with past practice). To the
Company\'s knowledge, since January 1, 1998, the Company and its Subsidiaries
have not performed warranty service with respect to any particular product or
product line materially in excess of the warranty service typically required
to be performed with respect to the products and product lines of the Company
and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole (the Buyer acknowledging that the
Company and its Subsidiaries do not track or record warranty service on a
product or product line basis).   3.19 Customers and Suppliers. No customer
(including any Affiliate thereof) of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
represented 5% or more of the Company\'s consolidated revenues in the fiscal
year ended December 31, 2000 or in the three-month period ended   -25- 
33 March 31, 2001. No supplier of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
whose failure to continue to be a supplier of the Company or its Subsidiaries
would reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to result in
a Company Material Adverse Effect has indicated to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries that it will stop, or materially decrease the rate of, supplying
materials, products or services to them.   3.20 No Existing Discussions. As
of the date of this Agreement, neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries is engaged, directly or indirectly, in any discussions or
negotiations with any other party with respect to an Acquisition
Proposal.   3.21 Opinion of Financial Advisor. The financial advisor of
the Company, JP Morgan Chase and Co., has delivered to the Company an opinion
dated the date of this Agreement to the effect, as of such date, that the
Merger Consideration is fair to the holders of the Company Common Stock from
a financial point of view, a signed copy of which opinion has been delivered
to the Buyer.   3.22 Section 203 of the DGCL Not Applicable. The Company
Board has taken all actions necessary so that the restrictions contained in
Section 203 of the DGCL applicable to a "business combination" (as defined in
Section 203) shall not apply to the execution, delivery or performance of

consummation of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, the Stockholder\'s Agreement or the Voting Agreements.   3.23
Brokers. No agent, broker, investment banker, financial advisor or other
firm, or person is or shall be entitled, as a result of any action, agreement
or commitment of the Company or any of its Affiliates, to any broker\'s,
finder\'s, financial advisor\'s or other similar fee or commission
in connection with any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
except JP Morgan Chase and Co., whose fees and expense shall be paid by the
Company.   ARTICLE IV   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE BUYER AND

corporation in each jurisdiction where the character of its properties owned,
operated or leased or the nature of its activities makes such qualification
necessary, except for such failures to be so organized, qualified or in good

conditions, events or circumstances generally adversely affecting the
economies of the countries where the Buyer and its Subsidiaries operate, the
United States securities markets or the industries in which the Buyer
operates, so long as such conditions, events or circumstances do not
materially disproportionately affect the Buyer and its Subsidiaries, taken as
a whole, (III) conditions, events or circumstances directly arising out of or
directly attributable to (x) a material breach of this Agreement by the
Company or (y) the Merger or any other transaction involving the parties
hereto contemplated by this Agreement, or (IV) conditions, events or

announcement of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, shall
not be taken into account in determining whether there has been or would be a
"Buyer Material Adverse Effect".   4.2 Capitalization.   (a) The

Common Stock and 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $1.00 par value per

outstanding and no shares of Buyer Preferred Stock were issued
and outstanding. Other than pursuant to the exercise of options under the
Buyer\'s stock option plans, the Buyer has not, since July 10, 2001 through
the date of this Agreement, issued any shares of Buyer Common Stock or Buyer
Preferred Stock. All shares of Buyer Common Stock issuable pursuant to
Section 2.1(c) in connection with the Merger, when issued on the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, will be duly authorized, validly issued, fully
paid and nonassessable and not subject to or issued in violation of any
purchase option, call option, right of first refusal, preemptive right,

Massachusetts Business Corporation Law, the Buyer\'s Articles of Organization
or By-laws or any agreement to which the Buyer is a party or is otherwise
bound.   -27-  35    (b) As of the date of this Agreement, except (x) as

equity securities, issued, reserved for issuance or outstanding and (ii)
there are no options, warrants, equity securities, calls, rights, commitments
or agreements of any character to which the Buyer is a party or by which the
Buyer is bound obligating the Buyer to issue, exchange, transfer, deliver or
sell, or cause to be issued, exchanged, transferred, delivered or sold,
additional shares of capital stock or other equity interests of the Buyer or
any security or rights convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for
any such shares or other equity interests. As of the date of this Agreement,
the Buyer has no (A) stock appreciation rights or phantom stock or (B)
performance based rights or similar rights or obligations outstanding.  
(c) As of the date of this Agreement, there are no obligations, contingent or
otherwise, of the Buyer to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any shares
of Buyer Common Stock or other capital stock of the Buyer.   4.3 Authority;

held, by the unanimous vote of all directors (i) determined that the Merger
is fair and in the best interests of the Buyer and its stockholders and (ii)

approval of the Merger by the Buyer in its capacity as the sole stockholder
of the Transitory Subsidiary), subject only to the approval of the Buyer

Buyer. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by each of the
Buyer and the Transitory Subsidiary and constitutes the valid and binding
obligation of each of the Buyer and the Transitory Subsidiary, enforceable in
accordance with its terms.   (b) The execution and delivery of this
Agreement by each of the Buyer and the Transitory Subsidiary does not, and
the consummation by the Buyer and the Transitory Subsidiary of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not, (i) conflict with, or
result in any violation or breach of, any provision of the Articles of
Organization or By-laws of the Buyer or the Certificate of Incorporation or
By-laws of the Transitory Subsidiary, (ii) conflict with, or result in any
violation or breach of, or constitute (with or without notice or lapse of
time, or both) a default (or give rise to a right of termination,
cancellation or acceleration of any obligation or loss of any material
benefit) under, require a consent or waiver under, constitute a change in
control under, require the payment of a penalty under or result in
the imposition of any    -28-  36 Lien on the Buyer\'s or the Transitory

note, bond, mortgage, indenture, lease, license, contract or other agreement,
instrument or obligation to which the Buyer or the Transitory Subsidiary is a
party or by which any of them or any of their properties or assets may be
bound, or (iii) subject to compliance with the requirements specified in
Section 4.3(c), conflict with or violate any permit, concession, franchise,
license, judgment, injunction, order, decree, statute, law, ordinance, rule
or regulation applicable to the Buyer or the Transitory Subsidiary or any of
its or their properties or assets, except in the case of clauses (ii) and
(iii) of this Section 4.3(b) for any such conflicts, violations, breaches,

Material Adverse Effect.   (c) No consent, approval, license, permit, order
or authorization of, or registration, declaration, notice or filing with, any
Governmental Entity is required by or with respect to the Buyer or the
Transitory Subsidiary in connection with the execution and delivery of this

of the Buyer SEC Reports for purposes of this Agreement) shall not at
the time the Registration Statement is declared effective by the SEC contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated in the Registration Statement or necessary in order to
make the statements in the Registration Statement not misleading. The
information related to the Buyer to be supplied by or on behalf of the Buyer

Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus not false or misleading; or omit to state
any material fact necessary to correct any statement in any earlier
communication with respect to the solicitation of proxies for the Buyer

have any liabilities, either accrued, contingent or otherwise (whether or not
required to be reflected in financial statements in accordance with GAAP),
and whether due or to become due, except for any liabilities which would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Buyer

possess legally enforceable rights to use all Intellectual Property used in
or necessary to the conduct of the business of the Buyer and its Subsidiaries
(the "Buyer Intellectual Property"), except where the failure to own, license
or have rights to use such Buyer Intellectual Property would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Buyer
Material Adverse Effect. None of the (i) products sold by the Buyer or any of
its Subsidiaries or (ii) business or activities conducted by the Buyer or any
of its Subsidiaries infringes, violates or constitutes a misappropriation of,
or infringed, violated or constituted a misappropriation of, any Intellectual
Property of any third party (including any software programs and applications
that are commercially available), except for infringements, violations or

applicable to the conduct of its business, or the ownership or operation of
its properties or assets, except for such failures to comply, violations and
notices as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to result in a Buyer Material Adverse Effect.   4.13 Permits. The
Buyer and each of its Subsidiaries have all permits, licenses and franchises
from Governmental Entities necessary for the conduct of their businesses (the
"Buyer Permits"), except for such permits, licenses and franchises the

counsel and its financial advisors) is reasonably likely to result in a
Superior Proposal, pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement not
materially less restrictive of the other party than the Confidentiality
Agreement (which need not have standstill provisions) and (y) engage in
discussions or negotiations with such person and its
Representatives regarding any such Acquisition Proposal. Without limiting the
foregoing, it is agreed that any violation of the restrictions set forth in
this Section 6.1(a) by any Affiliate or Representative of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, whether or not such person is purporting to act on
behalf of the Company or otherwise, shall be deemed to be a breach of this
Section 6.1(a) by the Company.   (b) No Change in Recommendation or
Alternative Acquisition Agreement. Neither the Company Board nor any
committee thereof shall, prior to the Specified Time:   (i) except as set
forth in this Section 6.1(b), withdraw or propose to withdraw or knowingly
modify in any material adverse manner or propose to knowingly modify in any
material adverse manner, the approval or recommendation by the Company Board
or any such committee of this Agreement or the Merger;    -37-  45  (ii)
cause or permit the Company to enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger
agreement or similar agreement (an "Alternative Acquisition Agreement")
constituting or relating to any Acquisition Proposal other than
a confidentiality agreement referred to in Section 6.1(a) entered into in
the circumstances referred to in such Section 6.1(a); or   (iii) adopt,
approve or recommend, or propose to adopt, approve or recommend, any
Acquisition Proposal.   Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company Board may
(x) withdraw or knowingly modify in any material adverse manner the approval
or recommendation by the Company Board or any committee thereof of this
Agreement and the Merger, if the Company Board determines in good faith
(after consultation with outside counsel and its financial advisors) that an
Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal as to which it intends
to enter into a binding written agreement as provided in Section 8.1(i) and
(y) adopt, approve or recommend, or propose to adopt, approve or recommend,
any Superior Proposal subject to compliance with Section 8.1(i) hereof.  
(c) Notices to the Buyer; Additional Negotiations. The Company shall promptly
advise the Buyer orally, with written confirmation to follow within 24 hours
of the occurrence, of any Acquisition Proposal or any request for nonpublic
information in connection with any Acquisition Proposal, by any person that
the Company has knowledge may be considering making, or has made,
an Acquisition Proposal, the material terms and conditions of any such
Acquisition Proposal or request and the identity of the person making any
such Acquisition Proposal or request. The Company shall keep the Buyer
informed, on a prompt basis, of the status and material terms (including all
changes to the status and material terms) of any such Acquisition Proposal or
request.   (d) Certain Permitted Disclosure. Nothing contained in this
Section 6.1 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall be deemed to prohibit the
Company from taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position with
respect to a tender offer contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the
Exchange Act or from making any other disclosure to its stockholders if, in
the good faith judgment of the Company Board, based on the advice of outside
counsel, failure to so disclose would be inconsistent with its obligations
under applicable law.   (e) Cessation of Ongoing Discussions. The Company
shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their Representatives to,
cease immediately all discussions and negotiations commenced on or prior to
the date of this Agreement regarding any proposal that constitutes, or could
reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to have all copies of all nonpublic
information it or its Subsidiaries and its and their Representatives have
distributed since January 1, 2001, to persons who have executed a
confidentiality agreement in connection with such person\'s consideration of
an Acquisition Proposal, destroyed or returned to the Company as soon as
possible.    -38-  46  (f) Definitions. For purposes of this
Agreement:   "Acquisition Proposal" means (i) any proposal or offer for
a merger, consolidation, dissolution, sale of substantial assets, tender
offer, recapitalization, share exchange or other business combination
involving the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (ii) any
proposal for the issuance by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of over
20% of its equity securities or (iii) any proposal or offer to acquire in any
manner, directly or indirectly, over 20% of the equity securities or
consolidated total assets of the Company, in each case other than the Merger
contemplated by this Agreement.   "Superior Proposal" means any unsolicited,
bona fide written proposal made by a third party to acquire substantially all
the equity securities or assets of the Company pursuant to a tender or
exchange offer, a merger, a consolidation or a sale of its assets, (i) on
terms which the Company Board determines in its good faith judgment to be
more favorable from a financial point of view to the holders of Company
Common Stock than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (based on
the advice of a nationally recognized independent financial advisor), taking
into account all the terms and conditions of such proposal and this Agreement
(including any proposal by the Buyer to amend the terms of this Agreement)
and (ii) that is reasonably capable of being completed on the terms proposed,
taking into account all financial, regulatory, legal and other aspects of
such proposal; provided, however, that no Acquisition Proposal shall be
deemed to be a Superior Proposal if any financing required to consummate the
Acquisition Proposal is not committed; provided, further, however, that a
proposal to acquire less than substantially all of the equity securities of
the Company may constitute a Superior Proposal if it satisfies the other
provisions of this definition and provides for the acquisition of at least a
majority of the Company\'s equity securities so long as in the evaluation of
the proposal the Company Board determines in its good faith judgment (X) that
the value of the proposal of the third party, together with the fair market
value of the equity securities to be retained by the holders of the Company
Common Stock is more favorable from a financial point of view to the holders
of the Company Common Stock than the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (based on the advice of a nationally recognized independent
financial advisor) taking into account all the terms and conditions of such
proposal and this Agreement and (Y) that the proposal is reasonably capable
of being completed on the terms proposed, taking into account all financial,
regulatory, legal and other aspects of such proposal.   6.2 Joint Proxy

practicable after the execution of this Agreement, the Buyer and the Company
shall prepare and the Company shall file with the SEC the Joint Proxy

prepare and file with the SEC the Registration Statement, in which the Joint
Proxy Statement/Prospectus shall be included as a prospectus. Each of the
Buyer and the Company shall respond to any comments of the SEC and shall use
its respective reasonable best efforts to have the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus cleared by the SEC and the Registration
Statement declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as
practicable after such filings, and the Company shall cause the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus to be mailed to its stockholders at the earliest   
-39-  47 practicable time after both the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus is
cleared by the SEC and the Registration Statement is declared effective under
the Securities Act. Each of the Buyer and the Company shall notify the
other promptly upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC or its staff or
any other government officials and of any request by the SEC or its staff or
any other government officials for amendments or supplements to the
Registration Statement, the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or any filing
pursuant to Section 6.2(b) or for additional information and shall supply the
other with copies of all correspondence between such party or any of its
representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, or its staff or any other
government officials, on the other hand, with respect to the Registration

pursuant to Section 6.2(b). Each of the Buyer and the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause all documents that it is responsible for
filing with the SEC or other regulatory authorities under this Section 6.2 to
comply in all material respects with all applicable requirements of law and
the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. Whenever any event occurs
which is required to be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Joint
Proxy Statement/Prospectus, the Registration Statement or any filing pursuant
to Section 6.2(b), the Buyer or the Company, as the case may be, shall
promptly inform the other of such occurrence and cooperate in filing with the
SEC or its staff or any other government officials, and/or mailing to
stockholders of the Company, of such amendment or supplement.   (b) The
Buyer and the Company shall promptly make all necessary filings with respect
to the Merger under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, applicable state

Company shall (and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to) afford to the
Buyer\'s officers, employees, accountants, counsel and other representatives,
reasonable access, upon reasonable advance notice, during normal business
hours during the period prior to the Effective Time, to all its properties,
books, contracts, commitments, personnel and records and, during such period,
the Company shall (and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to) furnish
promptly to the Buyer (a) a copy of each report, schedule,
registration statement and other document filed or received by it during such
period pursuant to the requirements of federal or state securities laws and
(b) all other information concerning its business, properties, assets and
personnel as the Buyer may reasonably request. The Buyer will hold any such
information which is nonpublic in confidence in accordance with the
Confidentiality Agreement. No information or knowledge obtained in any
investigation pursuant to this Section or otherwise shall affect or be deemed
to modify any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement or the
conditions to the obligations of the parties to consummate the Merger.  
(b) In the event that the Company reasonably believes that the Buyer or the
Transitory Subsidiary has materially breached one or more of their respective
representations or    -40-  48 warranties under this Agreement, the Buyer
shall (and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to) afford the Company\'s
officers, employees, accountants, counsel and other representatives
reasonable access, upon reasonable advance notice, during normal business
hours during the period prior to the Effective Time, to all its properties,
books, contracts, commitments, personnel and records; provided that such
access shall be afforded solely to the extent that such access is necessary
to determine the existence of such a breach of one or more representations or
warranties of the Buyer or the Transitory Subsidiary under this Agreement.
The Company will hold any such information which is nonpublic in confidence
in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement. No information or knowledge
obtained in any investigation pursuant to this Section or otherwise shall
affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty contained
in this Agreement or the conditions to the obligations of the parties to
consummate the Merger.   (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Section 6.4(c), neither party hereto nor any of their Subsidiaries shall
be required to provide access to or to disclose information where such access
or disclosure would contravene any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment or
decree, or, in the event of any litigation or threatened litigation between
the parties over the terms of this Agreement, where such access to
information may be adverse to the interests of such party.   6.5
Stockholders Meetings.   (a) The Company, acting through the Company Board,
shall take all actions in accordance with applicable law (including all
applicable requirements of the Code and ERISA with respect to the shares of
Company Common Stock held by any Company Employee Plan) and its Certificate
of Incorporation and By-laws to promptly and duly call, give notice of,
convene and hold as promptly as practicable, and in any event within 45 days
after the declaration of effectiveness of the Registration Statement, the
Company Stockholders Meeting for the purpose of considering and voting upon
the Company Voting Proposal. Subject to Section 6.1(b), to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law, (i) the Company Board shall recommend approval
and adoption of the Company Voting Proposal by the stockholders of the
Company and include in the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus such
recommendation, and (ii) neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof
shall withdraw or modify, or propose or resolve to withdraw or modify in a
manner adverse to the Buyer, the recommendation of the Company Board that the
Company\'s stockholders vote in favor of the Company Voting Proposal. The
Company shall take all action that is both reasonable and lawful to solicit
from its stockholders proxies in favor of the Company Voting Proposal and
shall take all other action necessary or advisable to secure the vote or
consent of the Company Stockholders required by the rules of the Nasdaq Stock
Market or the DGCL to obtain such approvals. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, after consultation with the Buyer,
the Company may adjourn or postpone the Company Stockholders Meeting to the
extent necessary to ensure that any required supplement or amendment to the
Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus is provided to the Company\'s stockholders
or, if as of the time for which the Company Stockholders Meeting is
originally scheduled (as set forth in the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus)
there are insufficient shares of Company Common Stock represented   
-41-  49 (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to
conduct the business of the Company Stockholders Meeting.   (b) The Buyer,
acting through the Buyer Board, shall take all actions in accordance with
applicable law (including all applicable requirements of the Code and ERISA)
and its Articles of Organization and By-laws to promptly and duly call, give
notice of, convene and hold as promptly as practicable, and in any event
within 45 days after the declaration of effectiveness of the Registration
Statement, the Buyer Stockholders Meeting for the purpose of voting to
approve the issuance of the shares of Buyer Common Stock to be issued in
the Merger (the "Buyer Voting Proposal"). The Buyer Board shall (i)
recommend approval of the Buyer Voting Proposal and include in the Joint
Proxy Statement/Prospectus such recommendation and (ii) take all reasonable
and lawful action to solicit and obtain such approval, provided that the
Buyer may withdraw such recommendation if the Buyer Board in good faith
(after consultation with outside counsel) determines that it is required to
do so to comply with its fiduciary duties. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, after consultation with the Company,
the Buyer may adjourn or postpone the Buyer Stockholders Meeting to the
extent necessary to ensure that any required supplement or amendment to the
Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus is provided to the Buyer\'s stockholders or,
if as of the time for which the Buyer Stockholders Meeting is originally
scheduled (as set forth in the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus) there are
insufficient shares of Buyer Common Stock represented (either in person or by
proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the Buyer
Stockholders Meeting. The Buyer, as the sole stockholder of the Transitory
Subsidiary, shall approve this Agreement.   6.6 [Intentionally Omitted]  
6.7 Legal Conditions to the Merger.   (a) Subject to the terms hereof,
including Section 6.7(b) and Section 6.7(c), the Company and the Buyer shall
each use its commercially reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions, and do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate
with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate and make effective the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable, but in any event before the
Outside Date, including to: (i) obtain from any Governmental Entity or any
other third party any consents, licenses, permits, waivers, approvals,
authorizations, or orders required to be obtained or made by the Company or
the Buyer or any of their Subsidiaries in connection with the authorization,
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) make all necessary filings, and
thereafter make any other required submissions, with respect to this
Agreement and the Merger required under (A) the Securities Act and
the Exchange Act, and any other applicable federal or state securities laws,
(B) the HSR Act and any related governmental request thereunder, and (C) any
other applicable law (domestic or foreign), (iii) use commercially reasonable
best efforts in the defense of any lawsuits or other legal proceedings,
whether judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or the
consummation of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including seeking to have any stay or temporary restraining   
-42-  50 order entered by any court or other Governmental Entity vacated or
reversed, and (iv) execute or deliver any additional instruments necessary to
consummate the transactions contemplated by, and to fully carry out the
purposes of, this Agreement. The Company and the Buyer shall cooperate with
each other in connection with the making of all such filings, including
providing copies of all such documents to the non-filing party and its
advisors prior to filing and, if requested, to accept all reasonable
additions, deletions or changes suggested in connection therewith. The
Company and the Buyer shall use their respective commercially reasonable best
efforts to furnish to each other all information required for any application
or other filing to be made pursuant to the rules and regulations of any
applicable law (including all information required to be included in the
Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus and the Registration Statement) in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. For
the avoidance of doubt, the Buyer and the Company agree that nothing
contained in this Section 6.7(a) shall modify or affect their respective
rights and responsibilities under Section 6.7(b) or Section 6.7(c).   (b)
Subject to the terms hereof, the Buyer and the Company agree, and shall cause
each of their respective Subsidiaries, to cooperate and to use their
respective commercially reasonable best efforts to obtain any
government clearances or approvals required for Closing under the HSR Act,
the Sherman Act, as amended, the Clayton Act, as amended, the Federal Trade
Commission Act, as amended, and any other federal, state or foreign law or,
regulation or decree designed to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions for
the purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint of trade (collectively
"Antitrust Laws"), to respond to any government requests for information
under any Antitrust Law, and to contest and resist any action, including any
legislative, administrative or judicial action, and to have vacated, lifted,
reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order
(whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) (an "Antitrust Order") that
restricts, prevents or prohibits the consummation of the Merger or any other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement under any Antitrust Law. The
parties hereto will consult and cooperate with one another, and consider in
good faith the views of one another, in connection with any analyses,
appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and
proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any party hereto in connection
with proceedings under or relating to any Antitrust Law. The Buyer shall be
entitled to direct any proceedings or negotiations with any Governmental
Entity relating to any of the foregoing, provided that it shall afford the
Company an opportunity to fully participate therein as contemplated by this
Section 6.7. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, except as expressly provided in Section 6.7(c), neither the Buyer
nor any of its Affiliates shall be under any obligation to make proposals,
execute or carry out agreements or submit to orders providing for the sale or
other disposition or holding separate (through the establishment of a trust
or otherwise) of any assets or categories of assets of the Buyer, any of its
Affiliates or the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the holding separate
of the shares of Company Common Stock (or shares of stock of the Surviving
Corporation) or imposing or seeking to impose any material limitation on the
ability of the Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates to conduct
their business or own such assets or to acquire, hold or exercise full rights
of ownership of the shares of Company Common Stock (or shares of stock of the
Surviving Corporation). In furtherance and not in limitation of the
foregoing, each of the Buyer and the Company agrees to make an appropriate
filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act (and to make
such other filings as are required under the Antitrust    -43-  51 Laws)
with respect to the Merger as promptly as reasonably practicable (but
not later than 15 business days) after the date hereof and to supply as
promptly as reasonably practicable any additional information and documentary
material that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act (or pursuant to other
Antitrust Laws). Each party will consult with counsel for the other party as
to, and will permit such counsel to participate fully in, any litigation
referred to in this Section 6.7(b) and in Section 6.7(a)(iii) above. Each
party will (x) promptly notify the other party of any written communication
to that party from any Governmental Entity located in the U.S. and, to the
extent practicable, outside of the U.S. and, subject to applicable law, if
practicable, permit the other party to review in advance any proposed written
communication to any such Governmental Entity and incorporate the other
party\'s reasonable comments, (y) not agree to participate in any substantive
meeting or discussion with any such Governmental Entity in respect of any
filing, investigation or inquiry concerning this Agreement or the Merger
unless, to the extent reasonably practicable, it consults with the other
party in advance and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity,
gives the other party the opportunity to attend and (z) furnish the other
party with copies of all correspondence, filings and written communications
between them and their Affiliates and their respective Representatives on one
hand, and any such Governmental Entity or its respective staff on the other
hand, with respect to this Agreement and the Merger, except that any
materials concerning the Buyer\'s valuation of the Company or the Company\'s
valuation of the transaction may be redacted and internal
financial information of the Buyer may be provided to the Company\'s counsel
on an outside counsel basis only.   (c) If required to obtain clearances or
approvals of the Merger under Antitrust Laws, the Buyer and its Subsidiaries
shall agree to: (i) a sale, transfer, license, separate holding, divestiture
or other disposition of or (ii) a prohibition of, or a limitation on, the
acquisition, ownership, operation, effective control or exercise of full
rights of ownership of (the matters specified in clauses (i) and (ii) a
"Divestiture"), any asset or assets of the Buyer, the Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries that individually or in the aggregate would not be
material in relation to the continuing operations of the combined U.S.
businesses of the Company and the Buyer and their consolidated Subsidiaries,
but shall not be required to agree to any Divestiture that is so material.
Solely for purposes of this Section 6.7(c), a Divestiture will be deemed
material in relation to the continuing operations of the combined U.S.
businesses of the Company and the Buyer and their consolidated
Subsidiaries if the Divestiture relates to assets that generated in excess of
$30 million of the total consolidated sales of the Buyer and the Company in
fiscal year 2000, but will be deemed not to be material if the Divestiture
relates to assets that generated $30 million or less of the total
consolidated sales of the Buyer and the Company in fiscal year 2000.   (d)
Each of the Company and the Buyer shall give (or shall cause their respective
Subsidiaries to give) any notices to third parties, and use, and cause their
respective Subsidiaries to use, their commercially reasonable best efforts to
obtain any third party consents related to or required in connection with the
Merger that are (A) necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby, (B) disclosed or required to be disclosed in the Company Disclosure
Schedule or the Buyer Disclosure Schedule, as the case may be, or
(C) required to prevent a Company Material Adverse Effect or a Buyer
Material Adverse Effect from occurring prior to or after the Effective Time,
it being understood that neither the Company nor the Buyer (or any of   
-44-  52 their respective Subsidiaries) shall be required to make any cash
payments or grant any concessions to third parties in connection with the
fulfillment of its obligations under this Section 6.7 (except as otherwise
expressly set forth in this Section 6.7). The actions of each of the Buyer
and the Company with respect to the foregoing shall be reasonably calculated
to facilitate consummation of the Merger by the Outside Date.   6.8 Public
Disclosure. Except as may be required by law or stock market regulations, (i)
the press release announcing the execution of this Agreement shall be issued
only in such form as shall be mutually agreed upon by the Company and the
Buyer and (ii) the Buyer and the Company shall each use its commercially
reasonable efforts to consult with the other party before issuing any other
press release or otherwise making any public statement with respect to the
Merger or this Agreement and shall not issue any such press release or
make any such public statement prior to using such efforts.   6.9
Reorganization. The Buyer and the Company shall each use its commercially
reasonable best efforts to cause the Merger to be treated as a reorganization
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. The parties hereto hereby
adopt this Agreement as a plan of reorganization.   6.10 Affiliate
Agreements. Schedule 6.10 of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a
list of those persons who are, in the Company\'s reasonable judgment, Rule
145 Affiliates of the Company. The Company shall notify the Buyer in writing
regarding any change in the identity of its Rule 145 Affiliates prior to the
Closing Date. The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
deliver or cause to be delivered to the Buyer as soon as practicable
after the date of this Agreement (and in any case prior to the mailing of the
Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus Company Stockholder Meeting) from each of
its Rule 145 Affiliates, an executed Affiliate Agreement, in substantially
the form appended hereto as Exhibit D (the "Affiliate Agreement"). The Buyer
shall be entitled to place appropriate legends on the certificates evidencing
any shares of Buyer Common Stock to be received by Rule 145 Affiliates of the
Company pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and, subject to the terms of
the Stockholder\'s Agreement, to issue appropriate stop transfer instructions
to the transfer agent for the Buyer Common Stock (provided that such legends
or stop transfer instructions shall be removed, one year after the Effective
Time, upon the request of any holder of shares of Buyer Common Stock issued
in the Merger that is not then a Rule 145 Affiliate of the Buyer).   6.11
NYSE Listing. The Buyer shall use its commercially reasonable best efforts to
cause the shares of Buyer Common Stock to be issued in the Merger to be
listed on the NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance, on or prior
to the Closing Date.   6.12 Employee Matters.   (a) At the Effective
Time, each outstanding Company Stock Option under Company Stock Plans (other
than the Company\'s Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "ESPP")), whether
vested or unvested, and the Company Stock Plans (other than the ESPP),
insofar as they relate to outstanding Company Stock Options, shall be assumed
by the Buyer and shall be    -45-  53 deemed to constitute an option to
acquire, on the same terms and conditions as were applicable under the
Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, such number of
shares of Buyer Common Stock as is determined by multiplying the number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Exchange Ratio and rounded up
to the nearest whole number, at a price per share and rounded down to the
nearest whole cent equal to (y) the exercise price per share of
Company Common Stock at which such Company Stock Option was exercisable
immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by (z) the Exchange
Ratio.   (b) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, the Buyer
shall deliver to the participants in the Company Stock Plans (other than the
ESPP) appropriate notice setting forth such participants\' rights pursuant
thereto. All grants made pursuant to the Company Stock Plans (other than the
ESPP) shall continue in effect on the same terms and conditions (subject to
the adjustments required by this Section 6.12 after giving effect to the
Merger).   (c) The Buyer shall take all corporate action necessary to
reserve for issuance a sufficient number of shares of Buyer Common Stock for
delivery upon exercise of the Company Stock Plans (other than the ESPP)
assumed in accordance with this Section. As soon as practicable after the
Effective Time, the Buyer shall file a registration statement on Form S-8 (or
any successor form) or another appropriate form with respect to the shares of
Buyer Common Stock subject to such options and shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration
statement or registration statements (and maintain the current status of the
prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) for so long as such options
remain outstanding.   (d) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall honor all Company Employee Plans (other than the ESPP) in
accordance with their terms as in effect on the date of this Agreement,
subject to any amendment or termination thereof that may be permitted by such
terms. The Surviving Corporation shall provide, or shall cause to be
provided, to persons who are, immediately before the Effective Time,
employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries (the "Company Employees") (i)
in the case of Company Employees employed in the United States, compensation
and employee benefits that are, in the aggregate, not materially less
favorable than those provided by the Buyer to its similarly situated
employees and (ii) in the case of the Company Employees employed outside the
United States, compensation and any employee benefits that are, in the
aggregate, not materially less favorable than, at the option of the Buyer,
either (A) those provided by the Buyer to its similarly situated employees or
(B) those provided by the Company to such non-U.S. Company Employees
immediately prior to the Effective Time. The foregoing shall not be construed
to prevent (X) the termination of employment of any Company Employee at any
time after the Effective Time, (Y) the amendment or termination of
any Company Employee Plan at any time after the Effective Time or (Z) during
the period beginning immediately after the Effective Time and ending on
December 31, 2001, the provision of benefits, other than 401(k) benefits,
under Company Employee Plans as in existence immediately before the Effective
Time.    -46-  54  (e) For all purposes under the employee benefit plans
of the Buyer and its Affiliates providing benefits to any Company Employees
after the Effective Time (the "New Plans"), each Company Employee shall be
credited with his or her years of service with the Company and its Affiliates
before the Effective Time for purposes of participation, vesting and benefit
levels where length of services is relevant to benefit levels, but not for
benefit accrual under any defined benefit plan or any accrual that would
result in any duplication of benefits, to the same extent as such Company
Employee was entitled, before the Effective Time, to credit for such service
under any similar Company Employee Plans, except to the extent such credit
would result in a duplication of benefits. In addition, and without limiting
the generality of the foregoing: (i) each Company Employee shall be
immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all
New Plans (other than the Buyer\'s 401(k) plan) to the extent coverage under
such New Plan replaces coverage under a comparable Company Employee Plan in
which such Company Employee participated immediately before the Effective
Time (such plans, collectively, the "Old Plans"); and (ii) for purposes of
each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision
benefits to any Company Employee, the Buyer shall cause all pre-existing
condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be
waived for such employee and his or her covered dependents, and the Buyer
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause any eligible expenses
incurred by such employee and his or her covered dependents during the
portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the date such employee\'s
participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into account
under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance
and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such employee and his or
her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had
been paid in accordance with such New Plan. Company Employees who are
participants in the Company\'s 401(k) Plan immediately prior to the earlier
of (i) the termination of such Plan pursuant to Section 6.18 hereof or (ii)
the Closing, shall be eligible to participate in Buyer\'s 401(k) Plan as soon
as reasonably feasible after the Closing. Notwithstanding the
preceding sentence, such participation shall occur no later than 10 days
after the Closing, provided that the Company has given the Buyer such access
to the appropriate Company Employees as is reasonably needed substantially to

any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a
waiver of such rights.   ARTICLE IX   MISCELLANEOUS   9.1 Nonsurvival of
Representations and Warranties. The respective representations and warranties
of the Company, the Buyer and the Transitory Subsidiary contained in this
Agreement or in any instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall

parties hereto, whether to be performed before or after the consummation of
the Merger.   9.2 Notices. All notices, requests, claims and demands and

(212) 403-2000  Any party to this Agreement may give any notice or other
communication hereunder using any other means (including personal delivery,
messenger service, telecopy or ordinary mail), but no such notice or other
communication shall be deemed to have been duly given unless and until it
actually is received by the party for whom it is intended. Any party to this
Agreement may change the address to which notices and other communications
hereunder are to be delivered by giving the other parties to this Agreement
notice in the manner herein set forth.   9.3 Entire Agreement. This
Agreement (including the Schedules and Exhibits hereto and the documents and
instruments referred to herein that are to be delivered at the Closing)
constitutes the entire agreement among the parties hereto and supersedes any
prior understandings, agreements or representations by or among the parties
hereto, or any of them, written or oral, with respect to the subject matter
hereof; provided that the Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in effect in
accordance with its terms.   9.4 No Third Party Beneficiaries. Except as
provided in Section 6.12(f) and Section 6.15(c), this Agreement is not
intended, and shall not be deemed, to confer any rights or remedies upon any
person other than the parties hereto and their respective successors and
permitted assigns, to create any agreement of employment with any person or
to otherwise create any third-party beneficiary hereto.   9.5 Assignment.
Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations under
this Agreement may be assigned or delegated, in whole or in part, by
operation of law or otherwise by any of the parties hereto without the prior
written consent of the other parties, and any such assignment without
such prior written consent shall be null and void, except that the    - 59
-  67  Buyer may substitute any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary
of the Buyer for the Transitory Subsidiary without consent of the Company,
provided that the Buyer and/or the Transitory Subsidiary, as the case may be,
shall remain liable for all of its obligations under this Agreement; and
provided further that such substitution does not prevent or impede the Merger
from qualifying as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of
the Code. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding
upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties hereto and
their respective successors and permitted assigns.   9.6 Severability. Any
term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid or unenforceable in any
situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect the validity or enforceability
of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or the validity or
enforceability of the offending term or provision in any other situation or
in any other jurisdiction. If the final judgment of a court of competent
jurisdiction declares that any term or provision hereof is invalid
or unenforceable, the parties hereto agree that the court making such
determination shall have the power to limit the term or provision, to delete
specific words or phrases, or to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or
provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that
comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable
term or provision, and this Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified. In
the event such court does not exercise the power granted to it in the prior
sentence, the parties hereto agree to replace such invalid or unenforceable
term or provision with a valid and enforceable term or provision that shall
achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of
such invalid or unenforceable term.   9.7 Counterparts and Signature. This
Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be
deemed an original but all of which together shall be considered one and the
same agreement and shall become effective when counterparts have been signed
by each of the parties hereto and delivered to the other parties, it being
understood that all parties need not sign the same counterpart. This
Agreement may be executed and delivered by facsimile transmission.   9.8
Interpretation. When reference is made in this Agreement to an Article or a
Section, such reference shall be to an Article or Section of this Agreement,
unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents, table of defined terms and
headings contained in this Agreement are for convenience of reference only
and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of
this Agreement. The language used in this Agreement shall be deemed to be
the language chosen by the parties hereto to express their mutual intent, and
no rule of strict construction shall be applied against any party. Whenever
the context may require, any pronouns used in this Agreement shall include
the corresponding masculine, feminine or neuter forms, and the singular form
of nouns and pronouns shall include the plural, and vice versa. Any reference
to any federal, state, local or foreign statute or law shall be deemed also
to refer to all rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, unless the
context requires otherwise. Whenever the words "include", "includes" or
"including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed
by the words "without limitation". The mere inclusion of an item in the
relevant Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a representation, warranty or
covenant shall not be deemed an admission by a party that such item
represents a material exception or material fact, event or circumstance or
that such item has resulted or would reasonably be expected to result
in    - 60 -  68  a Company Material Adverse Effect or a Buyer Material
Adverse Effect, as the case may be. No summary of this Agreement prepared by
any party shall affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.
Notwithstanding any other provisions in this Agreement to the contrary, it is
the explicit intent of the parties hereto that no party is making any
representations or warranties whatsoever, express or implied, beyond those
expressly given in this Agreement (including the Schedules and Exhibits to
this Agreement and instruments contemplated hereby to be delivered to the
other party), including any implied warranty or representation as to
condition, merchantability or suitability as to any of the parties\'
properties or assets. To the extent that any representation or warranty is
made to the knowledge of the Company (or words of similar import), such
knowledge shall refer to the actual knowledge of the Company\'s employees set
forth on Section 9.8 of the Company Disclosure Schedule. To the extent that
any representation or warranty is made to the knowledge of the Buyer (or
words of similar import), such knowledge shall refer to the actual
knowledge of the Buyer\'s employees set forth on Section 9.8 of the Buyer
Disclosure Schedule.   9.9 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed
by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of
Delaware without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or
rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would
cause the application of laws of any jurisdictions other than those of the
State of Delaware.   9.10 Submission to Jurisdiction. Any suit, action or
proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any matter
arising out of or in connection with, this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be brought exclusively in any federal or state
court located in the State of Delaware, and each of the parties hereby
consents to the jurisdiction of such courts (and of the appropriate appellate
courts therefrom) in any such suit, action or proceeding and irrevocably
waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection that it may now
or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such suit, action or
proceeding in any such court or that any such suit, action or proceeding
brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient form. Process
in any such suit, action or proceeding may be served on any party anywhere in
the world, whether within or without the jurisdiction of any such court.
Without limiting the foregoing, each party agrees that service of process on
such party as provided in Section 9.2 as to giving notice hereunder shall be
deemed effective service of process on such party.   9.11 Remedies. Except
as otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred
upon a party shall be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other
remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such party, and the
exercise by a party of any one remedy shall not preclude the exercise of any
other remedy. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in
the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is
accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction
or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, this being in
addition to any other remedy to which the parties are entitled at law or in
equity.   - 61 -  69   9.12 WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH OF THE BUYER, THE
TRANSITORY SUBSIDIARY AND THE COMPANY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHTS TO
TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON
CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR
THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THE ACTIONS OF THE BUYER, THE
TRANSITORY SUBSIDIARY OR THE COMPANY IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION,
PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT OF THIS AGREEMENT.   IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the
Buyer, the Transitory Subsidiary and the Company have caused this Agreement
to be signed by their respective officers thereunto duly authorized as of the
date first written above.   PERKINELMER, INC.    By: /s/ Gregory L.
