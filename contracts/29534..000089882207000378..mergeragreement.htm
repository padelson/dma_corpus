CONVERSION OF SHARES; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

 

 Section 2.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or the holders of any securities of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub:

 

 (a) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Subject to Section 2.1(b) and 2.1(d), each issued and outstanding share of common stock, par value $0.50, of the Company outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (such shares, collectively, " _Company_ _Common Stock_ ", and each, a " _Share_ ") together with the associated Rights (as defined herein), other than (i) any Shares held by any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, which Shares shall remain outstanding except that the number of such Shares shall be appropriately adjusted in the Merger to maintain relative ownership percentages (the " _Remaining Shares_ ") and (ii) any Cancelled Shares (as defined, and to the extent provided in Section 2.1(b)), shall thereupon be converted automatically into and shall thereafter represent the right to receive $22.00 in cash, without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). All Shares, together with the associated Rights, that have been converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in this Section 2.1 shall be automatically cancelled and shall cease to exist, and the holders of certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented such Shares (and associated Rights) shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares and Rights other than the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 2.2.

 

 (b) _Parent, Merger Sub and Company-Owned Shares_. Each Share that is owned, directly or indirectly, by Parent or Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time, if any, or held by the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time (in each case, other than any such Shares held on behalf of third parties or Shares held in the trust that funds the obligations under the Companys CDP/SERP Plan, as amended and restated effective November 1, 2004 (and as amended through the date hereof) and Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors) (the " _Cancelled Shares_ ") shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange for such cancellation and retirement.

 

    -3- (c) _Conversion of Merger Sub Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.50 per share, of the Surviving Corporation and shall with the Remaining Shares constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation. From and after the Effective Time, all certificates representing the common stock of Merger Sub shall be deemed for all purposes to represent the number of shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation into which they were converted in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence.

 

 (d) _Adjustments_. If at any time during the period between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company, or securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of capital stock, shall occur as a result of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including a reverse stock split) or subdivision or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend or stock distribution with a record date during such period (excluding, in each case, normal quarterly cash dividends), merger or other similar transaction, the Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted, without duplication, to reflect such change; _provided_ that nothing in this Section 2.1(d) shall be construed to permit the Company to take any action with respect to its securities that is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

 

 Section 2.2 _Exchange of Certificates_.

 

 (a) _Paying Agent_. At or immediately subsequent to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with a U.S. bank or trust company that shall be appointed by Parent and approved in advance by the Company (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld) to act as a paying agent hereunder (the " _Paying Agent_ "), in trust for the benefit of holders of the Shares, cash in U.S. dollars sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration in exchange for all of the Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than the Remaining Shares) pursuant to the provisions of this Article II (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ ").

 

 (b) _Payment Procedures_.

 

 (i) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time and in any event not later than the fifth Business Day following the Effective Time, the Paying Agent shall mail to each holder of record of Shares whose Shares (together with associated Rights) were converted into the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1, (A) a letter of transmittal which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented Shares (" _Certificates_ ") shall pass, only upon delivery of Certificates to the Paying Agent (and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent and the Company may reasonably determine prior to the Effective Time) and (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or non-certificated Shares represented by book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") in exchange for the Merger Consideration.

 

    -4- 
--- 

  (ii) Upon surrender of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may customarily be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor an amount (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings) equal to the product of (x) the number of Shares represented by such holders properly surrendered Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) and Book-Entry Shares multiplied by (y) the Merger Consideration. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is not registered in the transfer or stock records of the Company, any cash to be paid upon due surrender of the Certificate formerly representing such Shares may be paid to such a transferee if such Certificate is presented to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer or other Taxes have been paid or are not applicable.

 

 (iii) The Surviving Corporation, Parent and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable under this Agreement to any Person such amounts as are required to be withheld or deducted under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), or any provision of U.S. state, local or foreign Tax Law with respect to the making of such payment. To the extent that amounts are so withheld or deducted and paid over to the applicable Governmental Entity, such withheld or deducted amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to such Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding were made.

 

 (c) _Closing of Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or Parent for transfer, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the proper amount pursuant to and subject to the requirements of this Article II.

 

 (d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains undistributed to the former holders of Shares for one year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation upon demand, and any former holders of Shares who have not surrendered their Shares in accordance with this Section 2.2 shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of their claim for the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon, upon due surrender of their Shares.

 

 (e) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, none of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent or any other person shall be liable to any former holder of Shares for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate shall not have been surrendered prior to the date on which the related Merger Consideration would, pursuant to applicable Law, escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity, any such Merger Consideration shall, to the extent permitted by applicable 

 

    -5- 
--- 

  Law, immediately prior to such time, become the property of the Surviving
Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interests of any Person
previously entitled thereto.

 

 (f) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest all cash included in the Exchange Fund as reasonably directed by Parent; _provided, however,_ that any investment of such cash shall in all events be limited to direct short-term obligations of, or short-term obligations fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, the U.S. government, in commercial paper rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $10 billion (based on the most recent financial statements of such bank that are then publicly available), and that no such investment or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares pursuant to this Article II. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to the Surviving Corporation on the earlier of one year after the Effective Time or full payment of the Exchange Fund.

 

 (g) _Lost Certificates_. In the case of any Certificate that has been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent, of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent or the Paying Agent, the posting by such person of an indemnity agreement or, at the election of Parent or the Paying Agent, a bond in customary amount as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate an amount equal to the number of Shares represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate multiplied by the Merger Consideration.

 

 (h) _No Further Ownership Rights_. All cash paid upon the surrender of Certificates in accordance with the terms of this Article II shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock (together with the associated Rights) formerly represented by such Certificates.

 

 Section 2.3 _Effect of the Merger on Company Stock Options and Company_ _Restricted Shares, RSUs and Deferred Equity Units_.

 

 (a) Each outstanding option to acquire shares of Company Common Stock (each, a " _Company Stock Option_ "), whether or not then vested or exercisable, that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (and except for Company Stock Options as to which the treatment in the Merger is hereafter separately agreed by Parent and the holder thereof, which Company Stock Options shall be treated as so agreed), become fully vested (based on a deemed achievement of performance awards at the maximum level, if applicable) and, subject to the terms of the Company Stock Plans, be converted into the right to receive a payment in cash, payable in U.S. dollars and without interest, equal to the product of (i) the excess, if any, of (x) the Merger Consideration over (y) the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option, multiplied by (ii) the number of shares of Company Common Stock for which such Company Stock Option shall not theretofore have been exercised. The Surviving Corporation shall pay the holders of Company Stock Options the cash payments described in this Section 

 

    -6- 
--- 

  2.3(a) on or as soon as reasonably practicable after the date on which the
Effective Time occurs, but in any event within five (5) Business Days
thereafter.

 

 (b) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, except as separately agreed by Parent and the holder thereof, each award of restricted Company Common Stock (the " _Company_ _Restricted Shares_ ") and any accrued stock dividends shall vest in full and be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.1(a) . The Surviving Corporation will vest and pay all cash dividends accrued on such Company Restricted Shares to the holders thereof within five (5) Business Days after the Effective Time.

 

 (c) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each restricted stock unit in respect of a share of Company Common Stock (collectively, the " _RSUs_ ") shall vest in full and be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, and the holder of any such RSU shall be paid as soon as reasonably practicable after the date on which the Effective Time occurs, but in any event within five (5) Business Days thereafter, an aggregate amount of cash as the holder would have been entitled to receive had such RSU been vested in full and settled immediately before the Effective Time.

 

 (d) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, all amounts held in participant accounts and denominated in Company Common Stock under the Companys CDP/SERP Plan, as amended and restated effective November 1, 2004 (and as amended through the date hereof) and Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors, shall vest in full and be converted into an obligation to pay cash with a value equal to the product of (i) the Merger Consideration and (ii) the number of shares of Company Common Stock deemed held in such participant accounts (" _Deferred Equity Units_ "). Such obligation shall be payable or distributable in accordance with the terms of the agreement, plan or arrangement relating to such Deferred Equity Units and prior to the time of any distribution, such deferred amounts shall be permitted to be deemed invested in another investment option under the plan.

 

 (e) The Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Section 2.3 to any holder of Company Stock Options, Company Restricted Shares or RSUs such amounts as the Surviving Corporation is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of state, or local Tax Law, and the Surviving Corporation shall make any required filings with and payments to Tax authorities relating to any such deduction or withholding. To the extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld by the Surviving Corporation, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Company Stock Options, Company Restricted Shares or RSUs in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation.

 

 (f) The Board of Directors of the Company (or the appropriate committee thereof) shall take the actions necessary to effectuate the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.3.

Neither Parent nor Merger Sub is in violation of its organizational or governing documents.

 

 Section 4.2 _Corporate Authority Relative to This Agreement; No Violation_.

Material Adverse Effect.

 

 (c) The execution, delivery and performance by Parent and Merger Sub of this Agreement does not, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Financing, and compliance with the provisions hereof will not (i) result in any breach or violation of, or default (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, require consent under, or give rise to a right of termination, cancellation, modification or acceleration of any obligation or to the loss of any benefit under any loan, guarantee of indebtedness or credit agreement, note, bond, mortgage, indenture, lease, agreement, contract, purchase or sale order, instrument, permit, concession, franchise, right or license binding upon Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the properties, assets or rights of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) conflict with or result in any violation of any provision of the certificate of incorporation or by-laws or other equivalent organizational document, in each case as amended, of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or (iii) assuming that all Parent Approvals are obtained, conflict with or violate any applicable Laws, other than, (x) in the case of clauses (i) and (iii), as would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Parent Material Adverse Effect and (y) in the case of clause (i) or (iii), to the extent relating to the Company or its Subsidiaries or a change of control thereof.

withdraw or terminate) or otherwise amended or modified in any respect and
neither Parent nor Merger Sub is in breach of any of the terms or conditions
set forth therein and, subject to the accuracy of the representations and

expected to constitute a breach or failure to satisfy a condition precedent
set forth therein or a default thereunder. As of the date hereof, subject to
the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in
Article III, neither Parent nor Merger Sub has any reason to believe that it
will be unable to satisfy on a timely basis any term or condition contemplated

Agreement, the Merger, or any transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

In connection with its obligations under this Section 5.9, Parent shall be permitted to amend, modify or replace the Debt Commitment Letters with new Debt Commitment Letters (the " _New Financing Commitments_ "), _provided_ that Parent shall not permit any replacement of, or amendment or modification to be made to, or any waiver of any material provision or remedy under, the Debt Commitment Letter if such replacement, amendment, modification, waiver or remedy (1) reduces the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing below that amount required to 

 

    -38- consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, (2)
adversely amends or expands the conditions to the drawdown of the Debt
Financing in any respect that would make such conditions less likely to be
satisfied by the End Date or that would expand the possible circumstances
under which such conditions would not be satisfied by such date, (3) can
reasonably be expected to delay the Closing, or (4) is otherwise adverse to
the interests of the Company in any other material respect; and _provided,
further,_ that nothing in this Section 5.9 shall be deemed to excuse, waive
compliance with or modify any of the obligations set forth in the
Confidentiality Agreement. In the event that all conditions to the Financing
Commitments (other than, in connection with the Debt Financing, the
availability or funding of any of the Equity Financing) have been satisfied,
Parent shall, from and after the final day of the Marketing Period and subject
to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Sections 6.1 and 6.3
hereof, use its reasonable best efforts to cause the lenders and other Persons
providing such Financing to fund the Financing required to consummate the
Merger on the Closing Date. In the event that Parent becomes aware of any
event or circumstance that makes procurement of any portion of the Financing
unlikely to occur in the manner or from the sources contemplated in the
Financing Commitments or generally less likely as on the date of this
Agreement, Parent shall notify the Company and shall use its reasonable best
efforts to arrange as promptly as practicable, but in no event later than one
day prior to the Closing Date, any such portion from alternative debt
financing sources on terms and conditions no less favorable to Parent or
Merger Sub and no more adverse to the ability of Parent to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (in each case, as determined in
the reasonable judgment of Parent). In the event that on the final day of the
Marketing Period (1) all or any portion of the Debt Financing structured as
High Yield Financing has not been consummated, (2) all closing conditions
contained in Article VI shall have been satisfied or waived (other than those
conditions that by their nature will not be satisfied until the Closing) and
(3) the Bridge Financing (or alternative bridge financing obtained in
accordance with the preceding sentence) is available substantially on the
terms and conditions described in the Debt Commitment Letters (or replacements
thereof as contemplated by the preceding sentence), then Merger Sub shall
borrow under and use the proceeds of the Bridge Financing (or such alternative
bridge financing) to replace such affected portion of the High Yield Financing
no later than the last day of the Marketing Period. For purposes of this
Agreement, " _Marketing Period_ " shall mean the first period of 20
consecutive Business Days after the date hereof throughout which (x) Parent
shall have all of the Required Information (as defined below) and during which
period such information shall remain compliant at all times with applicable
provisions of Regulation S-X and Regulation S-K under the Securities Act and
(y) the conditions set forth in Sections 6.1 shall be satisfied and nothing
has occurred and no condition exists that would cause any of the conditions
set forth in Sections 6.3(a) or (b) to fail to be satisfied assuming the
Closing were to be scheduled for any day during such 20 Business Day period;
_provided_ that, if the Marketing Period has not ended on or prior to August
16, 2007, the Marketing Period shall commence no earlier than September 4,
2007.

 

 (b) The Company shall provide, shall cause its Subsidiaries to provide, and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause its Representatives, including legal and accounting, to provide, all cooperation reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the Financing and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement ( _provided_ that such requested cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries), including (i) providing such financial and other information as Parent shall 

 

    -39-

  reasonably request in order to consummate the Debt Financing, including all
Company information, financial statements and financial data of the type
required by Regulation S-X and Regulation S-K under the Securities Act and of
a type and form customarily included in private placements pursuant to Rule
144A under the Securities Act (including, to the extent applicable with
respect to such financial statements, the report of the Companys auditors
thereon and related management discussion and analysis of financial condition
and results of operations) (collectively, the " _Required Information_ "),
(ii) participating in meetings, drafting sessions and due diligence sessions
in connection with the Financing, (iii) assisting in the preparation of (A)
one or more offering documents or confidential information memoranda for any
of the Debt Financing (including the execution and delivery of one or more
customary representation letters in connection therewith), _provided_ that any
private placement memoranda or prospectuses in relation to high yield debt
securities need not be issued by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and
_provided_ , _further_ , that any private placement memoranda or prospectuses
shall contain disclosure and financial statements reflecting the Surviving
Corporation and/or its Subsidiaries as the obligor and (B) materials for
rating agency presentations, (iv) reasonably cooperating with the marketing
efforts for any of the Debt Financing, including providing assistance in the
preparation for, and participating in, meetings, due diligence sessions and
similar presentations to and with, among others, prospective lenders,
investors and rating agencies, (v) providing monthly financial statements
(excluding footnotes) to the extent the Company customarily prepares such
financial statements, (vi) entering into one or more credit or other
agreements on terms satisfactory to Parent in connection with the Debt
Financing immediately prior to the Effective Time to the extent direct
borrowings or debt incurrences by the Company or its Subsidiaries are
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters, (vii) taking all corporate
actions, subject to the occurrence of the Closing, reasonably requested by
Parent to permit consummation of the Debt Financing and the direct borrowing
or incurrence of all proceeds of the Debt Financing, including any high yield
financing, by the Surviving Corporation immediately following the Effective
Time, (viii) taking all actions reasonably necessary to (A) permit the
prospective lenders involved in the Financing to evaluate the Companys
current assets, cash management and accounting systems, policies and
procedures relating thereto for the purpose of establishing collateral
arrangements (including conducting field examination and appraisals
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters within the time frame described
therein) and (B) establish bank and other accounts and blocked account
agreements and lock box arrangements in connection with the foregoing, and
(ix) executing and delivering (or using reasonable best efforts to obtain from
advisors), and causing its Subsidiaries to execute and deliver (or use
reasonable best efforts to obtain from advisors), customary certificates
(including a certificate of the chief financial officer of the Company with
respect to solvency matters), accounting comfort letters, legal opinions
(which may be reasoned if circumstances require), hedging agreements, surveys,
title insurance policies (to the extent in possession of, or otherwise
reasonably obtainable by, the Company or its Subsidiaries) or other documents
and instruments relating to guarantees, the pledge of collateral and other
matters ancillary to the Financing as may be reasonably requested by Parent in
connection with the Financing and otherwise reasonably facilitating the pledge
of collateral and providing of guarantees contemplated by the Debt Commitment
Letter; _provided, however,_ that, except for fees and liabilities subject to
reimbursement or indemnification pursuant to the next sentence, no obligation
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under any such certificate, document
or instrument (other than the representation letter referred to above) shall
be effective until the

 

    -40- Effective Time and, except for fees and liabilities subject to reimbursement
or indemnification pursuant to the next sentence, none of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries shall be required to pay any commitment or other similar
fee or incur any other liability in connection with the Financing prior to the
Effective Time. Parent shall promptly, upon request by the Company, reimburse
the Company for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs (including reasonable
attorneys fees) incurred by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in
connection with the cooperation of the Company and its Subsidiaries
contemplated by this Section 5.9 and shall indemnify and hold harmless the
Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective representatives from and
against any and all losses, damages, claims, costs or expenses suffered or
incurred by any of them in connection with the arrangement of the Financing
and any information used in connection therewith, except with respect to any
information provided by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

 

 Section 5.10 _Access; Confidentiality_. The Company shall afford to Parent, and to Parents officers, employees, accountants, counsel, consultants, financial advisors and other Representatives and financing sources, reasonable access during normal business hours during the period prior to the Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement to all of its and its Subsidiaries properties, Contracts, books and records and to those officers, employees and agents of the Company to whom Parent reasonably requests access, and, during such period, the Company shall furnish, as promptly as practicable, to Parent all information concerning its and its Subsidiaries business, properties, personnel and financial information as Parent may reasonably request. Except for disclosures expressly permitted by the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, Parent shall hold, and shall cause its officers, employees, accountants, counsel, financial advisors and other Representatives to hold, all information received from the Company or its Representatives, directly or indirectly, in confidence in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement.

 

 Section 5.11 _Treatment of Notes_.

 

 (a) If requested by Merger Sub, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to assist Merger Sub or an affiliate of Merger Sub in commencing, an offer to purchase, and related consent solicitation with respect to, all of the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the 8 5/8% Notes due June 15, 2010 (collectively, the " _Notes_ ") on the terms and conditions specified by Parent (the " _Debt Offer_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the closing of the Debt Offer shall be conditioned on the completion of the Merger, shall provide that the Notes shall be accepted for payment by the Surviving Corporation immediately upon the completion of the Merger, and otherwise shall be in compliance with applicable Laws and SEC rules and regulations. The Company shall provide, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause their respective Representatives to, provide cooperation reasonably requested by Merger Sub in connection with the Debt Offer. If requested by Merger Sub in writing, in lieu of Merger Sub or an affiliate of Merger Sub commencing the Debt Offer for such Notes (or in addition thereto), the Company shall, to the extent permitted by the indenture and supplemental indentures governing the Notes (collectively, the " _Indenture_ ") take actions reasonably requested by Merger Sub that are reasonably necessary for the satisfaction and/or discharge and/or defeasance of the Notes pursuant to the applicable provisions of the Indenture, and shall satisfy and/or discharge and/or defease, as applicable, the Notes in 

 

    -41- accordance with the terms of the Indenture at the Effective Time, _provided_
that to the extent that any action described above can be conditioned on the
occurrence of the Effective Time, it will be so conditioned, and _provided_ ,
_further_ , that prior to the Company being required to take any of the
actions described above that cannot be conditioned on the occurrence of the
Effective Time, prior to the Closing, Merger Sub shall irrevocably deposit, or
shall cause to be irrevocably deposited with the trustee under the Indenture
sufficient funds to effect such satisfaction or discharge or defeasance.

 

 (b) The Company covenants and agrees that, promptly following the consent solicitation expiration date, assuming the requisite consents are received, each of the Company and its applicable Subsidiaries as is necessary shall (and shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause the trustee to) execute a supplemental indenture to the Indenture, which supplemental indenture shall implement the amendments described in the offer to purchase, related letter of transmittal, and other related documents (collectively, the " _Offer Documents_ ") and shall become operative only concurrently with the Effective Time, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including the conditions to the Debt Offer). Concurrent with the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to accept for payment and thereafter promptly pay for the Notes that have been properly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Debt Offer and in accordance with the Debt Offer.

 

 (c) Merger Sub shall prepare all necessary and appropriate documentation in connection with the Debt Offer, including the Offer Documents, and provide the Company with a reasonable opportunity to comment and make reasonable changes to such documents. Merger Sub and the Company shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to, reasonably cooperate with each other in the preparation of the Offer Documents ( _provided_ that the Companys and its Subsidiaries cooperation shall be limited to matters that Merger Sub cannot accomplish without additional cost or delay without the assistance of the Company or its Subsidiaries). The Offer Documents (including all amendments or supplements) and all mailings to the holders of the Notes in connection with the Debt Offer shall be subject to the prior review of, and comment by, the Company and Merger Sub and shall be reasonably acceptable to each of them. If at any time prior to the completion of the Debt Offer any information in the Offer Documents should be discovered by the Company and its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, or Merger Sub, on the other, which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Offer Documents, so that the Offer Documents shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, the party that discovers such information shall use commercially reasonable efforts to promptly notify the other party, and an appropriate amendment or supplement prepared by Merger Sub describing such information shall be disseminated by or on behalf of the Company or its Subsidiaries to the holders of the Notes (which supplement or amendment and dissemination may, at the reasonable direction of Merger Sub, take the form of a filing of a Current Report on Form 8-K). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 5.11(c), the Company shall and shall cause its Subsidiaries to comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other applicable Law to the extent such laws are applicable in connection with the Debt Offer and such compliance will not be deemed a breach hereof.

  Section 5.12 _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company, of (i) any notice or other communication received by such party from any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby or from any person alleging that the consent of such person is or may be required in connection with the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby, if the subject matter of such communication or the failure of such party to obtain such consent could be material to the Company, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, (ii) any actions, suits, claims, investigations or proceedings commenced or, to such partys Knowledge, threatened against, relating to or involving or otherwise affecting such party or any of its Subsidiaries which relate to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby, (iii) the discovery of any fact or circumstance that, or the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event the occurrence or non-occurrence of which, would reasonably be likely to cause or result in any of the Conditions to the Merger set forth in Article VI not being satisfied or satisfaction of those conditions being materially delayed in violation of any provision of this Agreement; _provided, however,_ that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 5.12 shall not (x) cure any breach of, or non-compliance with, any other provision of this Agreement or (y) limit the remedies available to the party receiving such notice; and, _provided, further,_ that the failure to give prompt notice hereunder pursuant to clause (iii) shall not constitute a failure of a Condition to the Merger set forth in Article VI except to the extent that the underlying fact or circumstance not so notified would standing alone constitute such a failure. The Company shall notify Parent, on a reasonably current basis, of any events or changes with respect to any regulatory investigation or action involving the Company or any of its Affiliates, and shall reasonably cooperate with Parent or its Affiliates in efforts to mitigate any adverse consequences to Parent or its Affiliates which may arise (including by coordinating and providing assistance in meeting with regulators).

 Section 5.14 _Control of Operations_. Without in any way limiting any partys rights or obligations under this Agreement, the parties understand and agree that (i) nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Parent, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the Companys operations prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over its operations.

 

 Section 5.15 _Certain Transfer Taxes_. Any liability arising out of any real estate transfer Tax with respect to interests in real property owned directly or indirectly by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Merger, if applicable and due with respect to the Merger, shall be borne by the Surviving Corporation and expressly shall not be a liability of shareholders of the Company.

 

    -43- Section 5.16 _Obligations of Merger Sub_. Parent shall take all action necessary to cause Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation to perform their respective obligations under this Agreement, the Financing Commitments and any New Financing Commitments.

 (d) In the event that the Company shall fail to pay the Termination Fee or Parent Expenses, or Parent shall fail to pay the Parent Termination Fee, required pursuant to this Section 7.2 when due, such fee and/or expenses shall accrue interest for the period commencing on the date such fee or expenses, as the case may be, became past due, at a rate equal to the rate of interest publicly announced by JPMorgan Chase Bank from time to time during such period, as such banks prime lending rate. In addition, if either party shall fail to pay such fee or expenses when due, such owing party shall also pay to the owed party all of the owed partys costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees) in connection with efforts to collect such fee or expenses. Each of Parent and the Company acknowledges that the fees and the other provisions of this Section 7.2 are an integral part of the Merger and that, without these agreements, Parent and the Company would not enter into this Agreement.

 

 (e) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 7.2 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and that neither the Termination Fee nor the Parent Termination Fee is a penalty, but rather is liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent and Merger Sub or the Company, as the case may be, in the circumstances in which such Termination Fee is payable for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Companys right to receive payment of the Parent Termination Fee from Parent pursuant to this Section 7.2 or the guarantee thereof pursuant to the Guarantee shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Company and its Subsidiaries against Parent, Merger Sub, the Guarantor and any of their respective former, current or future general or limited partners, stockholders, managers, members, directors, officers, Affiliates or agents for the loss suffered as a result of the failure of the Merger to be consummated, and upon payment of such amount, none of Parent, Merger Sub, the Guarantor or 

 

    -49- any of their former, current or future general or limited partners,
stockholders, managers, members, directors, officers, Affiliates or agents
shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.
