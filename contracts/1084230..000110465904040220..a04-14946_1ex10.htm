Prior to the Closing, Shareholders and CIC shall have caused the formation of

 The Purchase Price will be decreased by the difference if actual
Working Capital on the Closing Date is less than the Targeted Working
Capital.

  



  

2.7 _Adjustment Procedure_.

  



  

(a) _Discounted Estimated Working Capital Adjustment_. Not later than 10
days prior to the Closing Date, CIC shall deliver to PAS its good faith
estimate of the Working Capital adjustment described in Section 2.6 above as
of the Closing Date, which estimate will have been prepared by CIC and
reviewed by J.D. Cloud and Co. L.L.P., CICs outside accountants ("Cloud"), and
shall include the estimated adjustment to CICs bad debt reserve according to
the methodology that is described in Section 2.7(b) below (the "Estimated
Working Capital Adjustment"). PAS may, not later than 3 days prior to
the Closing Date, notify, CIC and Cloud in writing of any initial dispute
or concerns PAS has with such Estimated Working Capital Adjustment, including
any facts or other basis it has supporting its position. If PAS does not
timely notify CIC and Cloud of any such disputed matters or concerns, the
Estimated Working Capital Adjustment as originally delivered by CIC shall be
used to determine the Discounted Estimated Working Capital Adjustment as
provided for below. If PAS does timely notify CIC and Cloud of such disputed
matters or concerns, CIC shall (i) review

  



  

13   

     
   

  



  

and consider the notice and any materials delivered to it by PAS, (ii)
perform what further investigation or inquiry it deems necessary, (iii) if it
deems appropriate, adjust the Estimated Working Capital Adjustment, and (iv)
notify PAS and CIC, in writing, of its final Estimated Working Capital
Adjustment.  The Estimated Working Capital Adjustment shall then be
multiplied by 80% and the product thus obtained (the "Discounted Estimated
Working Capital Adjustment") shall be added to the Purchase Price and paid at
the Closing by PAS.

  



  

(b) _Final Working Capital Adjustment_. Within 60 days following the Closing
Date, Holding Company shall deliver to PAS its calculation of a final Working
Capital adjustment accompanied by Clouds final report thereon. In preparing
such calculation, Working Capital shall be calculated in accordance with GAAP
applied consistently with CICs prior financial statements, except as noted
in Section 2.6 above and except as follows:

  



  

(i) the value of CICs Closing Date inventory shall be adjusted to be
consistent with the results of a physical inventory count to be taken on the
Closing Date (which count may be observed by PAS and its Representatives)
with inventory valued on a first in, first out basis, in accordance with GAAP
applied consistently with CICs prior financial statements, including
appropriate write-offs for any damaged or obsolete inventory; and

  



  

(ii) CICs bad debt reserve shall be adjusted as set forth in Schedule 2.7
attached hereto.

  



  

After receipt of Holding Companys calculation of the final Working Capital
adjustment and the Cloud report thereon, PAS and Holding Company
shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any differences. If within 30 days
after Holding Companys delivery of its calculation of the final Working
Capital adjustment, PAS does not notify Holding Company that it disagrees
with such calculation, specifying in reasonable detail the basis therefor, or
the parties are able to resolve any such differences, the final Working
Capital adjustment as proposed by Holding Company or their agreement as to
the final Working Capital adjustment, as the case may be, shall be binding
and conclusive (the "Final Working Capital Adjustment"). If within 30 days
after Holding Companys delivery of its calculation of the final Working
Capital adjustment, PAS has notified Holding Company that it disagrees with
such calculation, specifying in reasonable detail the basis therefor, and
the parties are unable to resolve any differences they may have concerning
such calculation, the parties shall select and engage the Auditor and request
the Auditor to review Holding Companys calculation of the Final Working
Capital Adjustment and to resolve any disputed item therein in a manner
consistent with GAAP as defined above and the provisions of this Agreement.
In that event, (i) each party will furnish to the Auditor such work papers
and other documents and information relating to the disputed issues and the
Final Working Capital Adjustment as the Auditor may request and as are
available to that party, and PAS and Holding Company will be afforded the
opportunity to present to the Auditor any other documentation or

  



  

14   

     
   

  



  

facts such party deems relevant to resolving the disputed issues. Unless the
Auditor requests a meeting where Representatives of both PAS and Holding
Company are present, all communications with the Auditor shall be in writing
and the other party will be copied on same. In resolving the disputed
issues, the Auditor shall act in accordance with Section 2.6 above and this
Section 2.7 but otherwise will not be bound by any determination previously
made by CIC, nor will any failure of PAS to challenge the Estimated Working
Capital Adjustment be a factor in making its calculation. The Auditor shall
deliver its calculation of the Final Working Capital Adjustment to each of
the parties. Either party may, not later than 10 days after receipt of the
Auditors calculation, notify, in writing, the Auditor and the other party of
any dispute or concerns it has with such calculation, including any facts or
other basis it has supporting its position. If neither party elects to timely
notify the Auditor of any such disputed matters or concerns, the calculation
of the Final Working Capital Adjustment as originally delivered by the
Auditor shall be final and binding and deemed to be the "Final Working
Capital Adjustment." If either party timely notifies the Auditor in writing
of such disputed matters or concerns, the Auditor shall (i) review and
consider the notice and any materials delivered to it by such party or
parties, (ii) perform what further investigation or inquiry it deems
necessary, (iii) if it deems appropriate, adjust its calculation of the Final
Working Capital Adjustment, and (iv) notify PAS and Holding Company, in
writing, of its Final Working Capital Adjustment, which for all purposes will
be final and binding and be deemed the "Final Working Capital Adjustment."
Each party will provide to the other reasonable access to its books, records
and personnel in connection with the foregoing procedures.

  



  

(c) _Payment; Interest; IRS Deposit_. The difference between the Final
Working Capital Adjustment and the Discounted Estimated Working
Capital Adjustment shall be calculated. If the Final Working Capital
Adjustment exceeds the Discounted Estimated Working Capital Adjustment, such
difference together with interest thereon at the Prime Rate accruing from the
Closing, shall be paid by PAS to Holding Company, by wire transfer, within 7
days after the final determination thereof as provided above. If the Final
Working Capital Adjustment is less than the Discounted Estimated Working
Capital Adjustment, such difference together with interest thereon at the
Prime Rate accruing from the Closing Date, shall be paid by Holding Company
to PAS, by wire transfer, within 7 days after the final determination thereof
as provided above. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that CIC has
not received the IRS Deposit prior to the time any payment is due to the
Holding Company hereunder, any payment due to Holding Company under
this Section 2.7(c) will be reduced by an amount (the "Contingent
Holdback Amount") equal to the lesser of: (i) the amount due to the Holding
Company hereunder, or (ii) the IRS Deposit, in each case, together with
interest thereon at the Prime Rate accruing from the Closing Date. PAS shall
pay the Contingent Holdback Amount to Holding Company only if and when the
IRS Deposit is received by CIC or PAS; such payment shall not bear interest.
 PAS shall make reasonable commercial efforts to obtain the IRS Deposit.

  



  

15   

     
   

  



  

(d) _Costs_. PAS and Holding Company will each bear 50% of the fees and
expenses of the Auditor.

Except as set forth in the Disclosure Schedule, Shareholders (solely with
respect to the provisions in Sections 3.2, 3.3 and 3.15(b)(ii) that expressly
refer to Shareholders), CIC and Holding Company represent and warrant to PAS
as follows:

  



  

3.1 _Organization and_ _Good Standing_.

  



  

(a) Part 3.1 of the Disclosure Schedule contains a complete and accurate list

authority to conduct its business as it is now being conducted, to own or use
the properties and assets that it purports to own or use, and to perform all
its obligations under Applicable Contracts. Holding Company, Central
Investment LLC and each Acquired Company is duly qualified to do business as
a foreign corporation or limited liability company and is in good standing
under the laws of each state or other jurisdiction in which either the
ownership or use of the properties owned or used by it, or the nature of the
activities conducted by it, requires such qualification.

  



  

(b) CIC has made available to PAS true, correct and complete copies of the
Organizational Documents, as currently in effect, of each Acquired Company,
Central Investment LLC and Holding Company, including a copy of Central
Investment LLCs and Holding Companys Articles of Organization and each

approved by the board of directors of CIC, the members of

  



  

17   

     
   

  



  

Central Investment LLC and Holding Company and the Shareholders. No other
corporate or limited liability company act or proceeding on the part of CIC,
Shareholders, Central Investment LLC or Holding Company is necessary to
authorize or approve this Agreement and the consummation of the Contemplated
Transactions. Each trustee listed on the signature page hereto has the power,
authority and capacity under his or her related trust instrument to execute
and deliver this Agreement.

  



  

(b) Except as set forth in Part 3.2 of the Disclosure Schedule, neither
the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation
or performance of any of the Contemplated Transactions will, directly
or indirectly (with or without notice or lapse of time):

  



  

(i) contravene, conflict with, or result in a violation of any provision of
the Organizational Documents of the Acquired Companies, Shareholders, Central
Investment LLC or Holding Company, or any resolution or agreement adopted or
executed by the board of directors or the stockholders of any Acquired
Company or managers or members of either Holding Company or Central
Investment LLC;

  



  

(ii) contravene, conflict with, result in a violation of, or give any
Governmental Body or other Person the right to challenge any of the
Contemplated Transactions or to exercise any remedy or obtain any relief
under, any Legal Requirement or any Order to which any Acquired Company or
Shareholder, or any of the assets owned or used by any Acquired Company or
Shareholder, may be subject;

  



  

(iii) contravene, conflict with, or result in a violation of any of the terms
or requirements of, or give any Governmental Body the right to revoke,

any Acquired Company or Shareholder;

  



  

(iv) cause PAS or any Acquired Company to become subject to, or to become
liable for the payment of, any Tax; contravene, conflict with, or result in a
violation or breach of any provision of, or give any Person the right to
declare a default or exercise any remedy under, or to accelerate the maturity
or performance of, or to cancel, terminate, or modify, any Applicable
Contract or Contract to which any Shareholder is a party; or

  



  

(v) result in the imposition or creation of any Encumbrance upon or with
respect to any of the assets owned or used by any Acquired Company.

  



  

Except as set forth in Part 3.2 of the Disclosure Schedule, none of the

3.3 _Capitalization_.  The authorized equity securities of CIC consist of
115,000 shares of nonvoting common stock, no par value, of which 86,268
shares are issued and outstanding and 35,000 shares of voting common stock,
no par value, of which 26,466 shares are issued and outstanding.  Except as
described in Part 3.3 of the Disclosure Schedule, on the date hereof,
Shareholders are the record and beneficial (subject, in the case of
the Shareholders which are trusts, to the interests therein of the
beneficiaries of such trusts) owners and holders of all the Shares, free and
clear of all Encumbrances. Part 3.3 of the Disclosure Schedule correctly
identifies all Shareholders and the number of Shares held by each. On the
Closing Date, Holding Company will be the record and beneficial owner and
holder of all the Shares, free and clear of all Encumbrances.  With the
exception of the Shares (which are owned by Shareholders), all of the
outstanding equity securities and other securities of each Acquired Company
are owned of record and beneficially by one or more of the
Acquired Companies, free and clear of all Encumbrances.  Part 3.3 of the
Disclosure Schedule provides a true and accurate capitalization table for
each of CICs Subsidiaries. Except as set forth on Part 3.3 of the Disclosure
Schedule, no legend or other reference to any purported Encumbrance appears
upon any certificate representing equity securities of any Acquired Company.
All of the outstanding equity securities of each Acquired Company have been
duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid and non-assessable.
 There are no outstanding (i) securities convertible into or
exchangeable for the capital stock or other securities of any of the Acquired
Companies, (ii) options, warrants or other rights to purchase or subscribe to
capital stock or other securities of any of the Acquired Companies, or (iii)
other Contracts, commitments, understandings or arrangements of any kind
relating to the issuance, sale, or transfer of any equity securities or other
securities of any Acquired Company except for this Agreement and except for
the restrictions contained in certain trust documents or other restrictions
described in Part 3.3 of the Disclosure Schedule that will terminate
effective as of the Closing. None of the outstanding equity securities or
other securities of any Acquired Company was issued in violation of the
Securities Act or any other Legal Requirement. Except for the shares and
partnership interests held in Queen City Racquet Club Corporation, Confluence
Enterprises, Inc., Signs of Life Corporation, Koba, Inc., Tsuga, Inc., EDLP,
Inc., Eagle Lake Development Limited Partnership and certain equity interests
set forth on Part 3.3 of the Disclosure Schedule, no Acquired Company owns,
or has any Contract to acquire, any equity securities or other securities of
any Person (other than the Acquired Companies) or any direct or indirect
equity or ownership interest in any other business.

  



  

3.4 _Financial Statements_. CIC has made available to PAS: (a) audited
consolidated balance sheets of CIC as of September 30 in each of the years
2002, 2003 and 2004, and the related audited consolidated statements of
earnings, changes in stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the
fiscal years then ended, including the notes thereto, together with the
report thereon of Cloud (collectively, the "Audited Financial
Statements"), (b) combined and proforma combined statements of earnings of
CICs soft drink bottling and full line vending operations for each of the
years ended September 30, 1997 through 2004 and a proforma combined balance
sheet of CICs soft drink bottling and full line vending operations as of
September 30, 2003 which exclude the Non-Core Assets, and (c) internally
prepared balance sheets and related statements of earnings of each of the
Acquired Companies for the twelve (12) months ended on September 30, for each
of years 2001 through 2004 (the "Internal Financial Statements").  The
Audited Financial Statements fairly present the financial condition and the
results of operations, changes in stockholders equity, and cash flows of the
Acquired Companies as of the respective dates of and for the periods referred
to in such financial statements, all in accordance with

  



  

19   

     
   

  



  

GAAP; the Audited Financial Statements reflect the consistent application of
such accounting principles throughout the periods involved except where
otherwise noted therein. The Internal Financial Statements are not prepared
in accordance with GAAP but, subject thereto and to normal recurring year-end
adjustments (the effect of which will not be materially adverse),
the information contained in the Internal Financial Statements is accurate in
all material respects.

  



  

3.5 _Books and_ _Records_. The books of account, minute books, stock record
books, and other records of the Acquired Companies, all of which have been
made available to PAS, are complete and correct in all material respects and
have been maintained in accordance with sound business practices. At the
Closing, all of those books and records will be in the possession of the
Acquired Companies. All redacted minutes in all minute books previously made
available to PAS for review relate only to CICs dispute with PepsiCo, Inc.
and the sale of the Shares to PAS.

  



  

3.6 _Title to_ _Properties; Encumbrances_. Part 3.6 of the Disclosure Schedule
contains a complete and accurate list of all real property, leaseholds, or
other interests therein owned by any Acquired Company. CIC has delivered or
made available to PAS copies of the deeds and other documents (as recorded)
by which the Acquired Companies acquired such real property and interests,
and copies of all title insurance policies, opinions, abstracts, and surveys
in the possession of CIC or the Acquired Companies and relating to such
property or interests. The Acquired Companies own (with good and marketable
title in the case of real property, subject only to the matters permitted by
the following sentence) all the properties and assets (whether real,
personal, or mixed and whether tangible or intangible) that they purport to
own. Except as set forth on Part 3.6 of the Disclosure Schedule, all
properties and assets owned by the Acquired Companies are owned by them are
free and clear of all Encumbrances other than Permitted Encumbrances. All
buildings, plants, and structures owned or leased by the Acquired Companies
lie wholly within the boundaries of the real property owned or leased by the
Acquired Companies and do not encroach upon the property of, or otherwise
materially conflict with the property rights of, any other Person. Part 3.6
of the Disclosure Schedule contains a list of the title insurance polices,
surveys and deeds previously made available to PAS for review. To
CICs Knowledge, there are no zoning laws and other building or land use
restrictions imposed by any Governmental Body with jurisdiction thereover
that impair the present use of the Facilities.

  



  

3.7 _Condition and_ _Sufficiency of Assets; Non-Core Assets_. The buildings,
plants, structures, and equipment used in the business of the Acquired
Companies are, subject to normal wear and tear,  structurally sound, in good
operating condition and repair, and adequate for the uses to which they are
being put, and, except as set forth in Part 3.7 of the Disclosure Schedule,
none of such buildings, plants, structures, or equipment is in need of
maintenance or repairs except for ordinary, routine maintenance and repairs
that are not material in nature or cost. Except as set forth in Part 3.7 of
the Disclosure Schedule, all repairs relating to or arising out of the
tornado at the Riviera Beach Facilities (including the correction of the mold
issue arising from/relating to such tornado damage) have been completed and
fully paid for. Excluding the Non-Core Assets, the remaining buildings,
plants, structures, equipment and other assets of the Acquired Companies are
sufficient for the continued conduct of the Business after the Closing in
substantially the same manner as conducted prior to the Closing. Except for
the Blue Ash office lease and the Airplane Lease, and the personal property
related to such office and airplane and included in the Non-Core Assets, none
of the tangible Non-Core Assets were used primarily in

  



  

20   

     
   

  



  

the Business. Except as set forth in Part 3.7 of the Disclosure Schedule, at
the Closing, the Acquired Companies shall own, lease or license (pursuant to
valid and enforceable lease agreements and license agreements) all the assets
which are necessary to conduct the Business.

  



  

3.8 _Accounts Receivable_. Other than in the Ordinary Course of Business,
there is no contest, claim, or right of set-off, under any Contract with any
obligor of a trade accounts receivable of an Acquired Company relating to the
amount or validity of such accounts receivable. CIC has provided to PAS a
materially accurate and complete list of all trade accounts receivable of the
Acquired Companies as of October 31, 2004, which list sets forth the aging of
such accounts receivable. As of the date hereof and as of the Closing Date,
no money is owed to the Acquired Companies from any insurer relating to the
tornado damage suffered at the Riviera Beach Facilities.

  



  

3.9 _Inventory_. All inventories not written off by CIC have been priced at
the lower of cost or market on a first in, first out basis.  On the Closing
Date, all vending machines and bulk coin changers in service that are owned
by the Acquired Companies will be filled to the levels generally maintained
at such time in the Ordinary Course of Business.

  



  

3.10 _No Undisclosed_ _Liabilities_. Except as set forth in Part 3.10(a) of
the Disclosure Schedule, on the date hereof the Acquired Companies have
no liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether known or unknown and
whether absolute, accrued, contingent, or otherwise) except for liabilities
or obligations reflected or reserved against in the most recent Audited
Financial Statements and current liabilities incurred in the Ordinary Course
of Business since the date thereof. On the Closing Date, the Acquired
Companies shall have no liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether
known or unknown and whether absolute, accrued, contingent, or otherwise)
except for: (i) the capital lease obligation for the Pompano Beach, Florida
distribution center, (ii) the Deferred Tax Liability, (iii) trade payables
and other current liabilities normally considered to be part of the Working
Capital and which will be included in the calculation of the Working Capital

Encumbrances, (v) executory obligations under the Applicable Contracts, the
performance of which is not yet due, (vi) the liabilities and obligations
described on Part 3.10(a) of the Disclosure Schedule and (vii)

3.11 _Taxes_.

  



  

(a) The Acquired Companies have filed or caused to be filed, on a timely
basis, all Tax Returns that are or were required to be filed by or with
respect to any of them, either separately or as a member of a group of

were complete and correct in all material respects and were prepared in
substantial compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. Part 3.11 of
the Disclosure Schedule contains a complete and accurate list of all state

the payment of, all Taxes that have or may have become due pursuant to its
Tax Returns or otherwise, or pursuant to any

  



  

21   

     
   

  



  

assessment received by Shareholders or any Acquired Company, except such
Taxes, if any, as are listed in Part 3.11 of the Disclosure Schedule and are
being contested in good faith and as to which adequate reserves (determined
in accordance with GAAP) have been provided in the most recent Audited
Financial Statements. There are no Encumbrances for Taxes (other than for
Taxes not yet due and payable) upon any assets of any of the
Acquired Companies.

  



  

(b) Part 3.11 of the Disclosure Schedule contains a complete and accurate
list of all audits of all United States federal and state income Tax Returns
of the Acquired Companies for tax years ending on or after December 31, 1999,
including a reasonably detailed description of the nature and outcome of each
audit. All deficiencies proposed as a result of such audits have been paid,
reserved against, settled, or, as described in Part 3.11 of the Disclosure
Schedule, are being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings. Part
3.11 of the Disclosure Schedule describes all adjustments to the United
States federal or state income Tax Returns filed by any Acquired Company or
any group of corporations including any Acquired Company for all taxable
years since 1993, and the resulting deficiencies proposed by the relevant
Governmental Body. Except as described in Part 3.11 of the Disclosure
Schedule, no Shareholder or Acquired Company has given or been requested to
give waivers or extensions (or is or would be subject to a waiver or
extension given by any other Person) of any statute of limitations relating
to the payment of Taxes of any Acquired Company or for which any Acquired
Company may be liable.  Except as set forth in Part 3.11 of the Disclosure
Schedule, none of the Acquired Companies has received from any Federal, state
or local taxing authority any notice indicating an intent to open an (i)
audit or other review, (ii) request for information related to Tax matters or

proposed, asserted or assessed by any Governmental Body against the Acquired
Companies.

January 1, 1997, no claim has been made by a Governmental Body in a
jurisdiction where the Acquired Companies do not file Tax Returns that any of
the Acquired Companies is or may be subject to taxation by that jurisdiction.

  



  

(d) The charges, accruals, and reserves with respect to Taxes on the
respective books of each Acquired Company are adequate (determined in
accordance with GAAP) and are at least equal to that Acquired Companys
liability for Taxes.  There exists no proposed tax assessment against any
Acquired Company except as disclosed in the most recent Audited Financial
Statements or in Part 3.11 of the Disclosure Schedule.  No consent to the
application of Section 341(f)(2) of the IRC has been filed with respect to
any property or assets held, acquired, or to be acquired by any Acquired
Company. All Taxes that any Acquired Company is or was required by Legal

of any "excess parachute payments" within the meaning of IRC Section 280G.

  



  

(f) CIC (and any predecessor of CIC) has been a validly electing S
corporation within the meaning of Code §§1361 and 1362 at all times since
October 1, 2002 and CIC will be an S corporation up to and including the day
before the Closing Date. Part 3.11(f) of the Disclosure Schedule

subsidiary" within the meaning of IRC §1361(b)(3)(B). Each Acquired Company
so identified has been a qualified subchapter S subsidiary at all times since
the date shown on such schedule up to and including the day before the
Closing Date.

LLC and Central Investment LLC shall then have complete and sole sponsorship,
control and the responsibilities of plan administrator and named fiduciary of
the Company Plans, including specifically the Central Investment
Corporation Consolidated Pension Plan, the Central Investment Corporation
Thrift Savings (401(k)) Retirement Plan, and the Central Investment
Corporation Individual Employee Accounts Retirement Plan, and the trusts

(b) _Plan Amendments_. Central Investment LLC shall promptly after the

provided that such Company Plan does not currently permit such a distribution
and that any such

  



  

41   

     
   

  



  

amendment shall not jeopardize such Plans tax-qualified status. Central
Investment LLC reserves the right to freeze the future accrual of benefits
under the Consolidated Pension Plan, complete the full funding of that Plan,
and, if it so chooses, perfect the termination of that Plan, incident to
which all benefits accrued under that Plan will then be distributed to the
Plans participants. Central Investment LLC will take all steps necessary to
cause each participant in the Central Investment Corporation Thrift Savings
(401(k)) Retirement Plan immediately prior to the Closing Date who is
employed by an Acquired Company immediately thereafter to be fully vested in
such employees account in such plan as of the Closing Date, including
advising the plan administrator that the Contemplated Transactions is a
"partial termination" of such plan.

  



  

(c) _Nonqualified Retirement Plans_. As of the Closing Date, Central
Investment LLC shall fully fund or assume all obligations then accrued under

other termination of employment for purposes of the nonqualified deferred
compensation or retirement plans or arrangements of Central Investment LLC.

to its nonqualified deferred compensation or retirement plans or arrangements
for the purpose of providing that no such separation or other termination
shall have occurred.

and PAS will cooperate with each other in the transfer of these Company
Plans, plan assets and related liabilities to Central Investment LLC to
accomplish the purposes stated herein and to keep affected employees informed
of their rights and benefit coverages as to benefits accrued both before and
after the Closing Date.

  



  

(e) _COBRA_. Central Investment LLC shall provide continuation of medical

prior to the Closing Date provided they had been employees or spouses or
dependents of employees of an Acquired Company prior to the Closing Date.

coverage to all Non-Core Employees and any other employees or qualified
beneficiaries who elect COBRA coverage as a result of a COBRA qualifying
event which occurs on or prior to the Closing Date.

5.12 _Consents_. CIC, Holding Company and Central Investment LLC shall
cooperate with and assist PAS in seeking to obtain the Consents identified in
Part 3.2 of the Disclosure Schedule. In the event that PAS is unable to
obtain the Consent for any agreement with Dr Pepper/Seven Up, Inc. (or its
Related Persons, including without limitation, Sunkist Soft Drinks, Inc.,
Sunkist Growers, Inc., Cadbury Beverages, Inc., Dr Pepper/Cadbury
North America, Inc. and The Seven Up Company), CIC, Holding Company and

with the proceeds of any such sale to go to PAS.

Taxes, consent to any extension or waiver of the limitation period applicable
to any Tax claim or assessment relating to any of the Acquired Companies, or
take any other similar action relating to the filing of any Tax Return or the
payment of any Tax, if such election, adoption, change, amendment, agreement,
settlement, surrender, consent or other action would have the effect of
increasing the Tax liability of any of the Acquired Companies for any period
ending on or after the Closing Date or decreasing any Tax attribute of any of
the Acquired Companies existing on the Closing Date.

  



  

(b) _S Corporation Status_. Neither Holding Company, Acquired Companies, nor
Shareholders shall revoke any Acquired Companys election to be taxed as an S

status as a validly electing S corporation within the meaning of IRC §§1361
and 1362.

  



  

5.15 _Non-_ _Core Employees_.  The parties shall cooperate with each other in

Date. Subject to the requirements of applicable law, each such Tax Return
shall be prepared in a manner consistent with past practices of the Acquired
Companies, as the case may be. Each such Tax Return shall be submitted to
PAS for approval at least thirty (30) days prior to the due date (including
any extension thereof) for filing such Tax Return, and PAS shall provide any
comments on such proposed Tax Return no less than fifteen (15) days prior to
the due date (including extensions) for filing such Tax Return. If any aspect
of such Tax Return remains in dispute five (5) days before the due date
(including extensions) for filing such Tax Return, PAS shall nevertheless
consent to filing of the Tax Returns if Holding Company provides an opinion
of the Holding Companys qualified tax advisor that filing of the Tax Return
as proposed by Holding Company is not inconsistent with applicable law and
will not create adverse tax consequences to PAS. If PAS withholds such
consent as permitted by this Agreement, the matters in dispute shall be
submitted to Auditor for resolution. The decision of Auditor concerning any
disputed items shall be final and binding on the parties and the fees and
expenses of Auditor shall be paid

  



  

48   

     
   

  



  

one-half by Holding Company and one-half by PAS. After each such Tax Return
has been prepared, reviewed and approved (and any disputes concerning any
items on such Tax Return have been resolved by Auditor, if necessary), PAS
shall cause the appropriate officers of the Acquired Companies to sign and
file such Tax Return with the applicable taxing authority.

  



  

(b) _Tax Returns for Periods Beginning On or Before and Ending after the
Closing Date_. PAS shall prepare or cause to be prepared and shall file or
cause to be filed any Tax Returns of the Acquired Companies for Tax periods
that begin on or before the Closing Date and end after the Closing Date. PAS
shall provide a copy of such Tax Returns for review by the Holding Company at
least thirty (30) days prior to the date for filing such Tax Returns.
 Whether or not Holding Company agrees with the contents of such
Tax Returns, it shall pay to PAS within thirty (30) days after the date on
which Taxes are paid with respect to such periods an amount equal to the
portion of such Taxes which relates to the portion of such Tax period ending
on the Closing Date. For purposes of this Section 9.5, in the case of any
Taxes that are imposed on a periodic basis and are payable for a Tax period
that includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date, the portion of such Tax
which relates to the portion of such Tax period ending on the Closing Date
shall (i) in the case of any Taxes other than Taxes based upon or related to
income, receipts, wages, capital expenditures, or expenses, be deemed to be
the amount of such Tax for the entire Tax period multiplied by a fraction the
numerator of which is the number of days in the portion of the Tax period
that ends on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of
days in the entire Tax period, and (ii) in the case of any Tax based upon
or related to income, receipts, wages, capital expenditures, or expenses,
be deemed equal to the amount which would be payable if the relevant Tax
period ended on the Closing Date. Any credits relating to a Tax period that
begins before and ends after the Closing Date shall be taken into account as
though the relevant Tax period ended on the Closing Date.

  



  

(c) _Payment of Tax for Periods Ending on or Before the Closing Date_.
 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, Holding Company shall reimburse PAS for Taxes of the Acquired
Companies with respect to any Tax period (or portion thereof) ending on or
before or including the Closing Date to the extent such Taxes are neither
paid before the Closing nor included as a current liability in the Final
Working Capital Adjustment.

  



  

(d) _Cooperation on Tax Matters_. PAS, Holding Company, Shareholders and
the Acquired Companies shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent
reasonably requested by the other parties, in connection with the filing of
Tax Returns pursuant to this Section 9.5 and any audit, litigation, or
other proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation shall include the
retention and (upon another partys request) the provision of records and
information that are reasonably relevant to any such audit, litigation, or
other proceeding and making employees available on a mutually convenient
basis to provide additional information and explanation of any material
provided hereunder.  Shareholders, Holding Company and PAS agree to, and
agree to cause the Acquired Companies to (i) retain all books and records
with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Acquired Companies relating to
any Tax period beginning before the Closing Date until

  



  

49   

     
   

  



  

the expiration of the statute of limitations (and, to the extent notified by
PAS or Holding Company, any extensions thereof) of the respective Tax
periods, and to abide by all record retention agreements entered into with
any Tax authority, and (ii) give the other parties reasonable written notice
prior to transferring, destroying, or discarding any such books and records.
PAS, Shareholders and Holding Company further agree, upon request, to use
their best efforts to obtain any certificate or other document from any
Governmental Authority or any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate,
reduce, or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed (including, but not
limited to, with respect to the transactions contemplated under this
Agreement).

  



  

(e) _Transfer Taxes_. All transfer, documentary, sales, use,
stamp, registration and other such Taxes and fees (including any penalties
and interest thereon) incurred in connection with or as result of this
Agreement shall be paid by Holding Company when due, and Holding Company
shall, at its own expense, file all necessary Tax Returns and other
documentation required to be filed by Holding Company with respect to all
such transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other Taxes
and fees, and if required by applicable law, PAS shall, and shall cause its
affiliates to join in the execution of any such Tax Returns and other
documentation.

  



  

(f) _Closing after December 31, 2004_. If the Contemplated Transactions do
not close on or prior to December 31, 2004 for reasons other than delays
caused by Shareholders, Holding Company, Central Investment LLC, the Acquired
Companies, or any Representatives of the foregoing, PAS will indemnify
Holding Company and Shareholders for any additional federal income tax
liability attributable to the Sale of the Shares pursuant to this
Agreement suffered solely as a result of changes in the tax laws (including
rates of taxation) effective after December 31, 2004 and that differ from the
tax laws effective for tax years ending on or during the calendar year ending
December 31, 2004 by grossing up the Purchase Price to reflect such
additional tax cost.

  



  

(g) _338 Election_. PAS shall not make and shall not cause or permit CIC to
make an election under IRC Section 338 with respect to the Contemplated
Transactions.

  



  

9.6 _Cafeteria Plan_.  For purposes of Section 5.10(a), the established CIC
Section 125 Cafeteria Plan shall not be considered to be a Company Plan the
sponsorship of which is to be transferred to Central Investment LLC; and CIC
shall continue to maintain, administer and control that Section 125 Cafeteria
Plan with medical spending and dependent care spending account components
for, and its responsibilities to, all participants, including the accounts
held thereunder for Non-Core Employees; provided, however, that no amounts
shall be credited to that Plan after December 31, 2004 with respect to Non-
Core Employees. The Closing Date balance in the Section 125 Cafeteria Plan
(i.e., the amount by which year to date contributions credited to employee
accounts in the Section 125 Cafeteria Plan exceed year to date benefits paid
out of the Section 125 Cafeteria Plan) shall be considered a current
liability for purposes of the Working Capital adjustment described in
Sections 2.5 and 2.6 herein.

  



  

9.7 _Compliance with OSHA_ _Standard for Carbon Dioxide._ Prior to the
Closing, CIC will take all steps and pay all costs necessary to bring the
facility at 7305 Garden Road, Riviera Beach, Florida into compliance with the
OSHA standard for carbon dioxide emissions ("CO2

  



  

50   

     
   

  



  

Standard") from site operations existing prior to Closing. If CIC cannot
bring the operations into compliance with the CO2 Standard by the Closing,
PAS will take all commercially reasonable steps necessary to bring the
facility into compliance and Holding Company shall pay all costs reasonably
incurred by PAS to do so. PAS shall consult with Holding Company prior to
making any such expenditures and permit Holding Company to comment on PASs
plans. Prior to Closing, CIC shall pay directly and, after the Closing,
Holding Company shall pay directly: all fines and penalties assessed by OSHA
or any other Government Body for non-compliance with the CO2 Standard until
compliance is achieved with respect to site operations existing prior to
Closing. If, after the Closing, CIC or PAS alters the operations existing
prior to Closing, thereby resulting in increased carbon dioxide emissions,
the obligations of Holding Company under this Section 9.7(a) shall terminate.
The Parties recognize that the "costs" referenced herein may include the
reasonable costs of environmental consultants, testing and capital
expenditures.

  



  

 **ARTICLE 10 
  
 TERMINATION PRIOR TO CLOSING**

  

 ** **

  

10.1 _Termination Events_. This Agreement may, by notice given prior to or at
the Closing, be terminated:

  



  

(a) by either PAS or CIC if a material Breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement of this Agreement has been committed by PAS
(in the case of a termination by CIC) or by CIC, Shareholders, Holding
Company or Central Investment LLC (in the case of a termination by PAS) and
such Breach has not been waived;

  



  

(b) (i) by PAS if any of the conditions in Article 7 have not been satisfied
as of the Closing Date or if satisfaction of such a condition is or becomes
impossible (other than through the failure of PAS to comply with its
obligations under this Agreement) and PAS has not waived such condition on or
before the Closing Date; or (ii) by CIC, if any of the conditions in Article
8 have not been satisfied as of the Closing Date or if satisfaction of such a
condition is or becomes impossible (other than through the failure of
Shareholders, CIC, Holding Company or Central Investment, LLC,  to comply
with any of their obligations under this Agreement) and Shareholders, CIC and
Holding Company have not waived such condition on or before the Closing Date;

  



  

(c) by mutual consent of PAS and CIC; or

  



  

(d) by either PAS or CIC if the Closing has not occurred (other than through
the failure of any party seeking to terminate this Agreement to comply fully
with its obligations under this Agreement) on or before March 31, 2005, or
such later date as the parties may agree upon.

  



  

10.2 _Effect of Termination_. Each partys right of termination under Section
10.1 is in addition to any other rights it may have under this Agreement
or otherwise, and the exercise of a right of termination will not be an
election of remedies. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant

  



  

51   

     
   

  



  

to Section 10.1, all further obligations of the parties under this Agreement
will terminate, except that the obligations in Sections 12.1 and 12.3 will
survive; provided, however, that if this Agreement is terminated by a party
because of the material Breach of the Agreement by the other party or because
one or more of the conditions to the terminating partys obligations under
this Agreement is not satisfied as a result of the other partys failure to
comply with its obligations under this Agreement, the terminating partys
right to pursue all legal remedies will survive such termination unimpaired.
In furtherance of the preceding sentence, in the event that PAS terminates
this Agreement under Section 10.1(a) because of a material Breach of this
Agreement by any of CIC, Shareholders, Holding Company or Central Investment
LLC, then CIC agrees to indemnify and hold harmless PAS from and will pay PAS
for any Damages arising, directly or indirectly, from or in connection with
such Breach; provided however, PAS agrees to hold CIC solely responsible for
such Breach and shall not, absent fraud or a claim involving equitable
remedies, seek to recover from Shareholders, Holding Company or Central
Investment LLC. In furtherance of the second preceding sentence, in the
event that CIC terminates this Agreement under Section 10.1(a) because of a
material Breach of this Agreement by PAS, then PAS agrees to indemnify and
hold harmless CIC, Shareholders, Holding Company and Central Investment LLC
from and will pay all of such parties for any Damages arising, directly or
indirectly, from or in connection with such Breach, without duplication of
any Damages among such parties.

terminate effective as of the Closing except for the following: (a)
representations and warranties contained in Section 3.11 ("Taxes"), Section
3.13 ("Employee Benefits"), and Section 3.21 ("Labor Relations; Compliance")
shall each survive the Closing, for one month past the applicable period of
limitations within which a third party could assert a claim against the
Acquired Companies that would, if established, create a liability or
obligation that would cause the representation or warranty contained in said
Section to be incorrect; (b) the representations and warranties contained in
Section 3.19 ("Environmental Matters") shall survive for seven years
following the Closing Date; and (c) the representations and warranties
contained in Section 3.1 ("Organization and Good Standing"), Section 3.2

be affected by any investigation of the subject matter thereof made by or on
behalf of any party or its Representatives.  The covenants of the parties
herein shall survive the Closing indefinitely. All statements contained herein
or in any certificate or schedule delivered in connection with the
Contemplated Transactions shall be deemed representations and warranties of
the respective parties making them.

  



  

11.2 _Indemnification and Payment of_ _Damages by Holding Company_. Subject
to Sections 11.4, 11.7 and 11.8 below, Holding Company will indemnify

provided, however, Holding Companys obligations under this paragraph with
respect to representations and warranties contained in Sections 3.13

Matters") shall only apply to Breaches of which the Acquired Companies had

(b) subject to the last sentence of Section 5.7, any Breach by any

53   

     
   

  



  

indirectly, by any of the Acquired Companies, their Related Persons or

before the Closing Date; provided however, Holding Company shall not have any

notice of which is first received after the seven (7) year anniversary date
of this Agreement;

  



  

(i) any Environmental, Health, and Safety Liabilities (including all pending
or Threatened claims relating thereto) arising, emanating or originating from

54   

     
   

  



  

11.4 _Basket_. Holding Company will have no obligation for indemnification
with respect to the matters described in Section 11.2(a) above until the
total of all Damages with respect to such matters exceeds $250,000 (the
"Basket") and then only for the amount by which such Damages exceed the
Basket.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Damages relating to Breaches
of Sections 3.13 ("Employee Benefits"), 3.19 ("Environmental Matters"),
and 3.21 ("Labor Relations") shall not be subject to such Basket.

  



  

11.5 _Procedure for_ _Indemnification Third Party Claims_.

  



  

(a) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under Sections 11.2 or
11.3 of notice of the commencement of any Proceeding against it, such
indemnified party will, if a claim is to be made against an indemnifying
party under such Section, give notice to the indemnifying party of the
commencement of such claim, but the failure to notify the indemnifying party
will not relieve the indemnifying party of any liability that it may have to
any indemnified party, except to the extent that the indemnifying party
demonstrates that the defense of such action is prejudiced by the indemnified
partys failure to give such notice. Holding Company shall be deemed to
have received notice under Section 11.2 of all Proceedings and matters
referred to in Part 3.15 of the Disclosure Schedule.

  



  

(b) If any Proceeding referred to in Sections 11.2 or 11.3 is brought against
an indemnified party and it gives notice to the indemnifying party of the
commencement of such Proceeding, the indemnifying party will, unless the
claim involves Taxes, be entitled to participate in such Proceeding and, to
the extent that it wishes (unless (i) the indemnifying party is also a party
to such Proceeding and the indemnified party determines in good faith that
joint representation would be inappropriate, or (ii) the indemnifying party
fails to provide reasonable assurance to the indemnified party of its
financial capacity to defend such Proceeding and provide indemnification with
respect to such Proceeding), to assume the defense of such Proceeding with
counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party and, after notice from the
indemnifying party to the indemnified party of its election to assume the
defense of such Proceeding, the indemnifying party will not, as long as it
diligently conducts such defense, be liable to the indemnified party under
this Section 11 for any fees of other counsel or any other expenses with
respect to the defense of such Proceeding, in each case subsequently incurred
by the indemnified party in connection with the defense of such Proceeding,
other than reasonable costs of investigation. If the indemnifying party
assumes the defense of a Proceeding, (i) no compromise or settlement of such
claims may be effected by the indemnifying party without the indemnified
partys consent unless (A) there is no finding or admission of any violation
of Legal Requirements or any violation of the rights of any Person and no
effect on any other claims that may be made against the indemnified party,
and (B) the sole relief provided is monetary damages that are paid in full by
the indemnifying party (subject to the limitations on indemnification set
forth herein); and (ii) the indemnified party will have no liability with
respect to any compromise or settlement of such claims effected without its
consent. If notice is given to an indemnifying party of the commencement of
any Proceeding and the indemnifying party does not, within ten days after the
indemnified partys notice is given, give notice to the indemnified party of
its election to assume the defense of such Proceeding, the

  



  

55   

     
   

  



  

indemnifying party will be bound by any determination made in such Proceeding
or any compromise or settlement effected by the indemnified party.

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an indemnified party determines in good
faith that there is a reasonable probability that a Proceeding may adversely
affect it or its affiliates other than as a result of monetary damages for
which it would be entitled to indemnification under this Agreement, the
indemnified party may, by notice to the indemnifying party, assume the
exclusive right to defend, compromise, or settle such Proceeding, but the
indemnifying party will not be bound by any determination of a Proceeding so
defended or any compromise or settlement effected without its consent (which
may not be unreasonably withheld).

  



  

11.6 _Procedure for Indemnification_ _ Other Claims_. A claim for
indemnification for any matter not involving a third-party claim may be
asserted by notice to the party from whom indemnification is sought.

  



  

11.7 _Insurance_. The indemnification obligations under this Agreement of an
indemnifying party shall be adjusted so as to give effect to any amount
actually and irrevocably recovered by the indemnified party under then
applicable existing policies of insurance that provide coverage
to indemnified party against such claims.  An Indemnified Party shall not be
obligated to seek recovery for Damages from insurance before seeking
indemnification under this Agreement. To the extent that an Indemnified
Party recovers from insurance amounts for which it has recovered pursuant to
this Article 11, the amount of such recovery shall be paid over to the
Indemnifying Party

  



  

11.8 _No Indemnification_. Notwithstanding any language contained herein to
the contrary, Holding Company shall not be required to indemnify PAS or
the Acquired Companies (i) for the Deferred Tax Liability, (ii) to
the extent PAS was compensated in the Final Working Capital Adjustment for
the matter which would otherwise give rise to such indemnification
obligation, (iii) as provided in Section 9.7, or (iv) costs necessary to
bring the facility at 7305 Garden Road, Riviera Beach, Florida into
compliance with the current terms of the industrial discharge permit (and the
permit for the period beginning on January 1, 2005) issued by the City of
West Palm Beach.

  



  

11.9 _Exclusive_ _Remedy_. Absent fraud and subject to the right of
each party to seek specific performance and injunction to enforce the terms
of any covenant in Article 9, the enforcement of the agreements of
indemnification contained in this Article 11 shall be, after the Closing
Date, the exclusive remedy of the parties hereto for any claims with respect
to matters covered in Sections 11.2 or 11.3 hereof; whether sounding in tort,
contract or otherwise, and the parties hereto waive all remedies otherwise
available to such parties save only remedies which by law may not be waived.

  



  

56   

     
   

  



  

 **ARTICLE 12 
  
 GENERAL PROVISIONS**

  

 ** **

  

12.1 _Expenses_.  Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement,
each party to this Agreement will bear its respective expenses incurred in
connection with the preparation, execution, and performance of this Agreement
and the Contemplated Transactions, including all fees and expenses of
agents, representatives, counsel, and accountants.  PAS will initially pay
the entire HSR Act filing fee relating to the sale of the Shares by Holding
Company to PAS.  Three business days thereafter, CIC shall reimburse PAS for
50% of such filing fee. In the event of termination of this Agreement, the
obligation of each party to pay its own expenses will be subject to any
rights of such party arising from a Breach of this Agreement by another
party.

  



  

12.2 _Public Announcements_. PAS shall obtain the prior consent of
Holding Company, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, before
making any public announcement or similar publicity with respect to this
Agreement or the Contemplated Transactions that is not required by a Legal
Requirement to be issued. If required by a Legal Requirement to be issued, a
public announcement or similar publicity with respect to this Agreement or
the Contemplated Transactions will be issued, at such time and in such manner
as PAS determines, provided that PAS will use reasonable efforts to consult
with Holding Company and obtain the comments of Holding Company prior to such
issuance.  Unless consented (which consent shall not be withheld
unreasonably) to by PAS in advance or required by Legal Requirements, prior
to the Closing, Shareholders, CIC, Holding Company, and Central Investment
LLC shall, and shall cause the Acquired Companies to, keep this Agreement
strictly confidential and may not make any disclosure of this Agreement to
any Person other than their own Representatives, CIC, Holding Company and PAS
will consult with each other concerning the means by which the Acquired
Companies employees, customers, and suppliers and others having dealings
with the Acquired Companies will be informed of the Contemplated
Transactions, and PAS will have the right to be present for any such
communication.

  



  

12.3 _Confidentiality_. Between the date of this Agreement and the Closing
Date (and with respect to any information relating to
Shareholders personally, thereafter), PAS, Acquired Companies and
Shareholders will maintain in confidence, and will cause the directors,
officers, employees, agents, and advisors of PAS and the Acquired Companies
to maintain in confidence, and not use to the detriment of another party or
an Acquired Company any written, oral, or other information obtained in
confidence from another party or an Acquired Company in connection with this
Agreement or the Contemplated Transactions, unless (a) such information is
already known to such party or to others not bound by a duty of
confidentiality or such information becomes publicly available through no
fault of such party, (b) the use of such information is necessary or
appropriate in making any filing or obtaining any consent or
approval required for the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions, or
(c) the furnishing or use of such information is required by or necessary
or appropriate in connection with legal proceedings. The parties understand
that PAS is a publicly traded company and that the Shareholders and each
person to whom the Contemplated Transaction is disclosed (which shall only be
on a "need to know basis") may be privy to material, non-public information.
CIC (and all its employees and directors who are aware of the Contemplated
Transaction) and Shareholders have each been advised and are otherwise aware
that applicable securities laws prohibit any person or entity who has
received material, non-public information from purchasing or selling
securities of PAS or from communicating such information to any person under
circumstances in which it is reasonably foreseeable that such person is
likely to purchase or sell securities of PAS. Accordingly, CIC and
Shareholders understand and shall apprise those to whom they disclose the

  



  

57   

     
   

  



  

Contemplated Transactions of the need for confidentiality and the potential
consequences of trading in the securities of PAS.

  



  

12.4 _Notices_. All notices, consents, waivers, and other communications
under this Agreement must be in writing and will be deemed to have been duly
given when (a) delivered by hand (with written confirmation of receipt), (b)
sent by telecopier (with written confirmation of receipt) or email, provided
that a copy is immediately mailed by registered mail, return receipt
requested, or (c) when received by the addressee, if sent by a nationally
recognized overnight delivery service (receipt requested), in each case to

other addresses and telecopier numbers as a party may designate by notice to

in the courts of the State of Ohio, County of Hamilton or, if it has or can
acquire jurisdiction, in the United States District Court for the Southern
District of

  



  

58   

     
   

  



  

Ohio, Western Division, at Cincinnati, Ohio, and each of the parties consents
to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts (and of the appropriate
appellate courts) in any such action or proceeding and waives any objection
to venue laid therein. Process in any action or proceeding referred to in the
preceding sentence may be served on any party anywhere in the world.

  



  

12.6 _Further Assurances_. The parties agree (a) to furnish upon request to
each other such further information, (b) to execute and deliver to each other
such other documents, and (c) to do such other acts and things, all as the
other party may reasonably request for the purpose of carrying out the intent
of this Agreement and the documents referred to in this Agreement.

  



  

12.7 _Waiver_. The rights and remedies of the parties to this Agreement are
cumulative and not alternative. Neither the failure nor any delay by any
party in exercising any right, power, or privilege under this Agreement or
the documents referred to in this Agreement will operate as a waiver of such
right, power, or privilege, and no single or partial exercise of any such
right, power, or privilege will preclude any other or further exercise of
such right, power, or privilege or the exercise of any other right, power, or
privilege. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, (a) no claim or
right arising out of this Agreement or the documents referred to in this
Agreement can be discharged by one party, in whole or in part, by a waiver or
renunciation of the claim or right unless in writing signed by the other
party; (b) no waiver that may be given by a party will be applicable except
in the specific instance for which it is given; and (c) no notice to or
demand on one party will be deemed to be a waiver of any obligation of such
party or of the right of the party giving such notice or demand to take
further action without notice or demand as provided in this Agreement or the
documents referred to in this Agreement.

  



  

12.8 _Entire Agreement and Modification_. Except for the terms and conditions
contained in the Confidentiality Agreement between CIC and PAS dated April
26, 2004, and the Site Access Agreement, this Agreement supersedes all prior
agreements between the parties with respect to its subject matter (including
the Letter of Intent between PAS and Shareholders dated October 26, 2004)
and constitutes (along with the documents referred to in this Agreement) a
complete and exclusive statement of the terms of the agreement between the
parties with respect to its subject matter. This Agreement may not be
amended except by a written agreement executed by the party to be charged
with the amendment.

  



  

12.9 _Disclosure Schedule_.

  



  

(a) The disclosures in each Part of the Disclosure Schedule, and those in any
Supplement thereto, relate only to the representations and warranties in the
Section of the Agreement to which they expressly reference and not to any
other representation or warranty in this Agreement; provided however, that
such disclosures shall be deemed to have been disclosed for purposes of other
representations and warranties if such disclosure clearly puts PAS on notice
of a condition or fact that reasonably relates to such other representation
or warranty.

  



  

(b) In the event of any inconsistency between the statements in the body of
this Agreement and those in the Disclosure Schedule (other than an exception
expressly set forth as such in the Disclosure Schedule with respect to a
specifically identified representation or warranty), the statements in the
body of this Agreement will control.

  



  

59   

     
   

  



  

12.10 _Assignment_ _s, Successors, and No Third Party Rights_. Neither party
may assign any of its rights under this Agreement without the prior consent
of the other parties, except that PAS may assign any of its rights and
obligations under this Agreement to any wholly owned Subsidiary of PAS,
provided, however, such assignment will not relieve PAS of its obligations
under this Agreement. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will
apply to, be binding in all respects upon, and inure to the benefit of the
successors and permitted assigns of the parties. Nothing expressed or referred
to in this Agreement will be construed to give any Person other than the
parties to this Agreement any legal or equitable right, remedy, or claim
under or with respect to this Agreement or any provision of this Agreement.
This Agreement and all of its provisions and conditions are for the sole and
exclusive benefit of the parties to this Agreement and their successors and
assigns.

  



  

12.11 _Severability_.  If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid or
unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction, the other provisions of
this Agreement will remain in full force and effect. Any provision of this
Agreement held invalid or unenforceable only in part or degree will remain in
full force and effect to the extent not held invalid or unenforceable.

  



  

12.12 _Section Headings_ _, Construction_. The headings of Sections in this
Agreement are provided for convenience only and will not affect its
construction or interpretation. All references to "Section" or "Sections"
refer to the corresponding Section or Sections of this Agreement. All words
used in this Agreement will be construed to be of such gender or number as
the circumstances require. Unless otherwise expressly provided, the word
"including" does not limit the preceding words or terms and shall be
interpreted the same as the phrase "including without limitation."

  



  

12.13 _Waiver of Certain_ _Rights in Shareholder Agreement_. By signing
this Agreement, Shareholders expressly waive any rights they have under
the Shareholder Agreement by and between Shareholders and CIC, dated October
1, 2002 with respect to the Contemplated Transactions.

  



  

12.14 _Time of_ _Essence_.  With regard to all dates and time periods set
forth or referred to in this Agreement, time is of the essence.

  



  

12.15 _Governing Law_.  This Agreement will be governed by the laws of the
State of Ohio without regard to conflicts of laws principles.

  



  

12.16 _Counterparts_.  This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, each of which will be deemed to be an original copy of this
Agreement and all of which, when taken together, will be deemed to constitute
one and the same agreement.
