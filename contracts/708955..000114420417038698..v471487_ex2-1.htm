Meeting</U>&rdquo; and the &ldquo;<U>MainSource Meeting</U>,&rdquo; respectively) to be held as soon as reasonably practicable
after the S-4 is declared effective for the purpose of obtaining the Requisite MainSource Vote and the Requisite First Financial
Vote required in connection with this Agreement and the Merger and, and, if so desired and mutually agreed, upon other matters
of the type customarily brought before an annual or special meeting of shareholders to adopt a merger agreement, and each shall
use its reasonable best efforts to cause such meetings to occur on the same day and at the same time as soon as reasonably practicable
after the date of this Agreement, and to set the same record date for each such meeting. The Board of Directors of each of First
Financial and MainSource shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain from the shareholders of First Financial and MainSource,
as the case may be, the Requisite First Financial Vote, in the case of First Financial, and the Requisite MainSource Vote, in
the case of MainSource, including by communicating to its respective shareholders its recommendation (and including such recommendation
in the Joint Proxy Statement) that they adopt and approve this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. However, subject
to Section 8.1 and Section 8.2, if the Board of Directors of MainSource or First Financial, after receiving the advice of its
outside counsel and, with respect to financial matters, its financial advisors, determines in good faith that it would be reasonably
likely to result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable law to continue to recommend this Agreement, then in
submitting this Agreement to its shareholders, such Board of Directors may (but shall not be required to) submit this Agreement
to its shareholders without recommendation (although the resolutions approving this Agreement as of the date hereof may not be
rescinded or amended), in which event the Board of Directors may communicate the basis for its lack of a recommendation to its
shareholders in the Joint Proxy Statement or an appropriate amendment or supplement thereto to the extent required by law; <U>provided</U>,
that the Board of Directors may not take any actions under this sentence unless (i) it gives the other party at least seven (7)
calendar days&rsquo; prior written notice of its intention to take such action and a reasonable description of the event or circumstances
giving rise to its determination to take such action (including, in the event such action is taken by the Board of Directors of
MainSource in response to an Acquisition Proposal, the latest material terms and conditions of, and the identity of the third
party making, any such Acquisition Proposal, or any amendment or modification thereof, and a copy thereof if in writing and any
related documentation or correspondence) and (ii) at the end of such notice period, the Board of Directors takes into account
any amendment or modification to this Agreement proposed by the other party and after receiving the advice of its outside counsel
and, with respect to financial matters, its financial advisors, determines in good faith that it would nevertheless be reasonably
likely to result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable law to continue to recommend this Agreement. Any material
amendment to any Acquisition Proposal will be deemed to be a new Acquisition Proposal for purposes of this Section 6.3 and will
require a new notice period as referred to in this Section 6.3. First Financial or MainSource shall adjourn or postpone the First
Financial Meeting or the MainSource Meeting, as the case may be, if, as of the time for which such meeting is originally scheduled
there are insufficient shares of First Financial Common Stock or MainSource Common Stock, as the case may be, represented (either
in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of such meeting, or if on the date of such meeting
MainSource or First Financial, as applicable, has not received proxies representing a sufficient number of shares necessary to
obtain the Requisite MainSource Vote or the Requisite First Financial Vote. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, unless
this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms, each of the First Financial Meeting and MainSource Meeting shall
be convened and this Agreement shall be submitted to the shareholders of each of First Financial and MainSource at the First Financial
Meeting and the MainSource Meeting, respectively, for the purpose of voting on the adoption of this Agreement and the other matters
contemplated hereby, and nothing contained herein shall be deemed to relieve either First Financial or MainSource of such obligation.</P>
