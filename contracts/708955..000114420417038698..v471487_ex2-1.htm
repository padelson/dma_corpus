AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

  



  

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of July 25, 2017 (this " _Agreement_
"), by and between MainSource Financial Group, Inc., an Indiana
corporation (" _MainSource_ "), and First Financial Bancorp, an Ohio
corporation (" _First Financial_ ").

  



  

WITNESSETH:

  



  

WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of First Financial and MainSource have
determined that it is in the best interests of their respective companies
and their shareholders to consummate the strategic business combination
transaction provided for herein, pursuant to which MainSource will, subject
to the terms and conditions set forth herein, merge with and into First
Financial (the " _Merger_ "), so that First Financial is the surviving
corporation (hereinafter sometimes referred to in such capacity as the "
_Surviving Corporation_ ") in the Merger; and

  



  

WHEREAS, for Federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the Merger
shall qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), and this
Agreement is intended to be and is adopted as a plan of reorganization for
purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of the Code; and

  



  

WHEREAS, as an inducement for each party to enter into this Agreement, the
directors of First Financial and the directors of MainSource, in their
capacity as shareholders, have simultaneously herewith entered into a voting
agreement (collectively, the " _Voting Agreements_ ") in connection with the
Merger, substantially in the forms attached hereto as Exhibit A; and

  



  

WHEREAS, the parties desire to make certain representations, warranties and
agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe certain
conditions to the Merger.

  



  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants, representations,
warranties and agreements contained herein, and intending to be legally bound
hereby, the parties agree as follows:

  



  

ARTICLE I 
 THE MERGER

  



  

1.1 _The Merger_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, in accordance with the Indiana Business Corporation Law (the "
_IBCL_ ") and the Ohio General Corporation Law (the " _OGCL_ "), at the
Effective Time, MainSource shall merge with and into First Financial. First
Financial shall be the Surviving Corporation in the Merger, and shall
continue its corporate existence under the laws of the State of Ohio. Upon
consummation of the Merger, the separate corporate existence of MainSource
shall terminate.

  



    

 | 1| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

1.2 _Effective Time_. The Merger shall become effective as set
forth in the articles of merger to be filed with the Secretary of State of
the State of Indiana (the " _Indiana Secretary_ ") and the certificate of
merger to be filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Ohio (the "
_Ohio Secretary_ "), respectively, on the Closing Date (collectively, the "
_Certificates of Merger_ "). The term " _Effective Time_ " shall be the date
and time when the Merger becomes effective, as set forth in the Certificates
of Merger.

  



  

1.3 _Effects of the Merger_. At and after the Effective Time, the
Merger shall have the effects set forth in the applicable provisions of the
IBCL and the OGCL.

  



  

1.4 _Conversion of MainSource Common Stock_.

  



  

(a) Subject to Section 2.2(e), each share of the common stock, no par
value per share, of MainSource issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time (" _MainSource Common Stock_ "), except for shares of
MainSource Common Stock owned by MainSource as treasury stock or owned by
MainSource or First Financial or a Subsidiary of either (in each case other
than in a fiduciary or agency capacity or as a result of debts
previously contracted), shall be converted into the right to receive 1.3875
shares (the " _Exchange Ratio_ " and such shares, the " _Merger
Consideration_ ") of the common shares, no par value per share, of First
Financial (the " _First Financial Common Stock_ "); it being understood that
upon the Effective Time, the First Financial Common Stock, including the
shares issued to former holders of MainSource Common Stock, shall be the
common shares of the Surviving Corporation.

  



  

(b) All of the shares of MainSource Common Stock converted into the
right to receive First Financial Common Stock pursuant to this Article I
shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall
cease to exist as of the Effective Time, and each certificate (each, a "
_Certificate_ ", it being understood that any reference herein to "
_Certificate_ " shall be deemed to include reference to book-entry account
statements relating to the ownership of shares of MainSource Common Stock)
previously representing any such shares of MainSource Common Stock shall
thereafter represent only the right to receive (i) a certificate representing
the number of whole shares of First Financial Common Stock which such shares
of MainSource Common Stock have been converted into the right to receive,
(ii) cash in lieu of fractional shares which the shares of MainSource
Common Stock represented by such Certificate have been converted into the
right to receive pursuant to this Section 1.4 and Section 2.2(e), without any
interest thereon and (iii) any dividends or distributions which the holder
thereof has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.2. Certificates
previously representing shares of MainSource Common Stock shall be exchanged
for certificates representing whole shares of First Financial Common Stock
(together with any dividends or distributions with respect thereto and cash in
lieu of fractional shares issued in consideration therefor) upon the
surrender of such Certificates in accordance with Section 2.2, without any
interest thereon. If, prior to the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of
First Financial Common Stock or MainSource Common Stock shall have been
increased, decreased, changed into or exchanged for a different number or kind
of shares or securities as a result of a reorganization, recapitalization,
reclassification, stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split, or
other similar change in capitalization, or there shall be any extraordinary
dividend or distribution, an appropriate and proportionate adjustment shall
be made to the Exchange Ratio.

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at
the Effective Time, all shares of MainSource Common Stock that are owned by
MainSource or First Financial (in each case other than in a fiduciary or
agency capacity or as a result of debts previously contracted) shall be
cancelled and shall cease to exist and no stock of First Financial or other
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

  



  

1.5 _First Financial Common Stock_. At and after the Effective
Time, each share of First Financial Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain an issued and outstanding
common share of the Surviving Corporation and shall not be affected by the
Merger.

  



  

1.6 _Treatment of MainSource Equity Awards_.

  



  

(a) At the Effective Time, each option granted by MainSource to
purchase shares of MainSource Common Stock under a MainSource Stock Plan (as
defined below), whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding and
unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time (a " _MainSource Stock
Option_ ") shall without any further action on the part of any holder thereof,
be assumed and converted into an option to purchase from First Financial, on
the same terms and conditions as were applicable under such MainSource Stock
Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, a number of shares of First
Financial Common Stock (rounded down to the nearest whole share) determined
by multiplying (x) the number of shares of MainSource Common Stock subject to
such MainSource Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time by (y)
the Exchange Ratio, at a per share exercise price (rounded up to the nearest
whole cent) equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (i) the per share
exercise price for each share of MainSource Common Stock subject to such
MainSource Stock Option by (ii) the Exchange Ratio (each, as so adjusted, a "
_Converted MainSource Option_ "). All rounding described in this Section
1.6(a) shall be done on an aggregate basis such that a single rounding of
shares and exercise price shall be applied to each Converted MainSource
Option.

  



  

(b) The Converted MainSource Options shall have the same vesting
schedule (including any acceleration of vesting as provided in the
applicable MainSource Stock Plan) as the MainSource Stock Options and
otherwise shall have the same terms and conditions as such MainSource Stock
Options; provided, that First Financial shall convert the MainSource Stock
Options into Converted MainSource Options in a manner consistent with the
requirements of Section 409A of the Code and, in the case of MainSource Stock
Options that are intended to qualify as incentive stock options within the
meaning of Section 422 of the Code, consistent with the requirements of
Section 424 of the Code, as applicable. After such assumption and conversion,
the Converted MainSource Options shall be subject to all of the terms and
conditions of the plan and grant agreements under which the MainSource Stock
Options were originally issued (including any applicable change in control or
other accelerated vesting provisions, and this transaction shall constitute a
change in control for all relevant provisions).

(c) Immediately prior to the Effective Time (but contingent upon the
Closing), each award in respect of a share of MainSource Common Stock
subject to vesting, repurchase or other lapse restriction granted under a
MainSource Stock Plan that is unvested or contingent and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (a " _MainSource
Restricted Stock Award_ ") shall fully vest (with any performance-
based vesting condition applicable to such MainSource Restricted Stock Award
deemed satisfied to the extent provided in the applicable award agreement)
and shall be cancelled and converted automatically into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration in respect of each share of MainSource Common Stock
underlying such MainSource Restricted Stock Award, less applicable tax
withholdings. 

  



  

(d) Immediately prior to the Effective Time (but contingent upon the
Closing), each performance share unit in respect of shares of MainSource
Common Stock granted under a MainSource Stock Plan that is unvested or
contingent and outstanding at such time (a " _MainSource Performance Share
Unit_ " and, together with the MainSource Stock Options and the MainSource
Restricted Stock Awards, the " _MainSource Equity Awards_ ") shall fully vest
(with any performance-based vesting condition applicable to such MainSource
Performance Share Unit deemed satisfied at target) and shall be cancelled and
converted automatically into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in
respect of each share of MainSource Common Stock underlying such MainSource
Performance Share Unit, less applicable tax withholdings.

  



  

(e) First Financial shall take all corporate action necessary to
issue a sufficient number of shares of First Financial Common Stock
with respect to the settlement of MainSource Restricted Stock Awards and
MainSource Performance Share Units contemplated by this Section 1.6. At the
Effective Time, First Financial shall reserve for future issuance a number of
shares of First Financial Common Stock at least equal to the number of shares
of First Financial Common Stock that will be subject to the Converted
MainSource Options as a result of the actions contemplated by Section 1.6(a).
As of or promptly following the Effective Time, First Financial shall file a
post-effective amendment to the Form S-4 or an effective registration
statement on Form S-8 (or other applicable form) with respect to the shares
of First Financial Common Stock subject to the Converted MainSource Options,
shall distribute a prospectus relating to such Form S-8, if applicable, and
First Financial shall use reasonable commercial efforts to maintain the
effectiveness of such registration statement for so long as such Converted
MainSource Options remain outstanding.

Bank (" _MainSource Bank_ "), an Indiana state chartered bank and a wholly-
owned Subsidiary of MainSource, will merge (the " _Bank Merger_ ") with and

ARTICLE II 
 EXCHANGE OF SHARES

  



  

2.1 _First Financial to Make Shares Available_. At or prior to the
Effective Time, First Financial shall deposit, or shall cause to be
deposited, with an exchange agent designated by First Financial and reasonably
acceptable to MainSource (the " _Exchange Agent_ "), for the benefit of the
holders of Certificates, for exchange in accordance with this Article II,
evidence of shares in book entry form (collectively, referred to herein as "
_certificates_ "), representing the shares of First Financial Common Stock,
and cash in lieu of any fractional shares (such cash and certificates for
shares of First Financial Common Stock, together with any dividends or
distributions with respect thereto, being hereinafter referred to as the "
_Exchange Fund_ "), to be issued pursuant to Section 1.4 and paid pursuant to
Section 2.2(a) in exchange for outstanding shares of MainSource Common Stock.

  



  

2.2 _Exchange of Shares_.

  



  

(a) As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, but in no
event later than ten (10) calendar days thereafter, First Financial shall
cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of one or more
Certificates representing shares of MainSource Common Stock at the Effective
Time that have been converted at the Effective Time into the right to receive
First Financial Common Stock pursuant to Article I, a letter of transmittal
(which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the
Certificates to the Exchange Agent) and instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Certificates in exchange for certificates representing the
number of whole shares of First Financial Common Stock and any cash in lieu
of fractional shares which the shares of MainSource Common Stock represented
by such Certificate or Certificates shall have been converted into the right
to receive pursuant to this Agreement as well as any dividends or
distributions to be paid pursuant to Section 2.2(b). Upon proper surrender of
a Certificate or Certificates for exchange and cancellation to the Exchange
Agent, together with such properly completed letter of transmittal, duly
executed, the holder of such Certificate or Certificates shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor, as applicable, (i) a certificate representing
that number of whole shares of First Financial Common Stock to which such
holder of MainSource Common Stock shall have become entitled pursuant to the
provisions of Article I and (ii) a check representing the amount of (A) any
cash in lieu of fractional shares which such holder has the right to receive
in respect of the Certificate or Certificates surrendered pursuant to the
provisions of this Article II and (B) any dividends or distributions which
the holder thereof has the right to receive pursuant to this Section 2.2, and
the Certificate or Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled.
No interest will be paid or accrued on any cash in lieu of fractional shares
payable to holders of Certificates. Until surrendered as contemplated by this
Section 2.2, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective
Time to represent only the right to receive, upon surrender, the number of
whole shares of First Financial Common Stock which the shares of MainSource
Common Stock represented by such Certificate have been converted into the
right to receive and any cash in lieu of fractional shares or in respect of
dividends or distributions as contemplated by this Section 2.2.

  



    

 | 6| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) No dividends or other distributions declared with respect to
First Financial Common Stock shall be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered Certificate until the holder thereof shall surrender such
Certificate in accordance with this Article II. After the surrender of a
Certificate in accordance with this Article II, the record holder thereof
shall be entitled to receive any such dividends or other distributions,
without any interest thereon, which theretofore had become payable with
respect to the whole shares of First Financial Common Stock which the shares
of MainSource Common Stock represented by such Certificate have been converted
into the right to receive.

  



  

(c) If any certificate representing shares of First Financial Common
Stock is to be issued in a name other than that in which the Certificate or
Certificates surrendered in exchange therefor is or are registered, it shall
be a condition of the issuance thereof that the Certificate or Certificates
so surrendered shall be properly endorsed (or accompanied by an appropriate
instrument of transfer) and otherwise in proper form for transfer, and that
the person requesting such exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent in
advance any transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason of the
issuance of a certificate representing shares of First Financial Common Stock
in any name other than that of the registered holder of the Certificate or
Certificates surrendered, or required for any other reason, or shall
establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been
paid or is not payable.

  



  

(d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the
stock transfer books of MainSource of the shares of MainSource Common
Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates representing such shares are
presented for transfer to the Exchange Agent, they shall be cancelled and
exchanged for certificates representing shares of First Financial Common
Stock as provided in this Article II.

  



    

 | 7| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no
certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of First Financial Common
Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates, no
dividend or distribution with respect to First Financial Common Stock shall
be payable on or with respect to any fractional share, and such fractional
share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other
rights of a shareholder of First Financial. In lieu of the issuance of any
such fractional share, First Financial shall pay to each former shareholder
of MainSource who otherwise would be entitled to receive such fractional
share an amount in cash (rounded to the nearest cent) determined by
multiplying (i) the average of the daily closing-sale prices of
First Financial Common Stock on the NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (" _NASDAQ_ ") as
reported by _The Wall Street Journal_  for the twenty (20) consecutive
trading days ending on the day immediately preceding the Closing Date by (ii)
the fraction of a share (rounded to the nearest thousandth when expressed in
decimal form) of First Financial Common Stock which such holder would
otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to Section 1.4.

  



  

(f) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the
shareholders of MainSource for twelve (12) months after the Effective Time
shall be paid to the Surviving Corporation. Any former shareholders of
MainSource who have not theretofore complied with this Article II shall
thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of the shares of
First Financial Common Stock, cash in lieu of any fractional shares and any
unpaid dividends and distributions on the First Financial Common Stock
deliverable in respect of each former share of MainSource Common Stock such
shareholder holds as determined pursuant to this Agreement, in each case,
without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of First
Financial, MainSource, the Surviving Corporation, the Exchange Agent or any
other person shall be liable to any former holder of shares of MainSource
Common Stock for any amount delivered in good faith to a public official
pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.

  



  

(g) First Financial shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or
cause the Exchange Agent to deduct and withhold, from any cash in lieu
of fractional shares of First Financial Common Stock, cash dividends or
distributions payable pursuant to this Section 2.2 or any other cash amounts
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of MainSource
Common Stock such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any provision of
state, local or foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld
by First Financial or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, and paid
over to the appropriate governmental authority, the withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder
of MainSource Common Stock in respect of which the deduction and withholding
was made by First Financial or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be.

  



  

(h) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by First Financial, the posting by such person of a bond in such
amount as First Financial may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate the shares of First Financial Common Stock and any
cash in lieu of fractional shares deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to
this Agreement.

ARTICLE III 
 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF MainSource

  



  

Except (i) as disclosed in the disclosure schedule delivered by MainSource to
First Financial concurrently herewith (the " _MainSource Disclosure Schedule_
"); _provided_ , that (a) no such item is required to be set forth as an
exception to a representation or warranty if its absence would not result in
the related representation or warranty being deemed untrue or incorrect, (b)
the mere inclusion of an item in the MainSource Disclosure Schedule as an
exception to a representation or warranty shall not be deemed an admission by
MainSource that such item represents a material exception or fact, event or
circumstance or that such item is reasonably likely to result in a Material
Adverse Effect and (c) any disclosures made with respect to a section of
Article III shall be deemed to qualify (1) any other section of Article III
specifically referenced or cross-referenced and (2) other sections of Article
III to the extent it is reasonably apparent on its face (notwithstanding the
absence of a specific cross reference) from a reading of the disclosure that
such disclosure applies to such other sections or (ii) as disclosed in any
MainSource Reports filed by MainSource since December 31, 2013, and prior to
the date hereof, including without limitation any information incorporated by
reference into such reports (but disregarding risk factor disclosures
contained under the heading "Risk Factors," or disclosures of risks set forth
in any "forward-looking statements" disclaimer or any other statements that
are similarly non-specific or cautionary, predictive or forward-looking in
nature), MainSource hereby represents and warrants to First Financial as
follows:

  



    

 | 9| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

3.1 _Corporate Organization_.

  



  

(a) MainSource is a corporation duly organized and validly existing
under the laws of the State of Indiana and is a bank holding company
duly registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended ("
_BHC Act_ ") that has elected to be treated as a Financial Holding Company
under the BHC Act. MainSource has all requisite corporate power and authority
to own or lease all of its properties and assets and to carry on its business
as it is now being conducted. MainSource is duly licensed or qualified to do
business and, where such concept is recognized under applicable law, is in
good standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business
conducted by it or the character or location of the properties and assets
owned or leased by it makes such licensing or qualification necessary, except
where the failure to be so licensed or qualified or in good standing would
not, either individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have
a Material Adverse Effect on MainSource. As used in this Agreement, the term
" _Material Adverse Effect_ " means, with respect to First Financial,
MainSource or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, a material
adverse effect on (i) the business, properties, assets, liabilities, results
of operations or financial condition of such party and its Subsidiaries taken
as a whole ( _provided_ , _however_ , that (i), Material Adverse Effect shall
not be deemed to include the impact of (A) changes, after the date hereof, in
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (" _GAAP_ ") or applicable
regulatory accounting requirements, (B) changes, after the date hereof, in
laws, rules or regulations of general applicability to companies in the
industries in which such party and its Subsidiaries operate, or
interpretations thereof by courts or Governmental Entities, (C) changes,
after the date hereof, in global, national or regional political
conditions (including the outbreak of war or acts of terrorism) or in
economic or market conditions affecting the financial services
industry generally and not specifically relating to such party or its
Subsidiaries, including changes in prevailing interest rates, (D) public
disclosure of the transactions contemplated hereby or actions expressly
required by this Agreement or actions or omissions that are taken with the
prior written consent of the other party in contemplation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, (E) the expenses incurred by MainSource or First
Financial in negotiating, documenting, effecting and consummating the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or (F) changes proximately
caused by the impact of the execution or announcement of the Agreement and
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby on relationships with
customers or employees (including the loss of personnel subsequent to the
date of this Agreement); except, with respect to subclauses (A), (B), or (C),
to the extent that the effects of such change are materially
disproportionately adverse to the business, properties, assets, liabilities,
results of operations or financial condition of such party and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as compared to other companies in the industry
in which such party and its Subsidiaries operate) or (ii) the ability of such
party to timely consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. As used in
this Agreement, the word " _Subsidiary_ " when used with respect to any
person, means any corporation, partnership, limited liability company, bank
or other organization, whether incorporated or unincorporated, or person of
which (i) such first person directly or indirectly owns or controls at least
a majority of the securities or other interests having by their terms
ordinary voting power to elect a majority of the board of directors or others
performing similar functions or (ii) such first person is or directly or
indirectly has the power to appoint a general partner, manager or managing
member or others performing similar functions. True and complete copies of
the Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation of MainSource (the "
_MainSource Articles_ ") and the Amended and Restated Bylaws of MainSource
(the " _MainSource Bylaws_ "), as in effect as of the date of this Agreement,
have previously been made available by MainSource to First Financial.

(b) Each Subsidiary of MainSource (a " _MainSource Subsidiary_ ")
(i) is duly organized and validly existing under the laws of its jurisdiction
of organization, (ii) is duly licensed or qualified to do business and, where
such concept is recognized under applicable law, in good standing in each
jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the
character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased by it
makes such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the failure
to be so licensed or qualified or in good standing would not, either
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on MainSource and (iii) has all requisite corporate power and
authority to own or lease its properties and assets and to carry on its
business as now conducted. There are no restrictions on the ability of any
Subsidiary of MainSource to pay dividends or distributions except, in the
case of a Subsidiary that is a regulated entity, for restrictions on
dividends or distributions generally applicable to all such regulated
entities. The deposit accounts of each Subsidiary of MainSource that is an
insured depository institution are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation (the " _FDIC_ ") through the Deposit Insurance Fund to the
fullest extent permitted by law, all premiums and assessments required to be
paid in connection therewith have been paid when due, and no proceedings for
the termination of such insurance are pending or threatened. Section 3.1(b)
of the MainSource Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true and complete list of
all Subsidiaries of MainSource as of the date hereof.

(i) 25,575,354 shares of MainSource Common Stock issued and outstanding, which

other voting securities of MainSource issued, reserved for issuance or

Stock have been duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid,
nonassessable and free of preemptive rights, with no personal liability
attaching to the ownership thereof. There are no bonds, debentures, notes or
other indebtedness that have the right to vote on any matters on which
shareholders of MainSource may vote. Other than the MainSource Trust
Preferred Securities and the MainSource Junior Subordinated Debentures there
are no trust preferred or subordinated debt securities of MainSource that are
issued or outstanding. Other than MainSource Stock Options,
MainSource Performance Share Units, and MainSource Warrants, in each case,
issued prior to the date of this Agreement, as of the date of this Agreement
there are no outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants, puts, calls,
rights, exchangeable or convertible securities or other commitments or
agreements obligating MainSource to issue, transfer, sell, purchase, redeem or
otherwise acquire, any such securities. There are no voting trusts,
shareholder agreements, proxies or other agreements in effect with respect to
the voting or transfer of the MainSource Common Stock or other equity
interests of MainSource, other than the Voting Agreements. Section 3.2(a) of

(F) the expiration date for each such MainSource Equity Award that is a
MainSource Stock Option. Other than the MainSource Equity Awards, no equity-
based awards (including any cash awards where the amount of payment is
determined in whole or in part based on the price of any capital stock of
MainSource or any of its Subsidiaries) are outstanding.

  



    

 | 11| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) MainSource owns, directly or indirectly, all of the issued and
outstanding shares of capital stock or other equity ownership interests
of each of the MainSource Subsidiaries, free and clear of any liens, pledges,
charges, encumbrances and security interests whatsoever (" _Liens_ "), and
all of such shares or equity ownership interests are duly authorized and
validly issued and are fully paid, nonassessable (except, with respect to
bank Subsidiaries, as provided under 12 U.S.C. §55 or any comparable
provision of applicable state law) and free of preemptive rights, with no
personal liability attaching to the ownership thereof. No
MainSource Subsidiary has or is bound by any outstanding subscriptions,
options, warrants, calls, rights, commitments or agreements of any character
calling for the purchase or issuance of any shares of capital stock or any
other equity security of such Subsidiary or any securities representing the
right to purchase or otherwise receive any shares of capital stock or any

Merger have been duly and validly approved by the Board of Directors of
MainSource. The Board of Directors of MainSource has determined that the

duly and validly executed and delivered by MainSource and (assuming due
authorization, execution and delivery by First Financial) constitutes a valid
and binding obligation of MainSource, enforceable against MainSource in

limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, reorganization or similar laws
affecting the rights of creditors generally and the availability of equitable
remedies (the " _Enforceability Exceptions_ ")).

MainSource nor the consummation by MainSource of the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Bank Merger, nor compliance by MainSource
with any of the terms or provisions hereof, will (i) violate any provision of
the MainSource Articles or the MainSource Bylaws or (ii) assuming that the
consents and approvals referred to in Section 3.4 are duly obtained, (x)
violate any statute, code, ordinance, rule, regulation, judgment, order, writ,

the terms, conditions or provisions of any note, bond, mortgage,
indenture, deed of trust, license, lease, agreement or other instrument or

3.6 _Financial Statements_.

  



  

(a) The financial statements of MainSource and its Subsidiaries
included (or incorporated by reference) in the MainSource Reports
(including the related notes, where applicable) (i) have been prepared from,
and are in accordance with, the books and records of MainSource and its
Subsidiaries, (ii) fairly present in all material respects the consolidated
results of operations, cash flows, changes in shareholders' equity and
consolidated financial position of MainSource and its Subsidiaries for the
respective fiscal periods or as of the respective dates therein set forth
(subject in the case of unaudited statements to year-end audit
adjustments normal in nature and amount), (iii) complied, as of their
respective dates of filing with the SEC, in all material respects
with applicable accounting requirements and with the published rules and
regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, and (iv) have been prepared in
accordance with GAAP consistently applied during the periods involved, except,
in each case, as indicated in such statements or in the notes thereto. The
books and records of MainSource and its Subsidiaries have been, and are being,
maintained in all material respects in accordance with GAAP and any other
applicable legal and accounting requirements and reflect only
actual transactions. Crowe Horwath LLP has not resigned (or informed
MainSource that it intends to resign) or been dismissed as independent public
accountants of MainSource as a result of or in connection with any
disagreements with MainSource on a matter of accounting principles or
practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure.

  



  

(b) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have, either
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on
MainSource, neither MainSource nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liability
of any nature whatsoever (whether absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise
and whether due or to become due), except for those liabilities that are
reflected or reserved against on the consolidated balance sheet of MainSource
included in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended
March 31, 2017 (including any notes thereto) and for liabilities incurred in
the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice since March
31, 2017, or in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby.

(c) The records, systems, controls, data and information of
MainSource and its Subsidiaries are recorded, stored, maintained and
operated under means (including any electronic, mechanical or photographic
process, whether computerized or not) that are under the exclusive ownership
and direct control of MainSource or its Subsidiaries or accountants (including
all means of access thereto and therefrom), except for any non-exclusive
ownership and non-direct control that would not reasonably be expected to have
a Material Adverse Effect on MainSource. MainSource (x) has implemented and
maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the " _Exchange Act_ ")) to
ensure that material information relating to MainSource, including its
Subsidiaries, is made known to the chief executive officer and the chief
financial officer of MainSource by others within those entities as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures and to
make the certifications required by the Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the " _Sarbanes-Oxley Act_ "), and (y) has
disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation prior to the date hereof, to
MainSource's outside auditors and the audit committee of MainSource's Board
of Directors (i) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the
design or operation of internal control over financial reporting (as defined
in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) which are reasonably likely to
adversely affect MainSource's ability to record, process, summarize and report
financial information, and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that
involves management or other employees who have a significant role in
MainSource's internal controls over financial reporting. These disclosures
were made in writing by management to MainSource's auditors and audit
committee and a copy has previously been made available to First Financial.
There is no reason to believe that MainSource's outside auditors and its
chief executive officer and chief financial officer will not be able to give
the certifications and attestations required pursuant to the rules and
regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without
qualification, when next due.

  



  

(d) Since January 1, 2014, (i) neither MainSource nor any of its
Subsidiaries, nor, to the knowledge of MainSource, any director,
officer, auditor, accountant or representative of MainSource or any of its
Subsidiaries, has received or otherwise had or obtained knowledge of any
material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim, whether written or oral,
regarding the accounting or auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or
methods (including with respect to loan loss reserves, write-downs, charge-
offs and accruals) of MainSource or any of its Subsidiaries or their
respective internal accounting controls, including any material complaint,
allegation, assertion or claim that MainSource or any of its Subsidiaries has
engaged in questionable accounting or auditing practices, and (ii) no
attorney representing MainSource or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not
employed by MainSource or any of its Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a
material violation of securities laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar
violation by MainSource or any of its officers, directors, employees or
agents to the Board of Directors of MainSource or any committee thereof or to
the knowledge of MainSource, to any director or officer of MainSource.

former directors or executive officers or challenging the validity or
propriety of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

(b) There is no injunction, order, judgment, decree, or regulatory
restriction imposed upon MainSource, any of its Subsidiaries or the assets of
MainSource or any of its Subsidiaries (or that, upon consummation of the

assessment or proposed assessment in connection with any material amount of
Taxes, and there are no threatened in writing or pending disputes, claims,
audits, examinations or other proceedings regarding any material Tax of
MainSource and its Subsidiaries or the assets of MainSource and its
Subsidiaries. MainSource has made available to First Financial true and

ERISA) from a Multiemployer Plan or Multiple Employer Plan.

  



  

(h) Except as set forth in Section 3.11(h) of the MainSource
Disclosure Schedule, neither MainSource nor any of its Subsidiaries

Benefit Plans that could reasonably be expected to result in any material
liability of MainSource or any of its Subsidiaries to the PBGC, the IRS, the

MainSource, any MainSource ERISA Affiliate or other person, including any
fiduciary, has engaged in any "prohibited transaction" (as defined in Section
4975 of the Code or Section 406 of ERISA), which could subject any of the
MainSource Benefit Plans or their related trusts, MainSource, any of its

(l) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will (either alone or in
conjunction with any other event) result in, cause the vesting, exercisability
or delivery of, or increase in the amount or value of, any payment, right or
other benefit to any employee, officer, director or other service provider of

transactions in conjunction with any other event) will be an
"excess parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code.
Neither MainSource nor any of its Subsidiaries maintains or contributes to a

meetings, respectively), contained any untrue statement of a material fact or
omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances in
which they were made, not misleading, except that information filed

be deemed to modify information as of an earlier date. Since December 31,
2014, as of their respective dates, all MainSource Reports filed under the
Securities Act and the Exchange Act complied in all material respects with
the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto. As of the

3.13 _Compliance with Applicable Law_. MainSource and each of its
Subsidiaries hold, and have at all times since December 31, 2014, held, all
licenses, franchises, permits and authorizations necessary for the lawful
conduct of their respective businesses and ownership of their respective
properties, rights and assets under and pursuant to each (and have paid all
fees and assessments due and payable in connection therewith), except where
neither the cost of failure to hold nor the cost of obtaining and holding such
license, franchise, permit or authorization (nor the failure to pay any fees
or assessments) would, either individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on MainSource, and to the knowledge
of MainSource no suspension or cancellation of any such necessary license,

Regulation S-K of the SEC), (iv) which restricts MainSource's ability to
compete or contains a client or customer non-solicit requirement or any other

(b) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have, either
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on First
Financial, neither First Financial nor any of its Subsidiaries has any

otherwise and whether due or to become due), except for those liabilities that
are reflected or reserved against on the consolidated balance sheet of First
Financial included in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter
ended March 31, 2017 (including any notes thereto) and for liabilities
incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice

process, whether computerized or not) that are under the exclusive ownership

(including all means of access thereto and therefrom),except for any non-
exclusive ownership and non-direct control that would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on First Financial. First

decisions regarding required disclosures and to make the certifications
required by the Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act, and (y) has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation prior to the

are reasonably likely to adversely affect First Financial's ability to record,
process, summarize and report financial information, and (ii) any fraud,
whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have
a significant role in First Financial's internal controls over financial
reporting. These disclosures were made in writing by management to First
Financial's auditors and audit committee and a copy has previously been made

consistent with past practice, (ii) which, upon the execution or delivery of
this Agreement, shareholder adoption of this Agreement or the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will (either alone or upon
the occurrence of any additional acts or events) result in any payment
(whether of severance pay or otherwise) becoming due from First Financial,
First Financial, the Surviving Corporation, or any of their respective
Subsidiaries to any officer or employee thereof, (iii) which restricts First
Financial's ability to compete or contains a client or customer non-

expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on First Financial.

policies, its management or its business (each, whether or not set forth in
the First Financial Disclosure Schedule, a " _First Financial
Regulatory Agreement_ "), nor has First Financial or any of its Subsidiaries

administrative, arbitral or other proceedings, claims or actions, or to the
knowledge of First Financial any private environmental investigations or
remediation activities or governmental investigations of any nature seeking
to impose, or that could reasonably be expected to result in the imposition,
on First Financial or any of its Subsidiaries of any liability or obligation
arising under any Environmental Law, pending or threatened against First
Financial, which liability or obligation would reasonably be expected to have,
either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on First
Financial. To the knowledge of First Financial, there is no reasonable basis
for any such proceeding, claim, action or governmental investigation that
would impose any liability or obligation that would reasonably be expected to
have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on
First Financial. First Financial is not subject to any agreement, order,
judgment, decree, letter agreement or memorandum of agreement by or with
any court, governmental authority, regulatory agency or third party imposing

with the SEC, no later than sixty (60) calendar days after of the date of
this Agreement, the Joint Proxy Statement and First Financial shall promptly
prepare and file with the SEC the S-4, in which the Joint Proxy Statement

the S-4 effective for so long as necessary to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and First Financial and MainSource shall
thereafter mail or deliver the Joint Proxy Statement to their respective
shareholders. First Financial shall also use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain all necessary state securities law or "Blue Sky" permits and approvals
required to carry out the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
MainSource shall furnish all information concerning MainSource and the
holders of MainSource Common Stock as may be reasonably requested in
connection with any such action.

  



    

 | 59| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) The parties hereto shall cooperate with each other and use their
reasonable best efforts to promptly (and in the case of the Bank
Regulatory Applications, as defined below, within sixty (60) calendar days of
the date of this Agreement) prepare and file all necessary documentation, to
effect all applications, notices, petitions and filings, to obtain as promptly
as practicable all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all
third parties and Governmental Entities which are necessary or advisable to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including,
without limitation, the Merger and the Bank Merger (collectively the "
_Bank Regulatory Applications_ ")), and to comply with the terms and
conditions of all such permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all
such Governmental Entities. First Financial and MainSource shall have the
right to review in advance, and, to the extent practicable, each will, in
good faith, consult the other on, in each case subject to applicable laws
relating to the exchange of information, all the information relating to
MainSource or First Financial, as the case may be, and any of
their respective Subsidiaries, which appears in any filing made with, or
written materials submitted to, any third party or any Governmental Entity in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In exercising
the foregoing right, each of the parties hereto shall act reasonably,
diligently, and as promptly as practicable. The parties hereto agree that they
will consult with each other with respect to the obtaining of all permits,
consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties and
Governmental Entities necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and each party will keep the other apprised of
the status of matters relating to completion of the transactions contemplated
herein. Each party shall, in good faith, consult with the other in advance of
any meeting or conference with any Governmental Entity in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to the extent permitted by
such Governmental Entity, give the other party and/or its counsel the
opportunity to attend and participate in such meetings and conferences.

  



  

(c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each of
First Financial and MainSource shall use its reasonable best efforts to avoid
the entry of, or to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree,
judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent, that would restrain, prevent or delay the Closing. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, nothing contained herein shall be deemed to require First
Financial or MainSource to take any action, or commit to take any action,
or agree to any condition or restriction, in connection with obtaining the
foregoing permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of Governmental
Entities that would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect
on the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or
MainSource and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after giving effect to the
Merger (a " _Materially Burdensome Regulatory Condition_ ").

(d) First Financial and MainSource shall, upon request, furnish each
other with all information concerning themselves, their
Subsidiaries, directors, officers and shareholders and such other matters as
may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with the Joint Proxy
Statement, the S-4 or any other statement, filing, notice or application made
by or on behalf of First Financial, MainSource or any of their respective
Subsidiaries to any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger, the
Bank Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

(e) To the extent permitted by applicable law, First Financial and
MainSource shall promptly advise each other upon receiving any
communication from any Governmental Entity whose consent or approval is
required for consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement that causes such party to believe that there is a reasonable
likelihood that any Requisite Regulatory Approval will not be obtained or
that the receipt of any such approval will be materially delayed. As used in
this Agreement, the " _Requisite Regulatory Approvals_ " shall mean all
regulatory authorizations, consents, orders or approvals from (x) the Federal
Reserve Board, the ODFI, and the IDFI and (y) any other approvals set forth
in Sections 3.4 and 4.4 which are necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger and the
Bank Merger, or those the failure of which to be obtained would reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect
on the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries.

6.2 _Access to Information_.

  



  

(a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable laws, each of
First Financial and MainSource, for the purposes of verifying the
representations and warranties of the other and preparing for the Merger and
the other matters contemplated by this Agreement, shall, and shall cause each
of their respective Subsidiaries to, afford to the officers, employees,
accountants, counsel, advisors and other representatives of the other party,
access, during normal business hours during the period prior to the Effective
Time, to all its properties, books, contracts, commitments, personnel,
information technology systems, and records, and each shall cooperate with the
other party in preparing to execute after the Effective Time conversion or
consolidation of systems and business operations generally, and, during such
period, each of First Financial and MainSource shall, and shall cause its
respective Subsidiaries to, make available to the other party (i) a copy of
each report, schedule, registration statement and other document filed or
received by it during such period pursuant to the requirements of federal
securities laws or federal or state banking laws (other than reports or
documents which First Financial or MainSource, as the case may be, is not
permitted to disclose under applicable law), and (ii) all other information
concerning its business, properties and personnel as such party may reasonably
request. Neither First Financial nor MainSource nor any of their respective
Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or to disclose information
where such access or disclosure would violate or prejudice the rights of
First Financial's or MainSource's, as the case may be, customers, jeopardize
the attorney-client privilege of the institution in possession or control of
such information (after giving due consideration to the existence of any
common interest, joint defense or similar agreement between the parties) or
contravene any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment, decree, fiduciary duty
or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement. The
parties hereto will make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under
circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply.

  



  

(b) Each of First Financial and MainSource shall hold all
information furnished by or on behalf of the other party or any of such
party's Subsidiaries or representatives pursuant to Section 6.2(a) in
confidence to the extent required by, and in accordance with, the provisions
of the confidentiality agreement, dated May 22, 2017, between First Financial
and MainSource (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ").

  



  

(c) No investigation by either of the parties or their respective
representatives shall affect or be deemed to modify or waive the
representations and warranties of the other set forth herein. Nothing
contained in this Agreement shall give either party, directly or
indirectly, the right to control or direct the operations of the other party
prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, each party shall
exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete
control and supervision over its and its Subsidiaries' respective operations.

  



    

 | 62| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

6.3 _Shareholders ' Approvals_. Each of First Financial and
MainSource shall call a meeting of its shareholders (the " _First
Financial Meeting_ " and the " _MainSource Meeting_ ," respectively) to be
held as soon as reasonably practicable after the S-4 is declared effective
for the purpose of obtaining the Requisite MainSource Vote and the Requisite
First Financial Vote required in connection with this Agreement and the
Merger and, and, if so desired and mutually agreed, upon other matters of the
type customarily brought before an annual or special meeting of shareholders
to adopt a merger agreement, and each shall use its reasonable best efforts
to cause such meetings to occur on the same day and at the same time as soon
as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement, and to set the
same record date for each such meeting. The Board of Directors of each of
First Financial and MainSource shall use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain from the shareholders of First Financial and MainSource, as the case
may be, the Requisite First Financial Vote, in the case of First Financial,
and the Requisite MainSource Vote, in the case of MainSource, including by
communicating to its respective shareholders its recommendation (and including
such recommendation in the Joint Proxy Statement) that they adopt and approve
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. However, subject to
Section 8.1 and Section 8.2, if the Board of Directors of MainSource or First
Financial, after receiving the advice of its outside counsel and, with
respect to financial matters, its financial advisors, determines in good faith
that it would be reasonably likely to result in a violation of its fiduciary
duties under applicable law to continue to recommend this Agreement, then
in submitting this Agreement to its shareholders, such Board of Directors may
(but shall not be required to) submit this Agreement to its shareholders
without recommendation (although the resolutions approving this Agreement as
of the date hereof may not be rescinded or amended), in which event the Board
of Directors may communicate the basis for its lack of a recommendation to
its shareholders in the Joint Proxy Statement or an appropriate amendment or
supplement thereto to the extent required by law; _provided_ , that the Board
of Directors may not take any actions under this sentence unless (i) it gives
the other party at least seven (7) calendar days' prior written notice of its
intention to take such action and a reasonable description of the event or
circumstances giving rise to its determination to take such action
(including, in the event such action is taken by the Board of Directors
of MainSource in response to an Acquisition Proposal, the latest material
terms and conditions of, and the identity of the third party making, any such
Acquisition Proposal, or any amendment or modification thereof, and a copy
thereof if in writing and any related documentation or correspondence) and
(ii) at the end of such notice period, the Board of Directors takes into
account any amendment or modification to this Agreement proposed by the other
party and after receiving the advice of its outside counsel and, with respect
to financial matters, its financial advisors, determines in good faith that it
would nevertheless be reasonably likely to result in a violation of its
fiduciary duties under applicable law to continue to recommend this Agreement.
Any material amendment to any Acquisition Proposal will be deemed to be a new
Acquisition Proposal for purposes of this Section 6.3 and will require a new
notice period as referred to in this Section 6.3. First Financial or
MainSource shall adjourn or postpone the First Financial Meeting or the
MainSource Meeting, as the case may be, if, as of the time for which such
meeting is originally scheduled there are insufficient shares of First
Financial Common Stock or MainSource Common Stock, as the case may be,
represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary
to conduct the business of such meeting, or if on the date of such
meeting MainSource or First Financial, as applicable, has not received
proxies representing a sufficient number of shares necessary to obtain the
Requisite MainSource Vote or the Requisite First Financial Vote.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, unless this Agreement has
been terminated in accordance with its terms, each of the First Financial
Meeting and MainSource Meeting shall be convened and this Agreement shall be
submitted to the shareholders of each of First Financial and MainSource at the
First Financial Meeting and the MainSource Meeting, respectively, for the
purpose of voting on the adoption of this Agreement and the other
matters contemplated hereby, and nothing contained herein shall be deemed to
relieve either First Financial or MainSource of such obligation.

---|---|--- 

 



    



  

6.4 _Legal Conditions to Merger_. Subject in all respects to
Section 6.1 of this Agreement, each of First Financial and MainSource shall,
and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use their reasonable best efforts (a) to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary, proper or advisable to
comply promptly with all legal requirements that may be imposed on such party
or its Subsidiaries with respect to the Merger and the Bank Merger and,
subject to the conditions set forth in Article VII hereof, to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (b) to obtain (and to
cooperate with the other party to obtain) any material consent,
authorization, order or approval of, or any exemption by, any Governmental
Entity and any other third party that is required to be obtained
by MainSource or First Financial or any of their respective Subsidiaries in
connection with the Merger, the Bank Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

6.5 _Stock Exchange Listing_. First Financial shall cause the
shares of First Financial Common Stock to be issued in the Merger to be
approved for listing on NASDAQ, subject to official notice of issuance, prior
to the Effective Time.

  



  

6.6 _Employee Benefit Plans_.

  



  

(a) First Financial shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide
the employees of MainSource and its Subsidiaries who continue to be employed
by First Financial or its Subsidiaries (including, for the avoidance of doubt,
the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries) immediately following the
Effective Time (the " _Continuing Employees_ "), for so long as such employees
are employed, following the Effective Time, with employee benefits that are
substantially comparable in the aggregate to the employee benefits provided
to similarly situated employees of First Financial and its Subsidiaries;
_provided_ that First Financial may satisfy its obligation under Section
6.6(a) by providing such Continuing Employees with employee benefits that are
substantially similar in the aggregate to the employee benefits provided by
MainSource or its Subsidiaries to such Continuing Employees immediately
prior to the Effective Time.

  



    

 | 64| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) Except for employees described in Section 6.6(c), those
employees of MainSource or any Subsidiary as of the Effective Time whom
First Financial or its Subsidiaries elect not to employ after the Effective
Time as a result of the Merger, who are employed and then terminated as a
result of the Merger within six (6) months subsequent to the conversion of the
operating system of MainSource Bank into First Financial Bank (including
through an Involuntary Termination), or those employees who voluntarily resign
employment due to an involuntary relocation of the employee's principal place
of employment to a location which is more than twenty-five (25) miles from
the employee's principal place of employment immediately prior to the
Effective Time (" _Separated Employees_ ") and who would have been considered
eligible for a payment under First Financial's applicable severance plan
shall be entitled to severance benefits equal to two (2) weeks of annual base
pay for each year of service (including years of service with MainSource
and/or any of its Subsidiaries) with a minimum of four (4) weeks of annual
base pay and a maximum of twenty-six (26) weeks of annual base pay. For the
purposes of this subsection, "Involuntary Termination" includes a termination
by an employee whose (1) annual base salary is reduced below the employee's
base salary immediately prior to the Effective Time, or (2) total
compensation opportunity is not at least ninety percent (90%) of his or her
total compensation opportunity immediately prior to the Effective Time.
Effective as of the day immediately following the day which is six (6)
months subsequent to the conversion of the operating system of MainSource
Bank into First Financial Bank, all Continuing Employees will be entitled to
severance benefits equal to those provided by First Financial from time to
time to its employees. Nothing in this Section 6.6(b) shall be deemed to
limit or modify First Financial's at-will employment policy.

  



  

(c) Any MainSource employee who has or is party to any employment
agreement, severance agreement, change in control agreement or any
other agreement or arrangement that provides for any payment that may be
triggered by the Merger or the Bank Merger (the " _CIC Payment_ ") shall not
receive any severance benefits as provided in Section 6.6(b) but will receive
the CIC Payment to the extent it is required to be paid under such agreement,
provided that, on or before the Closing, MainSource will take all
steps necessary to ensure that in the event that the amounts of the CIC
Payment, either individually or in conjunction with a payment or benefit
under any other plan, agreement or arrangement that is aggregated for purposes
of Code Section 280G (in the aggregate, " _Total Payments_ "), would
constitute an "excess parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G
of the Code that is subject to the Tax imposed by Section 4999 of such Code,
then the amounts of the CIC Payment shall be reduced such that the value of
the Total Payments that each counterparty is entitled to receive shall be
$1.00 less than the maximum amount which the counterparty may receive without
becoming subject to the excise tax or resulting in a disallowance of a
deduction of the payment of such amount under Section 280G of the Code. Any
MainSource employee who waives and relinquishes his or her right to a CIC
Payment will be eligible for a severance payment as provided in Section
6.6(b), unless such MainSource employee enters into an employment agreement,
severance agreement, change in control agreement or any written similar
agreement or arrangement with the Surviving Corporation or a Subsidiary of
the Surviving Corporation.

(d) As soon as reasonably practicable, but in no event, later than
the Effective Time, First Financial, after review of the employee
benefit plans offered by First Financial and the MainSource Benefit Plans and
in consultation with MainSource, shall determine which employee benefit plans
the Surviving Corporation shall implement for Continuing Employees as between
the MainSource Benefit Plans and the benefit plans offered to the First
Financial existing employees. If it is determined that the First Financial
plans shall be provided to Continuing Employees (the " _New Plans_ "), then
First Financial and/or any Subsidiaries shall or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to use commercially reasonable efforts to: (i) waive all pre-
existing conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to
participation and coverage requirements applicable to such employees and their
eligible dependents under any New Plans, except to the extent such pre-
existing conditions, exclusions or waiting periods would apply under the
analogous MainSource Benefit Plan, (ii) provide each such employee and their
eligible dependents with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid
prior to the Effective Time under a MainSource Benefit Plan (to the same
extent that such credit was given under the analogous MainSource Benefit Plan
prior to the Effective Time) in satisfying any applicable deductible or out-
of-pocket requirements under any New Plans, and (iii) recognize all service
of such employees with MainSource and its Subsidiaries for all purposes in any
New Plan to the same extent that such service was taken into account under
the analogous MainSource Benefit Plan prior to the Effective Time; _provided_
that the foregoing service recognition shall not apply (A) to the extent it
would result in duplication of benefits for the same period of services, (B)
for purposes of any defined benefit pension plan or benefit plan that provides
retiree welfare benefits, or (C) to any benefit plan that is a frozen plan or
provides grandfathered benefits.

  



  

(e) Notwithstanding any other provisions, the Surviving Corporation
agrees to assume and honor in accordance with their terms all benefits,
including but not limited to, any employment or change in control agreement
or equity award agreement, vested as of the Closing Date under the MainSource
Benefit Plans; provided, First Financial may replace such MainSource Benefit
Plans with a similar benefit plan of First Financial. First Financial hereby
acknowledges that a "change in control" (or similar phrase) within the
meaning of the MainSource Benefit Plans will occur at the Effective Time.
With respect to certain employees who are party to change in control
agreements with MainSource, each of whom is named on Section 6.6(e) of the
MainSource Disclosure Schedules, MainSource shall, prior to the Effective
Time, use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain from each individual a
settlement agreement upon terms mutually agreeable to MainSource, First
Financial and such employee, setting forth the method in which his or her
rights under the change in control agreement will be settled. MainSource
shall make the payments required under such change in control, settlement or
similar agreements.

(f) Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any employee,
officer, director or consultant of MainSource or any of its Subsidiaries or
affiliates any right to continue in the employ or service of the Surviving
Corporation, MainSource, or any Subsidiary or affiliate thereof, or shall
interfere with or restrict in any way the rights of the Surviving Corporation,
MainSource, First Financial or any Subsidiary or affiliate thereof to
discharge or terminate the services of any employee, officer, director or
consultant of MainSource or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates at any time
for any reason whatsoever, with or without cause. Nothing in this Agreement
shall be deemed to (i) establish, amend, or modify any MainSource Benefit
Plan, New Plan or any other benefit or employment plan, program, agreement or
arrangement, or (ii) alter or limit the ability of the Surviving Corporation
or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates to amend, modify or terminate any
particular MainSource Benefit Plan, New Plan or any other benefit or
employment plan, program, agreement or arrangement after the Effective Time.
Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, nothing in this Agreement,
express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any person, including
without limitation any current or former employee, officer, director or
consultant of MainSource or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates, any right,
benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this
Agreement.

  



  

(g) If requested by First Financial in writing at least ninety (90)
calendar days prior to the Effective Time, MainSource shall cause the
MainSource 401(k) Plan to be terminated effective as of the day immediately
prior to the Effective Time and contingent upon the occurrence of the
Closing. In the event First Financial requests that the MainSource 401(k) Plan
be terminated, (i) MainSource shall provide First Financial with evidence
that such plan has been terminated (the form and substance of which shall be
subject to reasonable review and comment by First Financial) not later than
seven (7) calendar days immediately preceding the Effective Time and (ii) the
Continuing Employees of MainSource shall be eligible to participate, effective
as of the Effective Time, in a 401(k) plan sponsored or maintained by First
Financial or one of its Subsidiaries (a " _First Financial 401(k) Plan_
"). First Financial and MainSource shall take any and all actions as may be
required, including amendments to the MainSource 401(k) Plan and/or First
Financial 401(k) Plan, to permit the Continuing Employees of MainSource who
are then actively employed to make rollover contributions to the First
Financial 401(k) Plan of "eligible rollover distributions" (within the
meaning of Section 401(a) (31) of the Code) in the form of cash, notes (in
the case of loans), First Financial Common Stock or a combination thereof in
an amount equal to the full account balance distributed to such Continuing
Employee of MainSource from the MainSource 401(k) Plan.

  



  

(h) As soon as reasonably practicable following the date of this
Agreement, MainSource and First Financial shall cooperate and use
their commercially reasonable efforts to establish an aggregate retention
bonus amount and identify key employees of MainSource or First Financial who
will be offered a retention bonus prior to the Effective Time upon such terms
and conditions as the chief executive officers of First Financial and
MainSource shall mutually agree.

6.7 _Indemnification; Directors ' and Officers' Insurance_.

  



  

(a) From and after the Effective Time, each of First Financial and
the Surviving Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless each present and
former director, officer or employee of MainSource and its Subsidiaries (in
each case, when acting in such capacity) (collectively, the " _MainSource
Indemnified Parties_ ") against any costs or expenses (including reasonable
attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, losses, damages or liabilities incurred
in connection with any threatened or actual claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, whether arising before or after the Effective Time, arising
out of the fact that such person is or was a director, officer or employee of
MainSource or any of its Subsidiaries and pertaining to matters existing or
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, including the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement to the same extent as such persons are
indemnified as of the date of this Agreement by MainSource pursuant to the
MainSource Articles, MainSource Bylaws, the governing or organizational
documents of any Subsidiary of MainSource and any indemnification agreements
in existence as of the date hereof; and First Financial and the Surviving
Corporation shall also advance expenses as incurred by such MainSource
Indemnified Party to the same extent as such persons are entitled to
advancement of expenses as of the date of this Agreement by MainSource
pursuant to the MainSource Articles, MainSource's Bylaws, the governing or
organizational documents of any Subsidiary of MainSource and any
indemnification agreements in existence as of the date hereof; _provided_
, that, if required, the MainSource Indemnified Party to whom expenses are
advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately
determined that such MainSource Indemnified Party is not entitled to
indemnification.

  



  

(b) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall cause to be maintained in effect the
current policies of directors' and officers' liability insurance maintained
by MainSource ( _provided_ , that the Surviving Corporation may substitute
therefor policies with a substantially comparable insurer of at least the same
coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions which are no less
advantageous to the insured) with respect to claims against the present and
former officers and directors of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
arising from facts or events which occurred at or before the Effective Time
(including the transactions contemplated by this Agreement); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Surviving Corporation shall not be obligated to expend,
on an annual basis, an amount in excess of 300% of the current annual premium
paid as of the date hereof by MainSource for such insurance (the " _Premium
Cap_ "), and if such premiums for such insurance would at any time exceed the
Premium Cap, then the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be maintained
policies of insurance which, in the Surviving Corporation's good faith
determination, provide the maximum coverage available at an annual premium
equal to the Premium Cap. In lieu of the foregoing, MainSource, in
consultation with, but only upon the consent of First Financial, may (and at
the request of First Financial, MainSource shall use its reasonable best
efforts to) obtain at or prior to the Effective Time a six-year "tail" policy
under MainSource's existing directors and officers insurance policy providing
equivalent coverage to that described in the preceding sentence if and to the
extent that the same may be obtained for an amount that, in the aggregate,
does not exceed the Premium Cap.

(c) The provisions of this Section 6.7 shall survive the Effective
Time and are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by,
each MainSource Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives. If
the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns will
consolidate with or merge into any other entity and not be the continuing or
surviving entity of such consolidation or merger, transfer all or
substantially all of its assets or deposits to any other entity or engage in
any similar transaction, then in each case, the Surviving Corporation will
cause proper provision to be made so that the successors and assigns of the
Surviving Corporation will expressly assume the obligations set forth in this
Section 6.7.

  



  

6.8 _Additional Agreements_. In case at any time after the
Effective Time any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out
the purposes of this Agreement (including, without limitation, any merger
between a Subsidiary of First Financial, on the one hand, and a Subsidiary of
MainSource, on the other) or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full title
to all properties, assets, rights, approvals, immunities and franchises of
any of the parties to the Merger, the proper officers and directors of each
party to this Agreement and their respective Subsidiaries shall take all such
necessary action as may be reasonably requested by First Financial.

  



  

6.9 _Advice of Changes_. First Financial and MainSource shall each
promptly (but in any event within 24 hours) advise the other party of any
change or event (i) that has had or is reasonably likely to have a Material
Adverse Effect on it or (ii) which it believes would or would be reasonably
likely to cause or constitute a material breach of any of its representations,
warranties or covenants contained herein or that reasonably could be expected
to give rise, individually or in the aggregate, to the failure of a
condition in Article VII; _provided_ , that any failure to give notice in
accordance with the foregoing with respect to any breach shall not be deemed
to constitute a violation of this Section 6.9 or the failure of any condition
set forth in Section 7.2 or 7.3 to be satisfied, or otherwise constitute a
breach of this Agreement by the party failing to give such notice, in each
case unless the underlying breach would independently result in a failure of
the conditions set forth in Section 7.2 or 7.3 to be satisfied.

  



  

6.10 _Dividends_. After the date of this Agreement, each of First
Financial and MainSource shall coordinate with the other the declaration of
any dividends in respect of First Financial Common Stock and MainSource
Common Stock and the record dates and payment dates relating thereto, it
being the intention of the parties hereto that holders of MainSource Common
Stock shall not receive two dividends, or fail to receive one dividend, in
any quarter with respect to their shares of MainSource Common Stock and any
shares of First Financial Common Stock any such holder receives in exchange
therefor in the Merger.

6.12 _Acquisition Proposals_.

  



  

(a) MainSource agrees that it will not, and will cause its
Subsidiaries and its and their officers, directors, agents, advisors and
representatives (collectively, " _Representatives_ ") not to, directly or
indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit, knowingly encourage or knowingly
facilitate inquiries or proposals with respect to, (ii) engage or participate
in any negotiations with any person concerning, or (iii) provide any
confidential or nonpublic information or data to, or have or participate in
any discussions with, any person relating to, any Acquisition Proposal,
except to notify such person of the existence of the provisions of this
Section 6.12(a); _provided_ , that, prior to the adoption of this Agreement
by the shareholders of MainSource by the Requisite MainSource Vote, in the
event MainSource receives an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition
Proposal, it may, and may permit its Subsidiaries and its and its
Subsidiaries' Representatives to, furnish or cause to be furnished nonpublic
information or data and participate in such negotiations or discussions to
the extent that its Board of Directors concludes in good faith (after
receiving the advice of its outside counsel, and with respect to financial
matters, its financial advisors) that failure to take such actions would be
reasonably likely to result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under
applicable law; _provided_ , _further_ , that, prior to providing any
nonpublic information permitted to be provided pursuant to the foregoing
proviso, MainSource shall have entered into a confidentiality agreement with
such third party on terms no less favorable to it than the Confidentiality
Agreement and which is expressly assignable to First Financial, which
confidentiality agreement shall not provide such person with any
exclusive right to negotiate with MainSource. MainSource will, and will cause
its Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated any
activities, discussions or negotiations conducted before the date of this
Agreement with any person other than First Financial with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal. MainSource will promptly (within twenty-four (24) hours)
advise First Financial following receipt of any Acquisition Proposal or any
inquiry which could reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal,
and the substance thereof (including the terms and conditions of and the
identity of the person making such inquiry or Acquisition Proposal and a copy
thereof if in writing and any related documentation or correspondence), and
will keep First Financial apprised of any related developments, discussions
and negotiations on a current basis, including any amendments to or revisions
of the terms of such inquiry or Acquisition Proposal. MainSource shall use
its reasonable best efforts to enforce any existing confidentiality or
standstill agreements to which it or any of its Subsidiaries is a party in
accordance with the terms thereof. As used in this Agreement, " _Acquisition
Proposal_ " shall mean, other than the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, any offer, proposal or inquiry relating to, or any third party
indication of interest in, (i) any acquisition or purchase, direct
or indirect, of 20% or more of the consolidated assets of MainSource and its
Subsidiaries or 20% or more of any class of equity or voting securities of
MainSource or its Subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the aggregate,
constitute more than 20% of the consolidated assets of MainSource, (ii) any
tender offer (including a self-tender offer) or exchange offer that, if
consummated, would result in such third party beneficially owning 20% or more
of any class of equity or voting securities of MainSource or its Subsidiaries
whose assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute more than 20% of
the consolidated assets of MainSource, or (iii) a merger, consolidation,
share exchange, business combination, reorganization, recapitalization,
liquidation, dissolution or other similar transaction involving MainSource or
its Subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the aggregate,
constitute more than 20% of the consolidated assets of MainSource.

  



    

 | 71| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent MainSource or
its board of directors from complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2
under the Exchange Act with respect to an Acquisition Proposal or from making
any legally required disclosure to its shareholders; provided, that such
Rules will in no way eliminate or modify the effect that any action pursuant
to such Rules would otherwise have under this Agreement.

  



  

6.13 _Public Announcements_. MainSource and First Financial shall
each use its reasonable best efforts to develop a joint communications plan,
to ensure that all press releases and other public statements with respect to
the transactions contemplated hereby shall be consistent with such joint
communications plan, and except in respect of any announcement required by
applicable law, or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with or
rules of any securities exchange, to consult with each other before
issuing any press release or, to the extent practical, otherwise making any
public statement with respect to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby.

  



  

6.14 _Change of Method_. MainSource and First Financial shall be
empowered, upon their mutual agreement, at any time prior to the
Effective Time, to change the method or structure of effecting the
combination of MainSource and First Financial (including the provisions of
Article I), if and to the extent they both deem such change to be necessary,
appropriate or desirable; _provided_ , however, that no such change shall (i)
alter or change the Exchange Ratio or the number of shares of First Financial
Common Stock received by MainSource shareholders in exchange for each share
of MainSource Common Stock, (ii) adversely affect the Tax treatment of
MainSource's shareholders or First Financial's shareholders pursuant to this
Agreement, (iii) adversely affect the Tax treatment of MainSource or First
Financial pursuant to this Agreement or (iv) materially impede or delay the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in a timely
manner. The Parties agree to reflect any such change in an appropriate
amendment to this Agreement executed by both parties in accordance with
Section 8.3.

  



  

6.15 _Restructuring Efforts_. If either MainSource or First Financial
shall have failed to obtain the Requisite MainSource Vote or the
Requisite First Financial Vote at the duly convened MainSource Meeting or
First Financial Meeting, as applicable, or any adjournment or postponement
thereof, each of the parties shall in good faith use its reasonable best
efforts to negotiate a restructuring of the transaction provided for herein
(it being understood that neither party shall have any obligation to alter or
change any material terms, including without limitation the amount or kind of
the consideration to be issued to holders of the capital stock of
MainSource as provided for in this Agreement, in a manner adverse to such
party or its shareholders) and/or resubmit this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby (or as restructured pursuant to this Section 6.15) to its
respective shareholders for adoption.

  



    

 | 72| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

6.16 _Takeover Statutes_. None of MainSource, First Financial or
their respective Boards of Directors shall take any action that would cause
any Takeover Statute to become applicable to this Agreement, the Merger, or
any of the other transactions contemplated hereby, and each shall take all
necessary steps to exempt (or ensure the continued exemption of) the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated hereby from any applicable Takeover
Statute now or hereafter in effect. If any Takeover Statute may become, or
may purport to be, applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby, each
party and the members of their respective Boards of Directors will grant such
approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable
on the terms contemplated hereby and thereby and otherwise act to eliminate or
minimize the effects of any Takeover Statute on any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including, if necessary, challenging the
validity or applicability of any such Takeover Statute.

  



  

6.17 _Exemption from Liability Under Section 16(b)_. MainSource and
First Financial agree that, in order to most effectively compensate
and retain MainSource Insiders (as defined below), both prior to and after
the Effective Time, it is desirable that those officers and directors of
MainSource subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the
Exchange Act (the " _MainSource Insiders_ "),not be subject to a risk of
liability under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law in connection with the conversion of shares of
MainSource Common Stock and MainSource Equity Awards in the Merger, and for
that compensatory and retentive purpose agree to the provisions of this
Section 6.17. The Board of Directors of First Financial and of MainSource, or
a committee of non-employee directors thereof (as such term is defined for
purposes of Rule 16b-3(d) under the Exchange Act), shall, prior to the
Effective Time, take all such steps as may be required to cause (in the case
of MainSource) any dispositions of MainSource Common Stock or MainSource
Equity Awards by the MainSource Insiders, and (in the case of
First Financial) any acquisitions of First Financial Common Stock by any
MainSource Insiders who, immediately following the Merger, will be officers
or directors of the Surviving Corporation subject to the reporting
requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act, in each case pursuant to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, to be exempt from liability
pursuant to Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act to the fullest extent permitted
by applicable law.

6.18 _Assumption of MainSource Debt_. First Financial agrees to
execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, by or on
behalf of the Surviving Corporation or First Financial Bank (as the case may
be), at or prior to the Effective Time, one or more supplemental indentures,
guarantees and other instruments required for the due assumption of
MainSource's or MainSource Bank's outstanding debt, guarantees, securities,
and other agreements to the extent required by the terms of such debt,
guarantees, securities and other agreements, including but not limited to the
trust preferred securities (the " _MainSource Trust Preferred Securities_

II, MainSource Statutory Trust III, MainSource Statutory Trust IV, MainSource
Capital Statutory Trust I and FCB Bancorp Statutory Trust I (collectively, the

in the principal amount of $10,400,000 assumed by MainSource (such
obligations, the " _MainSource Junior Subordinated Debentures_ ").

  



  

6.19 _Civic Commitment_. The Surviving Corporation shall contribute
no less than One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) (the " _Greensburg Fund_ ")
over five (5) years to the greater Greensburg, Indiana, community or civic
groups whose primary goal is to assist the greater Greensburg, Indiana
community. The management of the Surviving Corporation shall determine which
organizations shall receive funding, taking into consideration the
organizations historically supported by MainSource in the Decatur County,
Indiana community.

than, in the case of Section 4.2(a), such failures to be true and correct as
are de minimis) in each case as of the date of this Agreement and (except to
the extent such representations and warranties speak as of an earlier date) as
of the Closing Date as though made on and as of the Closing Date, and the
representations and warranties of First Financial set forth in
Sections 4.1(a), 4.1(b), the third to last sentence of 4.2(a), 4.2(b) and
4.3(a) (in each case, after giving effect to the lead in to Article IV) shall
be true and correct in all material respects as of the date of this Agreement
and (except to the extent such representations and warranties speak as of an
earlier date) as of the Closing Date as though made on and as of the Closing
Date. All other representations and warranties of First Financial set forth
in this Agreement (read without giving effect to any qualification as to
materiality or Material Adverse Effect set forth in such representations or
warranties but, in each case, after giving effect to the lead in to Article
IV) shall be true and correct in all respects as of the date of this Agreement
and (except to the extent such representations and warranties speak as of an
earlier date) as of the Closing Date as though made on and as of the Closing
Date, _provided_ ,  _however_ , that for purposes of this sentence, such
representations and warranties shall be deemed to be true and correct unless
the failure or failures of such representations and warranties to be so true
and correct, either individually or in the aggregate, and without giving
effect to any qualification as to materiality or Material Adverse Effect set
forth in such representations or warranties, has had or would reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on First Financial. MainSource
shall have received a certificate signed on behalf of First Financial by the
Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of First Financial to
the foregoing effect.

(b) _Performance of Obligations of First Financial_. First
Financial shall have performed in all material respects the obligations
required to be performed by it under this Agreement at or prior to the
Closing Date, and MainSource shall have received a certificate signed on

Financial Officer of First Financial to such effect.

  



  

(c) _Federal Tax Opinion_. MainSource shall have received the
opinion of SmithAmundsen LLC, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to MainSource, dated as of the Closing Date, to the effect that,
on the basis of facts, representations and assumptions set forth or referred
to in such opinion, the Merger shall qualify as a "reorganization" within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. In rendering such opinion, counsel may
require and rely upon representations contained in certificates of
officers of First Financial and MainSource, reasonably satisfactory in form
and substance to such counsel.

  



  

ARTICLE VIII 
 TERMINATION AND AMENDMENT

  



  

8.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time
prior to the Effective Time, whether before or after adoption of this
Agreement by the shareholders of First Financial or MainSource:

  



  

(a) by mutual consent of First Financial and MainSource in a written
instrument signed by each of MainSource and First Financial, if the Board of
Directors of each so determines by a vote of a majority of the members of its
entire Board;

  



  

(b) by either the Board of Directors of First Financial or the Board
of Directors of MainSource if any Governmental Entity that must grant a
Requisite Regulatory Approval has denied approval of the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated hereby and such denial has become final and
nonappealable or any Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction shall have
issued a final nonappealable order permanently enjoining or otherwise
prohibiting or making illegal the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, unless the failure to obtain a Requisite
Regulatory Approval shall be due to the failure of the party seeking to
terminate this Agreement to perform or observe the covenants and agreements
of such party set forth herein;

  



  

(c) by either the Board of Directors of First Financial or the Board
of Directors of MainSource if the Merger shall not have been consummated on
or before October 31, 2018 (the " _Termination Date_ "), unless the failure of
the Closing to occur by such date shall be due to the failure of the party
seeking to terminate this Agreement to perform or observe the covenants and
agreements of such party set forth herein;

  



    

 | 77| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(d) by either the Board of Directors of First Financial or the Board
of Directors of MainSource ( _provided_ , that the terminating party is not
then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other
agreement contained herein) if there shall have been a breach of any of the
covenants or agreements or any of the representations or warranties (or any
such representation or warranty shall cease to be true) set forth in this
Agreement on the part of MainSource, in the case of a termination by
First Financial, or First Financial, in the case of a termination by
MainSource, which breach or failure to be true, either individually or in the
aggregate with all other breaches by such party (or failures of such
representations or warranties to be true), would constitute, if occurring or
continuing on the Closing Date, the failure of a condition set forth in
Section 7.2, in the case of a termination by First Financial, or 7.3, in the
case of a termination by MainSource, and which is not cured within forty-
five (45) calendar days following written notice to MainSource, in the case
of a termination by First Financial, or First Financial, in the case of a
termination by MainSource, or by its nature or timing cannot be cured during
such period (or such fewer days as remain prior to the Termination Date);

  



  

(e) by First Financial, if the Board of Directors of MainSource
shall have (i) failed to recommend in the Joint Proxy Statement that
the shareholders of MainSource adopt this Agreement, or withdrawn, modified
or qualified such recommendation in a manner adverse to First Financial, or
resolved to do so, or failed to reaffirm such recommendation within three (3)
calendar days after First Financial requests in writing that such action be
taken, or failed to recommend against acceptance of a tender offer or exchange
offer for outstanding MainSource Common Stock that has been publicly
disclosed (other than by First Financial or an affiliate of First
Financial) within ten (10) business days after the commencement of such
tender or exchange offer, in any such case whether or not permitted by the
terms hereof, (ii) recommended or endorsed an Acquisition Proposal, or (iii)
breached its obligations under Section 6.3 or 6.12 in any material respect;

  



  

(f) by MainSource, if the Board of Directors of First Financial
shall have (i) failed to recommend in the Joint Proxy Statement that
the shareholders of First Financial adopt this Agreement, or withdrawn,
modified or qualified such recommendation in a manner adverse to MainSource,
or resolved to do so, or failed to reaffirm such recommendation within three
(3) calendar days after MainSource requests in writing that such action be
taken, or (ii) breached its obligations under Section 6.3 in any material
respect;

  



  

(g) by written notice of MainSource to First Financial if both of
the following conditions requisite to termination under this Section 8.1(g)
are satisfied at any time during the seven (7) calendar day period commencing
on the Determination Date, such termination to be effective on the tenth
(10th) calendar day following the Determination Date:

  



    

 | 78| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(i) the First Financial Market Value on the Determination Date is
less than 80% of the Initial First Financial Market Value; and

  



  

(ii) the number obtained by dividing the First Financial Market Value
on the Determination Date by the Initial First Financial Market Value shall
be less than the Index Ratio minus 0.20.

  



  

If First Financial or any company belonging to the Index declares or effects
a stock dividend, reclassification, recapitalization, split-up,
combination, exchange of shares or similar transaction between the date of
this Agreement and the Determination Date, the prices for the common stock of
such company shall be appropriately adjusted for the purposes of applying this
Section 8.1(g).

  



  

The termination right under this Section 8.1(g) is subject, however, to the
following: If MainSource elects to exercise its termination right pursuant to
this Section 8.1(g), it shall give prompt written notice thereof to First
Financial. During the seven (7) calendar day period commencing upon its
receipt of such notice, First Financial shall have the option to increase the
Exchange Ratio to equal the lesser of (x) a quotient, the numerator of which
is equal to the product of the Initial First Financial Market Value, the
Exchange Ratio (as then in effect), and the Index Ratio minus 0.20 and the
denominator of which is equal to the First Financial Market Value on the
Determination Date; or (y) the quotient determined by dividing the Initial
First Financial Market Value by the First Financial Market Value on the
Determination Date, and multiplying the quotient by the product of the
Exchange Ratio (as then in effect) and 0.80. If within such seven (7)
calendar day period, First Financial delivers written notice to MainSource
that it intends to proceed with the Merger by paying such additional
consideration as contemplated by the preceding sentence, and notifies
MainSource of the revised Exchange Ratio, then no termination shall have
occurred pursuant to this Section 8.1(g) as if no written notice of
termination had been given, and this Agreement shall remain in full force and
effect in accordance with its terms (except that the Exchange Ratio shall
have been so modified).

  



  

For purposes of this Section 8.1(g), the following terms shall have the
meanings indicated below:

  



  

(iii) " _Determination Date_ " shall mean the latest of (i) the date
on which all Regulatory Approvals (and waivers, if applicable) necessary for
consummation of the Merger have been received (disregarding any waiting
period); or (ii) the date on which the shareholder approvals of both
MainSource and First Financial have been received.

  



  

(iv) " _Final Index Price_ " means the average of the daily closing
value of the Index for the twenty (20) consecutive trading days immediately
preceding the Determination Date.

  



    

 | 79| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(v) " _Index_ " means the KBW Regional Banking Index or, if such
Index is not available, such substitute or similar Index as substantially
replicates the KBW Regional Banking Index.

  



  

(vi) " _Index Ratio_ " means the Final Index Price divided by the
Initial Index Price.

  



  

(vii) " _Initial First Financial Market Value_ " means $27.7282,
adjusted as indicated above.

  



  

(viii) " _Initial Index Price_ " means $106.25.

  



  

(ix) " _First Financial Market Value_ " means, as of any specified
date, the volume-weighted average closing price per share of First Financial
Common Stock as reported on NASDAQ for the twenty (20) consecutive trading
days immediately preceding such specified date.

  



  

8.2 _Effect of Termination_.

  



  

(a) In the event of termination of this Agreement by either First
Financial or MainSource as provided in Section 8.1, this Agreement
shall forthwith become void and have no effect, and none of First Financial,
MainSource, any of their respective Subsidiaries or any of the officers or
directors of any of them shall have any liability of any nature whatsoever
hereunder, or in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, except
that (i) Sections 6.2(b) and this Section 8.2 and Article IX (other than
Section 9.1) shall survive any termination of this Agreement, and (ii)
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, neither
First Financial nor MainSource shall be relieved or released from any
liabilities or damages arising out of its willful and material breach of any
provision of this Agreement.

  



  

(b) 

  



  

(i) In the event that after the date of this Agreement and prior to
the termination of this Agreement, a bona fide Acquisition Proposal shall
have been made known to senior management of MainSource or has been made
directly to its shareholders generally or any person shall have publicly
announced (and not withdrawn) an Acquisition Proposal with respect to
MainSource and (A) thereafter this Agreement is terminated by either First
Financial or MainSource pursuant to Section 8.1(c) and MainSource shall have
failed to obtain the Requisite MainSource Vote or (B) thereafter this
Agreement is terminated by First Financial pursuant to Section 8.1(d) and
(C) prior to the date that is twelve (12) months after the date of such
termination, MainSource enters into a definitive agreement or consummates a
transaction with respect to an Acquisition Proposal (whether or not the same
Acquisition Proposal as that referred to above), then MainSource shall, on
the earlier of the date it enters into such definitive agreement and the date
of consummation of such transaction, pay First Financial, by wire transfer of
same day funds, a fee equal to $40,000,000 (the " _Termination Fee_ ");
provided, that for purposes of this Section 8.2(b), all references in the
definition of Acquisition Proposal to "20%" shall instead refer to "50%".

  



    

 | 80| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(ii) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by First
Financial pursuant to Section 8.1(e), then MainSource shall pay First
Financial, by wire transfer of same day funds, the Termination Fee on the
date of termination.

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, but without
limiting the right of any party to recover liabilities or damages arising out
of the other party's willful and material breach of any provision of this
Agreement, in the event that this Agreement is terminated as provided in
Section 8.1, the maximum aggregate amount of monetary fees, liabilities or
damages payable by MainSource under this Agreement shall be equal to the
Termination Fee.

  



  

(d) Each of First Financial and MainSource acknowledges that the
agreements contained in this Section 8.2 are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these
agreements, the other party would not enter into this Agreement;
accordingly, if MainSource fails promptly to pay the amount due pursuant to
this Section 8.2, and, in order to obtain such payment, First
Financial commences a suit which results in a judgment against MainSource for
the Termination Fee, MainSource shall pay the costs and expenses of First
Financial (including attorneys' fees and expenses) in connection with such
suit. In addition, if MainSource fails to pay the amounts payable pursuant to
this Section 8.2, then MainSource shall pay interest on such overdue amounts
at a rate per annum equal to the "prime rate" (as announced by JPMorgan Chase
and Co. or any successor thereto) in effect on the date on which such payment
was required to be made for the period commencing as of the date that such
overdue amount was originally required to be paid.

  



  

8.3 _Amendment_. Subject to compliance with applicable law, this
Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto, by action taken or authorized
by their respective Boards of Directors, at any time before or after approval
of the matters presented in connection with Merger by the shareholders of
First Financial and MainSource; _provided_ , _however_ , that after adoption
of this Agreement by the respective shareholders of First Financial or
MainSource, there may not be, without further approval of such shareholders,
any amendment of this Agreement that requires further approval under
applicable law. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto.

  



    

 | 81| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

8.4 _Extension; Waiver_.

  



  

At any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties hereto, by action taken
or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors, may, to the extent
legally allowed, extend the time for the performance of any of the
obligations or other acts of the other parties hereto, waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained herein or in any
document delivered pursuant hereto, and waive compliance with any of the
agreements or satisfaction of any conditions contained herein; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that after adoption of this Agreement by the respective
shareholders of First Financial or MainSource, there may not be, without
further approval of such shareholders, any extension or waiver of this
Agreement or any portion thereof that requires further approval under
applicable law. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such
extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument
signed on behalf of such party, but such extension or waiver or failure to
insist on strict compliance with an obligation, covenant, agreement or
condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any
subsequent or other failure.

representations and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of
actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any

breaches of this Agreement or to enforce specifically the performance of the
terms and provisions hereof (including the parties' obligation to consummate
the Merger), in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at
law or in equity. Each of the parties hereby further waives (a) any
defense in any action for specific performance that a remedy at law would be
adequate and (b) any requirement under any law to post security or a bond as
a prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief.

  



  

9.12 _Severability_. Whenever possible, each provision or portion of
any provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be
effective and valid under applicable law, but if any provision or portion of
any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any respect under any applicable law or rule in any
jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not
affect any other provision or portion of any provision in such jurisdiction,
and this Agreement shall be reformed, construed and enforced in such
jurisdiction such that the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision or
portion thereof shall be interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable.

  



  

9.13 _Delivery by Facsimile or Electronic Transmission_. This
Agreement and any signed agreement or instrument entered into in
connection with this Agreement, and any amendments or waivers hereto or
thereto, to the extent signed and delivered by means of a facsimile machine
or by e-mail delivery of a ".pdf" format data file, shall be treated in all
manner and respects as an original agreement or instrument and shall be
considered to have the same binding legal effect as if it were the original
signed version thereof delivered in person. No party hereto or to any such
agreement or instrument shall raise the use of a facsimile machine or e-mail
delivery of a ".pdf" format data file to deliver a signature to this Agreement
or any amendment hereto or the fact that any signature or agreement or
instrument was transmitted or communicated through the use of a facsimile
machine or e-mail delivery of a ".pdf" format data file as a defense to the
formation of a contract and each party hereto forever waives any such
defense.

This Voting Agreement (the "Voting Agreement") is entered into by and among
First Financial Bancorp., an Ohio corporation ("First Financial"), and each
of the undersigned directors of MainSource Financial Group, Inc., an Indiana
corporation ("MainSource"). Each of the undersigned, being all of the
