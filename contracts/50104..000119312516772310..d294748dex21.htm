_RECITALS_

 

WHEREAS, (i) the respective boards of directors of each of the Merger Subs and
the Company have approved and declared advisable this Agreement and the
merger of Merger Sub 1 with and into the Company, with the Company being the

with the First Merger, the " _Merger_ ") upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement and (ii) the board of directors
of Parent has approved this Agreement and the Merger and the issuance of
Parent Shares (as defined below) in the Merger upon the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in this Agreement; and

the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder (the " _Code_ "); and

 

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, as a

enter into this Agreement, each of (i) Paul L. Foster and Franklin Mountain
Investments, LP (collectively, the " _Chairman_ "), (ii) Jeff A. Stevens (the
" _Company CEO_ ") and (iii) Scott D. Weaver (together with each of the

pursuant to which, among other things, each Founder, has agreed to vote all
of the Company Shares beneficially owned by such Founder in favor of the
adoption of this Agreement subject to the terms and conditions of such Voting
Agreement; and

 

WHEREAS, the Company, Parent and the Merger Subs desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with this
Agreement.

 



-1- NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, and of the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, the parties hereto
agree as follows:

_ARTICLE I_

 

 _The Merger; Closing; Effective Times_

 

1.1. _The First Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the satisfaction or
waiver of the conditions set forth in this Agreement and in accordance with
the Delaware General Corporation Law, as amended (the " _DGCL_ "), at the
Effective Time (as defined in _Section_ _ _ _1.4_ ), Merger Sub 1 shall be
merged with and into the Company and the separate corporate existence of
Merger Sub 1 shall thereupon cease. The Company shall be the surviving
corporation in the First Merger (sometimes hereinafter referred to as the "
_Surviving Corporation_ "), and the separate corporate existence of the
Company with all of its rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises
shall continue unaffected by the First Merger, except as set forth in
_Article_ _ _ _II_. The First Merger shall have the effects specified in this
Agreement and by the DGCL.

1.2. _The Second Merger_. If a Second Merger Election is made pursuant to 
_Section 6.6(b)_ , then, upon the terms and subject to the satisfaction or
waiver of the conditions set forth in this Agreement and in accordance with
the DGCL and the Limited Liability Company Act of the State of Delaware (the "
_LLC Act_ "), at the Second Merger Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall be merged with and into Merger Sub 2 and the separate corporate
existence of the Surviving Corporation shall thereupon cease. Merger Sub 2
shall be the surviving company in the Second Merger (sometimes hereinafter
referred to as the " _Surviving Company_ "), and the separate corporate
existence of the Surviving Company with all of its rights, privileges,
immunities, powers and franchises shall continue unaffected by the Second
Merger, except as set forth in Article _II_. The Second Merger shall have the
effects specified in this Agreement and by the DGCL and the LLC Act.

 

1.3. _Closing_.

(a) Unless otherwise mutually agreed in writing between the Company and
Parent, the closing for the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place at the
offices of Sullivan and Cromwell LLP, 125 Broad Street, New York, New York,
at 9:00 A.M. (Eastern Time) on the fifth business day (the " _Closing Date_
") following the day on which the last to be satisfied or waived of the
conditions set forth in _Article_ _ _ _VII_ (other than those conditions that
by their nature are to be satisfied at or immediately prior to the Closing,
but subject to the fulfillment or waiver of those conditions) shall be
satisfied or waived by the party entitled to the benefit thereof in accordance
with this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _business
day_ " shall mean any day ending at 11:59 p.m. (Eastern Time), other than a
Saturday or Sunday or a day on which banks are required or authorized to close
in the City of New York. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Marketing
Period has not ended at the time of the satisfaction or waiver of the
conditions set forth in _Article VII_ (other than those conditions that by
their nature are to be satisfied at or immediately prior to the Closing, but
subject to the fulfillment or waiver of those conditions), then the Closing
shall occur instead on the date following the satisfaction or waiver of such
conditions that is the earliest to occur of (a) any business day during or
before the expiration of the Marketing Period as may be specified by Parent on
no fewer than three business days prior written notice to the Company and (b)
three business days after the final day of the Marketing Period, unless
another date is agreed to in writing by Parent and the Company. For purposes
of this Agreement, " _Marketing Period_ " means the first period of 15
consecutive 

 



-2-  business days commencing on the first business day following January 15,
2017 on which Parent shall have the Required Information and such Required
Information is Compliant; it being understood and agreed that when the
Company in good faith reasonably believes that it has delivered the Required
Information, it shall deliver to Parent a written notice to that effect
(stating when the Company believes it completed such delivery), in which case
the Marketing Period shall be deemed to have commenced on the date specified
in such notice, unless Parent in good faith reasonably believes that the
Company has not completed delivery of the Required Information and, within
three consecutive business days after receipt of such notice from the
Company, Parent delivers a written notice to the Company to that effect
(stating with specificity which Required Information the Company has not
delivered); _provided_ that, for purposes of determining the Marketing
Period, such period shall exclude May 26, 2017 and July 3, 2017 and July 5,
2017 and such period shall end on or prior to August 18, 2017, and if such
period has not ended on or prior to such date, then such period shall begin
on or after September 5, 2017. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Marketing
Period shall not commence and shall be deemed not to have commenced if, at any
time during such 15 consecutive business day period, (x) the applicable
independent registered accounting firm for the Company shall have withdrawn
its authorization letter or audit opinion with respect to any financial
statements contained in the Required Information, in which case the Marketing
Period shall not be deemed to commence until the time at which, as
applicable, a new authorization letter or unqualified audit opinion is issued
with respect to the consolidated financial statements for the applicable
periods by the Companys independent registered accounting firm or another
independent registered accounting firm acceptable to Parent, (y) the Company
or its auditors issues a public statement indicating its intent to restate any
financial statements or material financial information included in the
Required Information, in which case the Marketing Period shall be deemed not
to commence unless and until such restatement has been completed and the
applicable Required Information has been amended or it has been concluded that
no restatement shall be required or (z) the Company shall have announced that
it has entered into any transaction described in Items 1 and 2 set forth in
_Section_ _6.1(a)(iii)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, in which case the
Marketing Period shall be deemed to have commenced on the first business day
following such announcement.

(b) " _Compliant_ " means, with respect to the Required Information, without
giving effect to any supplements or updates, (i) no audit opinion with respect
to any financial statements contained in the Required Information shall have
been withdrawn, amended or qualified and (ii)(A) the financial statements and
other financial information included in such Required Information that have
been prepared by the Company are, and remain throughout the Marketing Period,
sufficient to permit the Financing Sources (including underwriters, placement
agents or initial purchasers) to receive customary comfort letters with
respect to such financial information (including customary negative assurance
comfort with respect to periods following the end of the latest fiscal year
and fiscal quarter for which historical financial statements are included) on
any date during the Marketing Period and (B) the auditors that have reviewed
or audited such financial information have delivered drafts of customary
comfort letters, including customary negative assurance comfort, and such
auditors have confirmed they are prepared to issue such comfort letters upon
any pricing date and the closing relating to the Financing occurring during
the Marketing Period.

 



-3- (c) For the avoidance of doubt, and notwithstanding anything else contained
herein, the requirements set forth in _Section 1.3(b)(ii)_ shall not, under
any circumstances, require the auditors to address or opine on, or provide
comfort or negative assurance comfort with respect to, the preliminary
financial information included in any Recent Developments Section in their
comfort letter or negative assurance letter.

1.4. _Effective Time_ _s_.

 

(a) At or promptly following the Closing on the Closing Date, the Company and
Parent will cause a Certificate of Merger (the " _Delaware Certificate of
First Merger_ ") to be duly executed, acknowledged and filed with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware as provided in Section 251 of the
DGCL, and make any other filings, recordings or publications required to be
made by the Company or Merger Sub 1 under the DGCL. The First Merger shall
become effective at the time when the Delaware Certificate of First Merger has
been duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, or at
such later date or time as may be agreed by the parties in writing and
specified in the Delaware Certificate of First Merger (the " _Effective Time_
").

 

(b) If a Second Merger Election is made pursuant to _Section_ _6.6(b)_ in
connection with the Closing, then, immediately following the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation and Parent will cause a Certificate of Merger (the "
_Delaware Certificate of Second Merger_ ") to be duly executed, acknowledged
and filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware as provided in
Section 264 of the DGCL and Section 18-209 of the LLC Act, and make any other
filings, recordings or publications required to be made by the Surviving
Corporation or Merger Sub 2 under the DGCL or LLC Act. The Second Merger
shall become effective at the time when the Delaware Certificate of Second
Merger has been duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware, or at such later date or time as may be agreed by the parties in
writing and specified in the Delaware Certificate of Second Merger (the "
_Second Merger Effective Time_ ").

Corporation common stock outstanding immediately prior to the Second Merger
Effective Time shall be cancelled, and no consideration shall be paid with

tax purposes, (a) the Merger shall qualify as a "reorganization" within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and (b) this Agreement, including any

Parent, Merger Sub 1, Merger Sub 2 or any other direct or indirect wholly-
owned Subsidiary of Parent and Company Shares owned by the Company or any

shall cease to exist, and each certificate (a " _Certificate_ ") formerly
representing any of the Company Shares, and each non-certificated Company
Share represented by book entry (each, a " _Book Entry Company Share_ "),
(other than in each case those representing Excluded Company Shares) shall
thereafter represent only the right to receive, without interest, the Per
Share Merger Consideration and (with respect to the Stock Consideration) the

-6- 4.2. _Allocation of Per Share Merger Consideration; Election Procedures_.

 

(a) _Allocation_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
the maximum number of Company Shares (the " _Cash Election Number_ ") to be
converted into the right to receive Cash Consideration in the First Merger
shall be equal to 10,843,042 Company Shares _less_ (ii) the number of Company
Shares to be cancelled in accordance with  _Section_ _ _ _4.1(b)_. The number
of Company Shares to be converted into the right to receive Stock
Consideration in the First Merger (the " _Stock Election Number_ ") shall be
equal to the number of Company Shares issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (excluding for the avoidance of doubt the number
of Company Shares represented by the Company RSUs, the Company PUAs and
Company Other Awards that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time, all of which shall be treated solely as provided in _Section 4.5_ )
_less_ the sum of (i) the number of Company Shares in respect of which Cash
Elections have been made (or, if less, the Cash Election Number) and (ii) the
number of Company Shares to be cancelled in accordance with _Section_ _ _
_4.1(b)_.

(b)  _Election Procedures_.

(i) _Exchange Agent_. Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited,
with an exchange agent selected by Parent and reasonably acceptable to the
Company (the " _Exchange Agent_ "), for the benefit of the holders of Company
Shares, (i) at the Effective Time, certificates, or at Parents option,
evidence of non-certificated Parent Shares in book-entry form (" _Book Entry
Parent Shares_ "), constituting at least the amounts necessary for the Stock
Consideration, (ii) at the Effective Time, cash in immediately available funds
constituting at least the amounts necessary for the Cash Consideration, and
(iii) as necessary from time to time after the Effective Time, if applicable,
any cash and dividends or other distributions with respect to the Parent
Shares to be issued or to be paid pursuant to  _Section_ _4.2(c)_ , in
exchange for Company Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time, deliverable upon due surrender of the Certificates (or affidavits of
loss in lieu thereof as provided in  _Section_ _ _ _4.2(g)_ ) or Book Entry
Company Shares pursuant to the provisions of this _Article_ _ _ _IV_ (such
cash, certificates for Parent Shares and evidence of Book Entry Parent Shares,
together with the amount of any dividends or other distributions payable
pursuant to this _Article_ _ _ _IV_ with respect thereto, being hereinafter
referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The Exchange Agent shall invest the
cash available in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent; _provided_ that
such investments shall be in obligations, funds or accounts typical for
(including having liquidity typical for) transactions of this nature. To the
extent that there are losses with respect to such investments, or the
Exchange Fund diminishes for other reasons below the level required to make
prompt cash payment of the aggregate cash portion of the Cash Consideration as
contemplated hereby, Parent shall promptly replace or restore the cash in the
Exchange Fund lost through such investments or other events so as to ensure
that the Exchange Fund is at all times maintained at a level sufficient to
make such cash payments. Any interest and other income resulting from such
investment shall become a part of the Exchange Fund, and any amounts in excess
of the amounts payable under _Section_ _ _ _4.1(a)_ shall be promptly returned
to Parent. The Exchange Agent shall also act as the agent for the Companys
stockholders for the purpose of receiving and holding their Certificates and
Book Entry Company Shares and shall obtain no rights or interests in the
shares represented thereby.

 

(ii) _Types of Election._ _ _ Subject to allocation and proration in
accordance with the provisions of this  _Section_ _ _ _4.2_ , each record
holder of Company Shares (other than (1) any Company Shares represented by the
Company RSUs, the Company PUAs and Company Other Awards that are outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, all of which shall be treated solely
as provided in _Section 4.5_ and (2) Excluded Company Shares) issued and

 



-7-  outstanding immediately prior to the Election Deadline (as defined below)
shall be entitled to elect to receive in respect of each such Company Share
held by such record holder (A) Cash Consideration (a " _Cash Election_ ") or
(B) Stock Consideration (a " _Stock Election_ "). Company Shares in respect of
which no Cash Election or Stock Election has been affirmatively made and not
revoked shall be deemed to be Company Shares in respect of which Stock
Elections have been made.

(iii) _Form of Election and Election Deadline._ (A) Elections pursuant to
_Section_ _ _ _4.2(b)(ii)_ shall be made on a form (a " _Form of Election_ ")
to be provided by the Exchange Agent for that purpose to holders of record of
Company Shares (other than (1) any Company Shares represented by the Company
RSUs, the Company PUAs and Company Other Awards that are outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, all of which shall be treated solely
as provided in _Section_ _4.5_  and (2) Excluded Company Shares), together
with appropriate transmittal materials. Elections shall be made by mailing to
the Exchange Agent a duly completed Form of Election. To be effective, a Form
of Election must be (x) properly completed, signed and submitted to the
Exchange Agent at its designated office, by 5:00 P.M. (Eastern Time) on the
business day that is two trading days prior to the Closing Date (which date
shall be publicly announced by Parent at least four business days prior to
the anticipated Closing Date) or such other date and time as Parent may
publicly announce with the consent of the Company (the applicable of such date
and times described in this clause (x), the " _Election Deadline_ ") and (y)
(except with respect to Book Entry Company Shares, in respect of which such
other customary evidence as determined by the Exchange Agent shall be provided
in lieu of Certificates) accompanied by the Certificate(s) representing the
Company Shares as to which the election is being made (or by an appropriate
guarantee of delivery of such Certificate(s) by a financial institution
(including most commercial banks, savings and loan associations and
brokerage houses) that is a participant in the Security Transfer Agents
Medallion Program, the New York Stock Exchange Medallion Signature Guarantee
Program or the Stock Exchange Medallion Program, _provided_ that such
Certificates are in fact delivered to the Exchange Agent within three trading
days after the date of execution of such guarantee of delivery), together with
a duly completed letter of transmittal. The Company shall use its best efforts
to make a Form of Election (and where applicable, appropriate transmittal
materials) available to all Persons who become holders of record of Company
Shares (other than (1) any Company Shares represented by the Company RSUs, the
Company PUAs and Company Other Awards that are outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time, all of which shall be treated solely as provided in
_Section_ _4.5_ and (2) Excluded Company Shares) between the date the Forms of
Election are mailed and the Election Deadline. Parent shall determine, in its
reasonable discretion, which discretion and authority it may delegate in whole
or in part to the Exchange Agent, whether Forms of Election (and where
applicable, appropriate transmittal materials) have been properly completed,
signed and submitted or revoked. The decision of Parent (or the Exchange
Agent, as the case may be) in such matters shall be conclusive and binding. A
holder of Company Shares that does not submit an effective Form of Election
prior to the Election Deadline shall be deemed to have made a Stock Election.

(iv) _Revocation of Election._ _ _ An election may be revoked, but only by
written notice received by the Exchange Agent prior to the Election Deadline.
Any Certificate(s) representing Company Shares that have been submitted to the
Exchange Agent in connection with an election shall be returned without
charge to the holder thereof in the event such election

 



-8-  is revoked as aforesaid and such holder requests in writing the return of
such Certificate(s) or Book Entry Company Shares. Upon any such revocation,
unless a duly completed Form of Election is thereafter submitted prior to the
Election Deadline in accordance with _Section_ _ _ _4.2(b)(ii)_ and _Section_
_ _ _4.2(b)(iii)_ , such Company Shares shall be Stock Election Shares. In the
event that this Agreement is terminated in accordance with _Article_ _ _
_VIII_ and any Company Shares have been transmitted to the Exchange Agent
pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement, such Company Shares shall
promptly be returned without charge to the Person submitting the same.

(v) _Proration for Oversubscription of Cash Election._ In the event that the
aggregate number of Company Shares in respect of which Cash Elections have
been made (collectively, the " _Cash Election Shares_ ") exceeds the Cash
Election Number, all Company Shares in respect of which Stock Elections have
been made, or deemed by Parent in its reasonable discretion to have been
made, pursuant to this _Section_ _4.2_ (the " _Stock Election Shares_ ") shall
be converted into the right to receive Stock Consideration, and all Cash
Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive Stock
Consideration or Cash Consideration in the following manner:

(A) the Cash Election Shares held by each record holder of Company Shares
shall be deemed converted to Stock Election Shares, on a pro-rata basis based
on the ratio that the number of Cash Election Shares held by such holder bears
to the total number of Company Shares in respect of which Cash Elections have
been made, such that the aggregate number of Cash Election Shares so deemed
converted, when added to the other Stock Election Shares, shall equal as
closely as practicable the Stock Election Number (rounding the number of Cash
Election Shares of a holder that are to remain Cash Election Shares downward
where needed), and all such Cash Election Shares so deemed converted ("
_Deemed Converted Cash Election Shares_ ") shall be converted into the right
to receive Stock Consideration (and cash in lieu of fractional Parent Shares
pursuant to _Section_ _ _ _4.2(e)_ ). For example, and by way of illustration
only, if the aggregate number of Company Shares in respect of which Cash
Elections had been made were three times the Cash Election Number, each record
holder of Company Shares holding Cash Election Shares would receive, in
respect of the Company Shares for which he had made a Cash Election,
Cash Consideration for approximately one-third of such Company Shares and
Stock Consideration for approximately two-thirds of such Company Shares; and

 

(B) any remaining Cash Election Shares shall be converted into the right to
receive Cash Consideration.

 

For the avoidance of doubt, in the circumstances where this _Section
4.2(b)(v)_ is applicable, each record holder of Cash Election Shares shall to
the extent reasonably possible receive the same proportion of Cash
Consideration, and the same proportion of Stock Consideration, with respect to
their aggregate Cash Election Shares and Deemed Converted Cash Election Shares
as each other record holder of Cash Election Shares receives in respect of
their aggregate Cash Election Shares and Deemed Converted Cash Election
Shares.

 



-9- (vi) _Default Allocation._ _ _ In the event that clause (v) of this 
_Section_ _ _ _4.2(b)_ is not applicable, (A) all Cash Election Shares shall
be converted into the right to receive Cash Consideration, and (B) all Stock
Election Shares and Company Shares in respect of which Stock Elections are
deemed by Parent in its reasonable discretion to have been made pursuant to
this _Section 4.2_ shall be converted into the right to receive Stock
Consideration (and cash in lieu of fractional Parent Shares pursuant to 
_Section_ _ _ _4.2(e)_ ).

(vii) The Exchange Agent, in consultation with Parent, shall make all
computations to give effect to this _Section_ _ _ _4.2_.

(c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Company Shares; Voting_. All
Parent Shares to be issued pursuant to the First Merger shall be deemed issued
and outstanding as of the Effective Time and whenever a dividend or other
distribution is declared by Parent in respect of Parent Shares, the
record date for which is at or after the Effective Time, that declaration
shall include dividends or other distributions in respect of all Stock
Consideration issuable pursuant to this Agreement. No dividends or other
distributions in respect of the Parent Shares shall be paid to any holder of
any unsurrendered Certificate or Book Entry Company Share until such
Certificate (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the Certificate as provided in
_Section_ _ _ _4.2(g)_ ) or Book Entry Company Share is surrendered for
exchange in accordance with this _Article_ _ _ _IV_. Subject to the effect of
applicable Laws, following surrender of any such Certificate (or affidavits of
loss in lieu of the Certificate as provided in _Section_ _ _ _4.2(g)_ ) or
Book Entry Company Share that has been converted into the right to receive the
Stock Consideration, there shall be issued and/or paid to the holder of the
certificates representing whole Parent Shares (or as applicable, Book Entry
Parent Shares) issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (A) at the time
of such surrender, the dividends or other distributions with a record date
after the Effective Time theretofore payable with respect to such whole
Parent Shares and not paid and (B) at the appropriate payment date, the
dividends or other distributions payable with respect to such whole Parent
Shares with a record date after the Effective Time but with a payment date
subsequent to surrender. No holder of Certificates or Book Entry Company
Shares that have been converted into the right to receive Cash Consideration
shall be entitled to receive any amount pursuant to this  _Section_ _ _
_4.2(c)_ in respect of such Certificates or Book Entry Company Shares.

(d) _Transfers_. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no
transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of the Company Shares
that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, any Certificate or Book Entry Company Share is presented to
the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Exchange Agent for transfer, it shall
be cancelled and exchanged for the aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration
(and to the extent applicable, cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to
_Section_ _ _ _4.2(e)_ and/or any dividends or other distributions pursuant to
_Section_ _ _ _4.2(c)_ ) to which the holder thereof is entitled pursuant to
this _Article_ _ _ _IV_. 

(e) _Fractional Company Shares_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, no fractional Parent Shares will be issued and any holder of
Company Shares entitled to receive a fractional Parent Share but for this
_Section_ _ _ _4.2(e)_ shall be entitled to receive a cash payment in lieu
thereof, without interest, which payment shall be calculated by the Exchange
Agent and shall be an amount equal to the product of (i) the average of the
closing prices per Parent Share on the New York Stock Exchange (the " _NYSE_
"), as reported in the Wall Street Journal (or if not reported thereby, as
reported in another authoritative source), for

 



-10-  the five full trading days ending on the second business day immediately
preceding the date on which the Effective Time occurs _multiplied by_ (ii) the
fraction of a Parent Share (after taking into account all Company Shares held
by such holder at the Effective Time and rounded to the nearest one thousandth
when expressed in decimal form) to which such holder would otherwise be
entitled. No such holder shall be entitled to dividends, voting rights or any
other rights in respect of any fractional Parent Shares. No holder of
Certificates or Book Entry Company Shares that have been converted into the
right to receive Cash Consideration shall be entitled to receive any amount
pursuant to this _Section_ _ _ _4.2(e)_ in respect of such Certificates or
Book Entry Company Shares.

(f)  _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including the proceeds of any investments of the Exchange Fund and any Parent
Shares) that remains unclaimed by the stockholders of the Company for 180 days
after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent. Any holder of Company
Shares (other than Excluded Company Shares) who has not theretofore complied
with this _Article_ _ _ _IV_ shall thereafter look only to Parent for delivery
of any Per Share Merger Consideration (and to the extent applicable, cash in
lieu of fractional shares pursuant to _Section_ _ _ _4.2(e)_ and/or any
dividends or other distributions pursuant to  _Section_ _ _ _4.2(c)_ ),
payable and/or issuable pursuant to _Section_ _ _ _4.1_ and _Section_ _ _
_4.2_ upon due surrender of their Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu
of the Certificates as provided in _Section_ _ _ _4.2(g)_ ) or Book Entry
Company Shares, in each case, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, none of the Surviving Corporation, Parent, the Exchange Agent
or any other Person shall be liable to any former holder of Company Shares
for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
which remains undistributed to the holders of Company Shares immediately
prior to the time at which the Exchange Fund would otherwise escheat to, or
become property of, any Governmental Entity, shall, to the extent permitted by
Law, become the property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest
of any Person previously entitled thereto. For the purposes of this Agreement,
the term " _Person_ " shall mean any individual, corporation (including not-
for-profit), general or limited partnership, limited liability company, joint
venture, estate, trust, association, organization, Governmental Entity (as
defined in _Section_ _ _ _5.1(d)_ ) or other entity of any kind or nature.

 

(g) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in
customary amount and upon such terms as may be required by Parent as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent, the Exchange
Agent or any of Parents Subsidiaries with respect to such Certificate, the
Exchange Agent will issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate, the applicable Per Share Merger Consideration, and (to the
extent applicable) any cash pursuant to _Section_ _ _ _4.2(e)_ or unpaid
dividends or other distributions pursuant to _Section_ _ _ _4.2(c)_ , that
would have been payable or deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this
Agreement had such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate been surrendered.

 

4.3. _Appraisal Rights_. In accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL, no
appraisal rights shall be available to holders of Company Shares in
connection with the First Merger.

 



-11- 4.4. _Adjustments_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, if, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the
issued and outstanding Company Shares or securities convertible or
exchangeable into or exercisable for Company Shares or the issued and
outstanding Parent Share or securities convertible or exchangeable into or
exercisable for Parent Shares, shall have been changed into a different number
of shares or a different class by reason of any reclassification, stock split
(including a reverse stock split), stock dividend or distribution,
recapitalization, merger, issuer tender or exchange offer, or other similar
transaction, then the Per Share Merger Consideration and the Cash Election
Number shall be equitably adjusted, without duplication, to proportionally
reflect such change and as so adjusted shall, from and after the date of such
event, be the Per Share Merger Consideration; _provided_ _that_ nothing in
this _Section_ _ _ _4.4_ shall be construed to permit the Company to take any
of the foregoing actions with respect to its securities to the extent
otherwise prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

4.5.  _Treatment of Stock Plans_.

(a) _Vested Company RSUs_. At the Effective Time, each outstanding restricted
stock unit under the Stock Plans (as defined in _Section_ _ _ _5.1(b)(i)_ )
(a " _Company RSU_ ") that is vested as of the Effective Time (after
application of any vesting acceleration provisions set forth in the terms of
such Company RSU, if any) (each, a " _Vested Company RSU_ ") shall,
automatically and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be
cancelled and shall only entitle the holder of such Vested Company RSU to
receive (without interest), as soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, an amount in cash equal to (x) the number of Company Shares
subject to such Vested Company RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time
_multiplied by_ (y) the Cash Consideration, less applicable Taxes required to
be withheld with respect to such payment; _provided_ , that, with respect to
any Vested Company RSUs that constitute nonqualified deferred compensation
subject to Section 409A of the Code and that are not permitted to be paid as
soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time without triggering a
Tax or penalty under Section 409A of the Code, such payment shall be made at
the earliest time permitted under the Stock Plans and applicable award
agreement that will not trigger a Tax or penalty under Section 409A of the
Code.

(b) _Unvested Company RSUs_. At the Effective Time, each outstanding Company
RSU that is not vested as of the Effective Time (after application of any
vesting acceleration provisions set forth in the terms of such Company RSU, if
any) (each, an " _Unvested Company RSU_ ") shall, automatically and without
any action on the part of the holder thereof, cease to represent a restricted
stock unit denominated in Company Shares and shall be converted into a
restricted stock unit denominated in Parent Shares (a " _Parent RSU_ "). The
number of shares of Parent Shares subject to each such Parent RSU shall be
equal to the product (rounded down to the nearest whole number) of (x) the
number of Company Shares subject to such Company RSU immediately prior to the
Effective Time _multiplied by_ (y) the Exchange Ratio. Except as specifically
provided in this _Section 4.5(b)_ , following the Effective Time, each such
Parent RSU shall continue to be governed by the same terms and conditions
(including vesting terms) as were applicable to the applicable Company RSU
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 



-12- (c) _Company PUAs_. At the Effective Time, each outstanding performance unit
award (a " _Company PUA_ ") under the Stock Plans, whether vested or
unvested, shall, automatically and without any action on the part of the
holder thereof, remain a performance unit award denominated in the same cash
value as the Company PUA, except that any references in such Company PUA to
Company Shares shall be to Parent Shares (a " _Parent PUA_ "). Except as
specifically provided above, following the Effective Time, each such Parent
PUA shall continue to be governed by the same terms and conditions (including
vesting terms) as were applicable to the applicable Company PUA immediately
prior to the Effective Time, _provided_ that the performance metrics shall be
adjusted by the Company with the approval of Parent to reflect the First
Merger.

(d) _Company Awards_. At the Effective Time, each right of any kind,
contingent or accrued, to acquire or receive Company Shares or benefits
measured by the value of Company Shares, and each award of any kind consisting
of Company Shares that may be held, awarded, outstanding, payable or reserved
for issuance under the Stock Plans and any other Company Benefit Plans (as
defined in _Section_ _ _ _5.1(h)(i)_ ), other than Company RSUs and Company
PUAs (the " _Company Other Awards_ "), shall, automatically and without any
action on the part of the holder thereof, be deemed to be converted into the
right to acquire or receive benefits measured by the value of (as the case may
be) the number of Parent Shares equal to the product (rounded down to the
nearest whole number) of (x) the number of Company Shares subject to such
Company Other Award immediately prior to the Effective Time _multiplied by_
(y) the Exchange Ratio, and to the extent such Company Other Award provides
for payments to the extent the value of the Company Shares exceeds a
specified reference price, at a reference price per share (rounded to the
nearest whole cent) equal to (A) the reference price per Company Share
immediately prior to the Effective Time _divided by_ (B) the Exchange Ratio.
Except as specifically provided above, following the Effective Time, each such
right shall otherwise be subject to the same terms and conditions (including,
as applicable, vesting and exercisability terms) as were applicable to
the rights under the relevant Stock Plan or other Company Benefit Plan
immediately prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ _that_ any applicable
performance metrics shall be adjusted by the Company with the approval of
Parent to reflect the First Merger.

(e) _Registration_. If registration of any interests in the Stock Plans or
other Company Benefit Plans or the Parent Shares issuable thereunder is
required under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the " _Securities Act_
"), Parent shall file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_
") within 10 business days after the Effective Time a registration statement
on Form S-8 with respect to such interests or Parent Shares, and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such
registration statement for so long as the relevant Stock Plans or other
Company Benefit Plans, as applicable, remain in effect and such registration
of interests therein or Parent Shares issuable thereunder continues to be
required.

 

(f) _ESPP_. As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the
Company will take all actions necessary to terminate purchases under the
Company Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the " _ESPP_ ") and return contributions
to participants in accordance with the terms of the ESPP.

 



-13- (g) _Corporate Actions_. At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the
board of directors of the Company and the compensation committee of the board
of directors of the Company, as applicable, shall adopt any resolutions and
take any actions which are necessary to effectuate the provisions of 
_Section_ _ _ _4.5(a)_ through _Section_ _4.5(d)_. The Company shall take all
actions necessary to ensure that, from and after the Effective Time, neither
Parent nor the Surviving Corporation will be required to deliver Company
Shares or other capital stock of the Company to any Person pursuant to or in
settlement of Company Equity Awards. Parent shall take all actions which are
necessary for the assumption of the Company RSUs, Company PUAs and
Company Other Awards (the " _Company Equity Awards_ ") pursuant to _Section_
_ _ _4.5(a)_ through _Section_ _4.5(d)_ including the reservation, issuance
and listing of Parent Shares as necessary to effect the transactions
contemplated by this _Section_ _ _ _4.5_.

_ARTICLE V_

 

 _Representations and Warranties_

 

5.1. _Representations and Warranties of the Company_. Except as set forth in
the Company Reports or the MLP Reports (each as defined in _Section_ _ _
_5.1(e)(i)_ ) publicly filed with the SEC prior to the date of this Agreement

or in any other section to the extent they are forward-looking statements or
cautionary, predictive or forward-looking in nature) or in the corresponding
sections or subsections of the disclosure letter delivered to Parent by the
Company prior to entering into this Agreement (the " _Company Disclosure
Letter_ ") (it being agreed that disclosure of any item in any section or

its business as presently conducted and is qualified to do business and is in

jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing or operation of its assets or
properties or conduct of its business requires such qualification, except
where the failure to be so organized, qualified or in good standing, or to

reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect (as defined
below). The Company has made available to Parent complete and correct
copies of the Companys and its Significant Subsidiaries certificates of
incorporation and by-laws or comparable governing documents, each as amended
to the date of this Agreement, and each as so delivered is in full force

(C) (i) the (1) announcement, or (2) consummation, of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement;  _provided_ that the exception in clause (2)
shall not apply to any representation or warranty contained in _Section_ _5.1_
of this Agreement if the primary purpose of such representation or warranty is
from the face of such representation or warranty to address the consequences
resulting from the consummation of the Merger; or (ii) any litigation brought
by or on behalf of any current or former holder of Company Shares, in its

such failure has resulted in, or contributed to, a Company Material Adverse
Effect;

such decline has resulted in, or contributed to, a Company Material
Adverse Effect;

 



-15- (G) (1) any action taken (or omitted to be taken) at the written request of
Parent or that is expressly required by this Agreement or (2) the failure to
take any specific action expressly prohibited by this Agreement for which
Parent declined to consent; and

 

(H) any change in the prices of natural gas, crude oil, refined petroleum
products, other hydrocarbon products or natural gas liquids or products
produced from hydrocarbon products, natural gas liquids or crack spreads,

except, with respect to clauses (A), (B), (D) and (H), to the extent such
change, event, circumstance or development (i) primarily relates only to (or
has the effect of primarily relating only to) the Company and its Subsidiaries
or (ii) disproportionately adversely affects the Company and its Subsidiaries
compared to other companies of similar size operating in the petrochemical

Company Disclosure Letter to indicate, for each Company RSU, whether it is a
Vested Company RSU or Unvested Company RSU. All outstanding Company Shares
are, and all Company Shares reserved for issuance in accordance with the Stock

securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for capital stock

requisite corporate power and authority and has taken all corporate action
necessary in order to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under this
Agreement and the Voting Agreements and to consummate the Merger, subject
only to adoption of this Agreement by the holders of a majority of the
outstanding Company Shares entitled to vote on such matter at a stockholders
meeting duly called and held for such purpose (the " _Requisite Company Vote_
"). The Requisite

 



-17-  Company Vote is the only vote of the holders of capital stock of the Company
that is necessary under applicable Law, NYSE rules, and the Companys
certificate of incorporation and bylaws to adopt, approve and authorize this
Agreement. This Agreement and the Voting Agreements have been duly executed

the Company enforceable against the Company in accordance with their
respective terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer,
reorganization, moratorium and similar Laws of general applicability relating
to or affecting creditors rights and to general equity principles (the "

(ii) The board of directors of the Company has (A) unanimously determined
that the First Merger is fair to, and in the best interests of, the Company

to the holders of Company Shares (the " _Company Recommendation_ "), (B)

qualifications and other matters set forth therein, to such holders. A signed
copy of the written opinion of Barclays Capital Inc. rendered to the board of
directors of the Company will promptly be delivered to Parent, solely for
informational purposes, following receipt thereof by the Company. It is
understood and agreed that such opinion is for the benefit of the Companys
board of directors and may not be relied upon by Parent, Merger Sub 1 or
Merger Sub 2 or any other Person. The board of directors of the Company has
taken all action so that Parent will not be an "interested stockholder" or
prohibited from entering into or consummating a "business combination" with
the Company (in each case as such term is used in Section 203 of the DGCL) as
a result of the execution of this Agreement or the Voting Agreements or the
consummation of the transactions in the manner contemplated hereby or
thereby.

consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby, or in connection with the continuing operation of the business of the
Company and its Subsidiaries following the Effective Time, except those that
the failure to make or obtain would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect
or prevent, materially delay or materially impair the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any Voting Agreement.

 



-18- (ii) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the Voting
Agreements by the Company do not, and the consummation of the First Merger
and/or the Second Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and

default under, the certificate of incorporation or by-laws of the Company or
the comparable governing documents of any of its Subsidiaries, (B) with or
without notice, lapse of time or both, a breach or violation of, a termination
(or right of termination) or default under, the creation or acceleration of

to (1) any agreement, lease, license, contract, note, mortgage, indenture,
arrangement or other obligation (each, a " _Contract_ ") binding upon the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or, (2) assuming (solely with respect to
performance of this Agreement and consummation of the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby and by the Voting Agreements)
compliance with the matters referred to in _Section_ _ _ _5.1(d)(i)_ , any Law
to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is subject or (C) any change

transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any Voting Agreement.

provides retiree or post-employment medical, disability, life insurance or

defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code.

(ix) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has any obligation to provide,
and no Company Benefit Plan or other agreement provides any individual with
the right to, a gross up, indemnification, reimbursement or other payment for

Agreement.

the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(iv) As of the close of business on November 14, 2016, there were (A)

(B) no subordinated units of TMLP issued and outstanding and (C) 1,100,916
common units of TMLP reserved for issuance under the TMLP 2011 Long-Term

the outstanding equity interests of TMLP are duly authorized and validly
issued, free and clear of all Liens in accordance with TMLPs First Amended
and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership, dated April 21, 2011, as
amended (the " _TMLP Partnership Agreement_ ") and are fully paid (to the
extent required by TMLP Partnership Agreement) and non-assessable. Except as
set forth above in this _Section_ _ _ _5.2(b)(iv)_ , and for changes after the
date hereof in compliance with _Section_ _6.1(b)_ , as of the date
hereof, there are no equity interests in, or any securities convertible into
or exchangeable or exercisable for any equity interests in TMLP. Each
Subsidiary of TMLP is wholly-owned by TMLP.

 

(c) _Corporate Authority; Approval_. (i) Each of Parent, Merger Sub 1 and
Merger Sub 2 has all requisite corporate power and authority and has taken
all corporate action necessary in order to execute, deliver and perform its
obligations under this Agreement and the Voting Agreements and to consummate
the Merger, subject only to (A) the adoption of this Agreement by Parent as
the sole stockholder of Merger Sub 1 and the sole member of Merger Sub 2 (each
of which will occur promptly following the execution of this Agreement) and
(B) the approval of the issuance of Parent Shares in connection with the First
Merger by the affirmative vote, at a stockholders meeting duly called and
held for such purpose, of holders of a majority in voting power of the Parent
Shares present in person or by proxy at such meeting and entitled to vote on
such matter (the " _Requisite Parent Vote_ "). The Requisite Parent Vote is
the only vote of the holders of capital stock of Parent that is necessary
under applicable Law, NYSE rules, and Parents certificate of incorporation
and bylaws to approve the issuance of Parent Shares in the Merger. This
Agreement and the Voting Agreements have been duly executed and delivered by
Parent and constitute valid and binding agreements of Parent, Merger Sub 1 and
Merger Sub 2 enforceable against Parent, Merger Sub 1 and Merger Sub 2 in
accordance with their respective terms, subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity
Exception.

 



-36- (ii) The board of directors of Parent has (A) unanimously approved this
Agreement and the Voting Agreements and the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby, and resolved to recommend that the holders of
Parent Shares vote in favor of the issuance of Parent Shares required to be
issued pursuant to  _Article_ _ _ _IV_ (the " _Parent_ _Recommendation_ ")
and (B) directed that such matter be submitted to holders of Parent Shares for
their approval and (C) received the opinion of its financial advisor,
Goldman Sachs and Co. to the effect that, subject to the assumptions,
qualifications and limitations set forth in such opinion, as of the date of
such opinion, the Per Share Merger Consideration to be paid by Parent for each
Company Share pursuant to this Agreement is fair from a financial point of
view to Parent. It is understood and agreed that such opinion is for the
benefit of Parents board of directors and may not be relied upon by the
Company or any other Person.

the other transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, or in connection with
the continuing operation of the business of Parent and its Subsidiaries
following the Effective Time, except those that the failure to make or obtain

impair the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
any Voting Agreement.

 

(ii) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the Voting
Agreements by Parent, Merger Sub 1 and Merger Sub 2 do not, and the
consummation of the First Merger, the Second Merger (solely with respect to

contemplated hereby and thereby will not, constitute or result in (A) a breach
or violation of, or a default under, the certificate of incorporation or by-
laws of Parent or Merger Sub 1 or the comparable governing documents of any of
Parents other Subsidiaries (including Merger Sub 2), (B) with or without
notice, lapse of time or both, a breach or violation of, a termination (or

on any of the assets of Parent, Merger Sub 1 or Merger Sub 2 or any other
Subsidiary of Parent pursuant to (1) any Contract binding upon Parent, Merger
Sub 1 or Merger Sub 2 or any other Subsidiary of Parent or (2) assuming
(solely with respect to performance of this Agreement and consummation of the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and by the Voting
Agreements) compliance with the matters referred to in _Section_ _ _
_5.2(d)(i)_ , any Law to which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is subject
or (C) any change in the rights or obligations of any party under any

 



-37-  Contract binding upon Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, except, in the case
of clause (B) or (C) above, for any such breach, conflict violation,

(h) _Compliance with Laws_. The businesses of each of Parent and its
Subsidiaries are and have at all times since the Applicable Date been in

Effect or prevent, materially delay or materially impair the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any Voting Agreement.
Except with respect to regulatory matters covered by _Section_ _ _ _6.5_ , no
investigation or review by any Governmental Entity with respect to Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries is pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent,
threatened, nor has any Governmental Entity indicated an intention to conduct
the same, except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Parent and its
Subsidiaries (other than TMLP and its Subsidiaries) and, to the Knowledge of
Parent, TMLP and its Subsidiaries, each has obtained and is in compliance with
all Licenses necessary to conduct its business as presently conducted, except
those the absence of which would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to result in a Parent Material Adverse Effect or
prevent, materially delay or materially impair the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(i) _Takeover Statutes_. No Takeover Statute or any anti-takeover provision
in Parents certificate of incorporation or by-laws is applicable to Parent
or the Parent Shares to be issued in connection with this Agreement.

-40- (k) _Financing_. Substantially concurrently with the execution and delivery of
this Agreement, Parent has delivered to the Company true and correct copies
of a commitment letter, including all exhibits and schedules thereto (the "
_Commitment Letter_ ") (and a corresponding (x) customarily redacted
engagement letter and (y) customarily redacted fee letter, in each case
relating to the Commitment Letter) pursuant to which Goldman Sachs Bank USA
and Goldman Sachs Lending Partners LLC have committed to provide Parent with
financing in the amount set forth therein (the " _Financing_ ") for the
purpose of funding the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, subject to
the terms and conditions set forth in the Commitment Letter. As of the date
hereof, the Commitment Letter is in full force and effect to the knowledge of
Parent and is a legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent and to the
knowledge of Parent, each of the other parties thereto, subject to the
Bankruptcy and Equity Exception. As of the date of the Commitment Letter,
Parent has not entered into any agreement, side letter or other arrangement
relating to the financing of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement

Letter provided to the Company on the date hereof, and there are no conditions
precedent related to the funding of the full amount of the Financing, other
than as expressly set forth in the Commitment Letter. Parent has fully paid
any and all commitment fees or other fees required by the Commitment Letter to

satisfaction of the conditions to Closing in this Agreement and the accuracy
of the representations and warranties set forth in _Section_ _5.1_ , (i) no
event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both,
would reasonably be expected to constitute a default or breach on the part of
the Parent, or to Parents knowledge, any other party thereto under the
Commitment Letter, and (ii) Parent has no reason to believe that the
condition to the Financing set forth in the Commitment Letter will not be
satisfied or the Financing will not be made available to Parent on the Closing
Date. Assuming the accuracy of the representations set forth in _Section_
_5.1_ and the performance by the Company and its Subsidiaries of their
obligations under this Agreement, the net proceeds from the Financing,
together with cash otherwise available to Parent, will be sufficient to pay
the Cash Consideration and all other cash amounts (including amounts required
to repay or prepay all indebtedness outstanding under the Company Credit
Agreements (without giving effect to clause (E) of the definition of such
term) (other than the MLP Credit Agreement) and the Company Indentures
(without giving effect to clause (D) of the definition of such term) (other
than the MLP Indenture) to be paid in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Parent confirms that it is not
a condition to Closing or any of its other obligations under this Agreement
that Parent consummate the Financing.

(l) _Tax Matters_. As of the date of this Agreement, neither Parent, nor any
of its Affiliates has taken or agreed to take any action, nor does Parent have

the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement from qualifying as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

the Parent Reports.

(iv) Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has distributed stock of
another person, or has had its stock distributed by another person, during
the two year period prior to the date of this Agreement, in a transaction in
which the parties to such distribution treated the distribution as one to

(v) Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has participated in any
reportable or listed transaction within the meaning of Treasury Regulations

federal income tax purposes and the TMLP has satisfied the gross income
requirements of Section 7704(c) of the Code for each taxable year in which it

infringing, misappropriating, or otherwise violating, or has infringed,
misappropriated, or otherwise violated the valid and enforceable Intellectual
Property rights of any third party during the six year period immediately
preceding the date of this Agreement, and there are no pending, outstanding,
or, to Parents Knowledge, threatened written notices (including invitations
to take a license), actions, suits, claims, investigations or other legal
proceedings asserting the same.

(o) _Environmental_. Except as is not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect, to the Knowledge
of Parent, there are no conditions or occurrences involving Parent that would
reasonably be expected to result in any claim, liability or investigation to

applicable amounts, sufficient cash on hand and/or undrawn amounts immediately

action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Delaware law,
then the board of directors of the receiving party may,

_however_ , that if any disclosure made in reliance on this _Section_ _6.2(e)_
does not reaffirm the Company Recommendation (in the case of the Company) or
Parent Recommendation (in the case of Parent), such disclosure shall be deemed
to be an Adverse Company Recommendation Change or Adverse Parent
Recommendation Change, respectively, and, in the case of an Adverse
Company Recommendation Change Parent shall have the right to terminate this
Agreement as set forth in _Section_ _8.4(b)(i)_ , and, in the case of an
Adverse Parent Recommendation Change the Company shall have the right to
terminate this Agreement as set forth in _Section_ _8.3(b)(i)_.

(f) _Match Rights_. The board of directors of the Company, on the one hand,
and the board of directors of Parent, on the other hand, shall not take any
action set forth in _Section_ _ _ _6.2(d)_ unless it has first:

 

(i) caused the Company (in the case of the Companys board of directors) or

extent the other party so wishes to negotiate, during such four business day
period following delivery of the Notice of Superior Proposal (the " _Notice

wishes to propose in response to such Company Superior Proposal or Parent
Superior Proposal; and

 



-52- (iii) following the end of the Notice Period, determined in good faith after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor, that such
Company Acquisition Proposal or Parent Acquisition Proposal continues to
constitute a Company Superior Proposal or Parent Acquisition Proposal,
respectively, after taking into account any changes to which the other party
has committed in writing to make to this Agreement and any Voting Agreement,
and that the failure to take an action set forth in clause (x) or clause (y)
of _Section_ _ _ _6.2(d)_ would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
under Delaware law; _provided_ , _however_ , that if, during the Notice
Period, any revisions are made to the financial or other material terms of the
Company Superior Proposal or Parent Superior Proposal that is the subject of
such Notice of Superior Proposal, the notifying party shall deliver to the

notify the other promptly (but in no event later than 24 hours) after receipt
by such party (or any of its Representatives) of any Company Acquisition
Proposal (in the case of the Company) or Parent Acquisition Proposal (in the
case of Parent), or any inquiry, proposal or offer that would reasonably be
expected to lead to a Company Acquisition Proposal (in the case of the
Company) or Parent Acquisition Proposal (in the case of Parent), or any
request for information relating to such party or any of its Subsidiaries or
for access to the business, properties, assets, books or records of such
party or any of its Subsidiaries, in each case by any Person that is
reasonably likely to be considering or seeking to make, or has made within the
12 months preceding the date of this Agreement, a Company Acquisition
Proposal (in the case of the Company) or Parent Acquisition Proposal (in the
case of Parent), which notice shall include the material terms and conditions

Parent Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, proposal, offer or request (including
any amendments thereto) and the status of any discussions or negotiations with

_6.2_ ) and provide copies of all material written communications and draft

Intervening Event (in the case of Parent) occurs and (ii) the board of
directors of the Company (in the case of a Company Intervening Event) or

after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor, that
the failure to effect an Adverse Company Recommendation Change (in the case
of the Company) or an Adverse Parent Recommendation Change (in the case of
Parent) in response to such Company Intervening Event or Parent Intervening
Event would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Delaware law; 
_provided_ __ that the board of directors of the party in respect of which
such Company Intervening Event (in the case of the Company) or Parent
Intervening Event (in the case of Parent) has first (x) caused such party to
provide the other party at least four business days prior written notice of
its intent to effect such an Adverse Company Recommendation Change or Adverse
Parent Recommendation Change, which shall specify in reasonable detail the
circumstances related to such determination, (y) caused such party and its
Representatives to negotiate, to the extent the other party so wishes to
negotiate, during such four business day period following delivery of such

wishes to propose in response to such Company Intervening Event or Parent
Intervening Event and (z) after complying with _clause (x)_ and _clause (y)_
, determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel
and financial advisor, that the failure to effect an Adverse Company
Recommendation Change (in the case of the Company) or Adverse Parent
Recommendation Change (in the case of Parent) in response to such Company
Intervening Event or Parent Intervening Event continues to be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties under Delaware law after taking into account any
changes committed in writing to be made to this Agreement and any Voting
Agreement by the other party.

promptly prepare and file with the SEC the Registration Statement on Form S-4
to be filed with the SEC by Parent in connection with the issuance of Parent
Shares in the Merger, which shall include the Prospectus/Proxy Statement
(the " _S_ __ _-4 Registration Statement_"). Parent and the Company each
shall use its reasonable best efforts to have the Prospectus/Proxy Statement
cleared by the SEC as promptly as practicable after such filing, and Parent

the Company and Parent shall mail their respective Prospectus/Proxy Statement
to their respective stockholders. Each of the parties shall promptly furnish

required by applicable Law to be included in the Prospectus/Proxy Statement or
the S-4 Registration Statement so as to enable Parent to file the S-4
Registration Statement and the Company to file the Prospectus/Proxy Statement.
Each of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub 1 and Merger Sub 2 shall promptly
correct any information provided by it or any of its Representatives for use
in the Prospectus/Proxy Statement or the S-4 Registration Statement if and to
the extent that such information is discovered by Company, Parent, Merger Sub
1 or Merger Sub 2, as applicable, to be or to have become false or misleading
in any material respect. Each of the Company and Parent shall, as promptly as
practicable after the receipt thereof, provide the other party with copies of
any written comments and advise the other party of any oral comments with
respect to the Prospectus/Proxy Statement or the S-4 Registration Statement
received by such party from the SEC, including any request from the SEC for
amendments or supplements thereto, and shall provide the other with copies of
all other material or substantive correspondence between it and its
Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, on the other hand.

Registration Statement or responding to any comments of the SEC with respect
thereto, each of the Company and Parent shall provide the other party and its
counsel a reasonable opportunity to review such document or response
(including the proposed final version of such document or response) and
consider in good faith the comments of the other party in connection with any
such document or response. None of the Company, Parent or their respective
Representatives shall agree to participate in any material or substantive
meeting or conference (including by telephone) with the SEC, or any member of
the staff thereof, in respect of the Prospectus/Proxy Statement or the S-4
Registration Statement unless it consults with the other party in advance and,
to the extent permitted by the SEC, allows the other party to participate.
Parent shall advise the Company, promptly after receipt of notice thereof, of
the time of effectiveness of the S-4 Registration Statement, and the issuance
of any stop order relating thereto or the suspension of the qualification of
Parent Shares for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, and each of the
Company and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to have any such stop
order or suspension lifted, reversed or otherwise terminated.

(b) The Company and Parent each agrees, as to itself and its Subsidiaries,
that none of the information supplied or to be supplied by it or its
Subsidiaries for inclusion or incorporation by reference in (i) the S-4
Registration Statement will, at the time the S-4 Registration Statement
becomes effective under the Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading, and (ii) the Prospectus/Proxy
Statement and any amendment or supplement thereto will, at the date of mailing
to stockholders and at the times of the meeting of stockholders of each of
the Company and Parent to be held in connection with the Merger, contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. The Company and Parent will cause the S-4 Registration Statement
to comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable provisions
of the Securities Act and the rules and regulations thereunder.

(c) If at any time prior to the Requisite Company Vote and the Requisite
Parent Vote, any information relating to the Company or Parent, or any of
their respective Affiliates, officers or directors, should be discovered by
the Company or Parent that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement
to either of the Prospectus/Proxy Statement or the S-4 Registration Statement,
so that either of such documents would not include any misstatement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, the party that discovers such information shall promptly
notify the other party hereto and an appropriate amendment or supplement
describing such information shall promptly be prepared and filed with the SEC
and, to the extent required under applicable Law, disseminated to the
stockholders of each of the Company and Parent.

 

(d) Each of the Company and Parent shall, upon request, furnish to the other
all information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers and
(to the extent reasonably available to the applicable party) stockholders and
such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection

the Company, Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries, to the SEC or
the NYSE in connection with the Prospectus/Proxy Statement and the S-4
Registration Statement.

is reasonably necessary (A) to ensure that any required supplement or
amendment to the Prospectus/Proxy Statement is provided to the holders of

Stockholders Meeting, (B) to allow reasonable additional time to solicit
additional proxies necessary to obtain the Requisite Company Vote (including

postponed by more than 20 business days pursuant to this clause (B) in
connection with any individual commencement of a Company Acquisition Proposal

necessary to conduct the business of the Company Stockholders Meeting or (D)
otherwise where required to comply with applicable Law. Subject to _Section_
_ _ _6.2_ , the Companys board of directors shall recommend the adoption of

as the record date established by the Company for the Company Stockholders
Meeting) to consider and vote upon the issuance of Parent Shares in the Merger
and (ii) as soon as reasonably practicable (but in any event within 35 days)
following the commencement of the mailing of the Prospectus/Proxy Statement
pursuant to clause (i) above, convene and hold the Parent Stockholders
Meeting; _provided_ _that_ Parent may adjourn or postpone the Parent
Stockholders Meeting to a later date to the extent Parent believes

 



-58-  in good faith that such adjournment or postponement is reasonably necessary
(A) to ensure that any required supplement or amendment to the
Prospectus/Proxy Statement is provided to the holders of Parent Shares within
a reasonable amount of time in advance of the Parent Stockholders Meeting, (B)
to allow reasonable additional time to solicit additional proxies necessary to
obtain the Requisite Parent Vote (including after commencement of a Parent

days pursuant to this clause (B) in connection with any individual

advisable on its part to solicit such approval.

 

(c) Parent and the Company shall cooperate to schedule and convene the Parent
Stockholders Meeting and the Company Stockholders Meeting on the same date
and to establish the same record date for both the Parent Stockholders Meeting
and the Company Stockholders Meeting. Notwithstanding any Adverse Company

6.5. _Filings; Other Actions; Notification_.

(a) [RESERVED]

 

(b) _Cooperation_. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this
Agreement, the Company and Parent shall cooperate with each other and use
(and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to use) their respective
reasonable best efforts to take or cause to be taken all actions, and do or
cause to be done all things, reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its
part under this Agreement and applicable Laws to consummate and make
effective the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
as soon as practicable, including preparing and filing as promptly as
practicable all documentation to effect all necessary notices, reports and
other filings and to obtain as promptly as practicable all consents,
registrations, approvals, permits and authorizations necessary or advisable to
be obtained from any third party and/or any Governmental Entity in order to
consummate the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including filing a Notice and Report Form with the Federal Trade
Commission and the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice pursuant
to the HSR Act within 15 business days after the date of this Agreement;
_provided_ , _however_ , that (i) nothing in this Agreement, including this
_Section_ _ _ _6.5_ , will (and "reasonable best efforts" will in no event)
require, or be construed to require, Parent to

 



-59-  agree to or take any action (or consent to the Company or any Company
Subsidiary agreeing to take, or taking, any action) that would constitute a
Burdensome Condition. For purposes of this Agreement, a " _Burdensome
Condition_ " means any terms, conditions, liabilities, obligations or
commitments that would obligate or require Parent, the Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries to (A) proffer to or agree to sell, divest, lease,
license, transfer, dispose of or otherwise encumber or hold separate, any
assets, licenses, operations, rights, product lines, businesses or interest
therein of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (B) agree to any
material changes (including through a licensing arrangement) or restriction
on, or other impairment of Parents or the Companys ability to own or
operate, any assets, licenses, operations, rights, product lines, businesses
or interest therein of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, other than, in
the case of each of clause (A) and clause (B), for (1) any sales, divestments,
leases, licenses, transfers, disposals, encumbrances or holding separate of,
and (2) any agreements to any material changes, restrictions or impairments
on, any assets, licenses, operations, rights, product lines, businesses or
interest therein of Parent, the Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries, that generated no more than $25,000,000 of EBITDA, in the
aggregate (taking into account all proffers and agreements made pursuant to
this sentence), in the most recently completed fiscal year for which financial
information is available. The Company and its Subsidiaries shall not take or
agree to any of the actions set forth in clause (A) or clause (B) of the
definition of "Burdensome Condition" without the prior written consent of
Parent which, without limiting Parents obligations under this _Section
6.5(b)_ , may be granted or withheld in Parents sole discretion. To the
extent Parent so requests in writing (and solely to the extent of such written
request), the Company shall and shall cause its Subsidiaries to proffer,
consent and/or agree to any of the matters referred to in clause (A) or
clause (B) of the definition of "Burdensome Condition" to the extent such
proffer, consent or agreement is conditioned on the occurrence of the
Effective Time. Nothing in this Agreement shall require, or be construed to
require, Parent or any of its Affiliates to defend litigation or any similar
proceeding if the United States Department of Justice or the United States
Federal Trade Commission authorizes its staff to seek a
preliminary injunction or restraining order to enjoin consummation of the
Merger. If Parent determines to defend any litigation or similar proceeding
brought by the Federal Trade Commission or the Antitrust Division of the
Department of Justice or any state attorney general in connection with their
review (if any) of the Merger, Parent will promptly reimburse the Company for
any reasonable and documented expenses and costs (including out-of-pocket
auditors and attorneys fees and expenses) incurred in connection with the
Companys or its Subsidiaries or Representatives involvement therewith. The
Company and Parent will each request early termination of the waiting period
with respect to the Merger under the HSR Act. At the written request of
Parent, each of Parent and the Company shall, on a one time basis, (i) agree
to extend the waiting period with respect to the Merger under the HSR Act for
up to a further 30 days and/or (ii) pull and promptly refile the Notice and
Report Forms filed in respect of the Merger. Subject to applicable Laws
relating to the exchange of information, Parent shall have the right to direct
all matters with any Governmental Entity consistent with its obligations
hereunder; _provided_ _that_ each party hereto shall permit the other parties
to review in advance, and to the extent practicable each of Parent and the
Company will consult with the other on and consider in good faith the views
of the other in connection with, any proposed substantive communication to any
Governmental Entity in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including all of the information relating to
Parent or the Company, as the case may be, and any

 



-60-  of their respective Subsidiaries, that appears in any filing made with, or
written materials submitted to, any Governmental Entity in connection with the
Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including
the Prospectus/Proxy Statement). In exercising the foregoing rights, each of
the parties hereto shall act reasonably and as promptly as practicable.

 

(c) _Information_. The Company and Parent each shall, upon request by the
other, use reasonable best efforts to furnish the other with all information
concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers and stockholders and
such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection
with the Prospectus/Proxy Statement, the S-4 Registration Statement or any
other statement, filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of Parent,
the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any third party and/or
any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ , that the limitations set forth in
the provisos to _Section_ _ _ _6.7_ shall apply to the Companys and
Parents obligations, _mutatis mutandis_. In addition, each of the Company
and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to provide the information
concerning it necessary to enable the Company and Parent to prepare required
pro forma financial statements and related footnotes in connection with the
preparation of the Prospectus/Proxy Statement and the S-4 Registration
Statement.

 

(d) _Status_.

 

(i) Subject to applicable Law and as required by any Governmental Entity, the
Company and Parent each shall keep the other apprised of the status of
matters relating to completion of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including promptly furnishing the other with copies of written
notices or other communications received by Parent or the Company, as the case
may be, or any of its Subsidiaries, from any Governmental Entity with respect
to such transactions. The Company and Parent each shall give prompt notice to
the other of any change, fact or condition of which it becomes aware that
would be reasonably likely to result in a Company Material Adverse Effect or
a Parent Material Adverse Effect, respectively, or any breach by such party of
its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements hereunder that would
reasonably be expected to result in the failure of any condition to the other
partys obligations to effect the Merger hereunder. Subject to _Section_ _ _
_6.5(b)_ , neither the Company nor Parent shall permit any of its officers or
any other representatives or agents to participate in any substantive meeting
or discussion with any Governmental Entity in respect of any filings,
investigation or other inquiry relating to the transactions contemplated
hereby unless it consults with the other party in advance and, to the extent
permitted by such Governmental Entity, gives the other party the opportunity
to attend and participate thereat.

(ii) Without limiting the generality of _Section_ _ _ _6.5(b)_ or _Section_ _
_ _6.5(d)(i)_ , the Company and Parent shall each promptly advise the other
party if it obtains knowledge of (A) any written notice or other written
communication from any counterparty to a Contract with regard to any action,
consent, approval or waiver that is required to be taken or obtained with
respect to such Contract in connection with the consummation of the Merger
(and provide a copy thereof) or (B) any written notice or other written
communication from any other Person alleging that the consent of such Person
is or may be required in connection with the Merger (and provide a copy
thereof). The Company shall notify Parent as promptly as practicable of any
written notice or other written communication received after the date of this
Agreement from any party

 



-61-  to any Material Contract to the effect that such party has terminated or
intends to terminate or otherwise materially adversely modify its relationship
with the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, a partys failure to comply with this _Section_ _6.5(d)(ii)_
(provided that such failure was not in bad faith) shall not constitute a
failure of any condition set forth in _Article _ _VII_ to be satisfied, or
otherwise provide any other party the right not to effect the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, except to the extent that any other provision
of this Agreement independently provides such right.

 

6.6. _Taxation_.

(a) The parties intend to adopt this Agreement and the Merger as a plan of
reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code. Notwithstanding any other
provision in this Agreement, the Company Disclosure Letter or the Parent
Disclosure Letter to the contrary, each of the parties hereto shall, and
shall cause each of their respective Affiliates to, use its reasonable best
efforts to (i) not take any action that would reasonably be expected to
prevent or impede the treatment of the Merger as a "reorganization" within
the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and (ii) cooperate with one another
in obtaining the opinion from Davis Polk and Wardwell LLP (or another nationally
recognized law firm selected by the Company) described in _Section_ _7.3(c)_.
Parent and the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to execute
and deliver to the counsel of Parent and the Company officers certificates
containing appropriate representations at such time or times as may be
reasonably requested by such counsel (each, a " _Tax Representation Letter_ ")
in connection with the delivery of the opinion described in _Section_ _7.3(c)_
(in each case, only to the extent that Parent or Company, as the case may be,
in good faith reasonably believes that it is able to make such representations
truthfully).

(b) Unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Company and Parent, then
notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Parent, the Surviving
Corporation and Merger Sub 2 shall not consummate the Second Merger unless
either Parent or the Company provides notice prior to the Closing, to the
other party that it elects to have the Second Merger consummated (the "
_Second Merger Election_ ") because it reasonably believes, based upon the
receipt of an opinion of Davis Polk and Wardwell LLP (or another nationally
recognized law firm selected by the Company), that the Second Merger is
necessary to enable the Merger to qualify as a "reorganization" within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

 

(c) After the date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time, Parent
and the Company shall cooperate in good faith with respect to Tax matters
relevant to integrating their respective Subsidiaries and operations.

6.7. _Access and Reports_. Subject to applicable Law, upon reasonable notice,
the Company shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) afford Parents
Representatives reasonable access, during normal business hours throughout the
period prior to the Effective Time, to its employees, properties, books,
Contracts and records and, during such period, shall (and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to) furnish promptly to Parent all information concerning its
business, properties and personnel as may reasonably be requested, 
_provided_ that no investigation pursuant to this _Section_ _ _ _6.7_ shall
affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty made by the
Company, Parent, Merger Sub 1 or Merger Sub 2 herein, and _provided_ , 
_further_ , that the foregoing shall not require the Company (i) to permit any
inspection, or to

 



-62-  disclose any information, that in the reasonable judgment of the Company
would result in the disclosure of any trade secrets of third parties or
violate any of its obligations with respect to confidentiality if the Company
shall have used reasonable best efforts to obtain the consent of such third
party to such inspection or disclosure, (ii) to permit any environmental
sampling on any of the properties owned, leased or operated by it or any of
its Subsidiaries or (iii) to disclose any privileged information of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries. All requests for information made pursuant
to this _Section_ _ _ _6.7_ shall be directed to the executive officer or
other Person designated by the Company. All such information shall be governed
by the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.

 

6.8. _Stock Exchange Listing and Delisting_. Parent shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause the Parent Shares to be issued in the Merger to be
approved for listing on the NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance,
prior to the Closing Date. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall cooperate
with Parent and use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions, and do or cause to be done all things, reasonably
necessary, proper or advisable on its part under applicable Laws and rules and
policies of the NYSE to enable the delisting by the Surviving Corporation of
the Company Shares from the NYSE and the deregistration of the Company Shares
under the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time,
and in any event no more than 10 days after the Closing Date.

 

6.9. _Publicity_. The initial press release regarding the Merger shall be a
joint press release, and thereafter, unless an Adverse Company Recommendation
Change or an Adverse Parent Recommendation Change shall have occurred, and
except with respect to press releases and other public statements in
connection with _Section 6.2_ (to the extent expressly permitted pursuant to 
_Section 6.2_ ), the Company and Parent each shall consult with the other
prior to issuing any press releases or otherwise making public announcements
with respect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and prior to making any filings with any third party and/or any
Governmental Entity (including any national securities exchange or interdealer
quotation service) with respect thereto, except as may be required by Law or
by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with or rules of any
national securities exchange or interdealer quotation service or by the
request of any Governmental Entity. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence,
without prior consultation, each party (a) may, subject to  _Section 6.2_ ,
communicate information that is not confidential information of any other
party with financial analysts, investors and media representatives in the
ordinary course of business and in a manner consistent with its past practice
in compliance with applicable Law and (b) may disseminate information

any of its Subsidiaries with: (A) during the period commencing at the
Effective Time and ending on the 12 month anniversary of the Effective Time,

the Effective Time and ending on

 



-63-  the December 31 of the year in which the Effective Time occurs, (x) target

no less favorable than those provided by the Company and its Subsidiaries to
such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time and (y)

welfare benefits) that are no less favorable in the aggregate than those
provided by the Company and its Subsidiaries to such Continuing Employee
immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (C) during the period commencing
on January 1 of the year following the year in which the Effective
Time occurs and ending on the 12 month anniversary of the Effective Time, (x)

that are substantially comparable to those provided to similarly situated
employees of Parent and (y) retirement and welfare benefits (other than
defined benefit plan and retiree welfare benefits) that are substantially
comparable in the aggregate to those provided to similarly situated employees
of Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that until such time as Parent fully
integrates the Continuing Employees into its plans, participation in the
Company Benefit Plans shall be deemed to satisfy the foregoing standards, it
being understood that the Continuing Employees may commence participating in
the plans of Parent on different dates following the Effective Time with
respect to different benefit plans; _provided_ , _further_ , that the
requirements of this sentence shall not apply to Continuing Employees who
are covered by a collective bargaining agreement.

Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents, (B) use its reasonable
best efforts to give each Continuing Employee credit for the plan year in
which the Effective Time occurs towards applicable deductibles and annual out-
of-pocket limits for medical expenses incurred prior to the Effective Time for
which payment has been made and (C) give each Continuing Employee service
credit for such Continuing Employees employment with the Company and its
Subsidiaries for purposes of vesting, benefit accrual and eligibility to
participate under each applicable Parent benefit plan, as if such service had
been performed with Parent, except for benefit accrual under defined benefit
pension plans, or to the extent it would result in a duplication of benefits.

 

(c) If requested in writing by Parent at least five business days prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall take (or cause to be taken) all actions
reasonably determined by Parent to be necessary or appropriate to terminate,
effective not later than the business day immediately prior to the Effective
Time, any Company Benefit Plans that contain a cash or deferred
arrangement intended to qualify under Section 401(k) of the Code. In the
event that Parent requests that such plan(s) be terminated, (i) the Company

form and substance of which shall be subject to review and approval by
Parent) not later than the business day immediately preceding the Effective
Time and (ii) Parent shall permit each eligible Continuing Employee to become
a participant in an "eligible retirement plan" (within the meaning of Section
401(a)(31) of the Code) of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (the " _Parent
401(k) Plan_ ") and make rollover contributions of "eligible rollover
distributions" (within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code,
including, to the extent permitted by the Parent 401(k) Plan, all participant
loans) in cash or notes (in the case of participant loans and to the extent
permitted by the Parent 401(k) Plan) in an amount equal to the eligible
rollover distribution portion of the account balance distributed to each such
Continuing Employee from such plan to the Parent 401(k) Plan.

amendment of any particular Company Benefit Plan, (B) prevent Parent, the
Company or any of their Affiliates from amending or terminating any of their
benefit plans in accordance their terms, (C) prevent Parent, the Company or
any of their Affiliates, after the Effective Time, from terminating the
employment of any Continuing Employee, or (D) create any third party
beneficiary rights in any employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
any beneficiary or dependent thereof, or any collective bargaining
representative thereof, with respect to the compensation, terms and conditions
of employment and/or benefits that may be provided to any Continuing Employee
by Parent, the Company or any of their Affiliates or under any benefit plan
which Parent, the Company or any of their Affiliates may maintain.

Effective Time, Parent shall increase the size of its board of directors in
order to cause Paul Foster and Jeff Stevens to be appointed to Parents board

and hold harmless each present and former director and officer of the Company
or any

of its Subsidiaries and each other Person who, at the request or for the
benefit of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, is or was previously
serving as a director or officer, MLP employee or fiduciary of any other
Person or any benefit plan of the Company or any benefit plan of any of the
Companys Subsidiaries (in each case, when acting in such capacity),
determined as of the Effective Time (the " _Indemnified Parties_ "), from and
against any costs or expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines,
losses, claims, damages, penalties, amounts paid in settlement (including all
interest, assessments and other charges) or liabilities incurred in connection
with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of matters
existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or
claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent that
the Company or the applicable Subsidiary of the Company would have been
permitted under Delaware law and under its certificate of incorporation or by-
laws or other governing documents in effect on the date of this Agreement to
indemnify such Person (and Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall also
advance fees, costs and expenses (including attorneys fees and disbursements)
as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, _provided_
the Person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay
such advances if it is ultimately determined by a final and nonappealable
judicial determination that such Person is not entitled to indemnification
hereunder or thereunder).

 



-65- (b) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under _paragraph
(a)_ of this  _Section_ _ _ _6.13_ , upon learning of any such claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation, shall promptly notify Parent thereof, but
the failure to so notify shall not relieve Parent or the Surviving Corporation
of any liability it may have to such Indemnified Party except to the extent
such failure materially prejudices the indemnifying party.

(c) For six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be
maintained in effect provisions in the Surviving Corporations certificate of
incorporation and bylaws (or in such documents of any successor to the
business of the Surviving Corporation (including, for clarity the Surviving
Company, if applicable)) regarding elimination of liability of directors,
indemnification of directors, officers, employees, fiduciaries and agents and
advancement of fees, costs and expenses that are no less advantageous to the
intended beneficiaries than the corresponding provisions in existence on the
date of this Agreement. From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to honor and comply with their
respective obligations under any indemnification agreement with any
Indemnified Party in effect as of (and disclosed to Parent prior to) the date
hereof, and not amend, repeal or otherwise modify any such agreement in any
manner that would adversely affect any right of any Indemnified Party
thereunder.

(d) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall, and if the Company is
unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective
Time to, obtain and fully pay for "tail" insurance policies (providing only
for the Side A coverage for Indemnified Parties where the existing policies
also include Side B coverage for the Company) with a claims period of at least
six years from and after the Effective Time with respect to any claim related
to any period of time at or prior to the Effective Time from an insurance
carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Companys current
insurance carrier with respect to directors and officers liability insurance
and fiduciary liability insurance (collectively, " _D andO Insurance_") with
benefits and levels of coverage no less favorable in any material respect to
the Indemnified Parties than the Companys existing policies with respect to
matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including in
connection with this Agreement or the transactions or actions contemplated
hereby); _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the Company expend
for such policies a premium amount in excess of the amount set forth in 
_Section_ _ _ _6.13(d)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter. If the Company and
the Surviving Corporation for any reason fail to obtain such "tail" insurance
policies as of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, continue to maintain in
effect for a period of at least six years from and after the Effective Time
the DandO Insurance in place as of the date of this Agreement with benefits and
levels of coverage no less favorable in any material respect to the
Indemnified Parties than that provided in the Companys existing policies as
of the date of this Agreement, or the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, use reasonable best efforts to
purchase comparable DandO Insurance for such six-year period with benefits and
levels of coverage at least as favorable to the Indemnified Parties as
provided in the Companys existing policies as of the date of this
Agreement), _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall Parent or the
Surviving Corporation be required to expend for such policies an annual
premium amount in excess of 300% of the annual premiums currently paid by the
Company for such insurance; and, _provided_ _further_ that if the annual
premia of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, the Surviving
Corporation shall obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a
cost not exceeding such amount.

 



-66- (e) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) shall consolidate with or merge into any other
corporation or entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation
or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) shall transfer all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any individual, corporation
or other entity, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made
so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation
(including, for clarity, the Surviving Company, if applicable) shall assume
all of the obligations set forth in this _Section_ _ _ _6.13_.

(f) The provisions of this  _Section_ _ _ _6.13_ are intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties.

 

(g) The rights of the Indemnified Parties under this _Section_ _ _ _6.13_
shall be in addition to any rights such Indemnified Parties may have under
the certificate of incorporation or by-laws of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, or under any applicable Contracts or Laws.

Subsidiaries of any amounts outstanding under any Company Credit Agreement
(other than the MLP Credit Agreement) on or after the Closing Date (and in

advisable or desirable to (i) satisfy on a timely basis all terms and
conditions applicable to Parent and Parents Subsidiaries set

 



-69-  forth in the Commitment Letter that are within its control (other than, for

maintain in effect the Commitment Letter and negotiate and enter into
definitive agreements with respect thereto on the terms and conditions
contemplated by the Commitment Letter and (iii) subject to the other terms
and provisions of this Agreement, to consummate the Financing at the Closing

that, notwithstanding clauses (i) and (ii) above, Parent may substitute one or
more other debt financing contemplated by the Commitment Letter, whether with
the same and/or alternative financing sources (any such substitute financing,
a " _Permitted Alternative Financing_ "), so long as such substitution does
not reduce the aggregate amount of Financing and would not reasonably be

event within three business days) (A) of any breach or default of the
Commitment Letter by any party to the Commitment Letter of which Parent
becomes aware, (B) if and when Parent becomes aware that any portion of the

Parent will keep the Company informed on a reasonably current basis and in
reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to arrange the Financing.
Parent will not replace (except with Permitted Alternative Financing), amend
or waive the Commitment Letter without the Companys prior written consent if
such replacement, amendment or waiver reduces the aggregate amount of the
Financing or amends the Financing, in each case, in a manner that
would reasonably be expected to delay or prevent the Closing or make the
timely funding of the Financing materially less likely to occur to the extent
needed to consummate the Merger (it being understood that Parent may amend or
supplement the Commitment Letter (and the related fee and engagement letters)
on one or more occasions to add additional arrangers, bookrunners, agents,
other titled persons and lenders in accordance with the terms of the

agreement relating thereto) expire or are terminated or become unavailable
prior to the Closing Date, in whole or in part, for any reason, and such
portion is reasonably required to fund the amounts contemplated to be paid by
Parent

 



-70-  pursuant to this Agreement, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts
promptly to arrange for alternative financing (" _Required Alternative
Financing_ " and together with Permitted Alternative Financing, the "
_Alternative Financing_ ") (which shall not, without the prior written consent
of the Company, impose any new or additional condition or otherwise expand any
condition to the receipt of the Financing to the extent such new, additional
or expanded condition would cause the Financing to be materially less likely
to occur to the extent needed to consummate the Merger) to replace the
financing contemplated by such expired, terminated, or unavailable commitment
or arrangement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, nothing contained in this _Section_ _6.17_ shall require, and in no
event shall the reasonable best efforts of Parent be deemed or construed to
require, Parent to pay any fees or any interest rates applicable to the
Financing in excess of those contemplated by the Commitment Letter and the
related fee letter (including the market flex provisions) and engagement
letter or require Parent to agree to other terms and conditions materially
less favorable to Parent than those set forth in the Financing. Parent and the
Merger Subs shall deliver to the Company true and correct copies of all
contracts or other arrangements pursuant to which any alternative source
shall have committed to provide any portion of any Required Alternative
Financing.

 

(c) The Company shall use and cause its Subsidiaries to use its and their

other agreement relating to the Financing, or the performance thereof or the
financings contemplated thereby shall, except as specifically set forth in the
Commitment Letter, be exclusively governed by, and construed in accordance

have the effect of applying the laws of, or directing a matter to, another
jurisdiction, and each party agrees not to bring or support any Person in any
action of any kind or description, whether in law or in equity, whether in
contract or in tort or otherwise, against any of the Financing Sources in any

-82- (b) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY VOTING AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED
AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN
RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING
TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY VOTING AGREEMENT, OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY
THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY VOTING AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES
THAT (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS
REPRESENTED TO SUCH PARTY, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD
NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (II)
EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER,
(III) EACH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (IV) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN
INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE VOTING AGREEMENTS BY, AMONG OTHER
THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS  _SECTION_ _ _ _9.5_.
Each party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives any right such party
may have to a trial by jury in respect of any litigation (whether in law or in
equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise) involving the Financing
Sources or directly or indirectly arising out of or relating in any way to the
Financing, the Commitment Letter or any other agreement relating to the
Financing or the performance thereof or the financings contemplated thereby.

(c) The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that
any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that
the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement in the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware, without the necessity of proving the inadequacy of money damages as
a remedy (and each party hereby waives any requirement for the securing or
posting of any bond in connection with such remedy), this being in addition
to any other remedy to which such party is entitled at Law or in equity. The
parties further agree that (x) by seeking the remedies provided for in this
_Section 9.5(c)_ , a party shall not in any respect waive its right to seek
any other form of relief that may be available to a party under this
Agreement, including, subject to _Section 8.5(d)_ , monetary damages in the
event that this Agreement has been terminated or in the event that the
remedies provided for in this _Section 9.5(c)_ are not available or otherwise
are not granted and (y) nothing contained in this _Section 9.5(c)_ shall
require any party to institute any proceeding for (or limit any partys right
to institute any proceeding for) specific performance under this _Section
9.5(c)_ before exercising any termination right under _Article VIII_ (and
pursuing damages after such termination) nor shall the commencement of any
action pursuant to this _Section 9.5(c)_ or anything contained in this
_Section 9.5(c)_ restrict or limit any partys right to terminate this
Agreement in accordance with the terms of _Article VIII_ or pursue any
other remedies under this Agreement that may be available then or thereafter.

Company Disclosure Letter, the Parent Disclosure Letter, the Voting

Parent and the Company (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ") constitute the
entire agreement, and supersede all other prior agreements, understandings,
representations and warranties both written and oral, among the parties, with
respect to the subject matter of this Agreement. EACH PARTY HERETO AGREES
THAT, EXCEPT FOR THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES CONTAINED IN THIS
AGREEMENT, NONE OF PARENT, MERGER SUB 1, MERGER SUB 2, OR THE COMPANY MAKES
ANY OTHER REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, AND EACH HEREBY DISCLAIMS ANY OTHER
REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, OR AS TO THE ACCURACY OR

RESPECT TO ANY ONE OR MORE OF THE FOREGOING.

 

9.8. _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except as provided in _Section_ _ _
_6.13_ ( _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_), Parent,
Merger Sub 1, Merger Sub 2 and the Company hereby agree that their respective
representations, warranties and covenants set forth herein are solely for the
benefit of the other party hereto, in accordance with and subject to the
terms of this Agreement and this Agreement is not intended to, and does not,
confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies
hereunder, including the right to rely upon the representations and
warranties set forth herein. The parties hereto further agree that the rights
of third party beneficiaries under _Section 6.13_ shall not arise unless and
until the Effective Time occurs. The representations and warranties in this
Agreement are the product of negotiations among the parties hereto and are for
the sole benefit of the parties hereto. Any inaccuracies in such
representations and warranties are subject to waiver by the parties hereto
in accordance with _Section_ _ _ _9.3_ without notice or liability to any
other Person. In some instances, the representations and warranties in this
Agreement may represent an allocation among the parties hereto of
risks associated with particular matters regardless of the Knowledge of any
of the parties hereto. Consequently, Persons other than the parties hereto may
not rely upon the representations and warranties in this Agreement as
characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this
Agreement or as of any other date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each of the
Financing Sources shall be an express third party beneficiary of and shall be
entitled to rely on this sentence of _Section 9.8_ , _Section 8.5(d)_ , the
last sentence of _Section 9.2_ , the last sentence of _Section 9.5(a)_ , the
last sentence of _Section 9.5(b)_ and _Section 9.15_ and each of the Financing
Sources may enforce such provisions.

 



-85- 9.9. _Obligations of Parent and of the Company_. Whenever this Agreement
requires Merger Sub 1, Merger Sub 2 or any other Subsidiary of Parent to take
any action, such requirement shall be deemed to include an undertaking on the
part of Parent to cause Merger Sub 1, Merger Sub 2 or such other Subsidiary to
take such action. Whenever this Agreement requires a Subsidiary of the
Company to take any action, such requirement shall be deemed to include an
undertaking on the part of the Company to cause such Subsidiary to take such
action and, after the Effective Time, on the part of the Surviving
Corporation to cause such Subsidiary to take such action.

9.10. _Transfer Taxes_. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration and other such Taxes and fees (including penalties and interest)
incurred in connection with the Merger shall be paid by Parent, Merger Sub 1
and Merger Sub 2 when due, and Parent, Merger Sub 1 and Merger Sub 2 will
indemnify the Company against liability for any such Taxes.

9.11. _Definitions_. Each of the terms set forth in _Annex_ _ _ _A_ is
defined in the Section of this Agreement set forth opposite such term.

9.12.  _Severability_. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed
severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions of this
Agreement. If any provision of this Agreement, or the application of such
provision to any Person or any circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable, (a)
a suitable and equitable provision shall be substituted therefor in order to
carry out, so far as may be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of
such invalid or unenforceable provision and (b) the remainder of this
Agreement and the application of such provision to other Persons or
circumstances shall not be affected by such invalidity or unenforceability,
nor shall such invalidity or unenforceability affect the validity or
enforceability of such provision, or the application of such provision, in any
other jurisdiction.

 

9.13. _Interpretation; Construction_. (a) The table of contents and headings
herein are for convenience of reference only, do not constitute part of this

Section or Exhibit, such reference shall be to a Section of or Exhibit to
this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. Whenever the words "include,"
"includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to
be followed by the words "without limitation." References to any statute,
rule, regulation, law or Law shall be deemed to refer to all applicable Laws
as amended or supplemented from time to time and to any rules, regulations and
interpretations promulgated thereunder. References to any agreement or
Contract are to that agreement or Contract as amended, modified or
supplemented from time to time, in accordance with its terms. References to
any Person include the successors and permitted assigns of that Person.
References to a "party" or the "parties" means a party or the parties to this
Agreement unless the context otherwise requires.

 

(b) The parties have participated jointly in negotiating and drafting this
Agreement. In the event that an ambiguity or a question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly
by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or
disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provision of
this Agreement.

 



-86- (c) Each party to this Agreement has or may have set forth information in its
respective Disclosure Letter in a section of such Disclosure Letter that
corresponds to the section of this Agreement to which it relates. The fact
that any item of information is disclosed in a Disclosure Letter to this
Agreement shall not be construed to mean that such information is required to
be disclosed by this Agreement.

9.14. _Assignment_. This Agreement shall not be assignable by operation of
Law or otherwise; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent may designate, by
written notice to the Company, (i) another wholly-owned direct or indirect
Subsidiary that is a Delaware corporation in lieu of Merger Sub 1, in which
event all references herein to Merger Sub 1 shall be deemed references to such
other Subsidiary, except that all representations and warranties made herein
with respect to Merger Sub 1 as of the date of this Agreement shall be
deemed representations and warranties made with respect to such other
Subsidiary as of the date of such designation or (ii) another wholly-owned
direct or indirect Subsidiary that is a Delaware limited liability company in
lieu of Merger Sub 2, in which event all references herein to Merger Sub 2
shall be deemed references to such other Subsidiary, except that all
representations and warranties made herein with respect to Merger Sub 2 as of
the date of this Agreement shall be deemed representations and warranties
made with respect to such other Subsidiary as of the date of such designation;
_provided_ that no such designation shall relieve any such Person of its
obligations hereunder, (ii) impose any additional or incremental non-
_de minimis_ obligation, or otherwise have any non- _de minimis_ adverse
effect, on the Company or any of its stockholders, or (iii) impede or delay
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
otherwise impede the rights of the Company or the stockholders of the Company
under this Agreement. Any purported assignment in violation of this Agreement
is void.

 

9.15. _No Recourse to Financing Sources_. Notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary, without in any way limiting the rights of the Company against
Parent or the Merger Subs (including the right to sue Parent and the Merger
Subs to compel it to seek specific performance of the Financing Sources
obligations under the Commitment Letter), the Company acknowledges
and agrees, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates and each of its and its
Affiliates respective former, current or future general or limited partners,
stockholders, managers, members, controlling persons, agents or
Representatives (collectively, the " _Company Parties_ ") that the Financing
Sources shall be subject to no liability or claims to the Company Parties in
connection with the Financing or in any way relating to this Agreement or any
of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, whether at law, in
equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise.
