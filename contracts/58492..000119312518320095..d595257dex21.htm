STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT

 

THIS STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT (this " _Agreement_ "), dated as of November 6,
2018, is made by and among (i) Leggett and Platt, Incorporated, a Missouri
corporation (" _Buyer_ "), (ii) Elite Comfort Solutions, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (the " _Company_ "), and (iii) Elite Comfort Solutions LP, a
Delaware limited partnership (" _Seller_ "). Capitalized terms used and not
otherwise defined herein have the meanings set forth in _ARTICLE_ __ _ XII_
below.

 

WHEREAS, Seller owns all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of the
Company (collectively, the " _Shares_ ");

 

WHEREAS, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, Buyer desires to purchase from Seller, and Seller desires to sell
to Buyer, all of the Shares;

WHEREAS, the respective boards of managers or directors or other governing
bodies, as applicable, of Seller, the Company and Buyer have approved this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, upon the terms and subject
to the conditions set forth herein; and

 

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and
as a condition and inducement to Buyers willingness to enter into this
Agreement, (i) Seller and certain equityholders of Seller are entering into
restrictive covenant agreements by and between Seller or each such
equityholder and Buyer, which shall become effective as of the Closing
(collectively, the " _Restrictive Covenant Agreements_ ") and (ii) the
Specified Employees are entering into new employment agreements by and between
each Specified Employee and the Company or one of its Subsidiaries regarding
the employment of each such Specified Employee, which shall become effective
as of the Closing.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual
representations, warranties and covenants set forth herein, and intending to
be legally bound, the parties agree as follows:

 

ARTICLE I

 

PURCHASE AND SALE OF SHARES

 

1.01 _Purchase and Sale of Shares_. On and subject to the terms and
conditions contained herein, at the Closing, Seller will sell, assign,
transfer and convey to Buyer, and Buyer will purchase and acquire from Seller,
all right, title and interest in and to the Shares free and clear of all Liens
(other than restrictions imposed under applicable securities Laws) in
exchange for the payment of the Purchase Price as set forth in this _ARTICLE_
__ _ I_.

 

1.02 _Calculation of Estimated Purchase Price_. At least four (4) Business
Days prior to the Closing, the Company will prepare and deliver to Buyer (a)
an estimated unaudited balance sheet of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of
the Adjustment Calculation Time (the " _Estimated Closing Balance Sheet_ ")
and (b) a statement (the " _Estimated Closing Statement_ ") setting forth a
calculation of (i) the estimated Closing Net Working Capital (the " _Estimated
Closing Net Working Capital_ "), (ii) the estimated Closing Cash (the "
_Estimated Closing Cash_ "), (iii) the estimated Closing Indebtedness
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, any earnout

   

 Liabilities under the HSM APA) (the " _Estimated Closing Indebtedness_ "),
(iv) the estimated Transaction Expenses (the " _Estimated Transaction
Expenses_ "), and (v) the Companys calculation of the Estimated Purchase
Price derived from the foregoing. The Estimated Closing Balance Sheet and the
Estimated Closing Statement will be prepared, and the Estimated Closing Net
Working Capital, the Estimated Closing Cash, the Estimated Closing
Indebtedness, and the Estimated Transaction Expenses will be determined, in
each case, in good faith, on a consolidated basis in accordance with the
definitions set forth in this Agreement, using the same accounting methods,
assumptions, policies, principles, practices and procedures, with consistent
classifications, judgments and estimation methodology, as were used in the
preparation of the Latest Balance Sheet except, in the case of
the calculation of Net Working Capital, as set forth on _Schedule A_.
Following the delivery of the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet and the
Estimated Closing Statement, the Company shall, upon the written request of
Buyer, provide Buyer and its accountants with reasonable supporting
documentation for the calculations included therein and make the relevant
financial records of the Company and its Subsidiaries relating thereto
reasonably available to Buyer and its accountants in connection therewith.

1.03 _Closing Payments_. Subject to the full satisfaction (or waiver in
accordance with  _ARTICLE_ __ _ VIII_) of the closing conditions set forth
in _ARTICLE_ __ _ VIII_ (other than the conditions that by their nature only
can be satisfied by actions taken at the Closing, but subject to
the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions at the Closing), at the
Closing, Buyer will make the payments set forth below:

 

(a) At the Closing, Buyer will deliver an amount equal to the Estimated
Purchase Price _minus_ the Adjustment Escrow Deposit Amount to Seller by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to the account designated by Seller no
later than two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date.

 

(b) At the Closing, Buyer will deliver the Adjustment Escrow Deposit Amount
to the Escrow Agent by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
escrow account designated by the Escrow Agent no later than two (2) Business
Days prior to the Closing Date (the " _Adjustment Escrow Account_ ") and
established pursuant to the terms of an escrow agreement to be dated as of
the Closing Date and substantially in the form attached as _Exhibit A_ (the "
_Adjustment Escrow Agreement_ "), among Buyer, Seller and the Escrow Agent.
The Adjustment Escrow Account will be maintained separately from other funds
held by the Escrow Agent and will be Buyers sole and exclusive source of
recovery for any amounts owing to Buyer or, following the Closing, the Company
or its Subsidiaries under  _Section_ __ _ 1.04_.

(c) At the Closing, Buyer will pay, on behalf of the Company and
its Subsidiaries, all Estimated Transaction Expenses to such Persons as they
are owed by wire transfer of immediately available funds to accounts
designated in invoices delivered by the Company at least two (2) Business Days
prior to the Closing Date.

(d) At the Closing, Buyer will pay, on behalf of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, all amounts required to be paid under the payoff letters
delivered pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 6.08_ in order to fully discharge the
Indebtedness owed to the Persons thereunder, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to the accounts designated in such payoff letters.

1.04 _Post-Closing Purchase Price Adjustment_. Following the Closing
Date, the Estimated Purchase Price will be adjusted, if at all, dollar-for-
dollar as set forth below:

 

(a) Buyer will prepare and deliver to Seller within sixty (60) days after
the Closing Date (i) an unaudited balance sheet of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as of the Adjustment Calculation Time (the " _Closing Balance
Sheet_ ") and (ii) a statement (the " _Closing Statement_ ") setting forth a
calculation of (1) the Closing Net Working Capital, (2) the Closing Cash, (3)
the Closing Indebtedness, (4) the Transaction Expenses, (5) Buyers
calculation of the Final Purchase Price derived from the foregoing, and (6)
with respect to each of the foregoing, the changes in such amounts from the
corresponding amounts on the Estimated Closing Statement. The Closing Balance
Sheet and Closing Statement will be prepared, and the Closing Net Working
Capital, Closing Cash, Closing Indebtedness and Transaction Expenses will be
determined, in each case, in good faith, on a consolidated basis in accordance
with the definitions set forth in this Agreement, using the same accounting
methods, assumptions, policies, principles, practices and procedures, with
consistent classifications, judgments and estimation methodology, as were used
in the preparation of the Latest Balance Sheet except, in the case of the
calculation of Net Working Capital, as set forth on  _Schedule A_. The
Closing Balance Sheet and Closing Statement (A) will not include any changes
in assets or liabilities as a result of purchase or other accounting
adjustments or other changes arising from or resulting as a consequence
of the Transactions, (B) will be based on facts and circumstances as they
exist as of the Adjustment Calculation Time and will exclude the effect of any
act, decision or event occurring on or after the Closing and (C) will not
include, directly or indirectly, any additional reserve or accrual that is
not reflected on the Latest Balance Sheet. The parties agree that the purpose
of preparing the Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing Statement and
calculating Final Purchase Price is solely to (x) accurately measure the
Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Cash, Closing Indebtedness and
Transaction Expenses and (y) measure the difference in Closing Net Working
Capital from Target Net Working Capital, and such processes are not intended
to permit the introduction of different judgments, accounting methods,
policies, principles, practices, procedures, reserves classifications or
estimation methodologies for the purpose of calculating Final Purchase Price
than were used in the calculation of Estimated Purchase Price.

(b) On or prior to the thirtieth (30th) day following Buyers delivery of
the Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing Statement, Seller may give Buyer a
written notice stating in reasonable detail the items and amounts as to which
Seller objects (a " _Notice of Disagreement_ ") to the Closing Balance Sheet
and the Closing Statement and the basis for such objection. During such 30-day
period, and any period of dispute thereafter with respect to such Closing
Balance Sheet and/or Closing Statement, Buyer will, and will cause the
Company and its Subsidiaries to, provide Seller and its Advisors reasonable
access upon reasonable advance notice to the books, records, supporting data,
facilities, and personnel of the Company and its Subsidiaries (including
Company personnel responsible for accounting and finance and senior
management) and, subject to execution of any customary work paper access
letters required by them, the Companys accountants and their work papers.
Any determination set forth on the Closing Statement which is not
specifically objected to in the Notice of Disagreement will be deemed
acceptable to Seller, and will be final and binding upon all parties upon
delivery of the Notice of Disagreement. If Seller does not deliver to Buyer a
Notice of Disagreement within such 30-day period or otherwise delivers notice
to Buyer of its acceptance of the Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing
Statement, then the Closing Balance Sheet, the Closing Statement

 



3

    

 and the Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Cash, Closing Indebtedness, and
Transaction Expenses, each as set forth in the Closing Statement, will be
final and binding upon the parties as of the expiration of such 30-day period
or delivery of such notice, as applicable, and the Final Purchase Price set
forth in the Closing Statement will constitute the Final Purchase Price for
all purposes of this  _Section_ __ _ 1.04_.

(c) Following Buyers receipt of any Notice of Disagreement, Seller and
Buyer will negotiate in good faith to resolve the disputed matters set forth
therein, and all such discussions and negotiations related thereto shall
(unless otherwise agreed by Buyer and Seller) be governed by Rule 408 of the
Federal Rules of Evidence (as in effect as of the date of this Agreement) and
any applicable similar state rule. In the event that Seller and Buyer fail to
agree on any of Sellers proposed adjustments set forth in the Notice of
Disagreement within thirty (30) days after Buyer receives the Notice of
Disagreement, Seller and Buyer agree to use their respective reasonable best
efforts to cause Deloitte LLP (provided that if Deloitte LLP is unable or
unwilling to serve in such capacity, Seller and Buyer shall jointly select an
alternative firm that is a nationally recognized independent accounting or
valuation firm) (the " _Firm_ "), within 45 days following such 30-day
negotiation period, to make the final written determination of all matters
which remain in dispute that were included in the Notice of Disagreement.
Buyer and Seller will instruct the Firm to, and the Firm will, make a final
determination of the items included in the Closing Balance Sheet and the
Closing Statement (to the extent such amounts are in dispute) solely in
accordance with this Agreement. Buyer and Seller will execute a customary
engagement letter and will cooperate with the Firm during the term of
its engagement. Buyer and Seller will instruct the Firm not to, and the Firm
will not, assign a value to any item in dispute greater than the greatest
value for such item assigned by Buyer, on the one hand, or Seller, on the
other hand, or less than the smallest value for such item assigned by Buyer,
on the one hand, or Seller, on the other hand. Buyer and Seller will also
instruct the Firm to, and the Firm will, make its determination based solely
on written submissions by Buyer and Seller that are in accordance with this
Agreement (i.e., not on the basis of an independent review). The Closing
Balance Sheet, the Closing Statement and the resulting Closing Net Working
Capital, Closing Cash, Closing Indebtedness and Transaction Expenses, in each
case, as determined by the Firm in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 1.04_,
will be final and binding on the parties on the date the Firm delivers its
final determination in writing to Buyer and Seller. The date on which
the Closing Balance Sheet, the Closing Statement and the resulting Closing
Net Working Capital, Closing Cash, Closing Indebtedness and Transaction
Expenses are finally determined pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.04(b)_, are
agreed upon by Buyer and Seller pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 1.04(c)_ or
are determined by the Firm in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 1.04(c)_ is
referred to as the " _Settlement Date_ _._ " The fees, costs and expenses of
the Firm will be allocated between Buyer, on the one hand, and Seller, on the
other hand, in the same proportion that the aggregate amount of the disputed
items so submitted to the Firm that is unsuccessfully disputed by such party
(as finally determined by the Firm) bears to the total amount of disputed
items submitted. For example, if Seller submits a Notice of Disagreement for
$1,000, and if Buyer contests only $500 of the amount claimed by Seller, and
if the Firm ultimately resolves the dispute by awarding Seller $300 of the
$500 contested, then the costs and expenses of the Firm will be allocated 60%
(i.e., 300/500) to Buyer and 40% (i.e., 200/500) to Seller.

(d) If the Estimated Purchase Price exceeds the Final Purchase Price (such
excess, the " _Excess Amount_ "), Buyer and Seller will deliver joint written
instructions to the Escrow Agent to cause the Escrow Agent to pay to Buyer (or
its designee), within five (5) Business Days after the Settlement Date by
wire transfer of immediately available funds, the Excess Amount from the
Adjustment Escrow Funds. In the event that at such time the Excess Amount is
less than the Adjustment Escrow Funds (such shortfall, the "
_Remaining Adjustment Escrow Funds_ "), Buyer and Seller will simultaneously
with delivery of the instructions in the immediately foregoing sentence
deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent to cause the Escrow
Agent to pay the Remaining Adjustment Escrow Funds from the Adjustment Escrow
Account to Seller (or its designee).

(e) If the Final Purchase Price exceeds the Estimated Purchase Price (such
excess, the " _Adjustment Amount_ "), then (i) Buyer will, within five (5)
Business Days after the Settlement Date, make payment of the Adjustment Amount
by wire transfer of immediately available funds to Seller (or its designee)
to the account designated pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.03(a)_ or another
account designated in writing by Seller within three (3) Business Days after
the Settlement Date, and (ii) Buyer and Seller will deliver joint written
instructions to the Escrow Agent to cause the Escrow Agent to make payment of
the Adjustment Escrow Funds from the Adjustment Escrow Account, within five
(5) Business Days after the Settlement Date, to Seller (or its designee).

(f) The parties agree that any payment made pursuant to this  _Section_ __
_ 1.04_ shall be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for Tax
purposes, unless otherwise required by applicable Law.

 

1.05 _Inventory Count_. Not later than the Business Day immediately prior
to the Closing, Seller shall cause the Company to conduct a physical count of
the inventory of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the time of such
calculation (the "Inventory"). Such Inventory count shall be conducted in
accordance with the past procedures and practices of the Company and Buyer or
its representatives shall have an opportunity to observe such count after
being given reasonable (at least two (2) Business Days) prior written notice
thereof; provided that the Closing shall not be delayed or otherwise impacted
if Buyer does not observe such count.

1.06 _Withholding Rights_. Buyer, Seller or the Company will be entitled
to deduct and withhold from any amount otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement only such amounts as are required to be deducted and withheld with
respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any provision of Tax
Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and timely remitted in full to
the applicable Tax authority by Buyer, Seller or the Company, such withheld
amounts will be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding
was made. Except with respect to payments of compensation, in the event that
Buyer, Seller or the Company determines that withholding from any payment
contemplated hereunder is required under applicable Tax Law and permitted
under this Agreement, Buyer, Seller or the Company, as applicable, will notify
the applicable recipient at least three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing
Date or any subsequent date that the applicable payment is to be made so as
to provide such recipient with an opportunity to provide any form or
documentation or take such other steps in order to avoid such withholding. If
Buyer, Seller or the Company withholds any amount which it was not required
to withhold, it will promptly, but in any event within five (5) Business Days
after demand therefor (including wire transfer information as applicable),
remit to the appropriate recipient thereof such amount wrongly withheld.

case, in accordance with GAAP consistently applied, from and in accordance
with the books and records of the Company (which books and records are true,
correct and complete in all material respects and are maintained in accordance
with GAAP and properly reflect in all material respects all of the
transactions entered into by the Company and its Subsidiaries), and present
fairly in all material respects the consolidated financial condition and

(b) Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.06(b)(i)_ , the Company and its
Subsidiaries do not have any Liabilities, except (i) Liabilities accrued on or
reserved against in the Latest Balance Sheet or disclosed in the notes thereto
or in the notes to the other Financial Statements, (ii) Liabilities that have
arisen since the date of the Latest Balance Sheet in the ordinary course of
business ( _provided_ , that, with respect to this clause (ii), such Liability

unsatisfied community or charitable monetary Liabilities.

actually performed in the ordinary course of business and, to the extent not
previously collected, are fully collectible, net the allowance for doubtful
accounts, in the ordinary course of business in accordance with their terms.
All reserves for the collection of such accounts receivable were calculated in

contest, claim or right of set-off, other than returns in the ordinary course

consistently applied. Since the date of the Latest Balance Sheet, due
provision has been made on the books of the Company and its Subsidiaries to
provide for all slow-moving, obsolete, damaged or defective inventories to
their estimated useful or scrap values, and such inventory reserves are
adequate to provide for such slow-moving, obsolete, damaged or defective
inventory.

rights of way, railway agreements or other similar real property agreements
(the " _Leased Real Property_ "), and the Contracts pursuant to which such
Leased Real Property is leased, subleased or licensed (the " _Leases_ "). All
Leased Real Property is leased to the Company or its Subsidiaries pursuant to
written Leases, and all such written Leases are valid, binding and in full

other party to any Lease (except for any Leases for which a consent is
obtained prior to the Closing), will not result in a material breach of or
default under such Lease, and will not otherwise cause such Lease to cease to
be legal, valid, binding, enforceable and in full force and effect on
identical terms following the Closing. There are no material disputes with
respect to any Lease. Neither the Company nor its Subsidiaries, nor, to the
Companys knowledge, any other party to any Lease, is in breach of or default
under any Lease, and no event has occurred or circumstance exists that, with
the delivery of notice, the passage of time or both, would constitute such a
breach or default by the Company or any Subsidiary or, to the Companys
knowledge, any other party, or permit the termination or modification of any
Lease or acceleration of rent under any Lease. No security deposit or portion
thereof deposited with respect to any Lease has been applied in respect of

any brokerage commissions or finders fees with respect to any Lease.

and its Subsidiaries own good, valid and marketable fee title to the Owned
Real Property other than any failure to own such Owned Real Property that is
not material to the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole. The Owned
Real Property is owned free and clear of all Liens, except for Permitted
Liens. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received written
notice of any condemnation proceeding, Action or agreement pending, or to

 



20

    

 the knowledge of the Company, threatened, with respect to any portion of any
Owned Real Property, in each case, that would be material to the Company and
its Subsidiaries as a whole. The Company has made available to Buyer copies
of all surveys, title policies, reports and deficiency notices concerning any
Owned Real Property which are in the possession or control of the Company or
any Subsidiary, except as would not be material to the Company and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

(c) To the Companys knowledge, none of the Real Property is in the
possession of any adverse possessors. To the Companys knowledge, the Real
Property is (i) compliant with and used in a manner consistent with and
permitted by applicable zoning ordinances and other Laws, in each case in
all material respects, without variance, special or conditional use approvals
or permits and is not dependent on a "permitted non-conforming use" or

approval from any Government Body, (ii) served by all water, sewer,
electrical, telephone, drainage and other utilities required for
normal operations of the Company, and (iii) requires no material capital

Intellectual Property that is registered, filed or issued under the authority
of any Governmental Body, including any domain name registration and all

Company or one or more of its Subsidiaries (collectively, " _Registered
Intellectual Property_ ") specifying the owner thereof and the jurisdiction in
which such item has been issued, registered or filed and the applicable
issuance, grant, registration or serial number(s) and related dates, as

taken within ninety (90) days of the date of the Closing to preserve such
item, including the payment of any registration, maintenance or renewal
fees or the filing of any documents, applications or certificates, and (ii)
any pending Actions (other than any ex parte examination proceedings) or, to
the knowledge of the Company, threatened in writing, before any Governmental

in which claims are raised relating to the validity, enforceability, scope,
ownership or infringement of any of the Registered Intellectual Property.

 

(b) With respect to each item of Registered Intellectual Property: (i) it
is subsisting; (ii) all necessary registration, maintenance and renewal fees
due and owing and all responses, documents and certificates have been filed,
submitted or paid (as applicable) with the applicable Governmental Body
anywhere in the world, as the case may be, for the purposes of maintaining
such Registered Intellectual Property; and (iii) each such item that is issued
or registered is in full force and effect valid, enforceable, and has been
obtained and maintained in compliance with all applicable rules, policies and
procedures of the applicable Governmental Body. To the knowledge of the
Company, there are no facts, information or circumstances,

 



21

    

 including any information or facts that would constitute prior art (with
respect to patents) or prior use (with respect to trademarks), that would
render any pending application for any Registered Intellectual Property non-
registerable or unpatentable, as applicable, in each case other than prior art
or prior use identified by the Company and disclosed to the relevant examining
authority or identified by the relevant examining authority and disclosed to
the Company in the course of prosecution of such applications.

of its Subsidiaries solely and exclusively own all right, title and interest
in and to the Owned Intellectual Property, free and clear of all Liens, other
than Permitted Liens. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries lawfully owns,
or otherwise has sufficient rights to exploit all Company Intellectual
Property. The Company Intellectual Property is all the Intellectual Property
that is required to conduct the business of the Company in the manner in which
it is currently being conducted. All Owned Intellectual Property is fully
transferable, alienable and licensable by the Company and its Subsidiaries
without restriction and without payment of any kind to any third party and
without approval of any third party. No funding, facilities or personnel of
any educational institution or Governmental Body were used, directly or
indirectly, to develop or create, in whole or in part, any Owned Intellectual
Property.

 

(d) None of the Company, its Subsidiaries, Company Products (including the
use thereof), Company Intellectual Property as used in the conduct of the
business of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries and the conduct of the
business of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries violate, infringe
(directly, contributorily, by inducement, or otherwise) or misappropriate any
Intellectual Property of any Person (and have not previously done so). Since
January 15, 2016, there have been no past, pending or threatened Actions
involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, the operation of
the business by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, any Owned
Intellectual Property, or Company Product (including the use thereof), or
alleging that any of the foregoing infringes, misappropriates or otherwise
violates the rights of any Person; and, to the knowledge of the Company,
there are no facts or circumstances that might reasonably serve as the basis
for any such Action. None of the Company or its Subsidiaries has received any
notice that it must license or refrain from using any Intellectual Property
or any offer by any other Person to license any Intellectual Property to the
Company (other than an offer by a Person to provide a license to generally
available software). No Person is infringing, misappropriating or
otherwise violating or conflicting with any Owned Intellectual Property, or
has done so since January 15, 2016.

(e) All Licenses are valid, binding and enforceable against the Company
and its Subsidiaries and, to the knowledge of the Company, all other parties
thereto and there exists no event or condition that violates or breaches or
will result in a violation or breach of, or otherwise constitutes (with or
without due notice or lapse of time or both) a default by any party
thereunder.

 

(f) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries use any Open Source
Software in a manner that requires any of the Company and its Subsidiaries to
distribute or make available any Software (including any source code) or other
materials or grant any Intellectual Property or other rights to any Person.

 



22

    

(g) Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has taken
commercially reasonable steps to protect the confidentiality of Personally
Identifiable Information and Trade Secrets owned, held or controlled by any of
the Company or its Subsidiaries, including, in each case, any information
(other than any information that was intentionally made public by the
management of the Company using its reasonable business judgment) that would
have been a Trade Secret but for any failure of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to act in a manner consistent with this  _Section_ __ _
3.13(g)_, including requiring each Person, including, employees, contractors,
third-party developers, suppliers, service providers, partners and advisors,
with access to such Trade Secrets to execute a binding confidentiality
agreement that requires such Person to reasonably protect such Trade Secrets
and to not use such Trade Secrets, except for the benefit of the Company or
its Subsidiaries.

 

(h) Each current and former employee, contractor, third-party developer,
service provider, partner and advisor of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries who is or has been involved in the development (alone or with
others) of any material Intellectual Property by or for any of the Company or
its Subsidiaries (each, a " _Contributor_ "), or has or previously had access
to any Trade Secrets owned or held by any of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, has either: (i) executed and delivered to the Company or a
Subsidiary, as applicable, a written and enforceable Contract that assigns
to the Company or a Subsidiary, as applicable, without any obligation of
payment, all right, title and interest in and to any such Intellectual
Property or (ii) transferred to the Company or a Subsidiary (as applicable)
all right, title and interest in and to any such Intellectual Property by
operation of Law. To the knowledge of the Company, no Contributor is in
violation of any such Contract. No present or former employee, officer,
consultant or contractor of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any
predecessor of any of the foregoing has any ownership, license or other right,
title or interest in any Company Intellectual Property. To the knowledge of
the Company, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries (including any
of the officers, employees, agents or contractors of any of the foregoing, in
their capacities as such) have done, or failed to do, any act or thing that
may prejudice the validity or enforceability of any Owned Intellectual
Property. 

(i) Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.13(i)_ , neither the Company nor any
of its Subsidiaries have (i) transferred ownership of any material
Intellectual Property to any other Person, (ii) granted any exclusive or
perpetual right or license with respect to any material Company Intellectual
Property; or (iii) granted any right to modify, enhance or create derivative
works of any material Owned Intellectual Property other than modifications,
enhancement or derivative works that are owned by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, as applicable. No Person (other than the Company or its
Subsidiaries) owns any improvement, modification, enhancement, customization
or derivative of any material Owned Intellectual Property.

 

(j) Neither the execution of this Agreement nor the consummation of the
Transactions will (i) result in the loss or impairment of any of the Company
Intellectual Property or any obligation to disclose any source code or other
similar materials held by any of the Company or its Subsidiaries, and (ii)
give rise to any right of any Person to terminate any rights under any
License or exercise any new or additional rights under any Owned Intellectual
Property, and (iii) cause or result in any of Buyer or its Affiliates or the
Company or its Subsidiaries (A) granting to any third party any right to or

any discounts to any Person with respect to any Intellectual Property in
excess of those payable or offered by the Company and its Subsidiaries in the
absence of this Agreement and the Transactions. Each item of Owned
Intellectual Property existing immediately prior to the Closing will be
available on identical terms and conditions immediately after the Closing. No
consent or approval is required under any License to maintain such License in
force and effect as a result of the execution and delivery of this Agreement
and the consummation of the Transactions.

(k) None of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is, or has been, a
member or a contributor to any industry standards body or similar
organization that requires the Company or any Subsidiary to grant or agree to
grant any other Person any license or right to any Owned Intellectual
Property.

facilities and services used by any of the Company or its Subsidiaries,
including all Software, hardware, networks, communications facilities,

Company or its Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Systems_ "), (i)
are reasonably sufficient for the existing needs of Company and its
Subsidiaries as their business is currently conducted and (ii) are free of any
material defects, bugs and errors, and do not contain or make available any

Systems or data or information stored therein, in each case that have not
been remediated in all material respects (" _Contaminants_ "). Each of the
Company and its Subsidiaries have taken commercially reasonable steps and
implemented commercially reasonable safeguards designed to ensure that the
Systems are free from Contaminants. The Systems are in good working condition
to effectively perform all computing, information technology and data
processing operations necessary for the operation of the business of the
Company and its Subsidiaries in the manner it is currently being conducted.

or warranty set forth in  _ARTICLE_ __ _ III_ or _ARTICLE_ __ _ IV_ at any
time during the Interim Period that would reasonably be expected to cause the
condition set forth in _Section_ __ _ 8.02(a)_ not to be satisfied; 
_provided_ , however, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this

(including the limitations set forth in _Section_ __ _ 6.03_, this _Section_
__ _ 6.06_, _Section_ __ _ 10.03_ and _Section_ __ _ 10.04_), the Company
and Seller will, and will cause the Companys Subsidiaries and Advisors to,

and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other
parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and

prevent or materially impede, interfere with, hinder or delay the
consummation by Seller or the Company of the Transactions. For purposes of
this _Section_ __ _ 6.06_ and _Section_ __ _ 6.01(a)_, the "reasonable best

be received or retained by any "disqualified individual" (as defined in
Treasury Regulation Section 1.280G-1) arising in whole or in part as a result

the intended recipients of such payments or benefits which waivers shall
provide that unless such payments or benefits are approved by the shareholders
of the Company to the extent and manner prescribed under Section 280G(b)(5)(B)

benefits shall not be made; _provided_ that in no event will this _Section_ __
_ 6.07_ be construed to require the Company or Seller to compel any Person to
waive any existing rights under any Contract that such Person has with
Seller, the Company or any Subsidiary thereof and in no event will the Company
or Seller be deemed in breach of this _Section_ __ _ 6.07_ if any such Person
refuses to waive any such rights. In connection with the foregoing, Buyer
shall reasonably cooperate with Seller and the Company in a timely manner to
provide any information in its possession regarding any payments or benefits

satisfy all outstanding obligations of the Company or its Subsidiaries, as
applicable, (b) agrees that all Liens on the properties or assets of the
Company or its Subsidiaries with respect to such Indebtedness will
automatically be released upon the satisfaction of the conditions in such
letter and authorizes the Company or its designee to prepare and file the

evidence such releases, and (c) provides payment instructions, including, if
applicable, wire transfer instructions for such lender. On the Closing Date,
the Company or Seller shall deliver to Buyer an executed copy of each such

arranged by Buyer) and the release of any Liens and termination of all
guarantees supporting such Indebtedness substantially contemporaneously with
the Closing Date.

seventh anniversary of the Closing Date, Buyer will, and will cause the
Company and its Subsidiaries to, provide Seller (and its Advisors reasonably
requiring such access in light of the purposes therefor), at Sellers sole
expense, with reasonable access, during normal business hours, and upon
reasonable advance notice, to the books and records (for the purpose of
examining and copying), executive officers, accounting and tax employees and
advisors and accountants of the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to
periods or occurrences prior to the Closing Date (a) in connection with the

preparing for or defending any tax related Action of the requesting party by

7.02 _Regulatory Filings_. Subject to _Section_ __ _ 10.03_, Buyer will,

49

    

 any breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty set forth in
_ARTICLE_ __ _ V_ at any time during the Interim Period that would reasonably
be expected to cause the condition set forth in _Section_ __ _ 8.03(a)_ not
to be satisfied; _provided_ , _however_ , that the delivery of any notice
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 7.03_ will not limit any of the
representations and warranties set forth in _ARTICLE_ __ _ V_ or the
remedies available hereunder to the Company or Seller.

 

7.04 _Reasonable Best Efforts_. Subject to the terms of this Agreement
(including the limitations set forth in _Section_ __ _ 7.02_, this _Section_
__ _ 7.04_, _Section_ __ _ 10.03_ and _Section_ __ _ 10.04_), Buyer will,

efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be
done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things
necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, as
promptly as practicable, the Transactions, including using reasonable best
efforts to (x) cause its conditions to Closing to be satisfied and for the
Closing to occur as promptly as practicable and (y) not take any action
intended to, or that would reasonably be expected to, prevent the Closing.

the consummation by Buyer of the Transactions.

7.05 _Director and Officer Liability and Indemnification_.

(a) Without limiting any additional rights that any Person may have
under any other agreement, from the Closing Date through the sixth (6th)
anniversary of the Closing Date, Buyer shall cause the Company and its
Subsidiaries to indemnify and hold harmless each present (as of immediately
prior to the Closing) and former officer, director, manager or managing
member of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (each, an " _Indemnified
Person_ ") to the maximum extent permitted under applicable Law, against all
claims, losses, liabilities, damages, judgments, inquiries, fines and
reasonable fees, costs and expenses, including attorneys fees and
disbursements, incurred in connection with any Action arising out of or
pertaining to the fact that the Indemnified Person is or was an
officer, director, manager or managing member of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (but in no event more than as set forth in the organizational or
other governing documents of the Company or any such Subsidiary, as
applicable). In the event of any such Action, each Indemnified Person will be
entitled to advancement of expenses incurred in the defense of any Action from
the Company and its Subsidiaries within ten (10) Business Days of receipt by
the Company from the Indemnified Person of a request therefor; _provided_
that any person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking, if and
only to the extent required by the DGCL or other applicable Law and by the
certificate of incorporation, bylaws, limited liability company agreement or
operating agreement (or equivalent organizational documents) of the Company or
any Subsidiary thereof.

 

(b) For a period of at least six (6) years from the Closing Date, the
Company will not, and Buyer will not permit the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to, amend, repeal or modify any provision in such Persons
certificate of incorporation, bylaws, limited liability company agreement or
operating agreement (or equivalent organizational documents), or in any
Contract, relating to the exculpation or indemnification of, or advancement of
expenses to, any Indemnified Person as in effect immediately prior to the
Closing in any manner adverse to any Indemnified Person, and Buyer and the
Company will cause all such provisions to be observed

 



50

    

 by the Company and its Subsidiaries, it being the intent of the parties that
any Indemnified Person will continue to be entitled to such exculpation,
indemnification and advancement of expenses from the Company or the
applicable Subsidiary to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law.

(c) At the Closing, the Company will (at Buyers and Sellers expense as
provided in _Section_ __ _ 11.05_) obtain, maintain and fully pay for
irrevocable "tail" insurance policies with respect to directors
and officers liability and employment practices liability insurance with a
reporting period of at least six (6) years from the Closing Date from an
insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Companys
current insurance carrier with respect to such insurance in an amount and
scope at least as favorable as the Companys and its Subsidiaries existing
directors and officers liability and employment practices liability policies
with respect to matters existing or occurring at or before the Closing Date,
and covering at least those of the Indemnified Persons that are covered under
such existing policies; _provided_ that, in the event that any claim is
brought under any such policy before the sixth (6th) anniversary of the
Closing Date, such insurance policies will be maintained until final
disposition thereof. Buyer and the Company will not, and will cause their
Subsidiaries to not, cancel or change such insurance policies in any respect.

(d) The rights of indemnification and to receive advancement of expenses as
provided by this Agreement shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights
to which any Indemnified Person may at any time be entitled. No right or
remedy herein conferred by this Agreement is intended to be exclusive of any
other right or remedy, and every other right and remedy shall be cumulative
and in addition to every other right and remedy given hereunder or now or
hereafter existing at Law or in equity or otherwise. Buyer hereby acknowledges
that the Indemnified Persons have or may in the future have certain rights to
indemnification, advancement of expenses or insurance provided by other
Persons (collectively, " _Other Indemnitors_ "). Buyer and the Company hereby
agree that, with respect to any advancement or indemnification obligation
owed at any time to an Indemnified Person by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or any Other Indemnitor, whether pursuant to any certificate of
incorporation, bylaws, partnership agreement, operating
agreement, indemnification agreement or other document or agreement or
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 7.05_ (any of the foregoing, an "
_Indemnification Obligation_ "), the Company and its Subsidiaries shall be (i)
the indemnitors of first resort (i.e., the Companys and its Subsidiaries
obligations to an Indemnified Person shall be primary and any obligation of
the Other Indemnitors to advance expenses or to provide indemnification for
the same expenses or liabilities incurred by an Indemnified Person shall be
secondary) and (ii) required to advance, and liable for the full amount of all
expenses, judgments, penalties, fines and amounts paid in settlement to the
extent legally permitted and as required by the terms of this Agreement or
any Indemnification Obligation, without regard to any rights that an
Indemnified Person may have against the Other Indemnitors. Furthermore, the
Company and Buyer (on behalf of the Company and its Subsidiaries) irrevocably
waive, relinquish and release the Other Indemnitors from any and all claims
(x) against the Other Indemnitors for contribution, subrogation,
indemnification or any other recovery of any kind in respect thereof and (y)
that the Indemnified Person must seek expense advancement, reimbursement or
indemnification from any Other Indemnitor before the Company or its
Subsidiaries must perform its expense advancement, reimbursement and
indemnification obligations under this Agreement. The Company and Buyer (on
behalf of the Company and its Subsidiaries) hereby further agree that

 



51

    

 no advancement, indemnification or other payment by the Other Indemnitors on
behalf of an Indemnified Person with respect to any claim for which an
Indemnified Person has sought indemnification from the Company or its
Subsidiaries shall affect the foregoing, and the Other Indemnitors shall have
a right of contribution and/or be subrogated to the extent of such
advancement, indemnification or other payment to all of the rights of
recovery of such Indemnified Person against the Company or its Subsidiaries,
the Company and its Subsidiaries shall indemnify and hold harmless against
such amounts actually paid by the Other Indemnitors to or on behalf of such
Indemnified Person to the extent such amounts would have otherwise been
payable by the Company or its Subsidiaries under any Indemnification
Obligation.

 

(e) In the event that the Company or any of their Subsidiaries or any of
the respective successors or assigns of the foregoing (i) consolidates with
or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or
substantially all of its properties, rights or assets to any Person, then, in
each case, the successors and assigns of such Persons or properties, rights or
assets, as the case may be, must expressly assume in writing and be bound by
the obligations set forth in this  _Section_ __ _ 7.05_ as a condition of
succession of assignment.

(f) This  _Section_ __ _ 7.05_ is intended to be for the benefit of each
of the Indemnified Persons and may be enforced by any such Indemnified Person
as if such Indemnified Person were a party to this Agreement. The obligations
of Buyer and the Company under this _Section_ __ _ 7.05_ will not be
terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Person to
whom this _Section_ __ _ 7.05_ applies without the consent of such
affected Person.

(g) Buyer and the Company, on behalf of themselves and their Subsidiaries,
knowingly, willingly, irrevocably and expressly acknowledge and agree, that
the agreements contained in this _Section_ __ _ 7.05_ and the indemnification
contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 7.05_ require performance after the
Closing to the maximum extent permitted by applicable Law and will survive
the Closing for the maximum duration permitted under applicable Law (or if
earlier, when no obligations under this _Section_ __ _ 7.05_ remain) and will
not be subject to any of the survival or exclusive remedy provisions of
_Section_ __ _ 11.01_.

 

7.06 _Contact with Business Relations_. Without limiting the provisions
of  _Section_ __ _ 6.02_, Buyer acknowledges that it is not authorized to,
and agrees that it will not, and it will not permit any member of the Buyer
Group to, contact any officer, director, employee, customer, supplier,
vendor, distributor, referral source, lessee, lessor, equityholder, lender,
noteholder or other material business relation of the Company or its
Subsidiaries before the Closing with respect to the Company, its Subsidiaries,
their businesses and the Transactions, in each case, without receiving the
prior written consent of the Company; _provided_ , however, that Buyer or any
member of the Buyer Group may contact the Persons listed on _Schedule 7.06_
before the Closing without the prior written consent of the Company.

7.07 _Tax Matters_.

 

(a) _Transfer Taxes_. At the Closing or, if due thereafter, promptly when
due thereafter, all sales, use, excise, goods and services, stock,
conveyance, gross receipts, registration, business and occupation, securities
transactions, real estate, land transfer, stamp,

 



52

    

 documentary, notarial, filing, recording, permit, license, authorization or
similar Taxes and all applicable conveyance fees, recording charges and other
similar fees and charges applicable to, arising out of or imposed upon the
Transactions, whether imposed on Buyer, Seller, the Company or its
Subsidiaries resulting from the Transactions (collectively, " _Transfer Taxes_
") will be paid by Buyer and Buyer will indemnify and hold Seller harmless
against all such Transfer Taxes. Buyer will prepare any Tax Returns with
respect to such Taxes, and Seller will cooperate with Buyer in the preparation
and filing of such Tax Returns.

 

(b) _Cooperation on Tax Matters_. Buyer, the Company and Seller will
cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by any other party
hereto, in connection with the filing of Tax Returns, any Tax audits, Tax
proceedings or other Tax-related claims. Such cooperation will include
providing records and information that are reasonably relevant to any such
matters, making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide
additional information and explaining any materials provided pursuant to
this  _Section_ __ _ 7.07(b)_.

(c) _Straddle Periods_. Whenever it is necessary to determine
the liability for Taxes of the Company or its Subsidiaries for a Straddle
Period, the determination of the Taxes of the Company or its Subsidiaries for
the portion of the Straddle Period ending on and including, and the portion of
the Straddle Period beginning after, the Closing Date will be determined in
the following manner: (i) in the case of any Taxes other than property or
similar ad valorem Taxes, by assuming that the Straddle Period consisted of
two taxable years or periods, one which ended at the close of the Closing
Date and the other which began at the beginning of the day following the
Closing Date, and items of income, gain, deduction, loss or credit of the
Company or its Subsidiaries for the Straddle Period will be allocated between
such two taxable years or periods on a "closing of the books basis" by
assuming that the books of the Company were closed at the close of the
Closing; _provided_ , that exemptions, allowances or deductions that
are calculated on an annual basis, such as the deduction for depreciation,
will be apportioned between such two taxable years or periods on a daily
basis; and (ii) in the case of Taxes not described in clause (i) above, such
Taxes will be deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for the entire period
multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is either the number of
calendar days in the Straddle Period ending on and including the Closing Date
or the number of calendar days in the Straddle Period beginning the day after
the Closing Date, as the case may be, and the denominator of which is the
number of calendar days in the entire relevant period.

 

7.08 _Financing Matters_. Buyer shall use reasonable best efforts to take,
or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary or advisable to arrange, obtain and consummate the Debt Financing no
later than the date the Closing is required to be effected in accordance with
this Agreement, including using reasonable best efforts to (a) maintain in
effect the commitments for the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt Letters
in accordance with their terms, (b) satisfy (or, if deemed advisable by Buyer,
to obtain the waiver of) on a timely basis all conditions to obtaining the
applicable Debt Financing, (c) negotiate and enter into definitive agreements
with respect thereto consistent with the terms and conditions described in the
Debt Letters (and any flex provisions in the Fee Letter) or on terms and
conditions not less favorable to Buyer with respect to conditionality at or
prior to the Closing Date than the terms and conditions contained in the Debt
Letters so long as such terms shall not reduce the aggregate amount of the
Debt Financing below the amount required (together with

 



53

    

 other reasonably available financial resources of Buyer and its
Subsidiaries, including cash on hand of Buyer and its Subsidiaries) to pay the
aggregate consideration and other amounts payable by Buyer on the Closing
Date, to refinance any indebtedness required to be refinanced in connection
with the Transactions and to pay all Transaction Expenses to be borne by Buyer
in connection with this Agreement on the Closing Date, (d) enforce its rights
under the Debt Letters, and (e) in the event that all conditions to the Debt
Financing have been satisfied or waived (and that the funding of such Debt
Financing is necessary to pay the aggregate consideration payable by Buyer on
the Closing Date, to refinance any indebtedness required to be refinanced in
connection with the Transactions and to pay all Transaction Expenses to be
borne by Buyer in connection with this Agreement on the Closing Date), cause
the lenders and other Persons providing Debt Financing to fund on the Closing
Date the Debt Financing, if and to the extent necessary for the foregoing
purposes. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, prior to the
Closing, Buyer shall give Seller reasonably prompt notice (and in any event,
within three (3) Business Days) (i) of any material breach or default related
to the Debt Financing of which Buyer becomes aware, (ii) of the receipt or
delivery of any written notice or other written communication, in each case
from any Person party to the Debt Letters (or any Affiliate of such Person)
with respect to (1) any actual or potential breach, default, termination, or
repudiation by any party to the Debt Letters with respect to the obligation
to fund the Debt Financing or (2) any material dispute or disagreement between
or among parties to any of the Debt Letters with respect to the obligation to
fund the Debt Financing or the amount of the Debt Financing to be funded at
the Closing (but excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any ordinary course
negotiations with respect to the terms of the Debt Financing or Debt Letters),
(iii) of the expiration or termination for any reason of the Debt Letters or
any definitive documentation with respect to the Debt Financing entered into
in connection therewith (or if any Person party thereto attempts or purports
in writing to terminate the Debt Letters or any definitive agreements entered
into in connection therewith, whether or not such attempted or purported
termination is valid), and (iv) if at any time for any reason Buyer believes
in good faith that all or any portion of the Debt Financing is unavailable on
the terms and conditions contemplated by any of the Debt Letters. In
connection with any notice thereof, Buyer shall promptly provide information
reasonably requested by Seller relating to any circumstance referred to in
clause (i), (ii), (iii), or (iv) of the immediately preceding sentence (other
than information to the extent that the provision thereof would violate or
waive any attorney-client or other privilege, constitute attorney work product
or violate or contravene any law, rule or regulation, or any obligation of
confidentiality). Prior to the Closing, without the prior written consent of
Seller, Buyer shall not agree to, or permit, any amendment, modification,
supplement, termination, replacement or waiver under, the Debt Letters
or definitive documentation relating to the Debt Financing; _provided_ that
Buyer shall have the right from time to time to amend, supplement, modify,
terminate, waive, replace or extend the Debt Letters or definitive
documentation with respect to the Debt Financing so long as such amendment,
modification, supplement, termination, waiver, extension or replacement would
not reasonably be expected to (A) reduce the amounts available to be funded
under the Debt Financing on the Closing Date below the amount required
(together with other reasonably available financial resources of Buyer and its
Subsidiaries, including cash on hand of Buyer and its Subsidiaries) to pay the
aggregate consideration and other amounts payable by Buyer on the Closing
Date, to refinance any indebtedness required to be refinanced in connection
with the Transactions and to pay all Transaction Expenses to be borne by Buyer
in connection with this Agreement on the Closing Date, or (B) expand on,
or impose new or

 



54

    

 additional conditions precedent or terms, or amend or modify any conditions
precedent or terms in each case which would reasonably be expected to (i)
prevent, delay, or impair the availability of the Debt Financing when
required to be funded or the satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the
Debt Financing, in each case on the Closing Date, or (ii) materially adversely
affect the ability of Buyer to enforce its rights against the other parties
to the Debt Letters; _provided_ that, for the avoidance of doubt, no consent
from Seller shall be required for: (1) any amendment, replacement, supplement
or modification of the Debt Letters that is limited to adding lenders, lead
arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities that have not
executed the Debt Letters as of the date of this Agreement (including in
replacement of a lender), if the addition of such additional
parties, individually or in the aggregate, would not prevent, materially
delay, or materially impair the availability of the Debt Financing when
required to be funded or the satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the
Debt Financing, in each case on the Closing Date, or (2) implementation or
exercise of any "flex" provisions provided in the Fee Letter as in effect as
of the date hereof. After any amendment, supplement, modification, replacement
or waiver of the Debt Letters or the definitive documentation (prior to the
Closing) with respect to the Debt Financing in accordance with this _Section_
__ _ 7.08_, Buyer shall promptly deliver to Seller true and complete copy
thereof (and in the case of the Fee Letter, redacted in a manner consistent
with _Section_ __ _ 5.08_). For purposes of this Agreement, the terms
"Commitment Letter" and "Fee Letter" shall include and mean such documents as
amended, supplemented, modified, waived, replaced or extended in compliance
with this _Section_ __ _ 7.08_ and references to "Debt Financing" shall
include and mean the financing contemplated by the Commitment Letter as so
amended, supplemented, modified, waived, replaced or extended, as applicable
(including the debt financing contemplated therein to replace the commitments
provided by the Commitment Letter as so amended, supplemented, modified,
waived, replaced or extended, as applicable, to the extent such alternative
or replacement financing satisfies the terms and conditions in this _Section_
__ _ 7.08_).

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS AND COVENANTS

 

10.01 _Further Assurances_. From time to time, as and when requested by
any party and at such partys reasonable expense, any other party will
execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, all such documents

actions as such requesting party may reasonably deem necessary or desirable
to evidence and effectuate the Transactions.

10.02 _Employee and Employee Benefits_.

(a) _Compensation and Benefits_. Effective as of the Closing and
continuing for one (1) year thereafter, Buyer will, or will cause its
Affiliates, the Company and its Subsidiaries to, provide to all employees of
the Company and its Subsidiaries as of immediately following the Closing (the
" _Retained Employees_ ") compensation (other than equity compensation) and
benefit plans, programs, arrangements, agreements and policies that, in the
aggregate, are substantially similar to those provided to the Retained
Employees immediately before the Closing. Buyers obligation to hire the
Retained Employees is subject to Buyers right to deny employment to any
Retained Employee based on the results of Buyers customary hiring practices.
Nothing in this  _Section_ __ _ 10.02(a)_ will obligate Buyer or the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries to continue (and will not prevent Buyer or the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries from modifying or terminating) the
employment of any such Retained Employee. Buyer will be solely responsible
for complying with the requirements of Part 6 of Subtitle B of Title I of
ERISA and Section 4980B of the Code for any individual who is an "MandA
qualified beneficiary" as defined in Treas. Reg. Sec. 54.4980B-9. __

(b) _Employee Service Credit_. Buyer (i) will give, or cause the Company
to give, each Retained Employee credit under any benefit or compensation plan,
program, agreement, arrangement or policy of Buyer or any of its Affiliates
(including retirement, vacation, sick leave and severance policies), for
purposes of eligibility, vesting and entitlement to such amount of vacation,
sick leave and severance benefits for the Retained Employees service with the
Company and its Affiliates prior to the Closing Date to the same extent such
service was recognized under a similar Plan, except in each case, to the
extent such treatment would result in duplicative benefits, (ii) will use
reasonable best efforts to allow such Retained Employees to participate in
each plan providing welfare benefits without regard to pre-existing condition
limitations, waiting periods, evidence of insurability or other exclusions or
limitations not imposed on the Retained Employee by the corresponding Plans
immediately prior to the Closing Date, and (iii) if any of the Plans that
provide welfare benefits are terminated prior to the end of the plan year that
includes the Closing Date, Buyer will use reasonable best efforts to cause
each Retained Employee to be credited with any deductibles and out-of-pocket
expenses paid by such Retained Employee under the corresponding Plan during
such plan year for purposes of determining deductibles and out-of-pocket
limits under any replacement plans.

 



59

    

(c) _Vacation Pay and Personal Holidays_. Buyer will cause the Company to
continue to credit to each Retained Employee all vacation and personal holiday
pay that the Retained Employee is entitled to use but has not used as of the
Closing Date, including any earned vacation or personal holiday pay to be used
in future years, and will assume all liability for the payment of such
amounts.

(d) _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. The provisions contained in this
_Section_ __ _ 10.02_ are for the sole benefit of the parties to this
Agreement and nothing set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 10.02_ will (i) confer
any rights or remedies, including any third party beneficiary rights, upon
any employee or former employee of the Company, any Retained Employee or upon
any other Person other than the parties hereto and their respective successors
and assigns, (ii) be construed to establish, amend, or modify any Plan or any
other benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement or (iii) alter or limit
Buyers or the Companys or any of its Subsidiaries ability to amend, modify
or terminate any specific benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement at
any time.

10.03 _Antitrust Notification_.

(a) The Company and Buyer will, as promptly as practicable and no later
than ten (10) Business Days following the date of this Agreement, file with
the United States Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ ") and the United
States Department of Justice (" _DOJ_ "), any notification form required
pursuant to the HSR Act for the Transactions, which form will specifically
request early termination of the waiting period prescribed by the HSR Act.
Each of the Company and Buyer will furnish to each others counsel such
necessary information and reasonable assistance as the other may request in
connection with its preparation of any filing or submission that is necessary
under the HSR Act and will provide any supplemental information requested by
any Governmental Body as promptly as reasonably practicable. Seller, the
Company and Buyer will use all reasonable best efforts to comply as promptly
as reasonably practicable with any requests made for any additional
information in connection with such filings. Subject to  _Section_ __ _
11.05_, Buyer will be responsible for the filing fees payable in connection
with the filings that are necessary under the HSR Act.

 

(b) Seller, the Company and Buyer will use their reasonable best efforts to
promptly obtain any HSR Approval for the consummation of the Transactions and
will keep each other apprised of the status of any communications with, and
any inquiries or requests for additional information from, any Governmental
Body and will comply promptly with any such inquiry or request. Reasonable
best efforts, for purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 10.03_, shall not require
Buyer to agree to or proffer to sell, divest, lease, license, transfer,
dispose of or otherwise encumber or impair Buyers ability to own or operate
any assets or properties of Buyer (including for the avoidance of doubt, any
equity or other interests in the Company) or any assets or properties of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries if such action would require
the divestiture, lease, license, transfer, disposition, encumbrance or
impairment, or holding separate (or any other remedy), or otherwise materially
changing the operations, of or with respect to any assets of Buyer, the
Company or any of their Subsidiaries representing, in the aggregate, more
than $20,000,000 of annual revenue (including both trade and intracompany
sales) generated between October 1, 2017 and September 30, 2018 or
representing any material Intellectual Property of Buyer, the Company or any
of their respective Subsidiaries.

 



60

    

(c) The parties commit to instruct their respective counsel to cooperate
with each other and use reasonable best efforts to facilitate and expedite the
identification and resolution of any issues arising under the HSR Act at the
earliest practicable dates. Such reasonable best efforts and cooperation
include counsels undertaking (i) to keep each other appropriately informed
of material communications from and to personnel of the reviewing Governmental
Bodies and (ii) to confer with each other regarding appropriate contacts with
and response to personnel of such Governmental Bodies and the content of any
such contacts or presentations. None of Seller, the Company or Buyer will
participate in any meeting or discussion with any Governmental Body with
respect of any such filings, applications, investigation or other inquiry
without giving the other party prior notice of the meeting or discussion and,
to the extent permitted by the relevant Governmental Body, the opportunity to
attend and participate in such meeting or discussion (which, at the request
of Seller, Buyer or the Company, will be limited to outside antitrust counsel
only). Buyer, the Company, and Seller will have the right to review (subject
to appropriate redactions for confidentiality and attorney-client privilege
concerns) and approve the content of any presentations, white papers or other
written materials to be submitted to any Governmental Body in advance of any
such submission.

 

(d) Except as specifically required by this Agreement, Buyer will not take
any action, or refrain from taking any action, the effect of which would be
to delay or impede the ability of the parties to consummate the Transactions.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Buyer will not, and will not
permit any member of the Buyer Group or their respective Affiliates to,
acquire or agree to acquire (by merging or consolidating with, or by
purchasing a substantial portion of the assets of or equity in, or by any
other manner), any Person or portion thereof, or otherwise acquire or agree
to acquire any assets, if the entering into a definitive Contract relating
to, or the consummation of, such acquisition, merger or consolidation could
reasonably be expected to (i) impose any delay in the obtaining of, or
increase the risk of not obtaining, any permits, orders or other approvals of
any Governmental Body necessary to consummate the Transactions or the
expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period, (ii) increase the
risk of any Governmental Body entering an order prohibiting the consummation
of the Transactions or (iii) delay the consummation of the Transactions.

 

10.04 _Certain Consents_. Buyer knowingly, willingly, irrevocably, and
expressly acknowledges and agrees that certain consents to the Transactions
may be required from Governmental Bodies or parties to contracts or other
agreements to which the Company or one of its Subsidiaries is a party
(including the agreements set forth on  _Schedule_ __ _ 3.11_) and that such
consents have not been obtained as of the date of this Agreement and may not
be obtained. Buyer knowingly, willingly, irrevocably, and expressly
acknowledges and agrees that, notwithstanding anything else in this
Agreement, subject to the Companys and Sellers compliance with _Sectio_ _ns
6.03_ , _6.06_ and _10.03_ in all material respects, neither the Company nor
any of the Seller Parties will have any liability whatsoever to Buyer,
including, for the avoidance of doubt, through any reduction in, or deduction
from, the Purchase Price (whether through any increase in Closing Indebtedness
or Transaction Expenses or any decrease in Closing Net Working Capital or
otherwise), and Buyer will not be entitled to assert any claims, in each case,
arising out of or relating to the failure to obtain any consents that may have
been or may be required in connection with the Transactions (other
than pursuant to the HSR Act) or because of the default, acceleration or
termination of or loss of any right under any Contract requiring such consent
as a result of the Closing and the failure to obtain any such consent.

61

    

 willingly, irrevocably, and expressly acknowledges and agrees that,
notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement, subject to the Companys and
Sellers compliance with _Sections 6.03_ , _6.06_ and _10.03_ in all material
respects, no condition of Buyer will be deemed not to be satisfied as a result
of the failure to obtain any such consent or as a result of any default,
acceleration or termination or loss of any right or any Action commenced or
threatened by or on behalf of any Person arising out of or relating to the
failure to obtain any such consent or any such default, acceleration or
termination or loss of any right.

11.01 _Survival; Certain Waivers_.

 

(a) Except as set forth in _Section_ __ _ 11.01(c)_, each of the
representations and warranties and the covenants and agreements (to the
extent such covenants or agreements contemplate or require performance by such
party prior to the Closing) of the parties set forth in, and each partys
right to recover based on, this Agreement or any other document contemplated
hereby, or in any certificate delivered hereunder or thereunder, will
terminate effective immediately as of the Closing. Each covenant and agreement
requiring performance at or after the Closing, will, in each case,
expressly survive the Closing in accordance with its terms, and if no term is
specified, then for the maximum duration permitted under applicable Law, and
nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 11.01(a)_ will be deemed to limit any rights
or remedies of any Person for breach of any such surviving covenant or
agreement (with it being understood that Buyer will also be liable for breach
of any covenant or agreement requiring performance by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries after the Closing), and nothing herein will limit or affect
Buyers or any of its Affiliates liability for the failure to pay the
Purchase Price (in whole or in part) or any other amounts payable by them (in
whole or in part) as and when required by this Agreement.

(b) From and after the Closing, except as set forth in  _Section_ __ _
11.01(c)_, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, the Company
and Buyer knowingly, willingly, irrevocably and expressly waive, on their own
behalf and on behalf of the Buyer Group, any and all rights, claims and
causes of action any of them may have against any Seller Party (excluding any
Person who is or was an officer or employee of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, but only in such Persons capacity as such) relating to the
Company or its Subsidiaries or arising out of any breach or inaccuracy of any
representation or warranty or breach of, or failure to perform, any covenant
or agreement that contemplates or requires performance to be completed prior
to the Closing, in each case, involving the Company or its Subsidiaries or
their respective businesses, or relating to the subject matter of this
Agreement or any other document contemplated hereby, or in any certificate
delivered hereunder or thereunder. Furthermore, except as set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 11.01(c)_, from and after the Closing, without limiting the
generality of this _Section_ __ _ 11.01_, to the fullest extent permitted
under applicable Law, no Action will be brought, encouraged, supported or
maintained by, or on behalf of, any member of the Buyer Group (including,
after the Closing, the Company and its Subsidiaries) or the Seller Parties
against any of the Seller Parties or Buyer (excluding any Person who is or
was an officer or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, but only
in such Persons capacity as such), as the case may be, and no recourse will
be sought or granted against any of them, by virtue of, 

 



62

    

 or based upon, any alleged misrepresentation or inaccuracy in, or breach of,
any of the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of Buyer,
Seller, the Company or any other Person set forth or contained in this
Agreement or any other document contemplated hereby or any certificate,
instrument, opinion, agreement or other document of Buyer, Seller, the Company
or any other Person delivered hereunder or in connection with
the Transactions (other than, and solely with respect to, any of the
covenants that survive the Closing in accordance with _Section_ __ _
11.01(a)_), the subject matter of this Agreement or any other document
contemplated hereby, the Transactions, the business, the ownership,
operation, management, use or control of the business of Seller, the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, any of their assets, or any actions or omissions
at, or prior to, the Closing.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary (including the
disclaimers and waivers set forth in this  _Section_ __ _ 11.01_), in no
event shall any party hereto be deemed to have waived, released or
relinquished any of its rights to claims for Fraud.

 

11.02 _Acknowledgment by Buye_ _r_ _and Seller_.

 

(a) Buyer knowingly, willingly, irrevocably and expressly acknowledges and
agrees, on its own behalf and on behalf of the Buyer Group, that it has
conducted to its satisfaction an independent investigation and verification of
the business, financial condition, results of operations, assets, liabilities,
properties, contracts, and prospects of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
and, in making its determination to proceed with the Transactions, Buyer has
relied solely on the results of its own independent investigation and
verification and has not relied on, is not relying on, and will not rely on
that certain datasite administered by Firmex (the " _Dataroom_ "), the
Projections or any other information, statements, disclosures, or materials,
in each case whether written or oral, provided by, Seller, the Company or its
Subsidiaries or any other Seller Party, or any failure of any of the
foregoing to disclose any information, except for the representations and
warranties of the Company expressly and specifically set forth in _ARTICLE_ __
_ III_ and of Seller expressly and specifically set forth in _ARTICLE_ __ _
IV_, in each case, as qualified by the Disclosure Schedules. Buyer knowingly,
willingly, irrevocably and expressly acknowledges and agrees, on its own
behalf and on behalf of the Buyer Group, that: (i) the representations and
warranties of the Company expressly and specifically set forth in _ARTICLE_ __
_ III_ and of Seller expressly and specifically set forth in  _ARTICLE_ __ _
IV_, in each case, as qualified by the Disclosure Schedules and in accordance
with the express terms and conditions (including limitations and exclusions)
of this Agreement, are the sole and exclusive representations, warranties,
and statements of any kind made to Buyer and on which Buyer may rely in
connection with the Transactions, and the Company and Seller acknowledge and
accept that Buyer is relying upon such representations and warranties; and
(ii) all other representations, warranties and statements of any kind or
nature expressed or implied, whether in written, electronic or oral form,
including (A) the completeness or accuracy of, or any omission to state or to
disclose, any information, including the Information Presentation, the
Dataroom, the Projections, meetings, calls or correspondence with management
of Seller, the Company and its Subsidiaries or any of the Seller Parties and
(B) any other statement relating to the historical, current or future
business, financial condition, results of operations, assets, liabilities,
properties, contracts, and prospects of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, or the quality, quantity or condition of the Companys or its
Subsidiaries assets, are, in each case of this clause (ii), specifically
disclaimed by Seller and the Company, on their own behalf and on behalf of the

 



63

    

 Seller Parties. Buyer, on its own behalf and on behalf of the Buyer Group,
knowingly, willingly, irrevocably and expressly: (x) disclaims reliance on the
items in clause (ii) in the immediately preceding sentence and (y)
acknowledges and agrees that it has relied on, is only relying on and will
only rely on, the items in clause (i) in the immediately preceding sentence.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Buyer knowingly, willingly,
irrevocably and expressly acknowledges and agrees, on its own behalf and on
behalf of the Buyer Group, that neither the Company, nor any other Person
(including the Seller Parties), has made, is making or is authorized to make,
and Buyer, on its own behalf and on behalf of the Buyer Group, hereby
knowingly, willingly and irrevocably waives, any warranty or representation
(whether in written, electronic or oral form), express or implied, as to
the quality, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or condition
of Sellers or the Companys or its Subsidiaries business, operations,
assets, liabilities, prospects or any portion thereof, except solely to the
extent expressly set forth in _ARTICLE_ __ _ III_ and _ARTICLE_ __ _ IV_,
in each case, as qualified by the Disclosure Schedules.

 

(b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in connection with
the investigation by Buyer of Seller and the Company and its Subsidiaries,
Buyer and its Affiliates, and the representatives of each of the foregoing,
have received or may receive, from or on behalf of Seller or the Company,
certain projections, forward-looking statements and other forecasts (whether
in written, electronic or oral form, and including in the Information
Presentation, Dataroom, management meetings, etc.) (collectively, "
_Projections_ "). Buyer knowingly, willingly, irrevocably and expressly
acknowledges and agrees, on its own behalf, and on behalf of the Buyer Group,
that (i) such Projections are being provided solely for the convenience of
Buyer to facilitate its own independent investigation of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, (ii) there are uncertainties inherent in attempting to make
such Projections, (iii) Buyer is familiar with such uncertainties, and (iv)
Buyer is taking full responsibility for making its own evaluation of the
adequacy and accuracy of all Projections (including the reasonableness of the
assumptions underlying such Projections).

(c) Each of Buyer and Seller knowingly, willingly, irrevocably and
expressly acknowledges and agrees, on its own behalf and on behalf of the
Buyer Group and the Seller Parties, as applicable, that it will not assert,
institute or maintain, and will cause the members of the Buyer Group and the
Seller Parties, as applicable, not to assert, institute or maintain, any
Action of any kind whatsoever, including a counterclaim, cross-claim, or
defense, regardless of the legal or equitable theory under which such
liability or obligation may be sought to be imposed, that makes any claim
contrary to the agreements and covenants set forth in this _Section_ __ _
11.02_, including, in the case of the Buyer and the Buyer Group, any such
Action with respect to the distribution to Buyer or any member of the Buyer
Group, or Buyers or any member of the Buyer Groups use, of the Information
Presentation, the Dataroom, the Projections or any other information,
statements, disclosures, or materials, in each case whether written or oral,
provided by them or any other Seller Party or any failure of any of the
foregoing to disclose any information.

 

(d) Each of Buyer and Seller knowingly, willingly, irrevocably and
expressly acknowledges and agrees, on its own behalf and on behalf of the
Buyer Group and the Seller Parties, as applicable, that the agreements
contained in this _Section_ __ _ 11.02_ (i) require performance after the
Closing to the maximum extent permitted by applicable Law and will survive
the

 



64

    

 Closing for the maximum duration permitted under applicable Law and will not
be subject to any of the survival or exclusive remedy provisions of _Section_
__ _ 11.01_; and (ii) are an integral part of the Transactions and that,
without these agreements set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 11.02_, Buyer, the
Company and Seller would not enter into this Agreement.

 

11.03 _Provision Respecting Representation of Company_. Each of the
parties agrees, on its own behalf and on behalf of its directors, members,
partners, managers, members, officers, employees and Affiliates, (a) that
Kirkland and Ellis LLP has been retained by, and may serve as counsel to, each
and any of the Seller Parties, on the one hand, and the Company and its
Subsidiaries, on the other hand, in connection with the negotiation,
preparation, execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement, and the
consummation of the Transactions, (b) that Kirkland and Ellis LLP has not acted
as counsel for any other party in connection with the Transactions and that
none of the other parties has the status of a client of Kirkland and Ellis LLP
for conflict of interest or any other purposes as a result thereof, and (c)
that, following consummation of the Transactions, Kirkland and Ellis LLP (or any
of its successors) may serve as counsel to the Seller Parties or any director,
member, partner, manager, officer, employee or Affiliate of any of the Seller
Parties, in connection with any Action arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or the Transactions. Notwithstanding such representation or any
continued representation of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, each of
the parties (on their own behalf and on behalf of their Affiliates) hereby
consents thereto and knowingly, willingly and irrevocably waives any conflict
of interest arising from such representations, and each of such parties will
cause any controlled Affiliate thereof to consent to knowingly, willingly and
irrevocably waive any conflict of interest arising from such representation.
Buyer, the Company and the Seller Parties hereby agree that, in the event that
a dispute arises after the Closing between Buyer, the Company, and/or its
Subsidiaries on the one hand, and the Seller Parties or their respective
Affiliates, on the other hand, Kirkland and Ellis LLP (or any of its successors)
may represent the Seller Parties, and/or such Affiliates in such dispute even
though the interests of the Seller Parties, and/or such Affiliates may be
directly adverse to Buyer, the Company or its Subsidiaries, and even though
Kirkland and Ellis LLP may have represented the Company or its Subsidiaries in
a matter substantially related to such dispute, or may be handling ongoing
matters for Buyer, the Company or any of their Subsidiaries. In addition,
Buyer agrees that (i) all communications prior to the Closing among any of
the Seller Parties, the Company and its Subsidiaries, any of their respective
Affiliates, directors, officers, employees or Advisors, on the one hand, and
Kirkland and Ellis LLP, on the other hand, that relate to the negotiation,
preparation, execution, delivery and closing under, or any dispute arising in
connection with, this Agreement, or otherwise relating to any potential sale
of the Company or the Transactions (the " _Protected Seller Communications_
"), will be deemed to be privileged and confidential communications, (ii) all
rights to such Protected Seller Communications, the expectation of client
confidentiality, and the control of the confidentiality and privilege
applicable thereto, belong to and will be retained by the Seller Parties and
(iii) to the extent Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including the Company and
its Subsidiaries after the Closing) should discover in its possession after
the Closing any Protected Seller Communications, it will take reasonable
steps to preserve the confidentiality thereof and will not by reason thereof
assert any loss of confidentiality or privilege protection. As to any such
Protected Seller Communications prior to the Closing Date, Buyer,
the Company, and each of its Subsidiaries together with any of their
respective Affiliates, Subsidiaries, successors or assigns, further agree that
none of the foregoing may use or rely on any of the Protected Seller
Communications in any action against or

 



65

    

 involving any of the Seller Parties or Kirkland and Ellis LLP after the
Closing. The Protected Seller Communications may be used by the Seller Parties
and/or any of their respective Affiliates in connection with any dispute that
relates in any way to this Agreement or the Transactions. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in the event that a dispute arises after the Closing between Buyer
and its Affiliates (including the Company or any of its Subsidiaries), on the
one hand, and a third party other than the Seller Parties (solely in their
capacity as equityholders of the Company), on the other hand, the Company and
its Affiliates may assert the attorney-client privilege with respect to
Protected Seller Communications to prevent disclosure of confidential
communications to such third party. Buyer and the Seller Parties knowingly,
willingly, irrevocably and expressly acknowledge and agree, on their own
behalf and on behalf of the Buyer Group and the Seller Parties, respectively,
that the agreements contained in this _Section_ __ _ 11.03_ (A) require
performance after the Closing to the maximum extent permitted by applicable
Law and will survive the Closing for the maximum duration permitted under
applicable Law and will not be subject to any of the survival or exclusive
remedy provisions of _Section_ __ _ 11.01_; and (B) are an integral part of
the Transactions and that, without the agreements set forth in this _Section_
__ _ 11.03_, none of the parties would enter into this Agreement.

 

11.04 _Press Releases and Communications_. None of Buyer, Seller, the
Company or their respective Affiliates shall issue any press release or
public announcement concerning this Agreement or the Transactions or make any
other public disclosure containing or pertaining to the terms of this
Agreement or the Transactions without obtaining the prior written approval of
Buyer and Seller, which approval will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed,
unless disclosure is otherwise required by applicable Law or stock exchange
rules or is otherwise permitted under this  _Section_ __ _ 11.04_. Seller
and the Company acknowledge that Buyer is an NYSE listed public company that
is required by Law or stock exchange rules to make public disclosures
regarding the Company and the Transactions. Buyer and Seller (or its
Affiliates) shall be entitled to issue one or more press releases (the form of
which shall be mutually agreed upon) and make other public announcements
regarding the Company and the Transactions upon the execution of this
Agreement, and thereafter Buyer shall be entitled to follow Buyers customary
investor relations practices regarding the Transactions so long as such
information about the Transactions and the Company to be disclosed is
substantially consistent with the information contained in the initial press
release regarding the Company and the Transactions and/or any other talking
points agreed in writing by Buyer and Seller, including publicly disclosing
information regarding the Company and the Transactions in Current Reports on
Form 8-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and an Annual Report on Form 10-K,
and speak publicly to investors and analysts regarding the Company and the
Transactions. Each Seller Party and member of the Buyer Group shall be
entitled to disclose such information to their respective employees, equity
owners, partners, prospective partners, investors, prospective investors,
professional advisors, credit rating agencies, lenders and underwriters who
have a need to know the information and who agree to keep such information
confidential or are otherwise bound to confidentiality (the obligation
to keep information confidential shall not apply to such information that has
been publicly disclosed, except if publicly disclosed in violation of this
Agreement or the Confidentiality Agreement).

 

11.05 _Expenses_. Whether or not the Closing takes place, except as
otherwise provided herein, all fees, costs and expenses (including fees,
costs and expenses of Advisors and appraisal fees, costs and expenses, and
travel, lodging, entertainment and associated expenses) incurred in

 



66

    

 connection with the negotiation of this Agreement and the consummation of
the Transactions will be paid by the party incurring such expenses, except
that Buyer will pay (a) all fees and expenses of the Escrow Agent, (b) all
Transfer Taxes, (c) all incremental out-of-pocket fees and expenses
contemplated by  _Section_ __ _ 2.02(l)_, (d) all fees in connection with
any filing or submission that is necessary under the HSR Act, (e) all costs
and expenses assessed by an insurer in connection with obtaining the
"tail" insurance policies described in _Section_ __ _ 7.05(c)_ and any Taxes
assessed in connection therewith, and (f) all costs and expenses assessed by
an insurer in connection with obtaining any representations and
warranties insurance policy in connection with the Transactions and any Taxes
assessed in connection therewith; _provided_ that, notwithstanding the
foregoing, Seller will pay the lesser of (i) $1,500,000 and (ii) 50% of the
aggregate costs and expenses contemplated by the foregoing clauses (d), (e)
and (f).

11.06 _Notices_. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all
notices, demands and other communications to be given or delivered under or by
reason of the provisions of this Agreement will be in writing and will be
deemed to have been given (a) when personally delivered, (b) when transmitted

11.07 _Assignment_. This Agreement and all of the provisions hereof will
be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective
successors and permitted assigns, except that neither this Agreement nor any
of the rights or obligations hereunder may be assigned or delegated without
the prior written consent of Seller and Buyer; _provided_ , that Buyer may
assign this Agreement to any of its Subsidiaries, any acquirer or successor in
interest in connection with any direct or indirect sale, merger, consolidation
or similar acquisition, disposition or transaction or in connection with a
reorganization of it or its business or to a lender or financing source of
Buyer or the Company or any Subsidiary as collateral security, in each case,
without the prior written consent of any party; _provided_ , _further_ , that
no such assignment shall relieve Buyer of its obligations under this
Agreement.

 

11.08 _Amendment and Waiver_. Except as provided herein, any provision of
this Agreement or the Disclosure Schedules or any exhibit hereto may be
amended or waived (a) only in a writing signed by Buyer, the Company, and
Seller; and (b) subject to _Section_ __ _ 8.04_ with respect to the waiver of
conditions to Closing as of the Closing, any waiver of any provision of this
Agreement will be effective against Buyer, the Company, or Seller, only as set
forth in a writing executed by such Person; _provided_ , that this _Section_
__ _ 11.08_ (as it relates to the Debt Financing Sources), _Section_ __ _
11.09(b)_, the last sentence of _Section_ __ _ 11.17_, the last sentence of
_Section_ __ _ 11.18(a)_,  _Section_ __ _ 11.18(b)_ (as it relates to the
Debt Financing Sources), and _Section_ __ _ 11.20_ (or any other provision of
this Agreement to the extent that an amendment or waiver of such provision
would modify the substance of any such Section specified in this proviso or
portion thereof, as applicable) may not be amended or waived in any manner
adverse to a Debt Financing Source without the express written consent of such
Debt Financing Source. The failure in any one or more instances of a party to
insist upon performance of any of the terms, covenants or conditions of this
Agreement or to exercise any right or privilege in this Agreement conferred,
or the waiver by such party of any breach of any of the terms, covenants or
conditions of this Agreement, shall not be construed as a subsequent waiver of
any such terms, covenants, conditions, rights or privileges, but the same
shall continue and remain in full force and effect as if no such forbearance
or waiver had occurred.

11.09 _Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except as otherwise expressly provided
herein, including _Section_ __ _ 7.05_, and except for (a) _ Sections
11.01_, _11.02_ , _11.03_ , _11.10_ and this _Section_ __ _ 11.09(a)_, in
respect of which each of the Seller Parties and Buyer Group, as applicable,
is a third party beneficiary and (b) _ Section_ __ _ 11.08_ (as it relates
to the Debt Financing Sources), this _Section_ __ _ 11.09(b)_, the last
sentence of  _Section_ __ _ 11.17_, the last sentence of _Section_ __ _
11.18(a)_, _Section_ __ _ 11.18(b)_ (as it relates to the Debt Financing
Sources), and _Section_ __ _ 11.20_, in respect of which each of the Debt
Financing Sources is a third party beneficiary, nothing expressed or referred
to in this Agreement will be construed to give any Person other than the
parties any legal or equitable right, remedy, or claim under or with respect
to this Agreement or any provision of this Agreement. The representations and
warranties in this Agreement are the product of negotiations among the parties
and are for the sole benefit of the parties. Any inaccuracies in
such representations and warranties are subject to waiver by the parties in
accordance with this Agreement without notice or liability to any other
Person. In some instances, the representations and warranties in this
Agreement may represent an allocation among the parties of risks associated
with particular matters regardless of the knowledge of any of the parties.
Consequently, Persons other than the parties may not rely upon the
representations and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of
actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any
other date.

 



69

     

11.10 _Non-Recourse_. This Agreement may only be enforced against, and
any action, suit, claim, investigation, or proceeding based upon, arising out
of or related to this Agreement may only be brought against, the Persons that
are expressly named as parties to this Agreement. Except to the extent named
as a party to this Agreement, and then only to the extent of the specific
obligations of such parties set forth in this Agreement, no past, present or
future shareholder, member, partner, manager, director, officer, employee,
Affiliate, agent or Advisor of any party to this Agreement or any Subsidiary
of the Company will have any liability (whether in contract, tort, equity or
otherwise) for any of the representations, warranties, covenants, agreements
or other obligations or liabilities of any of the parties to this Agreement
or for any action, suit, claim, investigation, or proceeding based upon,
arising out of or related to this Agreement.

 

11.11 _Severability_. Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement
will be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under
applicable Law, but if any provision of this Agreement is held to be
prohibited by or invalid under applicable Law, such provision will be
ineffective only to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without
invalidating the remainder of such provision or the remaining provisions of
this Agreement.

 

11.12 _Construction_. The language used in this Agreement will be deemed
to be the language chosen by the parties to express their mutual intent, and
no rule of strict construction will be applied against any Person. The
headings of the sections and paragraphs of this Agreement have been inserted
for convenience of reference only and will in no way restrict or otherwise
modify any of the terms or provisions hereof.

11.13 _Disclosure _ _Schedules_. The Disclosure Schedules have been
arranged for purposes of convenience in separately numbered sections
corresponding to the sections of this Agreement; _however_ , each section of
the Disclosure Schedules will be deemed to incorporate by reference all
information disclosed in any other section of the Disclosure Schedules to the
extent the relevance of such information to such other section of the
Disclosure Schedules is reasonably apparent on its face. Capitalized terms
used in the Disclosure Schedules and not otherwise defined therein have the
meanings given to them in this Agreement. The specification of any dollar
amount or the inclusion of any item in the Disclosure Schedules or the
attached exhibits to the Disclosure Schedules is not intended to imply that
the amounts, or higher or lower amounts, or the items so included, or other
items, are or are not required to be disclosed (including whether such amounts
or items are required to be disclosed as material or threatened) or are
within or outside of the ordinary course of business, and no party will use
the fact of the inclusion of any item in this Agreement, the Disclosure
Schedules or exhibits to the Disclosure Schedules in any dispute or
controversy between the parties as to whether any obligation, item or matter
not set forth or included in the Disclosure Schedules or exhibits to the
Disclosure Schedules is or is not required to be disclosed (including whether
the amount or items are required to be disclosed as material or threatened)
or are within or outside of the ordinary course of business. In addition,
matters reflected in the Disclosure Schedules are not necessarily limited to
matters required by this Agreement to be reflected in the Disclosure
Schedules. Such additional matters are set forth for informational purposes
only and do not necessarily include

 



70

    

 other matters of a similar nature. No information set forth in the
Disclosure Schedules will be deemed to broaden in any way the scope of the
parties representations and warranties. Any description of any agreement,
document, instrument, plan, arrangement or other item set forth on any
Disclosure Schedule or Updated Schedule is a summary only and is qualified in
its entirety by the terms of such agreement, document, instrument, plan,
arrangement or item. The information contained in this Agreement, in the
Disclosure Schedules, and exhibits hereto is disclosed solely for purposes of
this Agreement, and no information contained herein or therein will be deemed
to be an admission by any party to any Person of any matter whatsoever,
including any violation of Law or breach of contract.

 

11.14 _Complete Agreement_. This Agreement, together with the
Confidentiality Agreement, Adjustment Escrow Agreement, the Restrictive
Covenant Agreements and any other agreements expressly referred to herein or
therein (collectively, " _Transaction Documents_ "), contain the entire
agreement of the parties regarding the subject matter of this Agreement and
the Transactions and supersede all prior agreements among the parties with

Agreement will control and prior drafts of this Agreement and the documents
referenced herein will not be considered or analyzed for any purpose
(including in support of parol evidence proffered by any Person in connection
with this Agreement), will be deemed not to provide any evidence as to the
meaning of the provisions hereof or the intent of the parties with respect
hereto and will be deemed joint work product of the parties. 

11.15 _Conflict Between Transaction Documents_. The parties agree and
acknowledge that to the extent any terms and provisions of this Agreement are
in any way inconsistent with or in conflict with any term, condition or
provision of any other agreement, document or instrument contemplated by this
Agreement, this Agreement will govern and control. 

11.16 _Specific Performance_. The parties agree that irreparable damage,
for which monetary relief, even if available, would not be an adequate
remedy, would occur in the event that any provision of this Agreement is not
performed in accordance with its specific terms or is otherwise breached,
including if the parties fail to take any action required of them hereunder
to consummate the Transactions. It is accordingly agreed that (a) the parties
will be entitled to an injunction or injunctions, specific performance or
other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce

relief and (c) the right of specific performance and other equitable relief is
an integral part of the Transactions and without that right, none of Seller,
the Company or Buyer would have entered into this Agreement. The parties agree
not to assert that a remedy of specific performance or other equitable relief
is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to law or inequitable for any reason, and
not to assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate
remedy or that the parties otherwise have an adequate remedy at law. The
parties acknowledge and agree that any party pursuing an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement in accordance with this _Section_
__ _ 11.16_ will not be required to provide any bond or other security in

   5. |

_No Duty to Verify_. The Escrow Agent will verify the accuracy of the
information contained in the foregoing instructions, notices or certificates
solely by means of the security procedure communicated to the Escrow Agent
through a signed certificate in the form of _Exhibit A-1_ or _Exhibit A-2_
attached hereto. The Escrow Agent will be entitled to rely upon any document,
instrument or signature reasonably believed by it in good faith to be genuine
and signed by any party hereto or an authorized officer or agent thereof
(provided the document or instrument is otherwise in accordance with the
requirements of _Exhibits A-1_ or _A-2_  hereof), and will not have the duty
to verify the genuineness of the signatures or any instructions, notices or
certificates or the authority of such signatories to execute such
instructions, notices or certificates. Upon distribution of all of
the Adjustment Escrow Funds to Buyer and/or to or as directed by Seller in
accordance with _Sections_ _3_ , _4_ and _7_ hereof, the Escrow Agent will be
deemed to have fully discharged its duties and obligations hereunder, and
will have no further liability or obligation to any party with respect
hereto. 

---|--- 



   6. |

_Investment of Escrow Funds_. The Escrow Agent will follow Joint Instructions
of Buyer and Seller concerning the permissible investment, reinvestment,
purchase and sale of the assets on deposit in the Adjustment Escrow Funds.
Permissible investments will be limited to: (a) readily marketable direct
obligations issued or guaranteed by the United States or by any Person
controlled or supervised by or acting as an instrumentality of the United
States or by any Person controlled or supervised by or acting as an
instrumentality of the United States pursuant to authority granted
by Congress that are unconditionally guaranteed by the full faith and credit
of the government of the United States; (b) insured United States-dollar
denominated certificates of deposit, time deposits, or short-term market
instruments of banks or trust companies that are members of the Federal
Reserve System and which issues (or the parent of which issues) commercial or
finance paper which is rated either Prime-1 or higher or an equivalent
by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or A-1 or higher or an equivalent by
Standard and Poors Corporation, and which is organized under the laws of the
United States and having minimum combined capital and surplus of
$1,000,000,000; (c) money market funds subject to the requirements of the
Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, invested in any one or more of the
aforementioned types of instruments, which have a rating in the
highest category granted therefor by a nationally recognized credit rating
agency at the time of investment; and (d) interest bearing United States
dollar-denominated bank deposits. In the absence of the Joint Instructions
described  

---|--- 
 



\- 2 -

         |  above, the Adjustment Escrow Funds shall be held in a non-
interest bearing transactional account, subject to the applicable rules and
regulations of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (" _FDIC_ "), in the
basic FDIC insurance amount of $250,000 per depositor, per issued bank. This
includes principal and accrued interest up to a total of $250,000. For the
avoidance of doubt, in the absence of any Joint Instructions to the contrary,
Escrow Agent is not authorized to make any investment with the Adjustment
Escrow Funds. Any dividends, interest, distributions and other income received
in respect of any investments of the Adjustment Escrow Funds will be
deposited in, or credited to, the Adjustment Escrow Account until distributed
in accordance with this Agreement. The Escrow Agent will have the power to
sell or liquidate the foregoing investments, consistent with  _Sections 3_
and _4_ , whenever the Escrow Agent will be required to distribute the
Adjustment Escrow Funds pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. Any net loss
or expense (after taking into account all dividends, interests,
and distributions) incurred as a result of an investment will be borne by the
Adjustment Escrow Account. The Escrow Agent will have no responsibility or
liability for any diminution in value of the Adjustment Escrow Funds which may
result from any investments or reinvestment made in accordance with this
_Section_ __ _ 6_, other than to the extent resulting from its own gross
negligence, willful misconduct or fraud. Buyer and Seller acknowledge that the
Escrow Agent is not providing investment supervision, recommendations or
advice. The Escrow Agent is hereby authorized to execute purchases and sales
of permitted investments through the facilities of its own trading or capital
markets operations or those of any affiliated entity. The Escrow Agent will
send statements to each of the parties hereto on a monthly basis reflecting
activity in the Adjustment Escrow Account maintained pursuant to this
Agreement for the preceding month. Although Buyer and Seller each recognizes
that it may obtain a broker confirmation or written statement containing
comparable information at no additional cost, Buyer and Seller hereby agree
that confirmations of permitted investments are not required to be issued by
the Escrow Agent for each month in which a monthly statement is rendered.
Buyer and Seller acknowledge and agree that the delivery of the escrowed
property is subject to the sale and final settlement of permitted investments.
Proceeds of a sale of permitted investments will be delivered on the Business
Day on which the appropriate Joint Instructions are delivered to the Escrow
Agent if received prior to the deadline for same day sale of such permitted
investments. If such Joint Instructions are received after the applicable
deadline, proceeds will be delivered on the next succeeding Business Day.

Adjustment Escrow Account (the " _Income_ ") will be taxable to Buyer. The
Escrow Agent will be responsible for reporting to Buyer and any applicable

_Provisions with Respect to the Escrow Agent_. 

---|--- 
 



     | (a) |

_Protection of the Escrow Agent_. The Escrow Agent, Buyer, and Seller agree
that: (i) either Buyer or Seller may examine the Adjustment Escrow Account
(and the Adjustment Escrow Funds) at any time at the office of the Escrow
Agent upon reasonable notice to the Escrow Agent; (ii) if the Adjustment
Escrow Account (or the Adjustment Escrow Funds) are attached, garnished, or
levied upon under the order of any court, or the delivery thereof will be
stayed or enjoined by the order of any court, or any other order, judgment or
decree will be made or entered by any court affecting the Adjustment Escrow
Account (or the Adjustment Escrow Funds), the Escrow Agent is hereby expressly
authorized to obey and comply with all writs, orders or decrees so entered or
issued, whether with or without jurisdiction, provided that the Escrow Agent
will provide reasonable prior written notice, to the extent possible under
the circumstances, to Buyer and Seller of such compliance with such writs,
orders or decrees, and the Escrow Agent will not be liable to any of the
parties hereto or their successors by reason of compliance with any such
writ, order or decree notwithstanding such writ, order or decree being
subsequently reversed, modified, annulled, set aside or vacated; (iii) if any
conflict, disagreement or dispute arises between, among, or involving any of
the parties concerning the meaning or validity of any provision hereunder or
concerning any other matter relating to this Agreement, the Escrow Agent may,
in its sole and absolute discretion, deposit the Adjustment Escrow Funds with
the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware or, if the Chancery Court of the
State of Delaware declines to accept jurisdiction, any state or federal court
within the State of Delaware, and interplead the parties hereto, and upon so
depositing such property and filing its complaint in interpleader, it will be
relieved of all liability under the terms hereof as to the property so
deposited and will be entitled to recover in such interpleader action, from
the other parties hereto, its reasonable out-of-pocket attorneys fees and
related out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred in commencing and
prosecuting such action and furthermore, the parties hereto for themselves,
their successors and assigns, do hereby submit themselves to the jurisdiction
of said court and do hereby appoint the then clerk, or acting clerk, of said
court as their agent for the service of all process in connection with such
proceedings; and (iv) notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the
Escrow Agent will be under no duty to monitor or enforce compliance by Seller
or Buyer with any term or provision of the Purchase Agreement. 

---|---|--- 
 



     | (b) |

_Resignation; Removal; New Escrow Agent_. The Escrow Agent reserves the right
to resign at any time by giving at least thirty (30) days advance written
notice of resignation to Buyer and Seller, specifying the effective date
thereof. Similarly, the Escrow Agent 

---|---|--- 
 



\- 4 -

         |  may be removed and replaced following the delivery of a thirty
(30) days advance written notice to the Escrow Agent signed by Buyer and
Seller. Within thirty (30) days after the receipt of one of the notices
referred to above, Buyer and Seller agree to jointly appoint a mutually-
acceptable successor escrow agent (a " _Successor Escrow Agent_ "). The
Successor Escrow Agent will be a party to and will agree to be legally bound
by this Agreement by means of a written joinder agreement, the signature page
to which, when signed by the Successor Escrow Agent, will be deemed to be a
counterpart signature page to this Agreement. The Successor Escrow Agent will
be deemed to be the Escrow Agent under the terms of this Agreement and
without any further act, deed or conveyance, will become vested with all
right, title and interest to all cash and property held hereunder by such
predecessor Escrow Agent, and such predecessor Escrow Agent, will, on the
written request signed by Buyer and Seller, execute and deliver to such
Successor Escrow Agent all the right, title and interest hereunder in and to
the Adjustment Escrow Funds. If a Successor Escrow Agent has not been
appointed and has not accepted such appointment by the end of the thirty (30)
day period commencing upon the receipt of the notice of resignation by Buyer
and Seller, the Escrow Agent may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction
for the appointment of a Successor Escrow Agent, and the out-of-pocket costs,
expenses and reasonable attorneys fees which the Escrow Agent incurs in
connection with such a proceeding will be paid out of the Adjustment Escrow
Account in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 8_. 
---|--- 



     | (c) |

_Indemnification_. Without limiting any protection or indemnity of the Escrow
Agent under any other provision hereof, or otherwise at law, Buyer and Seller
agree to indemnify and hold harmless the Escrow Agent (one-half paid by Buyer
and one-half paid by Seller) from and against any and all liabilities,
losses, damages, penalties, claims, actions, suits, and reasonable, documented
and out-of-pocket costs, expenses and disbursements, including reasonable
out-of-pocket outside legal or advisor fees and disbursements of whatever kind
and nature which may at any time be imposed on, incurred by or asserted
against the Escrow Agent in connection with the performance of its duties and
obligations hereunder, other than such liabilities, losses, damages,
penalties, claims, actions, suits, costs, expenses and disbursements arising
by reason of the Escrow Agents gross negligence, willful misconduct or
fraud; _provided_ , that Sellers obligation to indemnify pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 8(c)_ will be satisfied only from the Adjustment Escrow
Account and the Escrow Agent is hereby authorized and directed to pay for all
such amounts required to be paid by Buyer from the Adjustment Escrow Account
(provided that such indemnification will be satisfied first from the
dividends, interests, distributions and other income received in respect of
the Adjustment Escrow Account (net of amounts distributable pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 7(b)_) and second from any other Adjustment Escrow Funds in
the Adjustment Escrow Account). This provision will survive the resignation
or removal of the Escrow Agent, or the termination of this Agreement. In so
agreeing to indemnify and hold harmless the Escrow Agent, as among themselves,
Buyer, on one hand, and Seller, on the other hand, intend to share equally
(one-half each) all amounts required to be paid under this _Section_ __ _
8(c)_; _provided_ , that Sellers obligation to indemnify pursuant to this 
_Section_ __ _ 8(c)_ will be limited to the Adjustment Escrow Funds remaining
in the Adjustment Escrow Account and Buyers obligation to indemnify pursuant
to this _Section_ __ _ 8(c)_ will be limited to the same amount as Sellers
obligation. In case Buyer or Seller will be liable to indemnify the Escrow
Agent with respect to any demand, claim or action against the Escrow Agent,
Buyer and Seller will each be notified by the Escrow Agent in writing of the
written assertion of such demand, claim or action against it, giving
information as to the nature and basis of the demand, claim or action,
promptly (but in no event later than five (5) Business Days)  

---|---|--- 
 



\- 5 -

         |  after the Escrow Agent has received any such written assertion
of a demand, claim or action or has been served with the summons or other
first legal process giving information as to the nature and basis of the
demand, claim or action. Each of Buyer and Seller will be entitled to
participate, at its own expense, in the defense of any action or proceeding
brought to enforce any such demand, claim or action. The Escrow Agent will not
settle any demand, claim or action for which an indemnification claim may be
made without Buyers and Sellers prior written consent. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary, Buyer and Seller will in no event be responsible for
reimbursing the reasonable costs of more than one counsel for the Escrow
Agent. 
---|--- 



     | (d) |

_Duties_. The Escrow Agent will have only those duties as are specifically
provided in this Agreement, which will be deemed purely ministerial in
nature, and will under no circumstance be deemed a fiduciary for any of the
parties to this Agreement. The Escrow Agent will neither be responsible for,
nor chargeable with, knowledge of the terms and conditions of any other
agreement, instrument or document between the other parties hereto, in
connection herewith, including, without limitation, the Purchase Agreement.
This Agreement sets forth all matters pertinent to the escrow
contemplated hereunder, and no additional obligations of the Escrow Agent
will be inferred from the terms of this Agreement or any other agreement. IN
NO EVENT WILL THE ESCROW AGENT BE LIABLE, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, FOR ANY (i)
DAMAGES OR EXPENSES ARISING OUT OF THE SERVICES PROVIDED HEREUNDER, OTHER
THAN DAMAGES WHICH RESULT FROM THE ESCROW AGENTS GROSS NEGLIGENCE, WILLFUL
MISCONDUCT OR FRAUD OR (ii) SPECIAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF THE
ESCROW AGENT HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 

---|---|--- 



   9. |

_Fees and Reimbursement to the Escrow Agent_. The Escrow Agent will be
entitled to be paid a fee of $3,500 for its services and to be reimbursed for
the reasonable, documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by the
Escrow Agent related to the Adjustment Escrow Account and this Agreement,
which fees, costs and expenses will be borne by Buyer. The Escrow Agent shall
have, and is hereby granted, the right to set off and deduct any unpaid fees,
non-reimbursed expenses and unsatisfied indemnification rights from the
Escrow Funds. 

---|--- 



   10. |

_Termination_. This Agreement will terminate when all of the Adjustment Escrow
Funds have been distributed in accordance with this Agreement.

CERTIFICATION OF NON-FOREIGN STATUS

 

This certification is delivered pursuant to Section 2.02(c) of that certain
Stock Purchase Agreement, dated as of November 6, 2018, by and among Leggett
and Platt, Incorporated, a Missouri corporation ("Buyer"), Elite Comfort
Solutions, LP, a Delaware limited partnership ("Seller"), and Elite Comfort
Solutions, Inc., a Delaware corporation. 

Section 1445 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, provides that a
transferee of a U.S. real property interest must withhold tax if the
transferor is a foreign person. For U.S. tax purposes (including section
1445), the owner of a disregarded entity (which has legal title to a U.S. real
property interest under local law) will be the transferor of the property
and not the disregarded entity. To inform Buyer that withholding of tax is
not necessary upon the disposition of a U.S. real property interest by Seller,
the undersigned hereby certifies the following on behalf of Seller:

 



     | 1. |

Seller is not a foreign corporation, foreign partnership, foreign trust, or
foreign estate (as those terms are defined in the Internal Revenue Code and
Treasury Regulations); 

---|---|--- 



     | 2. |

Seller is not a disregarded entity, as such term is defined in Section 1.1445-
2(b)(2)(iii) of the Treasury Regulations; 

---|---|--- 



     | 3. |

Sellers U.S. employer identification number is: [EIN] 

---|---|--- 
 



     | 4. |

Sellers office address is: [ADDRESS]; and 

---|---|--- 
 

Seller understands and acknowledges that this certification may be disclosed
to the Internal Revenue Service by Buyer and that any false statement
contained herein could be punished by fine, imprisonment, or both.

Under penalties of perjury, the undersigned declares that it has examined
this certification and to the best of its knowledge and belief, it is true,
correct and complete, and the undersigned further declares that it has
authority to sign and deliver this certification on behalf of the Seller.
