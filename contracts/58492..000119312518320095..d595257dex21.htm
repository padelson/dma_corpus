solely to (x)&nbsp;accurately measure the Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Cash, Closing Indebtedness and Transaction Expenses and (y)&nbsp;measure the difference in Closing Net Working Capital from Target Net Working Capital, and such processes
are not intended to permit the introduction of different judgments, accounting methods, policies, principles, practices, procedures, reserves classifications or estimation methodologies for the purpose of calculating Final Purchase Price than were

of Evidence (as in effect as of the date of this Agreement) and any applicable similar state rule. In the event that Seller and Buyer fail to agree on any of Seller&#146;s proposed adjustments set forth in the Notice of Disagreement within thirty

engagement. Buyer and Seller will instruct the Firm not to, and the Firm will not, assign a value to any item in dispute greater than the greatest value for such item assigned by Buyer, on the one hand, or Seller, on the other hand, or less than the
smallest value for such item assigned by Buyer, on the one hand, or Seller, on the other hand. Buyer and Seller will also instruct the Firm to, and the Firm will, make its determination based solely on written submissions by Buyer and Seller that
are in accordance with this Agreement (i.e., not on the basis of an independent review). The Closing Balance Sheet, the Closing Statement and the resulting Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Cash, Closing Indebtedness and Transaction Expenses, in
each case, as determined by the Firm in accordance with this <U>Section</U><U></U><U>&nbsp;1.04</U>, will be final and binding on the parties on the date the Firm delivers its final determination in writing to Buyer and Seller. The date on which the

party (as finally determined by the Firm) bears to the total amount of disputed items submitted. For example, if Seller submits a Notice of Disagreement for $1,000, and if Buyer contests only $500 of the amount claimed by Seller, and if the Firm
ultimately resolves the dispute by awarding Seller $300 of the $500 contested, then the costs and expenses of the Firm will be allocated 60% (i.e., 300/500) to Buyer and 40% (i.e., 200/500) to Seller. </P>
