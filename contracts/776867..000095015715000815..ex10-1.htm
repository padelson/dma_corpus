period up to and through Closing. Such Letter of Credit shall terminate upon

SECTION 1.02. _Closing Date_. The closing of the Acquisition (the " _Closing_

SECTION 1.03. _Transactions To Be Effected at the Closing_. At the Closing:

(b) Seller shall:

  


 

  

(i) deliver to Purchaser certificates representing the Shares, duly endorsed
in blank or accompanied by stock powers duly endorsed in blank in proper form
for transfer, with appropriate Transfer Tax stamps, if any, affixed; and

(i) deliver to Seller payment, by wire transfer to a bank account designated
in writing by Seller (such designation to be made at least four Business Days

an amount (such amount, the " _Estimated Payment Amount_ ") equal to the sum
of (A) the product of (1) Estimated Closing Book Value multiplied by (2) the
Agreed Multiple, (B) $10 million and (C) the Estimated Adjustment Amount, if
any. In the event that the Estimated Closing Book Value is less than the
Reference Book Value, Seller may, at its option, transfer to the Company
immediately prior to Closing an amount in Cash equal to the difference between
the Reference Book Value and the Estimated Closing Book Value and, upon
receipt of such amount by the Company, such Cash shall be taken into account
as an asset in determining the Estimated Closing Book Value for the purpose of
calculating the Estimated Payment Amount payable under this Section 1.03 and
the Closing Date Book Value for the purpose of calculating the Final Purchase
Price as determined pursuant to Section 1.04. In the event that the Estimated
Closing Book Value is greater than the Reference Book Value (the amount of
such excess, the " _Estimated Book Value Excess Amount_ ") and Seller, Parent
or any subsidiary thereof (other than the Company or any Subsidiary) has
contributed Cash to the Company or any Subsidiary after the date hereof and

contributed to the Company or any Subsidiary in exchange for the fair market
value of the Reorganization Assets (including the Closing Date Reorganization
Value) or the Extracted Entities (including the Extracted Entity Value) or in
respect of any Parent Covers), then an amount (the " _Estimated Adjustment
Amount_ ") equal to (x) the aggregate amount of any Cash contributed to the
Company or any Subsidiary after the date hereof and prior to the Closing Date
(other than, for the avoidance of doubt, Cash contributed to the Company or
any Subsidiary in exchange for the fair market value of the Reorganization
Assets (including the Closing Date Reorganization Value) or the Extracted
Entities (including the Extracted Entity Value) or in respect of any Parent
Covers) by Seller, Parent or any subsidiary thereof (other than the Company or
any Subsidiary), if any (the aggregate amount of such contribution, the "
_Estimated Contribution Amount_ "), or (y) in the event that the Estimated
Contribution Amount exceeds the Estimated Book Value Excess Amount, the
Estimated Book Value Excess Amount, shall be excluded as an asset in
determining the Estimated Closing Book Value for the purpose of calculating
the Estimated Payment Amount payable under Section 1.03 and the Closing Date
Book Value for the purpose of calculating the Final Purchase Price as
determined pursuant to Section 1.04 and shall instead be included in the
Estimated Payment Amount pursuant to clause (C) of the definition thereof; and

  


 

  

(ii) deliver to Seller and the Company counterparts of each of the Ancillary
Agreements to be entered into by Purchaser at the Closing, duly executed by

(d) Seller shall permit the Letter of Credit to be withdrawn by the Purchaser;

  


 

  

    

(e) the Company and the Subsidiaries shall (to the extent not previously

exchange for immediately available funds in U.S. dollars in an amount equal to
the Closing Date Reorganization Value reflected in the calculation of the
Estimated Closing Book Value;

  


 

  

(f) in the event that the conditions set forth in Article VI have been
satisfied and the Company or any Subsidiary holds any of the entities listed
on Section 1.03(f) of the Company Disclosure Letter (such entities the " _Run-
Off Entities_ "), the Company and the Subsidiaries shall sell, transfer and
deliver any Run-Off Entities then held by the Company or any Subsidiary to
Seller or any of its affiliates (other than the Company and the Subsidiaries)
in exchange for immediately available funds in U.S. dollars in an amount equal
to the amount set forth on Section 1.03(f) of the Company Disclosure Letter
with respect to the applicable Run-Off Entity (collectively, the " _Run-Off
Entity Value_ "), and, in connection therewith, Seller and the Company shall
cause Sirius Re Holdings, Inc. to execute and deliver a guarantee (in the form
customarily provided by the Company or its applicable Subsidiary in connection
with similar transactions by White Mountains Solutions Holding Company and as

internationally recognized independent public accounting firm as shall be
agreed upon in writing by Seller and Purchaser (such agreement not to be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned).

1.04(j) of the Company Disclosure Letter) with respect to the matters that
were submitted for resolution to the Accounting Firm, (ii) whether there were
mathematical errors in the Closing Date Statement and (iii) the fees and
expenses allocation pursuant to Section 1.04(f). The Accounting Firm is not

Statement or the Notice of Disagreement that was not submitted for resolution
to the Accounting Firm, (B) any determination as to whether GAAP or SAP was
followed for the Financial Statements, the Statutory Statements, the Estimated
Closing Date Statement or the Closing Date Statement (other than to the extent
required in connection with the determination made in clause (i) of the
preceding sentence), (C) any determination as to whether the Reference Book
Value, the Estimated Closing Book Value, the Estimated Adjustment Amount, the
Closing Date Reorganization Value, the Extracted Entity Value or any other
Cash contributed to the Company or any Subsidiary in exchange for the fair
market value of the Reorganization Assets or the Extracted Entities was
properly calculated in accordance with the Applicable Accounting Principles,
(D) any determination as to the accuracy of Section 3.05 or any other
representation or warranty in this Agreement, or (E) any determination as to
compliance by the Company, Purchaser or Seller with any of its covenants in
this Agreement. Any disputes not within the scope of disputes to be resolved
by the Accounting Firm pursuant to this Section 1.04(d) as well as any
disputes about the scope of disputes to be resolved by the Accounting Firm
pursuant to this Section 1.04(d) shall be resolved in accordance with Section
10.09. Any determination by the Accounting Firm, and any work or analyses
performed by the Accounting Firm, may not be offered as evidence in any suit,
action or proceeding as evidence of a breach of Section 3.05, a breach of any
other representation or warranty in this Agreement or a breach of any covenant
in this Agreement (other than a breach of this Section 1.04).

  


 

  

(e) The final determination by the Accounting Firm of the matters submitted to
it pursuant to Section 1.04(b) shall: (i) be in writing; (ii) include the
Accounting Firm's calculation of the Closing Date Book Value; (iii) include
the Accounting Firm's determination of each matter submitted to it pursuant to
Section 1.04(b); (iv) include the allocation of fees and expenses pursuant to
Section 1.04(f); and (v) include a brief summary of the Accounting Firm's
reasons for its determination of each issue.

  


 

  

(f) The dispute resolution by the Accounting Firm under this Section 1.04
shall constitute an expert determination under New York CPLR Article 76 and
shall not constitute an arbitration. The determinations of the Accounting Firm
as to any issue of fact shall be final and binding, absent actual and
intentional fraud, bad faith or manifest error or clear failure to apply
clause (i) or (ii) of the definition of "Applicable Accounting Principles".
Judgment may be entered upon the determination of the Accounting Firm in the
Supreme Court of the State of New York, New York County, the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York or any other court having
jurisdiction over the party against which such determination is to be
enforced. The cost of any dispute resolution (including the fees and expenses
of the Accounting Firm and reasonable attorney fees and expenses of the
parties) pursuant to this Section 1.04 shall be borne by Seller and Purchaser
equally. The fees and disbursements of Purchaser's independent accountants
incurred in connection with their preparation and review of the Closing Date
Statement and any Notice of Disagreement shall be borne by Purchaser, and the
fees and disbursements of Seller's independent accountants incurred in
connection with their preparation and review of the Closing Date Statement and
any Notice of Disagreement shall be borne by Seller.

  


 

  

    

(g) (i) In the event that the Closing Date Book Value as finally determined in
accordance with Section 1.04(b) (giving effect, for the avoidance of doubt, to
any amounts transferred to the Company prior to Closing pursuant to the second
sentence of Section 1.03(c)(i) as an asset in Closing Date Book Value) is less
than the Reference Book Value, Seller may elect, by delivering written notice
to Purchaser no later than five Business Days following the date on which the
Closing Date Statement becomes final and binding on the parties in accordance
with Section 1.04(b), to transfer to the Company an amount (such amount, the "
_Top-Up Amount_ ") in Cash equal to the difference between the Reference Book
Value and the Closing Date Book Value as finally determined in accordance with
Section 1.04(b). If Seller so notifies Purchaser of its election to transfer
the Top-Up Amount to the Company, (1) the Closing Date Book Value as finally
determined in accordance with Section 1.04(b) shall be increased by the Top-Up
Amount (such Closing Date Book Value, the " _Increased Closing Date Book
Value_ "), (2) the parties shall use the Increased Closing Date Book Value
instead of the Closing Date Book Value as finally determined in accordance
with Section 1.04(b) for the purpose of calculating the Final Purchase Price
as determined pursuant to, and any amounts payable pursuant to, Section
1.04(h) and (3) Seller shall transfer the Top-Up Amount to the Company no
later than such time as any amounts are payable pursuant to Section 1.04(h)
(and the payment of the Top-Up Amount may be applied to offset any payment
required to be made by Purchaser under Section 1.04(h)).

  


 

  

(ii) In the event that (1) the Closing Date Book Value as finally determined
in accordance with Section 1.04(b) (giving effect, for the avoidance of doubt,
to any amounts transferred to the Company prior to Closing pursuant to the
second sentence of Section 1.03(c)(i) as an asset in Closing Date Book Value)
is greater than the Reference Book Value (the amount of such excess, the "
_Book Value Excess Amount_ ") and (2) Seller, Parent or any subsidiary thereof
(other than the Company or any Subsidiary) contributed Cash to the Company or
any Subsidiary after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Closing Date
(other than, for the avoidance of doubt, Cash contributed to the Company or
any Subsidiary in exchange for the fair market value of the Reorganization
Assets (including the Closing Date Reorganization Value) or the Extracted
Entities (including the Extracted Entity Value) or in respect of any Parent
Covers), then the Closing Date Book Value as finally determined in accordance
with Section 1.04(b) shall be decreased by an amount (such amount, the "
_Adjustment Amount_ " and such Closing Date Book Value, the " _Decreased
Closing Date Book Value_ ") equal to (x) the aggregate amount of any Cash
contributed to the Company or any Subsidiary after the date of this Agreement
and prior to the Closing Date (other than, for the avoidance of doubt, Cash
contributed to the Company or any Subsidiary in exchange for the fair market
value of the Reorganization Assets (including the Closing Date Reorganization
Value) or the Extracted Entities (including the Extracted Entity Value) or in
respect of any Parent Covers) by Seller, Parent or any subsidiary thereof
(other than the Company or any Subsidiary), if any (the aggregate amount of
such contributions, the " _Contribution Amount_ "), or (y) in the event that
the Contribution Amount exceeds the Book Value Excess Amount, the Book Value
Excess Amount, and the parties shall use the Decreased Closing Date Book Value
instead of the Closing Date Book Value as finally determined in accordance
with Section 1.04(b) for the purpose of calculating the Final Purchase Price
as determined pursuant to, and any amounts payable pursuant to, Section
1.04(h) and the Adjustment Amount shall instead be included in the Final
Purchase Price pursuant to clause (C) of the definition of Purchase Price.

  


 

  

    

(h) In the event that the Estimated Payment Amount (based on the Estimated
Closing Book Value as determined pursuant to Section 1.03(c)(i)) does not
equal the Purchase Price (based on the Closing Date Book Value as finally
determined in accordance with Section 1.04(b) or, if applicable, the Increased
Closing Date Book Value or the Decreased Closing Date Book Value) (such
Purchase Price, the " _Final Purchase Price_ "), then (i) if the Final
Purchase Price is greater than the Estimated Payment Amount, Purchaser shall,
within seven Business Days after the Final Purchase Price is so finally
determined, make payment by wire transfer in immediately available funds in
U.S. dollars of the amount of such difference and (ii) if the Final Purchase
Price is less than the Estimated Payment Amount, Seller shall, within seven
Business Days after the Final Purchase Price is so finally determined, make
payment by wire transfer in immediately available funds in U.S. dollars of the
amount of such difference. Any payment pursuant to this Section 1.04(h) shall
be accompanied by interest thereon, compounded daily (based on a 365-day
year), at a rate per annum equal to the average of the six-month LIBOR for
United States dollars as published by Reuters as of 11:00 a.m. (London time)
on each day during the period for which interest is to be paid, from and
including the Closing Date to but excluding the date of payment.

  


 

  

(i) In connection with the determination of the Closing Date Book Value
pursuant to this Section 1.04:

  


 

  

(i) During the 45 days following Seller's receipt of the Closing Date
Statement, Seller and its independent accountants shall be permitted to review
the working papers of Purchaser, the Company and their respective independent
accountants relating to the Closing Date Statement.

  


 

  

    

(ii) From the Closing Date through the resolution of any adjustment to the
Purchase Price contemplated by this Section 1.04, Seller, Purchaser and the
Company shall not take any action with respect to the accounting Books and
Records of the Company on which the Closing Date Statement is to be based that
are not consistent with the Company's past practices.

  


 

  

(iii) From the Closing Date through the resolution of any adjustment to the
Purchase Price contemplated by this Section 1.04, Seller, Purchaser and the
Company shall afford to Seller and Purchaser and their respective independent
accountants reasonable access to the personnel, properties, Books and Records
of the Company and the Subsidiaries for any purpose relating to the adjustment
contemplated by this Section 1.04.

  


 

  

(j) In this Agreement:

  


 

  

" _Applicable Accounting Principles_ " means (i) the principles, policies and
procedures set forth in Section 1.04(j) of the Company Disclosure Letter,
whether or not used by the Company historically or in the Financial Statements
or the Statutory Statements and whether or not in accordance with GAAP or SAP,

of the Company and the Subsidiaries, in either case as a result of events or
developments occurring, or information becoming available, after the Closing
Date, even if otherwise required by clause (i), (ii) or (iii) above.

  


 

  

SECTION 1.05. _Settlement of Parent Covers_. (a) From and after the date
hereof until such time as all Parent Covers have expired or been sold,
unwound, settled, terminated or otherwise extinguished, the Company shall

forth each Parent Cover (whether or not currently in effect), including each
Parent Cover set forth on Section 10.04(b)(4) of the Company Disclosure
Letter, and reasonable detail regarding (w) the effective date, covered perils
and territories and attachment point, (x) the consideration paid (including
earned and unearned premiums as of the report date) by the Company or any
Subsidiary to acquire such Parent Cover (such amount, the " _Parent Cover
Costs_ "), (y) the amount of any recoveries or other payment received or
receivable therefrom by the Company or any Subsidiary (the " _Parent Cover
Benefits_ ") and (z) the legal entity purchasing each such Parent Cover, the
applicable statutory tax rate and the applicable tax-adjusted amounts of the
Parent Cover Costs and Parent Cover Benefits, in each case from and after the
date of any previous settlement of Parent Cover Costs and Parent Cover
Benefits pursuant to this Section 1.05. Promptly upon request by Seller and
promptly following any material change in the status of any Parent Cover or
the recoveries receivable thereunder, the Company shall deliver a copy of such
schedule to Seller.

  


 

  

    

(b) At least two Business Days prior to the anticipated Closing Date, the
Company shall deliver to Seller the then-current Parent Cover Schedule. In the
event that the then current tax-adjusted Parent Cover Costs (not previously
settled pursuant to this Section 1.05) exceed the then current tax-adjusted
Parent Cover Benefits (not previously settled pursuant to this Section 1.05),
at the Closing, Seller shall deliver to the Company an amount in Cash equal to
such excess (the amount of such excess at any time, the " _Seller Settlement
Amount_ "). In the event that the then current tax-adjusted Parent Cover
Benefits (not previously settled pursuant to this Section 1.05) exceed the
then current tax-adjusted Parent Cover Costs (not previously settled pursuant
to this Section 1.05), at the Closing, the Company shall deliver to Seller an
amount in Cash equal to such excess (the amount of such excess at any time, "
_Company Settlement Amount_ ").

  


 

  

(c) During the period from and after the Closing until such time as all Parent
Covers have expired or been sold, unwound, settled, terminated or otherwise
extinguished and no further Parent Cover Costs or Parent Cover Benefits may
accrue or be incurred, the Company shall, on a quarterly basis, deliver to
Seller the then-current Parent Cover Schedule and promptly thereafter, Seller
shall deliver an amount in Cash equal to the Seller Settlement Amount, if any,
and Purchaser shall deliver to Seller an amount in Cash equal to the Company
Settlement Amount, if any.

  


 

  

(d) With respect to each Parent Cover, from and after the date hereof and
until such Parent Cover has expired or been sold, unwound, settled, terminated
or otherwise extinguished, the Company shall, and shall cause any applicable
Subsidiary to, use its reasonable best efforts at the tax-adjusted cost of the
Seller to take any action with respect to such Parent Cover upon delivery of
written notice from Seller to the Company, including to sell, unwind, settle,
terminate or otherwise extinguish such Parent Cover.

  


 

  

(e) During the period from and after the Closing until such time as all Parent
Cover Costs and all Parent Cover Benefits have been finally settled, the
Company shall afford to Seller and its independent accountants reasonable
access to the personnel, properties and Books and Records of the Company and
the Subsidiaries for any purpose relating to the payments contemplated by this
Section 1.05.

  


 

  

(f) Disputes arising under this Section 1.05 regarding any Seller Settlement
Amount or Company Settlement Amount or the calculation of the amounts set
forth on the Parent Cover Schedule shall be identified by the party receiving
the Parent Cover Schedule within 30 days of the delivery of such schedule and
any dispute not resolved by mutual agreement within 30 days of the delivery of
such notice shall be resolved by the Accounting Firm. The Accounting Firm
shall resolve any disputed items within 30 days of having the item referred to
it pursuant to such procedures as it may require, and any such resolution by
the Accounting Firm shall be final. The costs, fees and expenses of the
Accounting Firm relating to any disputes under this Section 1.05 shall be
borne equally by Purchaser and Seller.

  


 

  

    

SECTION 1.06. _No Setoff_. Seller and Purchaser acknowledge and agree that the
payments contemplated by this Article I are non-refundable and that no party
shall have any right of abatement, reduction, setoff, counterclaim,
rescission, recoupment, refund, defense or deduction with respect thereto, in
each case except as otherwise expressly provided for in this Article I.

  


 

  

SECTION 1.07. _Withholding_. To the extent withholding is required by
Applicable Law, the Purchaser shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
the Purchase Price or any other payment made by it under this Agreement such
amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold under Applicable Law (such
requirement, the " _Withholding Tax_ "), and any amounts so deducted and
withheld shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made, _provided_ that, if the Withholding Tax was imposed as a result of a
present or former connection between Purchaser and the jurisdiction imposing
such Withholding Tax (other than a connection arising as a result of the sale
of the Shares hereunder), including for the avoidance of doubt any Withholding
Tax imposed under the laws of Singapore, then the Purchaser shall pay such
additional amounts as necessary so that the total amount received by Seller is
equal to the amount Seller would have received had no Withholding Tax been
imposed. Purchaser and Seller shall cooperate to reduce or eliminate any
Withholding Tax, and shall each provide to the other party any forms it is
eligible to provide to reduce or eliminate such Withholding Tax.

  


 

  

SECTION 1.08. _Substitution_. Purchaser shall be entitled, by delivering
written notice to Seller no later than two Business Days before the Closing
Date, to require Seller to transfer the Shares to CMB at the Closing rather
than Purchaser; provided, however, that Purchaser's election to require Seller
to deliver the Shares to CMB shall not relieve Purchaser of its obligation to
pay the Estimated Payment Amount at Closing pursuant to Section 1.03 or any
other obligations under this Agreement. If Purchaser elects to require Seller
to transfer the Shares to CMB pursuant to this Section 1.08, then following
Closing all references to Purchaser in this Agreement shall be deemed to refer
instead CMB and CMB shall be entitled to enforce any and all rights of
Purchaser hereunder.

Subsidiaries to furnish promptly to Purchaser any available information
concerning the Company or a Subsidiary as Purchaser may reasonably request, so
long as such access or requests do not unreasonably disrupt the normal

Company and the Subsidiaries) or (B) were prepared by or exclusively for the

SECTION 5.03. _Confidentiality_. Purchaser acknowledges that the information
being provided to it in connection with the Acquisition and the consummation

Agreements_ "), the terms of which are incorporated herein by reference.

and agrees that any and all other information provided to it by Purchaser
concerning Purchaser or its affiliates, shall remain subject to the terms and

SECTION 5.04. _Reasonable Best Efforts; Consents, Approvals and Filings;
Antitrust Strategy_. (a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions and
other agreements set forth in this Agreement, each of Seller, the Company,
Purchaser and CMB shall, and Purchaser and CMB shall cause CMI to, use its
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, and Purchaser and CMB
shall cause all other Potential Controllers (other than Purchaser, CMI and
CMB) if applicable to take or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do or
cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate in doing, all things necessary,
proper or advisable to consummate and make effective as promptly as
practicable the Acquisition and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including using its reasonable best efforts to (i) comply as
promptly as reasonably practicable with all requirements of Governmental
Entities and Lloyd's applicable to the Acquisition, (ii) seek to obtain or
make as promptly as reasonably practicable all approvals, filings or notices
necessary or advisable in connection with the Acquisition, including any
approvals, filings or notices required under the HSR Act and in connection
with the Regulatory Approvals (the " _Governmental Approvals_ "), and (iii)
fulfill or cause the fulfillment of the conditions to Closing set forth in
Article VI. The parties shall, and Purchaser shall cause all other Potential
Controllers to, cooperate with the reasonable requests of each other in
seeking to obtain as promptly as practicable all such Governmental Approvals.
In connection therewith, Seller and Purchaser shall make, and cause their
respective affiliates, and in the case of Purchaser, all other Potential
Controllers, to make, all filings required by Applicable Laws and the byelaws
and requirements of Lloyd's as promptly as practicable after the date hereof
in order to facilitate prompt consummation of the Acquisition and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and shall provide and shall cause
their respective affiliates, and in the case of Purchaser, all other Potential
Controllers, to provide such information and communications to Governmental
Entities and Lloyd's as such Governmental Entities and Lloyd's may request.
For the purposes of this Section 5.04, "reasonable best efforts" shall not
require Purchaser to take or agree to take any action or agree to any
condition, limitation, restriction or requirement that, individually or in the
aggregate with any other actions, conditions, limitations, restrictions or
requirements, would result in a Burdensome Condition. A " _Burdensome
Condition_ " means (i) a material adverse effect on the business, operations,
condition (financial or otherwise) or results of operation of (x) Purchaser
and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole or (y) the Company and the
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole or (ii) any requirement to sell, license,
assign, transfer, divest, hold separate or otherwise dispose of, before or
after the Closing Date, any material assets (other than Investment Assets) or
businesses of Purchaser, the Company or the Subsidiaries or any of their
respective affiliates, or (iii) the imposition on Purchaser or any Reinsurance
Subsidiary by any Governmental Entity of any capital requirement not
applicable to insurers generally in the jurisdiction of such Governmental
Entity that expressly requires Purchaser or any of its affiliates to
contribute more than $75,000,000 of additional capital to the Company and the
Subsidiaries (including in order to fulfill trusteed assets requirements)
(provided that, for the avoidance of doubt (x) to the extent that the Company
and the Subsidiaries are not prohibited under Applicable Law and the byelaws
or requirements of Lloyd's, the Company and the Subsidiaries shall transfer
capital and apply assets to fulfill any such capital requirement (including
any such trusteed asset requirement), and (y) (1) any trusteed asset
requirement to the extent so funded by capital of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries and (2) any transfer solely among the Company and its
Subsidiaries shall not be deemed a contribution of Purchaser or any of its
affiliates; provided further that, to the extent such transfer of capital
among the Company and its Subsidiaries to fulfill such capital requirements
(including any trusteed asset requirement) causes a Governmental Entity with
jurisdiction over a transferring entity to impose an express obligation on
Purchaser or any of its affiliates to contribute additional capital to such
transferring entity, such contribution obligation shall also be subject to
this clause (iii), including the foregoing proviso).

  

  

    

  

(b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, as soon as reasonably
practicable after the date of this Agreement, the parties shall make, and
Purchaser shall cause all other Potential Controllers to make, all filings and
notifications with all Governmental Entities and Lloyd's that may be or may
become reasonably necessary, proper or advisable under this Agreement and
Applicable Laws and the byelaws and requirements of Lloyd's to consummate and
make effective the Acquisition and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including (i) Purchaser causing all documents, forms, applications,
submissions and notifications (including an application by HGB for the
determination of non-control in the form required by the New York State
Department of Financial Services) to be filed with Insurance Regulators or
otherwise in each jurisdiction where required by applicable insurance or
financial services laws or the byelaws and requirements of Lloyd's with
respect to the Acquisition (including with respect to the Regulatory
Approvals), such filings to be made as promptly as practicable, and in any
event not later than 20 Business Days following the date of this Agreement
and, in each case, to be in compliance with all material requirements of
Applicable Law or the byelaws and requirements of Lloyd's, if applicable, and
(x) in the case of the Form A of Purchaser, CMI and CMB to be filed with the
New York State Department of Financial Services and the Tennessee Department
of Commerce and Insurance and the filings of Purchaser, CMI, CMB and HGB in
respect of the U.K. Approvals, to be in substantially the form which has been
delivered to Seller prior to the date hereof, (y) in the case of the request
for determination of non-control or disclaimer of affiliation or similar
relief, as applicable, in respect of HGB to be filed with the New York State
Department of Financial Services and the Tennessee Department of Commerce and
Insurance, to be substantially consistent with the information regarding BGB
and HGB contained in the filings of HGB in respect of the U.K. Approvals in
the form which has been delivered to Seller prior to the date hereof and (z)
to the extent that HGB is required by the New York State Department of
Financial Services or the Tennessee Department of Commerce and Insurance to
file a Form A, (1) such Form A will be substantially consistent with the
information regarding HGB and BGB contained in the filings of HGB in respect
of the U.K. Approvals in the form which has been delivered to Seller prior to
the date hereof and (2) the NAIC biographical affidavit in respect of the sole
director of HGB to be submitted with such Form A will be substantially in the
form which has been delivered to Seller prior to the date hereof, (ii) Seller
and Purchaser each making an appropriate filing of a notification and report
form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the Acquisition, such filings to
be made not later than 10 Business Days following the date of this Agreement,
(iii) Seller and Purchaser each making as promptly as reasonably practicable
any other filing that may be required under any other applicable antitrust or
competition law or by any Governmental Entity with jurisdiction over
enforcement of any applicable antitrust or competition laws and (iv) Seller
and Purchaser causing to be made as promptly as reasonably practicable any
other filing that may be required under any insurance, financial services or
similar Applicable Law or the byelaws or requirements of Lloyd's or by any
Governmental Entity with jurisdiction over enforcement of any applicable
insurance, financial services or similar Applicable Law or Lloyd's, including,
in the case of Purchaser, any such filings required to be made by any other
Potential Controller. Seller and Purchaser each shall supply, and Purchaser
shall cause each other Potential Controller to supply, as promptly as
reasonably practicable any additional information and documentary material
that may be reasonably requested pursuant to the HSR Act or any other
Applicable Laws or the byelaws or requirements of Lloyd's. Purchaser shall
have sole responsibility for the filing fees associated with all filings under
the HSR Act and any filings required by applicable insurance laws, and Seller
and Purchaser shall equally bear the cost of any filing fees associated with
any other required filings. Prior to furnishing any written materials to any
Insurance Regulator in connection with the Acquisition or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the furnishing party shall
provide the other party with a copy thereof and Purchaser shall provide Seller
a copy of any such materials to be furnished by each other Potential
Controller, and such other party shall have a reasonable opportunity to
provide comments thereon. Each party shall give to the other party prompt
written notice if it receives, and Purchaser shall give Seller prompt written
notice if any other Potential Controller receives, any notice or other
communication from any Insurance Regulator in connection with the Acquisition
or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and, in the case of
any such notice or communication which is in writing, shall promptly furnish
such other party with a copy thereof. If any Insurance Regulator requires that
a hearing or pre-application meeting be held in connection with any requisite
approval, Purchaser and CMB shall, and shall cause CMI to, use its reasonable
best efforts to arrange, and Purchaser shall cause each other Potential
Controller to arrange, for such hearing or pre-application meeting to be held
as promptly as practicable after the notice that such hearing or pre-
application meeting is required has been received by Purchaser, CMI, CMB or
such other Potential Controller and Seller shall use its reasonable best
efforts, and shall cooperate with Purchaser in its efforts, to arrange that
such hearings or pre-application meetings are held as promptly as practicable
after Purchaser, CMI, CMB or such other Potential Controller receives notice
that such hearing or pre-application meeting is required. Purchaser shall give
to Seller reasonable prior written notice of the time and place when any
meetings or other conferences may be held by it, CMI, CMB or any other
Potential Controller with any Insurance Regulator in connection with the
Acquisition and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
Seller shall have the right to have a representative or representatives attend
or otherwise participate in any such meeting or conference; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Purchaser shall have the right to require Seller's
representative or representatives to not attend or participate in any portion
of any such meeting or conference to the extent that Purchaser reasonably
believes such meeting or conference will involve discussions of confidential
information of Purchaser. Neither party shall be required to comply with any
of the foregoing provisions of this Section 5.04(b) to the extent that such
compliance would be prohibited by Applicable Law.

  

  

    

(c) From and after the date of this Agreement, Seller and Purchaser shall use
their reasonable best efforts, and shall cooperate with each other, to obtain
as soon as reasonably practicable following the date hereof all required
approvals, consents, waivers or authorizations from third parties under any
Listed Contract required in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements
(each, a " _Third Party Consent_ "). Seller and Purchaser shall equally bear
the costs, fees and expenses (including any license or other fees and
expenses) associated with obtaining the Third Party Consents. In the event any
Third Party Consent is not obtained by the Closing Date, (i) Seller shall
continue at Purchaser's request to use reasonable best efforts to cooperate
with Purchaser in attempting to obtain any such Third Party Consent, (ii) to
the extent practicable, Seller and Purchaser shall negotiate in good faith
with respect to an alternative arrangement (such as a license or transition
services agreement) until such time as such Third Party Consent has been
obtained which results in the Company and the Subsidiaries receiving the
benefits and bearing all the costs, liabilities and burdens with respect to
any such Listed Contract ( _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall
undertake to pay or satisfy all costs, expenses, obligations and liabilities
incurred by Seller or any of its affiliates in connection with any such
alternative arrangement) and (iii) notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, subject to Seller using its reasonable best efforts as
required by this Section 5.04(c), the failure of any such Third Party Consent
to be obtained shall in no event be deemed to give rise to a breach or
inaccuracy in any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement given or
made by Seller in this Agreement or give rise to any indemnification
obligation under Article VIII and shall not be considered for purposes of
determining the satisfaction of any of the conditions set forth in Article VI.

  


 

  

    

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, subject to
Purchaser's compliance with its obligations pursuant to Section 5.04(a) and
(b), Purchaser has the sole right to control and direct all antitrust strategy
in connection with review of the Agreement by any Governmental Entity, or any
litigation by, or negotiations with, any antitrust authority or other person
relating to the Acquisition under the HSR Act or any other antitrust law and
will take the lead in all meetings, discussions and communications with any
Governmental Entity relating to obtaining antitrust approval for the
Agreement; provided that, to the extent reasonably practicable and not
prohibited by Applicable Law, Purchaser will provide Seller an opportunity to
review in advance, and Purchaser will consult with and consider in good faith
the comments of Seller and/or the Company with respect to, any filing,
communication, defense, litigation, negotiation or strategy. If there is a
disagreement about antitrust strategy, the Purchaser's decision controls.

  


 

  

SECTION 5.05. _Expenses_. Whether or not the Closing takes place, and except
as set forth in Section 5.04, Article VIII and Article IX, all fees, costs and
expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby shall be paid
by the party incurring such fees, costs or expenses.

  


 

  

SECTION 5.06. _Employee Matters_.

_Continuation Period_ "), Purchaser shall, or shall cause the Company and the
Subsidiaries or Purchaser's other affiliates to, provide to each Employee who
continues employment with the Company and the Subsidiaries after the Closing
Date (such Employees, the " _Continuing Employees_ ") (i) a base salary or
base wages and incentive compensation opportunities (both annual and long-
term) that are no less favorable in the aggregate than the base salary or base
wages and incentive compensation opportunities (both annual and long-term)
applicable to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Closing (with
long-term incentive opportunities being based on performance goals relating to
the Company and the Subsidiaries), (ii) employee benefits (other than defined
benefit pension and retiree medical benefits) that are no less favorable in
the aggregate than those provided to such Continuing Employee immediately
prior to the Closing and (iii) in the case of each such Continuing Employee
whose employment is terminated by Purchaser and its affiliates (including,
after the Closing, the Company and the Subsidiaries) prior to the last day of
the Continuation Period, severance benefits and payments that are no less

have been provided to such Continuing Employee under the applicable severance
policy or practice of the Company and the Subsidiaries immediately prior to
the Closing. Subject to the limitations under Section 5.01(a) of this
Agreement, nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as altering or
limiting the rights of the Company and the Subsidiaries to (x) terminate the
employment of any Employee, (y) amend, modify or terminate any compensation or
employee benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement, subject to the terms
of such plan, program, agreement or arrangement or as necessary to comply with
Applicable Laws or (z) except as expressly set forth herein, change the terms
or conditions of employment of any Employee. Except as contemplated under
Sections 5.06(g) and 5.06(h), the active participation of the Participants in
the compensation and benefit plans, programs and arrangements of Parent and
its affiliates (other than a Stand-Alone Benefit Plan) shall terminate
effective as of the Closing, and from and after the Closing, none of Purchaser
or its affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Company and the
Subsidiaries) shall have any Liability under or in respect of (and Purchaser

of its affiliates shall have any Liability under or in respect of (and Parent
and its affiliates shall be indemnified and held harmless with respect to) the
Stand-Alone Benefit Plans.

  


 

  

    

(b) Parent, Seller and Purchaser intend that the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall not constitute or give rise
to a severance of employment of any Employee (or, if applicable, severance
from service of any other service provider) prior to or upon such consummation
of such transactions and that the Employees and such service providers shall
have continuous and uninterrupted employment or service (as applicable)
immediately before and immediately after the Closing. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, Parent and its affiliates shall not have any
responsibility for, and the Purchaser and its affiliates shall hold harmless
and indemnify Parent and its affiliates with respect to, any and all
Liabilities arising as a result of the actual or constructive termination of
(i) an Employee's employment (or, if applicable, other service provider's
service) as a result of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and (ii) a Continuing Employee's employment (or, if applicable,
other service provider's service) with Purchaser and its affiliates (including
the Company and the Subsidiaries) on or after the Closing.

  


 

  

(c) From and after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall, or shall cause the
Company and the Subsidiaries or Purchaser's other affiliates to, (i) honor all
obligations under the Stand-Alone Benefit Plans in accordance with their terms
as in effect immediately prior to the Closing, (ii) recognize all the
Continuing Employees' accrued and unused vacation and other paid time-off
benefits consistent with the terms of the vacation or similar policies of the
Company and the Subsidiaries applicable to Continuing Employees as in effect
immediately prior to the Closing and (iii) pay, no later than March 15, 2016,
all annual bonuses that are payable to Continuing Employees with respect to

amount paid by Purchaser and its affiliates (including, after the Closing, the
Company and the Subsidiaries) to Continuing Employees with respect to the FY
2015 Bonuses shall not be less than the amount accrued as a liability in
respect of the FY 2015 Bonuses in the calculation of the Closing Date Book
Value. For the avoidance of doubt, for purposes of the SIG LTIP, the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be deemed to constitute a
"change in control" with respect to the Participants.

  


 

  

(d) From and after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall, or shall cause the
Company and the Subsidiaries or Purchaser's other affiliates to, (i)
recognize, for all purposes under all plans, programs and arrangements
established or maintained by Purchaser or any of its affiliates (including,
after the Closing, the Company and the Subsidiaries) a Continuing Employee's
service with Parent and its affiliates (including the Company and the
Subsidiaries) and any of their respective predecessors, including for purposes
of eligibility, vesting and benefit levels and benefit accruals (other than
benefit accruals under a defined benefit pension plan), _provided_ that no
such recognition of service shall be required to the extent that it would
result in a duplication of benefits, (ii) waive any pre-existing condition
exclusion, actively-at-work requirement or waiting period under all employee
health and other welfare benefit plans established or maintained by Purchaser
or any of its affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Company and the
Subsidiaries) for the benefit of Continuing Employees, except to the extent
such pre-existing condition, exclusion, requirement or waiting period would
have been applicable under the corresponding Company Benefit Plan or any plan,
program, agreement, arrangement or understanding that is required by
Applicable Laws immediately prior to the Closing and (c) provide full credit
for any co-payments, deductibles or similar out-of -pocket payments made or
incurred by Continuing Employees prior to the Closing Date for the plan year
in which the Closing occurs.

  


 

  

    

(e) Purchaser agrees to provide, or to cause its affiliates to provide, any
required notice under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act
(the " _WARN Act_ ") and any similar Applicable Law and to otherwise comply
with the WARN Act and any Applicable Law with respect to any "plant closing"
or "mass layoff" (as defined in the WARN Act) or group termination or similar
event affecting Employees (including as a result of the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement) and occurring on or after the
Closing Date. Parent and Purchaser shall indemnify and hold each other
harmless, respectively, with respect to, any Liability incurred pursuant to
the WARN Act or any similar Applicable Law in connection with any Employee
whose employment terminates before the Closing Date (in the case of Parent's
indemnity) or on or after the Closing Date (in the case of Purchaser's
indemnity). Seller shall notify Purchaser prior to the Closing of any layoffs
of any Employees in the 90-day period prior to the Closing.

  


 

  

(f) (i) Each SIG Performance Unit Award that is outstanding immediately prior
to the Closing shall remain outstanding in accordance with its terms from and
after the Closing, and service with the Company and the Subsidiaries following
the Closing shall be taken into account for purposes of determining the
vesting of each such SIG Performance Unit Award after the Closing. Each SIG
Performance Unit Award shall be settled in cash by Purchaser and the Company
after the Closing in accordance with its terms based on the Payment Value (as
defined in the SIG LTIP) and Payout Percentage (as defined in the SIG LTIP)
for the applicable Award Period (as defined in the SIG LTIP), in each case, as
determined by Purchaser and the Company in accordance with the SIG LTIP;
_provided_ that Parent hereby agrees and acknowledges that such Payment Value
and Payout Percentage (calculated in accordance with Section 5(c) of the SIG
LTIP) shall not reflect the effect of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement on the UROC (as defined in the SIG LTIP) for such Award Period;
_provided_ further that, as soon as reasonably practicable after the last day
of the applicable Award Period, Purchaser and the Company shall notify Seller
of the Payment Value and Payout Percentage determined by Purchaser and the
Company with respect to such Award Period. Notwithstanding any other provision
of this Section 5.06 to the contrary, the aggregate amount of cash paid by
Purchaser and the Company to holders of SIG Performance Unit Awards
outstanding immediately prior to the Closing for purposes of settling such
awards shall not be less than the Aggregate Adjusted SIG PUA Amount (as
defined below).

  


 

  

    

(ii) Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that, from and after the Closing Date,
(A) Purchaser and its affiliates (including the Company and the Subsidiaries)
shall be solely responsible for (and Seller and its affiliates shall not have
any Liability under or in respect of (and shall be indemnified and held
harmless by Purchaser and its affiliates with respect to)) any payment
(including any employment or similar Taxes (including social security
contributions or the local equivalent)) required to be made in respect of the
settlement of SIG Performance Unit Awards, it being understood and agreed
however that Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless Purchaser and its
affiliates (including the Company and the Subsidiaries after the Closing Date)
from and against any liability arising from or with respect to the effect of
the proposed transactions contemplated by this Agreement on the calculation of
the UROC under Section 5(c) of the SIG LTIP, and (B) the Company and its
Subsidiaries shall be responsible for all Tax withholding and reporting
obligations with respect to the SIG Performance Unit Awards.

  


 

  

(iii) In connection with the Seller's calculation of the Estimated Closing
Book Value, Seller shall determine, with respect to each SIG Performance Unit
Award that is outstanding immediately prior to the Closing Date, (A) the SIG
PUA Amount (as defined below) and (B) the Adjusted SIG PUA Amount (as defined
below). For purposes of this Agreement, the " _SIG PUA Amount_ " shall equal
the product of (1) the number of Performance Units subject to a SIG
Performance Unit Award, (2) the Payment Value with respect to such SIG
Performance Unit Award and (3) the Payout Percentage with respect to such SIG
Performance Unit Award, and the Payment Value and Payout Percentage shall be
determined as described in this Section 5.06(f)(iii). The Payment Value and
the Payout Percentage with respect to the applicable Award Period shall be
determined for purposes of the calculation of Estimated Closing Book Value and
Closing Date Book Value, as applicable, by taking into account the UROC as of
the Business Day immediately prior to the Closing Date and, with respect to
the portion of such Award Period occurring on and after the Closing Date,
based on a forecast of the UROC with respect to the remainder such Award
Period (in each case, without regard to any effect of the transactions
contemplated under this Agreement on the UROC). Such determinations of the SIG
PUA Amount, the applicable Payment Value and the applicable Payout Percentage
shall otherwise be in accordance with the terms of the SIG LTIP and otherwise
consistent with past practice. The " _Adjusted SIG PUA Amount_ " shall equal
the product of (1) the applicable SIG PUA Amount and (2) the Pre-Closing Pro-
Rata Portion.

  

  

The Estimated Closing Book Value as determined pursuant to Section 1.03(c)(i)
and the Closing Date Book Value as finally determined in accordance with
Section 1.04 shall (x) reflect as liabilities (A) the Aggregate Adjusted SIG
PUA Amount and (B) the employer-paid portion of any employment or similar
Taxes (including social security contributions or the local equivalent) that
would be imposed on the Company or a Subsidiary upon the payment of the
Aggregate Adjusted SIG PUA Amount and (y) reflect as assets the Tax Benefit
attributable to the amounts in clause (x). The calculation of each amount in
the preceding sentence (and each component thereof) shall be subject to the
provisions of Section 1.04 and shall be made in accordance with the Applicable
Accounting Principles.

  


 

  


 

  

    

(g) (i) Prior to the Closing, the Board of Directors of Parent (or a duly
authorized committee thereof) shall adopt such resolutions and take such other
actions as may be necessary to provide that, notwithstanding any provision to
the contrary in the Parent LTIP, each Parent Performance Share Award that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Closing shall remain outstanding in
accordance with its terms from and after the Closing and shall be assumed by
the Company (provided that service with the Company and the Subsidiaries
following the Closing shall be taken into account for purposes of vesting
thereunder after the Closing) and shall be settled in cash by Purchaser and
the Company after the Closing in accordance with its terms based on (A) the
Performance Percentage (as defined in the Parent LTIP) for the applicable
Award Period (as defined in the Parent LTIP), as determined by Parent in
accordance with the Parent LTIP, which Performance Percentage shall be the
same as the Performance Percentage determined by Parent to be applicable to
the Parent Performance Share Awards held by then-active employees of Seller
and its affiliates (other than employees of the Company and the Subsidiaries)
with respect to the same Award Period and (B) the Parent common share price
(as determined by the Parent in good faith in accordance with the Parent LTIP)
at the time of settlement; _provided_ that, as soon as reasonably practicable
after the last day of the applicable Award Period, Seller shall notify
Purchaser of the Performance Percentage for the applicable Award Period and
such Parent common share price. The amount payable by the Purchaser and the
Company to settle such a Parent Performance Share Award is referred to as the
" _Parent PSA Amount_ ".

  


 

  

(ii) With respect to each Parent Performance Share Award that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Closing, in the event that the holder's employment
with the Company and the Subsidiaries terminates during the applicable Award
Period, the Purchaser shall notify Seller of such termination promptly, and in
any event no more than five days following the date of such termination.
Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that, from and after the Closing Date, (A)
Purchaser and its affiliates (including the Company and the Subsidiaries)
shall be solely responsible for (and Seller and its affiliates shall not have
any Liability under or in respect of (and shall be indemnified and held
harmless by Purchaser and its affiliates with respect to)) any payment
(including any employment or similar Taxes (including social security
contributions or the local equivalent)) required to be made in respect of the
settlement of such Parent Performance Share Awards and (B) the Company and its
Subsidiaries shall be responsible for all withholding and reporting
obligations with respect to such Parent Performance Share Awards; provided,
however, that Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the Purchaser and its
affiliates (including the Company and the Subsidiaries after the Closing
Date), from and against any Liability arising out of or with respect to the
calculation of the Parent PSA Amount.

hereof (the " _Specified Target Value_ ").

  


 

  

(iv) (A) As soon as practicable following the last day of an applicable Award
Period, Seller shall determine, subject to Purchaser's opportunity to review
and comment on the basis for Parent's determination, (1) the After-Tax Parent
PSA Amount and the (2) After-Tax Post-Closing Parent PSA Amount for each
Parent Performance Share Award settled at the end of such Award Period. The "
_After-Tax Parent PSA Amount_ " for an award shall equal (1) the Parent PSA
Amount for such award (which shall exclude any increase in an award by reason
of the termination of employment of an Employee after the Closing Date) _plus_
the employer-paid portion of any employment or similar Taxes (including social
security contributions or the local equivalent) imposed on the Company or its
Subsidiaries with respect to the payment of the Parent PSA Amount, _minus_ (2)
the Tax Benefit attributable to the payment or accrual of the amount described
in clause (1). The " _After-Tax Post-Closing Parent PSA Amount_ " for an award
shall equal (1) the product of (x) the Specified Target Value for such award
_plus_ the employer-paid portion of any employment or similar Taxes (including
social security contributions or the local equivalent) that would be imposed
on the Company or its Subsidiaries in respect of the payment of such Specified
Target Value and (y) the Post-Closing Pro-Rata Portion, _minus_ (2) the Tax
Benefit attributable to the payment or accrual of the amount described in
clause (1).

  

  

(B) If the After-Tax Parent PSA Amount for a Parent Performance Share Award
settled at the end of an Award Period exceeds the After-Tax Post-Closing
Parent PSA Amount for such award, then Parent shall pay to Purchaser the
amount of such excess as soon as practicable after the end of such Award
Period.

  


 

  

(v) The Estimated Closing Book Value and the Closing Date Book Value shall,
notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, exclude all effects of
the Parent Performance Share Awards (including any accruals, and any amounts
payable by either party, in respect of such awards), as provided in Section
1.04(j) of the Company Disclosure Letter.

  


 

  

(h) (i) Prior to the Closing, the Board of Directors of Parent (or a duly

actions as may be necessary to provide that, notwithstanding any provision to
the contrary in the Parent LTIP, each Parent Restricted Share Award that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Closing shall remain outstanding from and
after the Closing in accordance with its terms, _provided_ that, service with
the Company and the Subsidiaries following the Closing shall be taken into
account for purposes of vesting thereunder after the Closing.

  


 

  

    

(ii) With respect to each such Parent Restricted Share Award that is
outstanding as of the Closing, in the event that the holder's employment with
the Company and the Subsidiaries terminates during the applicable Restricted
Period (as defined in the Parent LTIP), Purchaser shall notify Seller of such
termination promptly, and in any event no more than five days following the
date of such termination. Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that, from and
after the Closing Date, (A) Purchaser and its affiliates (including the
Company and the Subsidiaries) shall be solely responsible for (and Seller and
its affiliates shall not have any Liability under or in respect of (and shall
be indemnified and held harmless by Purchaser and its affiliates with respect
to)) any employment or similar Taxes (including social security contributions
or the local equivalent) required to be made in respect of such Parent
Restricted Share Awards and (B) the Company and its Subsidiaries shall be
responsible for all withholding and reporting obligations with respect to the
Parent Restricted Share Awards. Parent and the Company shall cooperate (and
provide each other with all information reasonably necessary) to allow holders
of Parent Restricted Share Awards to satisfy their withholding tax obligations
to the Company and the Subsidiaries through share withholding as permitted by
the Parent LTIP.

the basis for Parent's determination, (1) the Post-Closing Parent RSA Amount,
(2) the Excess Employment Tax Amount and (3) the Excess Tax Benefit Amount,
with respect to such Parent Restricted Share Award. The _" Post-Closing Parent
RSA Amount_" shall equal the Total Parent RSA Amount _times_ the Post-Closing
Pro-Rata Portion. The _" Excess Employment Tax Amount_" shall equal the excess
(if any) of (1) the employer-paid portion of any employment or similar Taxes
(including social security contributions or the local equivalent) imposed on
the Company or its Subsidiaries in respect of such Parent Restricted Share
Award _over_ (2) the employer-paid portion of any employment or similar Taxes
(including social security contributions or the local equivalent) that would
be imposed on the Company or its Subsidiaries in respect of such award at a
value equal to its Post-Closing Parent RSA Amount. The _" Excess Tax Benefit
Amount_" shall equal the excess (if any) of (1) the Tax Benefit attributable
to such Parent Restricted Share Award and the payment of any related employer-
paid employment or similar Taxes (including social security contributions or
the local equivalent) imposed on the Company or its Subsidiaries _over_ (2)
the Tax Benefit that would be attributable to such Parent Restricted Share
Award at a value equal to its Post-Closing Parent RSA Amount and the payment
of any related employer-paid employment or similar Taxes (including social
security contributions or the local equivalent) imposed on the Company or its
Subsidiaries. The Excess Tax Benefit Amount shall be adjusted to take into
account the tax cost of any gain recognized by the Company or the Subsidiaries
in respect of any Parent Restricted Share Award.

  


 

  

    

(B) As soon as practicable following the last day of an applicable Restricted
Period with respect to a Parent Restricted Share Award, if the Post-Closing
Parent RSA Amount, _plus_ the Excess Tax Benefit Amount, _minus_ the Excess
Employment Tax Amount (the " _Parent RSA Net Payment Amount_ ") is a positive
number then Purchaser shall pay such positive amount to Parent, and if the
Parent RSA Net Payment Amount is a negative number then Parent shall pay the

as of the Closing Date (a " _Competing Business_ "), or (ii) acquire, or enter

(iii) selling and/or underwriting any insurance products whatsoever other than

Business; or

  


 

  

(iv) acquiring, hiring, merging or combining with any business, person or
assets that would otherwise violate this Section 5.16 after the Closing Date
(an " _After-Acquired Business_ ") (and, following such acquisition, hiring,
merger or combination, no activities of such After-Acquired Business or of
Parent or any of its subsidiaries relating to or in connection with the

Section 5.16) if at the time of such acquisition, hiring, merger or
combination, the portion of the aggregate gross revenues of the After-Acquired
Business attributable to the Competing Business in the most recently completed
fiscal year immediately prior to the date of such acquisition, hiring, merger
or combination is less than 35%; provided, for the avoidance of doubt, that
Parent and its subsidiaries may not hire any person pursuant to this clause
(iv) to the extent that such action would result in a breach of Section

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 5.16 to the contrary, Parent and
its subsidiaries shall have the right to engage in any Competing Business
after a Change of Control has occurred.

its subsidiaries shall be permitted to own or acquire, or agree to acquire,
securities in OneBeacon Insurance Group, Ltd. and its subsidiaries and any

securities are exchanged or any other securities received in respect of such
securities and nothing herein shall in any way restrict the operations or
conduct of business of OneBeacon Insurance Group, Ltd. and its subsidiaries.

  


 

  

(d) Parent acknowledges that the restrictions contained in this Section 5.16
are reasonable and necessary to protect the legitimate interests of Purchaser
and constitute a material inducement to Purchaser to enter into this Agreement
and consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In the event
that any covenant contained in this Section 5.16 should ever be adjudicated to
exceed the time, geographic, product or service, or other limitations
permitted by Applicable Law in any jurisdiction, then any court is expressly
empowered to reform such covenant, and such covenant shall be deemed reformed,
in such jurisdiction to the maximum time, geographic, product or service, or
other limitations permitted by Applicable Law. The covenants contained in this
Section 5.16 and each provision of this Section 5.16 are severable and
distinct covenants and provisions. The invalidity or unenforceability of any
such covenant or provision as written shall not invalidate or render
unenforceable the remaining covenants or provisions hereof, and any such
invalidity or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or
render unenforceable such covenant or provision in any other jurisdiction.

  


 

  

    

(e) For purposes of this Section 5.16, the term " _Change of Control_ " shall
mean, after the date hereof (A) any person or group being the owner, directly
or indirectly, beneficially or of record, of more than 50% of the voting power
or equity interests in Parent or any successor thereto, (B) any person or
group acquiring all or substantially all of the assets of Parent and its

(b) If on or prior to the Closing, Annex A and Annex B of the Bi-Lateral
Services Agreement is not agreed between the parties and a Bi-Lateral Services
Agreement is entered into between the Company and Seller (or its relevant
affiliates), with effect from the Closing and in consideration for the mutual
undertakings set out in this Agreement,

subsidiary of Parent shall) provide or procure the provision of such services

prior to the Closing and for such time periods as may be reasonably requested
(provided that such time periods shall be no longer than 6 months following
the Closing).

including, in each case, a balance sheet and statements of comprehensive

further that any biographical affidavit or other background information in
respect of such officer or director submitted in connection with any

parties may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations
or other acts of the other parties, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties contained in this Agreement or in any document
delivered pursuant to this Agreement or (c) waive compliance with any of the
agreements or conditions contained in this Agreement. Any agreement on the
part of a party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set
forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. The failure
of any party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this
Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such rights.

  


 

  


 

  

ARTICLE VIII 
  
  _Indemnification_

  


 

  

SECTION 8.01. _Indemnification by Seller_. (a) From and after the Closing,
Seller shall indemnify Purchaser, its affiliates (including the Company and
the Subsidiaries) and each of their respective former, current and future
officers, directors, employees, stockholders, agents and representatives (the
" _Purchaser Indemnitees_ ") against and hold them harmless from any loss,
liability, claim, damage or expense, including reasonable legal fees and
expenses (collectively, " _Losses_ "), suffered or incurred by such Purchaser
Indemnitee to the extent arising from, relating to or otherwise in respect of:

  


 

  

(i) any breach as of the date of this Agreement and/or where applicable as of
the Closing Date (or, to the extent expressly made as of an earlier date, as
of such earlier date) of any representation or warranty of Seller or the
Company contained in this Agreement or in any certificate delivered pursuant
hereto; and

  

  

    


 

  

(ii) any breach of any covenant or agreement of Seller (or, prior to the
Closing, the Company) contained in this Agreement.

  


 

  

(b) Seller shall not be required to indemnify any Purchaser Indemnitee, and
shall not have any liability, under Section 8.01(a)(i) of this Article VIII:

  


 

  

(i) unless the aggregate amount of all Losses for which Seller would, but for
this clause (i), be liable thereunder exceeds on a cumulative basis an amount
equal to one percent (1%) of the Final Purchase Price (the " _Deductible_ "),
and then only to the extent of any such excess; _provided_ , _however_ , that
this clause (i) shall not apply to any claim for indemnification arising out
of a breach or alleged breach of any Company or Seller representation or
warranty which is a Fundamental Representation;

  


 

  

(ii) for any individual item or series of related items arising out of the
same facts or circumstances where the Loss relating thereto is less than
$100,000, and such item or series of related items arising out of the same
facts or circumstances shall not be aggregated for purposes of clause (i) of
this Section 8.01(b); _provided_ , _however_ , that this clause (ii) shall not
apply to any claim for indemnification arising out of a breach or alleged
breach of any Company or Seller representation or warranty which is a
Fundamental Representation; and

  


 

  

(iii) for Losses under Section 8.01(a)(i) in excess of an amount equal to
fifteen percent (15%) of the Final Purchase Price in the aggregate (the "
_Cap_ "); provided that this clause (iii) shall not be applicable with regards
to claims of, or causes of action arising from, Fraud or to any claim for
indemnification arising out of a breach or alleged breach of any Company or
Seller representation or warranty which is a Fundamental Representation.

  


 

  

(c) Seller shall not be required to indemnify any Purchaser Indemnitee, and
shall not have any liability, with respect to any breach of any
representation, warranty or covenant of Seller or the Company, if: (A) Seller
provides written notice to Purchaser prior to the Closing, describing in
reasonable detail such breach, (B) Seller acknowledges in writing that the
effect of such breach is a failure of any condition to Purchaser's obligations
set forth in Article VI and (C) Purchaser proceeds with the Closing; provided
that in no event shall this clause 8.01(c) apply to any Intentional Breach by
Seller or the Company of any representation, warranty or covenant hereunder.
In the event that Seller provides such written notice in clause (A) of the
previous sentence to Purchaser less than five Business Days prior to the then-
scheduled Closing Date, Purchaser may, at its option, extend the Closing Date
for up to five Business Days.

  

  

    


 

  

(d) In no event shall Seller's aggregate indemnification obligation for Losses
and Tax Losses pursuant to this Article VIII and Article IX (including with
respect to any breach or alleged breach of any Fundamental Representation),
taken together, exceed the Final Purchase Price (other than claims of, or
causes of action arising from Fraud).

  


 

  

SECTION 8.02. _Indemnification by Purchaser_.

  


 

  

(a) From and after the Closing, Purchaser and the Company, jointly and
severally, shall indemnify Seller and its affiliates and each of their
respective former, current, or future officers, directors, employees,
stockholders, agents and representatives (the " _Seller Indemnitees_ ")
against and hold them harmless from any Loss suffered or incurred by such
Seller Indemnitee to the extent arising from, relating to or otherwise in
respect of:

  


 

  

(i) any breach as of the Closing Date of any representation or warranty of
Purchaser contained in this Agreement or in any certificate delivered pursuant
hereto; and

  


 

  

(ii) any breach of any covenant or agreement of Purchaser (or, after the
Closing, the Company) contained in this Agreement.

  


 

  

(b) Purchaser and the Company shall not be required to indemnify any Seller
Indemnitee, and shall not have any liability, under Section 8.02(a)(i) of this
Article VIII in respect of a breach of the Purchaser's representations and
warranties in Article IV:

  


 

  

(i) unless the aggregate of all Losses for which Purchaser and the Company
would, but for this clause (i), be liable thereunder exceeds the Deductible,
and then only to the extent of any such excess; provided, however, that this
clause (i) shall not apply to any claim for indemnification arising out of a
breach or alleged breach of any Purchaser representation or warranty which is
a Fundamental Representation;

  


 

  

(ii) in excess of the Cap provided that this clause (ii) shall not be
applicable with regards to claims of, or causes of action arising from, Fraud
or to any claim for indemnification arising out of a breach or alleged breach
of any Purchaser representation or warranty which is a Fundamental
Representation.

  


 

  

(c) In no event shall Purchaser's aggregate indemnification obligation for
Losses pursuant to this Article VIII or amounts under Section 9.05(d)
(including with respect to any breach of any Fundamental Representation),
taken together, exceed the Final Purchase Price (other than claims of, or
causes of action arising from, Fraud).

  

  

SECTION 8.03. _Calculation of Losses_. (a) The amount of any Loss or Tax Loss
for which indemnification is provided under this Article VIII or Article IX
shall be (i) net of any amounts actually recovered and received by the
indemnified party as a result of any indemnification by a third party or under
insurance policies with respect to such Loss and (ii) reduced to take account
of any net Tax benefit currently realized (in the form of cash from, or as a
reduction of a cash liability owed to, a Taxing Authority, or in the form of a
deferred tax asset) by the indemnified party arising from the circumstances
giving rise to the incurrence or payment of any such Loss. For purposes of the
preceding sentence, the deferred tax asset shall be calculated net of any
valuation allowance reasonably determined by the Company, except that in
calculating the valuation allowance, the underlying tax attribute shall be
deemed to expire after five calendar years (if it does not expire earlier
under then-Applicable Law). Purchaser, the Company and the Subsidiaries shall
provide Seller and its affiliates with reasonable access to information,
including copies of relevant Tax Returns or portions thereof, together with
accompanying schedules, related workpapers and documents relating to rulings
or other determinations by Taxing Authorities, as are reasonably necessary for
the determination of any net Tax benefit (and may redact such information as
is not reasonably necessary for the determination of any net Tax benefit), and
Seller shall, and shall cause its affiliates to, keep all such information and
items confidential and shall use such information solely in connection with
the determination of any net Tax benefit.

  


 

  

    

(b) If any insurance proceeds or other amounts are received by any Purchaser
Indemnitee or Seller Indemnitee after receipt of any indemnification payment
pursuant to this Article VIII, Purchaser or Seller, as applicable, shall
promptly repay to the indemnifying party such portion of such indemnification
payment equal to the amounts so recovered or realized.

  


 

  

(c) The amount of the Loss or Tax Loss arising out of any item reflected as a
liability or provided for or reserved against in calculating the Closing Date
Book Value (as finally determined under Section 1.04) shall be calculated net
of the amount so reflected, provided for or reserved against. Notwithstanding
any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, no Purchaser Indemnitee
shall be entitled to indemnification under this Article VIII or Article IX for
any Losses or Tax Losses to the extent such Losses or Tax Losses are
reflected, provided for or reserved against in the Closing Date Book Value.

  


 

  

(d) For the avoidance of doubt, neither Seller nor the Company makes any
representation, warranty or guarantee whatsoever that the Insurance Reserves
held by or on behalf of the Company and the Subsidiaries are or will be
sufficient for the purposes for which they were established, and nothing in
this Agreement shall be construed as providing the economic equivalent of any
such representation, warranty or guarantee. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, no Purchaser Indemnitee shall be
entitled to indemnification under this Article VIII for any Losses to the
extent such Losses arise out of any failure of the Insurance Reserves held by
or on behalf of the Company and the Subsidiaries to be sufficient for the
purposes for which they were established and regardless of whether such
Insurance Reserves are general in nature or specific to a particular matter.

  


 

  

(e) No indemnified party shall be entitled to indemnification under this
Article VIII or Article IX with respect to any Losses or Tax Losses that are
in the nature of punitive, incidental, consequential, special, treble or
indirect damages or damages based on any multiple, including business
interruption, loss of future revenue, profits or income, or loss of business
reputation or opportunity, in each case of any kind or nature, regardless of
the form of action through which any of the foregoing are sought unless such
party satisfies all of the elements necessary for recovery of such Losses
under the laws of the State of New York.

  


 

  

    

SECTION 8.04. _Termination of Indemnification_. The obligations to indemnify
and hold harmless any party (i) pursuant to Section 8.01(a)(i) or 8.02(a)(i)
shall terminate when the applicable representation or warranty terminates
pursuant to Section 8.06 and (ii) pursuant to Section 8.01(a)(ii) or
8.02(a)(ii) shall terminate when the applicable covenant terminates pursuant
to Section 8.06; _provided_ , _however_ , that such obligations to indemnify
and hold harmless shall not terminate with respect to any specific item as to
which the person to be indemnified has, before the expiration of the
applicable survival period, previously made a claim by delivering a notice of
such claim (stating in reasonable detail the basis of such claim) pursuant to
Section 8.05 to the party to be providing the indemnification (it being
understood and agreed that such obligations to indemnify and hold harmless
shall survive only until, and only for the purposes of, the final resolution
of the matter covered by such notice).

  


 

  

SECTION 8.05. _Procedures_. (a) _Third Party Claims_. In order for a Seller
Indemnitee or a Purchaser Indemnitee, as applicable (each, an " _indemnified
party_ ") to be entitled to any indemnification provided for under Section
8.01 or 8.02 in respect of, arising out of or involving a claim made by any
person against the indemnified party (a " _Third Party Claim_ "), such
indemnified party must notify the indemnifying party in writing (and in
reasonable detail) of the Third Party Claim within 30 days following receipt
by such indemnified party of notice of the Third Party Claim; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, subject to Sections 8.04 and 8.06, failure to give such
notification shall not affect the indemnification provided hereunder except to
the extent the indemnifying party shall have been actually prejudiced as a
result of such failure (except that the indemnifying party shall not be liable
for any expenses incurred during the period in which the indemnified party
failed to give such notice). Thereafter, the indemnified party shall deliver
to the indemnifying party, promptly following the indemnified party's receipt
thereof, copies of all notices and documents (including court papers) received
by the indemnified party relating to the Third Party Claim.

  


 

  

    

(b) _Assumption_. If a Third Party Claim is made against an indemnified party,
the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate in the defense thereof
and, if it so chooses, to assume the defense thereof with counsel selected by
the indemnifying party, so long as such counsel is not reasonably objected to
by the indemnified party; _provided_ , however, that as a condition to
assuming such defense, the indemnifying party shall acknowledge its
responsibility for Losses resulting from or relating to such Third Party
Claim. Should the indemnifying party so elect in writing to assume the defense
of a Third Party Claim, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to the
indemnified party for any legal expenses subsequently incurred by the
indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof. If the indemnifying
party assumes such defense, the indemnified party shall have the right to
participate in the defense thereof and to employ counsel (not reasonably
objected to by the indemnifying party), at its own expense, separate from the
counsel employed by the indemnifying party, it being understood that the
indemnifying party shall control such defense. The indemnifying party shall be
liable for the fees and expenses of counsel employed by the indemnified party
for any period during which the indemnifying party has not assumed the defense
thereof (other than during any period in which the indemnified party shall
have failed to give notice of the Third Party Claim as provided above). If the
indemnifying party chooses to defend or prosecute a Third Party Claim, all the
indemnified parties shall cooperate in the defense or prosecution thereof in a
commercially reasonable manner. Such cooperation shall include the retention
and (upon the indemnifying party's request) the provision to the indemnifying
party of records and information that are reasonably relevant to such Third
Party Claim, and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to
provide additional information and explanation of any material provided
hereunder; provided, however, that such indemnified parties may withhold any
such records or information to the extent necessary to preserve attorney
client privilege, so long as such indemnified parties deliver to the
indemnifying party the information contained in such records or information to
the extent possible while preserving such attorney client privilege. Whether
or not the indemnifying party assumes the defense of a Third Party Claim, the
indemnified party shall not admit any liability with respect to, or settle,
compromise or discharge, such Third Party Claim without the indemnifying
party's prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld). If the indemnifying party assumes the defense of a Third Party
Claim, the indemnified party shall agree to any settlement, compromise or
discharge of a Third Party Claim that the indemnifying party may recommend and
that by its terms obligates the indemnifying party to bear the full amount of
the liability in connection with such Third Party Claim and which releases the
indemnified party completely in connection with such Third Party Claim;
provided, however, that the indemnifying party shall not, without prior
written consent of the indemnified party (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld), settle, compromise or offer to settle or compromise
any Third Party Claim on a basis that would result in (A) injunctive or other
nonmonetary relief against the indemnified party, including the imposition of
a consent order, injunction or decree that would restrict the future activity
or conduct of the indemnified party, or (B) a finding or admission of a
violation of law by the indemnified party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
indemnifying party shall not be entitled to assume the defense of any Third
Party Claim (and shall be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of
counsel incurred by the indemnified party in defending such Third Party Claim)
if (W) the Third Party Claim seeks an order, injunction or other equitable
relief or relief for other than money damages against the indemnified party
that the indemnified party reasonably determines, after conferring with its
outside counsel, cannot be separated from any related claim for money damages
(and if such equitable relief or other nonmonetary relief portion of the Third
Party Claim can be so separated from that for money damages, the indemnifying
party shall be entitled to assume the defense of the portion relating to money
damages), (X) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party both are named
parties to the proceedings and the indemnified party has reasonably concluded,
after conferring with its outside counsel, that representation of both parties
by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential
differing interests between them or (Y) the indemnifying party is not entitled
to a legal defense or counterclaim available to the indemnified party.

  


 

  

    

(c) _Direct Claims_. In the event any indemnified party should have a claim
against any indemnifying party under Section 8.01 or 8.02 that does not
involve a Third Party Claim (a " _Direct Claim_ ") being asserted against or
sought to be collected from such indemnified party, the indemnified party
shall deliver notice of such claim with reasonable promptness to the
indemnifying party. Subject to Sections 8.04 and 8.06, the failure by any
indemnified party so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve the
indemnifying party from any liability that it may have to such indemnified
party under Section 8.01 or 8.02, except to the extent the indemnifying party
shall have been actually prejudiced as a result of such failure. The
indemnifying party shall have a period of 30 days within which to respond to
such Direct Claim. If the indemnifying party does not respond within such
30-day period, the indemnifying party will be deemed to have accepted the
Direct Claim.

  


 

  

(d) _Mitigation_. Purchaser and Seller and their respective affiliates shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate or resolve any claim or
liability with respect to which one party is obligated (or would be obligated,
but for the limitations contained in Section 8.01(b) or 8.02(b), as
applicable) to indemnify the other party hereunder. The costs of mitigation
pursuant to this Section 8.05(d) will themselves be Losses.

  


 

  

SECTION 8.06. _Survival_. The representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements contained in this Agreement and in any document delivered in
connection herewith shall survive the Closing solely for purposes of this
Article VIII as follows:

  


 

  

(i) the Fundamental Representations shall survive until the latest date
permitted by Applicable Law;

  


 

  

(ii) the representations and warranties contained in Section 3.13 shall not
survive the Closing;

  


 

  

(iii) the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement (other
than the Fundamental Representations and the representations and warranties
contained in Section 3.13) shall survive for 18 months following the Closing;

  


 

  

(iv) the covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement to be performed
at or prior to the Closing shall not survive the Closing; and

  


 

  

(v) the covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement to be performed
after the Closing shall survive in accordance with their terms.

  


 

  

Following the expiration of the applicable survival period, the applicable
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements shall terminate and
thereafter be of no force and effect, except as provided in Section 8.04.

  

  

SECTION 8.07. _No Additional Representations_. Purchaser acknowledges that it
and its representatives have been permitted full and complete access to the
books and records, facilities, equipment, tax returns, Contracts, insurance or
reinsurance policies (or summaries thereof) and other properties and assets of
the Company and the Subsidiaries that it and its representatives have desired
or requested to see or review, and that it and its representatives have had a
full opportunity to meet with the officers and employees of the Company and
the Subsidiaries to discuss the business of the Company and the Subsidiaries.
Purchaser acknowledges that (i) none of Seller, the Company or any other
person has made any representation or warranty, expressed or implied, as to
the Company or any Subsidiary or the accuracy or completeness of any
information regarding the Company and the Subsidiaries furnished or made
available to Purchaser and its representatives, except as expressly set forth
in this Agreement, (ii) Purchaser has not relied on any representation or
warranty from Seller, the Company or any other person in determining to enter
into this Agreement, except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, and
(iii) none of Seller or any other person shall have or be subject to any
liability to Purchaser or any other person resulting from the distribution to
Purchaser, or Purchaser's use of, any information, documents or material made
available to Purchaser in any "data rooms", management presentations or in any
other form in expectation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

  


 

  

    

SECTION 8.08. _Exclusive Remedy_. Except (i) with respect to claims relating
to the Bi-Lateral Services Agreement and (ii) as otherwise specifically
provided in this Agreement, the Seller and Purchaser acknowledge and agree
that their sole and exclusive remedy after the Closing with respect to any and
all claims relating to this Agreement, the Acquisition and the other
transactions contemplated hereby, the Company or any Subsidiary or their
assets and liabilities (other than claims of, or causes of action arising from
Fraud) shall, in each case, be pursuant to the indemnification provisions set
forth in this Article VIII and Article IX. In furtherance of the foregoing,
each of the Seller, Purchaser and the Company (on behalf of themselves and
their affiliates) hereby waive, from and after the Closing, to the fullest
extent permitted under Applicable Law, any and all rights, claims and causes
of action (other than claims of, or causes of action arising from Fraud) they
or their affiliates may have against the Purchaser or the Seller, as
applicable, arising under or based upon this Agreement, any Ancillary
Agreement, any document or certificate delivered in connection herewith, any
Applicable Law (including any rights of contribution or recovery under the
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act or any
analogous state law, or relating to any other environmental matters), common
law or otherwise (except pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth
in this Article VIII and Article IX). After the Closing, neither Seller,
Purchaser nor the Company nor their affiliates may bring any suit, action or
proceeding seeking to rescind the Acquisition or this Agreement, whether based
on fraud, gross negligence, negligence, breach of contract, breach of statute
or otherwise.

  


 

  

    


 

  

ARTICLE IX 
  
  _Tax Matters_

  


 

  

SECTION 9.01. _Tax Returns_. (a) The Seller shall cause the Company to (i)
prepare and file, to the standard reasonably expected from an independent tax
accountant, all Tax Returns with respect to the Company and the Subsidiaries
required to be filed on or before Closing Date (including such supplemental
non-mandatory Tax forms as would reasonably be expected to accompany such Tax
Returns) and (ii) pay to the relevant Taxing Authority all Taxes shown as due
on such Tax Returns, within the time and in the manner prescribed by
Applicable Law.

  


 

  

(b) The Purchaser shall cause the Company to prepare and file (or cause to be
prepared and filed), to the standard reasonably expected from an independent
tax accountant, all Tax Returns with respect to the Company and the
Subsidiaries required to be filed after the Closing Date (including such
supplemental non-mandatory Tax forms as would reasonably be expected to
accompany such Tax Returns) with respect to any Taxable Periods ending on or
prior to the Closing Date (" _Pre-Closing Periods_ ") and Taxable Periods
ending after, but including, the Closing Date (" _Straddle Periods_ "). In the
case of Tax Returns for Pre-Closing Periods, Seller shall be responsible for
paying to the relevant Taxing Authority or Purchaser, as directed by
Purchaser, all Taxes shown as due on such Tax Returns, within the time and in
the manner prescribed by Applicable Law. In the case of Tax Returns for
Straddle Periods, at the time Purchaser provides a copy of such Tax Return to
Seller, Purchaser shall provide a notice setting forth the amount of Tax
allocable to the period ending on (and including) the Closing Date in
accordance with Section 9.05(b), and Seller shall pay to the relevant Taxing
Authority or Purchaser, as directed by Purchaser, such amount of Tax no later
than 5 days prior to the time such Tax Return is due. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Seller shall not be responsible for any Tax under this Section
9.01(b) to the extent the liability for such Tax was taken into account in the
calculation of Closing Date Book Value as finally determined under Section
1.04 of this Agreement.

  


 

  

(c) The payment of Taxes with a Tax Return under subsection (a) or (b) shall
be without prejudice to the indemnification rights of the parties under
Section 9.05.

  


 

  

(d) Each of Seller and Purchaser shall use reasonable best efforts to make any
Tax Returns and work papers in respect of a Taxable Period that begins on or
before the Closing Date, which such party is responsible for causing to be
prepared, available for review by the other party sufficiently in advance of
the due date for filing such Tax Returns (after taking into account available
extensions), but in all events at least 45 days prior to the date such Tax
Return is required to be filed, to provide such other party with a meaningful
opportunity to analyze, comment on and dispute such Tax Returns. The reviewing
party shall notify the preparing party of any comments or disputes with
respect to such Tax Returns in advance of the due date for filing such Tax
Returns (after taking into account available extensions), but in all events at
least 30 days prior to the date such Tax Return is required to be filed, to
provide such other party with a meaningful opportunity to consider such
comments or disputes and for such Tax Returns to be modified, as appropriate,
before filing. In the event of any disagreement between Purchaser and Seller,
such disagreement shall be resolved in accordance with Section 9.06. If the
Tax Accountant does not resolve any differences between Seller and Purchaser
with respect to such Tax Return at least five Business Days prior to the due
date therefor, (i) such Tax Return shall be filed as prepared by the party
having the responsibility hereunder for preparing such Tax Return and amended
to reflect the Tax Accountant's resolution and (ii) to the extent the amount
of Tax shown on such return remains disputed by Seller, Seller shall not be
required to pay such amount pursuant to Section 9.01(b) until such dispute is
resolved.

  


 

  

    

SECTION 9.02. _Books and Records; Cooperation_. (a) The parties to this
Agreement and their respective affiliates will provide each other with such
cooperation and information as Purchaser or Seller reasonably may request of
the other or such affiliates with respect to any Tax matter at the expense of
the requesting party (unless such expense is an expense for which an indemnity
is due). Such cooperation shall include providing signatures with respect to
any Tax Returns that must be filed, and providing copies of relevant Tax
Returns or portions thereof, together with accompanying schedules, related
work papers and documents relating to rulings or other determinations by
Taxing Authorities. Each of Seller, Purchaser and their respective affiliates
shall retain all Tax Returns, schedules and work papers, records and other
documents in its possession relating to Tax matters of the Company and the
Subsidiaries until the later of (i) the expiration of the statute of
limitations of the Taxable Periods to which such Tax Returns and other
documents relate, without regard to extensions, or (ii) six years following
the due date (without extension) for such Tax Returns. Prior to disposing of
any such records, notice shall be given by Purchaser or Seller, as applicable,
to the other party providing reasonable terms allowing such other party to
take, at its sole expense, possession of such records.

  


 

  

(b) Without limiting the foregoing, at the Closing, Seller may retain any Tax
Returns with respect to the Company and the Subsidiaries in the possession of
Seller or any of its affiliates, and Purchaser shall be provided with copies
of the Company and the Subsidiaries' separate Tax Returns and the pro forma
portion of any consolidated or combined Tax Returns relating solely to the
Company and the Subsidiaries.

  


 

  

(c) Any information obtained under this Section 9.02 shall be kept
confidential, except as may be otherwise necessary in connection with the
filing of Tax Returns or amendments, or conducting an audit or other
proceeding.

  


 

  

SECTION 9.03. _Transfer Taxes_. Seller and Purchaser shall each pay 50% of any
Transfer Taxes incurred in connection with transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, except that Purchaser shall pay 100% of any such Transfer Taxes
imposed by the Republic of Singapore. Seller and Purchaser shall cooperate
with each other in the timely filing and execution of any Tax Returns and
other documentation relating to such Transfer Taxes, the remitting of payment
of all such Taxes and the delivery of any forms claiming exemption or relief
from any such Taxes.

  


 

  

    

SECTION 9.04. _Additional Covenants_. (a) All Tax sharing agreements with
respect to the Company or any Subsidiary (except for Tax sharing agreements
solely between the Company and the Subsidiaries) shall be terminated with
respect to any Liability of the Company or any Subsidiary as of the day prior
to the Closing Date and the Company and the Subsidiaries shall not be bound
thereby or have any Liability thereunder at any time thereafter.

  


 

  

(b) Seller and Purchaser (and each of their respective affiliates) agree to
treat all payments made by either of them under this Agreement (other than
payments made under _Section 1.03_ , which payments constitute the Purchase
Price) as adjustments to the Purchase Price for all Tax purposes and that such
treatment shall govern for purposes hereof except to the extent that the
Applicable Laws of a particular jurisdiction require otherwise.

  


 

  

SECTION 9.05. _Tax Indemnity_. (a) From and after the Closing Date, Seller
shall indemnify the Purchaser Indemnitees and hold them harmless from and
against all liability for (u) Taxes imposed on or payable by or with respect
to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any Pre-Closing Periods, (v) any
Taxes imposed on or payable by or with respect to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries which are allocable to the portion of a Straddle Period ending on
(and including) the Closing Date, (w) any Taxes of a person other than the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries for which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is or becomes liable as a result of (i) an agreement principally
related to Taxes and existing at any time prior to the Closing, (ii)
transferee or successor liability existing at any time prior to the Closing or
(iii) being or having been a member of an affiliated, consolidated, combined
or unitary tax group on or prior to the Closing Date, including pursuant to
U.S. Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 or any analogous or similar state,
local, or non-U.S. law, (x) a change in a Closing Statement Tax Attribute as a
result of (i) a final determination by a Taxing Authority, excluding by reason
of a change in law, official interpretation of a Taxing Authority or official
practice of a Taxing Authority, in each case after the Closing, or, with
respect to a Luxembourg Closing Statement Tax Attribute, the application of
the Luxembourg Circular L.I.R. no. 114/2 of 2 September 2010 as a result of an
action of the Purchaser, the Company or the Subsidiaries after the Closing
(other than an action required hereunder) or (ii) the application of such
Closing Statement Tax Attribute to offset or reduce any Tax liability of the
Seller described in clauses (u), (v), (w) or Section 9.01(b), in each case
which, if given effect as of the Closing Date (using the same accounting
principles as utilized in the calculation of Closing Date Book Value), would
have caused a reduction in the Net Deferred Tax Asset. in which case the
amount subject to indemnification under this clause (w) shall be equal to such
reduction multiplied by the Agreed Multiple, (x) a change in a Compensation
Related Tax Attribute as a result of a final determination by a Taxing
Authority, excluding by reason of a change in law official interpretation of a
Taxing Authority or official practice of a Taxing Authority, in each case
after the Closing, which, if given effect as of the date of the calculation of
the related Tax Benefit (using the same accounting principles as utilized in
the calculation of such Tax Benefit) would have caused a reduction in such Tax
Benefit, in which case the amount subject to indemnification under this clause
(y) shall be equal to such reduction, and (z) any reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, incurred or arising in
connection with or in respect of the assessment, assertion, contest or
imposition of a Tax or change in a Pre-Closing or Compensation Related Tax
Attribute described in any of clauses (u), (v), (w), (x) or (y) (the sum of
(u), (v), (w), (x) and (y) being referred to herein as a " _Tax Loss_ "). For
the avoidance of doubt, a change in a Closing Statement Tax Attribute that
results in an indemnification obligation under clause (x) shall not be taken
into account in determining whether a change in a Tax Benefit occurred under
clause (y).

  


 

  

    

(b) For purposes of this Article IX, in the case of any Taxes that are payable
for a Straddle Period, the portion of such Tax allocable to the portion of
such Tax period ending on (and including) the Closing Date shall (x) in the
case of any Taxes other than gross receipts, sales or use Taxes and Taxes
based upon or related to income, be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for
the entire Tax period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the
number of days in the Tax period ending on and including the Closing Date and
the denominator of which is the number of days in the entire Tax period, and
(y) in the case of any Tax based upon or related to income and any gross
receipts, sales or use Tax, be deemed equal to the amount which would be
payable if the relevant Tax period ended on and included the Closing Date. All
determinations necessary to give effect to the allocation set forth in the
foregoing clause (y) shall be made in a manner consistent with prior practice
of the Company and its Subsidiaries. For purposes of determining the amount of
Taxes allocable to the portion of a Straddle Period that ends on (and
includes) the Closing Date, each entity in which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries owns an interest which is fiscally transparent for Tax purposes
shall be treated as if its taxable year ended at the close of business on the
Closing Date.

  


 

  

(c) For the avoidance of doubt, Taxes of the Company and its Subsidiaries for
which Seller is responsible under Section 9.01(b) or clause (v), (w) or (x) of
Section 9.05(a) shall be computed after taking into account any Closing
Statement Tax Attributes available to reduce such Taxes.

  


 

  

(d) From and after the Closing Date, Purchaser and the Company, jointly and
severally, shall indemnify the Seller Indemnitees and hold them harmless from
and against all liability for (x) Taxes imposed on the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries for any Taxable Period beginning after the Closing Date, (y)
Taxes imposed on the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that are allocable to
the portion of a Straddle Period beginning on the day after the Closing Date
and (z) any Taxes described in Section 9.01(b) or clause (v), (w), (x) or (y)
of Section 9.05(a) for which Seller is not responsible by reason of Section
8.03(a) or (c), the final sentence of Section 9.01(b) or Section 9.05(e). For
the avoidance of doubt, the indemnity under this Section 9.05(d) shall be
limited by Section 8.02(c).

  


 

  

    

(e) Purchaser agrees to give prompt notice to Seller of any Tax Loss or the
assertion of any claim, or the commencement of any suit, action or proceeding
in respect of which indemnity may be sought under this Section 9.05 (a " _Tax
Proceeding_ ") and will give Seller such information with respect thereto as
Seller may reasonably request. Seller may (i) participate in and (ii) in the
case of a Tax Proceeding for Taxes relating to a Pre-Closing Period, upon
written notice to Purchaser, assume the defense of any such suit, action or
proceeding (including any Tax audit); _provided_ that (x) Seller shall
thereafter consult with Purchaser upon Purchaser's reasonable request for such
consultation from time to time with respect to such suit, action or proceeding
(including any Tax audit) and (y) Seller shall not, without Purchaser's
consent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), agree to
any settlement with respect to any Tax if such settlement would reasonably be
expected to materially adversely affect the Tax liability of any Purchaser
Indemnitee and (z) if Seller provides notice to Purchaser that Seller wishes
to concede the Tax Proceeding, Seller shall not be obligated to indemnify
Purchaser for further costs and expenses under 9.05(a). If Seller assumes such
defense, (i) Purchaser shall have the right (but not the duty) to participate
in the defense thereof and to employ counsel, at its own expense, separate
from the counsel employed by Seller and (ii) Seller shall not assert that the
Tax Loss, or any portion thereof, with respect to which Purchaser seeks
indemnification is not within the ambit of this Section 9.05. Whether or not
Seller chooses to defend or prosecute any claim, all of the parties hereto
shall cooperate in the defense or prosecution thereof. Notwithstanding any
other provision of this Section 9.05, Seller shall not be liable under this
Section 9.05 with respect to any Tax Loss resulting from a claim or demand the
defense of which Seller was not offered the opportunity to assume as provided
under this Section 9.05(e), to the extent Seller's liability under this
Section 9.05 is actually and materially adversely affected as a result
thereof.

  


 

  

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Section 9.05
and not Sections 8.01 (other than Section 8.01(d)), 8.02, and 8.05, shall
govern indemnification of the Purchaser Indemnitees in respect of Tax Losses
and the conduct of Tax Proceedings.

  


 

  

SECTION 9.06. _Disputes_. Disputes arising under this Article IX and not
resolved by mutual agreement within 30 days shall be resolved by an
internationally recognized accounting firm with no material relationship with
Purchaser, Seller or their affiliates (the " _Tax Accountant_ "), chosen by
and mutually acceptable to both Purchaser and Seller within five days of the
date on which the need to choose the Tax Accountant arises. The Tax Accountant
shall resolve any disputed items within 30 days of having the item referred to
it pursuant to such procedures as it may require, and any such resolution by
the Tax Accountant shall be final unless not consistent with a final
determination of the applicable Taxing Authority. The costs, fees and expenses
of the Tax Accountant shall be borne equally by Purchaser and Seller.

  


 

  

SECTION 9.07. _Survival_. The covenants and indemnities in this Article IX
shall survive for purposes of this Article IX until the expiration of the
relevant statute of limitations.

SECTION 10.08. _Enforcement_. The parties agree that irreparable damage would

entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions, specific performance or other

specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in the Supreme Court
of the State of New York, New York County and the United States District Court

to which they are entitled at law or in equity. The right of specific
enforcement is an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and without that right, none of Seller, the Company or Purchaser
would have entered into this Agreement. Each of the parties hereto agrees that
it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and
other equitable relief on the basis that the other parties hereto have an
adequate remedy at law or an award of specific performance is not an
appropriate remedy for any reason at law or in equity. The parties hereto
acknowledge and agree that any party seeking an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement in accordance with this Section 10.08 shall not
be required to provide any bond or other security in connection with any such
order or injunction, and the party opposing such injunction or injunctions
hereby agrees that it shall not contest the amount or absence of any such bond
or other security requested or offered by the party seeking such injunction or
injunctions.

  

  

SECTION 10.09. _Arbitration_. (a) Any dispute arising out of, relating to or
in connection with this Agreement, including any question regarding its
existence, validity or termination, shall be referred to and finally resolved
by arbitration under the arbitration rules of the International Chamber of
Commerce (the "ICC") then in effect, which rules are deemed to be incorporated
by reference into this Section 10.09 (the "ICC Rules"). The arbitral tribunal
shall consist of three arbitrators. Purchaser and Seller shall each nominate
one arbitrator, the party requesting arbitration concurrently with such
request and the other party within fifteen calendar days from receipt of the
request for arbitration. In the event that Purchaser or Seller fails to
nominate an arbitrator or deliver notification of such nomination to the other
party and to the ICC within this time period, upon request of Purchaser or
Seller, such arbitrator shall instead be appointed by the ICC within fifteen
calendar days of the ICC receiving such request in accordance with the ICC
Rules. The two arbitrators appointed in accordance with the above provisions
shall nominate the third arbitrator and notify Purchaser and Seller and the
ICC in writing of such nomination within fifteen calendar days of their
appointment. If the first two appointed arbitrators fail to nominate a third
arbitrator or notify Purchaser, Seller and the ICC of that nomination within
this time period, then, upon request of Purchaser or Seller, the third
arbitrator shall be appointed by the ICC within fifteen calendar days of the
ICC receiving such request in accordance with the ICC Rules. The third
arbitrator shall serve as president of the arbitral tribunal. The seat, or
legal place, of arbitration shall be New York, New York. The language to be
used in the arbitral proceedings shall be English. The governing law of this
agreement to arbitrate shall be the laws of the State of New York.

  


 

  

    

(b) Each arbitrator shall be qualified to practice law under the Laws of the
State of New York and fluent in the English language. No arbitrator shall be
an employee, officer, director, consultant, contractor or other service
provider of either party or of their respective affiliates, nor shall any
arbitrator have any interest that would be affected in any material respect by
the outcome of the dispute. The decision of a majority of the arbitrators
shall be final and binding on Purchaser and Seller and their respective
successors and assigns, and the parties waive any form of challenge or appeal
against it and agree that judgment may be entered on any such award by any
court having competent jurisdiction. Purchaser and Seller hereby waive any
right to refer any question of law to any court.

  


 

  

(c) In its award the arbitrators shall allocate, in their discretion, among
the parties to the arbitration all costs of the arbitration, including the
fees and expenses of the arbitrators and reasonable attorney's fees, costs and
expert witness expenses incurred by the parties.

  


 

  

(d) The parties hereby agree that the arbitral tribunal shall have the power
to award equitable remedies (including specific performance). The parties
irrevocably submit to the personal jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of the
State of New York, in and for the County of New York, or the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York, each for the limited
purpose of enforcing this agreement to arbitrate, including any action to
compel arbitration or to stay or enjoin any action or proceeding commenced or
prosecuted in violation of this Section 10.09, and irrevocably waive any
objection to venue for such a proceeding in any such court. Each party's
agreement to this arbitration is voluntary. Nothing in these dispute
resolution provisions shall be construed as preventing either party from
seeking conservatory or similar interim relief in any court of competent
jurisdiction.

  

  

(e) In order to facilitate the comprehensive resolution of related disputes
and to avoid inconsistent decisions in related disputes, upon request of any
party to an arbitration proceeding commenced pursuant to this Section 10.09,
any dispute, controversy or claim subsequently noticed for arbitration under
the provisions of this Section 10.09 may be consolidated with the earlier-
commenced arbitration proceeding, as determined within the discretion of the
arbitral tribunal appointed in the first-commenced arbitration proceeding. The
arbitral tribunal must not consolidate such arbitrations unless the arbitral
tribunal determines that (i) there are issues of fact or law common to the
proceedings, so that a consolidated proceeding would be more efficient than
separate proceedings, and (ii) no party hereto would be prejudiced as a result
of such consolidation through undue delay, conflict of interest or otherwise.
If the first-appointed arbitral tribunal determines that the arbitrations
shall be consolidated, the first-appointed arbitral tribunal shall have
jurisdiction over the consolidated arbitration to the exclusion of any other
arbitrator or arbitral tribunal and any appointment of another arbitrator in
relation to the other arbitrations will be deemed to be functus officio. Any
such termination of an arbitrator's appointment shall be without prejudice to:
(i) the validity of any act done or order made by that arbitrator or by the
ICC in support of that arbitration before the termination of his appointment;
(ii) his entitlement to be paid his proper fees and disbursements; and (iii)
the date when any claim or defence was raised for the purpose of applying any
limitation bar or any similar rule or provision.

  


 

  

    

(f) The parties agree that the arbitration shall be kept confidential and that
the existence of the proceeding and any element of it (including but not
limited to any pleadings, briefs or other documents submitted or exchanged,
any testimony or other oral submissions, and any awards) shall not be
disclosed other than to the arbitral tribunal, the ICC, the parties, their
counsel, accountants and auditors, insurers and re-insurers, and any person
necessary to the conduct of the proceeding. The confidentiality obligations
shall not apply ( _i_ ) if disclosure is required by law, rule or regulation,
or in judicial or administrative proceedings or ( _ii_ ) as far as disclosure
is necessary or appropriate to enforce the rights arising out of the award.

  


 

  

(g) Each party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to service of process by
U.S. registered mail to such party's respective address set forth above in
Section 10.03, including for proceedings regarding the recognition and
enforcement of any award resulting from an arbitration brought pursuant to
this Section 10.09 or any judgment, of any jurisdiction, resulting therefrom,
and for enforcement of the agreement to arbitrate set forth in this Section
10.09. Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of any party to this
Agreement to serve process in any other manner permitted by applicable law.

  


 

  

(h) This Section 10.09 shall not apply to any dispute under Section 1.04 or
1.05 or Article IX that is required to be decided by the Accounting Firm.

  


 

  

SECTION 10.10. _Governing Law_. This Agreement, and all matters, claims or
causes of action (whether in contract or tort) based upon, arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or the negotiation, execution or performance of
this Agreement, shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the
laws of the State of New York, regardless of the laws that might otherwise
govern under applicable principles of conflicts of laws thereof.

  


 

  

    

SECTION 10.11. _Waiver of Jury Trial_. Each party hereby waives to the fullest
extent permitted by Applicable Law, any right it may have to a trial by jury
in respect to any litigation directly or indirectly arising out of, under or
in connection with this Agreement, any Ancillary Agreement or any transaction
contemplated hereby or thereby. Each party (a) certifies that no
representative, agent or attorney of any other party has represented,
expressly or otherwise, that such other party would not, in the event of
litigation, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver and (b) acknowledges that it
and the other parties hereto have been induced to enter into this Agreement
and the Ancillary Agreements, as applicable, by, among other things, the
mutual waivers and certifications in this Section 10.11.

  


 

  

SECTION 10.12. _Remedies Cumulative_. Except as otherwise provided herein, any
and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party shall be deemed
cumulative with, and not exclusive of, any other remedy conferred hereby, or
by law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party of any one
remedy shall not preclude the exercise of any other remedy.
