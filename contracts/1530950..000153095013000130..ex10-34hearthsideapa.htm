provided, however, that the Seller may retain copies of all Acquired Records

the Other Agreements, and the schedules and exhibits hereto and thereto;

(vi) the personnel records and other records that the Seller or any of its

the conditions hereof, and as additional consideration for the Purchased
Assets, the Buyer shall assume and shall pay, perform and discharge, in
accordance with their respective terms and subject to their respective
conditions, all of the Liabilities of the Seller relating primarily to the
Business not specifically defined as Retained Liabilities pursuant to Section
1.2(b) including the following Liabilities (collectively, the "Assumed
Liabilities"):

(i) any Liability under any Assigned Contract or under any Other Assigned
Contract;

(ii) any other Liabilities specifically assumed by the Buyer elsewhere in this
Agreement or the Other Agreements;

(iii) any Liability in respect of Hired Employees and beneficiaries of Hired
Employees to the extent first arising after the Closing Date in their capacity
as employees of the Buyer;

(iv) any Liabilities specifically listed on Schedule 1.2(a)(iv) and hereafter

Purchased Assets; 

(vi) any Liability arising out of or relating to the return of any products

(vii) any Liability for Taxes arising out of or relating, directly or
indirectly, to the Purchased Assets or the ownership, sale or lease of any of
the Purchased Assets to the extent included in the Closing Date Net Working
Capital calculations or related solely to periods or transactions after the
Closing Date; and

(viii) any Liability of the Seller existing on or after the Closing Date for
the accounts payable of the Seller relating to the Business including those
listed on Schedule 1.2(a)(viii) and hereafter updated as provided in Section
5.3(b).

For the avoidance of doubt, except for the Assumed Liabilities specifically
assumed by the Buyer hereunder, the Buyer and the Seller agree that the Buyer
is not assuming any Liability of the Seller and the Buyer hereby disclaims any
Liabilities of the Seller not so specifically assumed, including the Retained
Liabilities. Except for the Assumed Liabilities specifically assumed by the
Buyer hereunder, the Parties intend that the Buyer is not, nor shall it be
deemed to be a successor of the Seller with respect to any of the Seller's
Liabilities arising or accruing before, on or after the Closing Date.

(b) Retained Liabilities. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, the Seller shall retain and shall be responsible for, and the Buyer
shall not assume or have any responsibility for, the following Liabilities
relating to the Business (collectively, the "Retained Liabilities"):

(i) any Liability to the extent exclusively arising out of and relating to the
Excluded Assets;

(ii) the Seller\'s obligations under this Agreement and the Other Agreements;

(iii) any Liability under any Plan of the Seller and any Liabilities to any
officer, director, or employee of the Seller or any of their dependents,
including for any salary, vacation pay, sick pay, severance, worker\'s
compensation, health benefits or any other compensation or benefits whatsoever
(whether under any applicable Law, any Plan or otherwise), arising out of or
relating to their employment by the Seller, except as otherwise provided in
Section 9.4;

(iv) any Liability of the Seller under any Contract not assumed by the Buyer
pursuant to Section 1.1(a);

(v) any Liability for Taxes imposed or arising as a result of the Seller\'s
operation of the Business or ownership of its assets and properties prior to
the Closing Date to the extent not included in the Closing Date Net Working
Capital calculations, including any Liability for Taxes arising out of or
relating, directly or indirectly, to the Purchased Assets or the ownership,
sale or lease of any of the Purchased Assets;

(vi) any Indebtedness of the Seller;

(vii) any Liability for issued but uncleared checks and drafts outstanding as
of the Closing Date; and

(viii) any Liability related to the Equity Interests of the Seller to which
the Seller is a party or by which it is bound, obligating the Seller to issue,
deliver, sell, repurchase or redeem, or cause to be issued, delivered, sold,
repurchased or redeemed, any Equity Interests of the Seller or obligating the
Seller to grant, extend, accelerate the vesting of, change the price of,
otherwise amend or enter into any such Equity Interests of the Seller. 

Section 1.3 Purchase Price. Subject to adjustment pursuant to Section 2.2 and
Section 9.4(e), the aggregate purchase price for the Purchased Assets (the
"Purchase Price") shall be an amount equal to $158,000,000 (One Hundred Fifty-
Eight Million Dollars). The Purchase Price shall be paid in the amount and in
the manner set forth in Article II.

Section 1.4 Consent of Third Parties. On the Closing Date, the Seller shall
assign to the Buyer, and the Buyer will assume, the Assigned Contracts and the
Other Assigned Contracts, to the extent provided in this Agreement, in each
case to the extent permitted by and in accordance with applicable Law.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if the assignment
or assumption of all or any portion of any rights or obligations under any
Assigned Contract shall require the Consent of the other party thereto or any
other third party that has not been obtained prior to the Closing Date (or
otherwise are not in full force and effect) and, if applicable, the Buyer
waives the condition set forth in Section 7.2(c) and the Closing occurs, then
this Agreement shall not constitute an agreement to assign or otherwise
transfer any rights or obligations under any such Assigned Contract or Other
Assigned Contract if an attempted assignment or transfer without any such
Consent would constitute a breach or violation thereof (each, a "Restricted
Assigned Contract"). Following the Closing the Parties shall use their
Reasonable Efforts, and cooperate with each other, to obtain the required
Consent relating to each Restricted Assumed Contract as soon as practicable
and, pending the receipt of the required Consent for the Restricted Assumed
Contract, the Parties shall cooperate with each other in any reasonable and
lawful arrangements designed to provide to the Buyer the benefits of use of
the Restricted Assumed Contract for its term (or any right or benefit arising
thereunder, including the enforcement for the benefit of the Buyer of any and
all rights of the Seller against a third party thereunder); provided, however,
that, except as set forth in the Transition Services Agreement (i) the Buyer
shall indemnify and hold harmless the Seller and its Affiliates for any and
all Liabilities arising in connection with any action by a third party arising
from, in connection with, or otherwise with respect to actions taken or failed
to be taken by the Seller at the Buyer\'s request pursuant to this Section
1.4, and (ii) the Buyer shall reimburse the Seller for all reasonable and
documented out‑of‑pocket expenses incurred by the Seller arising from, in
connection with or otherwise with respect to actions taken by the Seller at
the Buyer\'s request pursuant to this Section 1.4, and (iii) the Buyer shall
perform and comply with, at the Buyer\'s sole cost, all of the Seller\'s
obligations arising after Closing, except to the extent such obligations do
not constitute an Assumed Liability, under the Restricted Assigned Contracts
as if the Buyer was the Seller thereunder. Upon receipt of the required
Consent for the assignment and transfer of a Restricted Assigned Contract, the
Seller shall promptly assign and transfer such Restricted Assigned Contract to
the Buyer, and the Buyer shall assume the obligations under such Restricted
Assigned Contract pursuant to a special-purpose assignment and assumption
agreement reasonably satisfactory to the Parties (which special-purpose
agreement the Parties shall prepare, execute and deliver in good faith at the
time of such transfer, all at no additional cost to the Buyer).

Section 1.5 Closing. The closing of the purchase and sale of the Purchased
Assets (the "Closing") shall take place as described in Article VIII on the
first Business Day immediately following the end of the Seller\' s fiscal
period during which the last to be fulfilled or waived of the closing
conditions set forth in Article VII (other than the conditions that by their
nature are to be fulfilled at the Closing, but subject to the fulfillment or
waiver of such conditions) shall have been satisfied or waived in writing as
provided therein, or such other date as the Parties may mutually agree. The
date on which the Closing occurs shall be referred to in this Agreement as the
"Closing Date." The parties agree that if all such conditions are satisfied on
or prior to May 25, 2013, the Closing Date shall occur on May 28, 2013. The
Closing shall be deemed effective as of 12:01 a.m., Central Time, on the
Closing Date. 

ARTICLE II 
CONSIDERATION AND MANNER OF PAYMENT

Section 2.1 Payments at Closing. Subject to adjustment as set forth in Section
2.2(a) and Section 9.4(e), on the Closing Date, the Buyer shall pay to the
Seller an amount equal to the Purchase Price by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to the bank account(s) specified by the Seller in writing
prior to the Closing Date.

Section 2.2 Adjustments to Purchase Price.

(a) Closing Date Net Working Capital Adjustment. Within ten (10) Business Days
prior to the Closing Date, but in no event less than three (3) Business Days
prior to the Closing Date, the Seller shall prepare and deliver, or cause to
be prepared and delivered, to the Buyer, a certificate of the Seller that
contains a reasonable good faith estimate of the Net Working Capital of the
Business as of the close of business on the day immediately prior to the
Closing Date (the "Estimated Net Working Capital"). If the Estimated Net
Working Capital is less than the Target Net Working Capital (such deficiency,
the "Estimated Working Capital Deficit"), then the Purchase Price shall be
reduced dollar‑for‑dollar by the amount of such Estimated Working Capital
Deficit. If the Estimated Net Working Capital is greater than the Target Net
Working Capital (such excess, the "Estimated Working Capital Surplus"), then
the Purchase Price shall be increased dollar‑for‑dollar by the amount of such
Estimated Working Capital Surplus.

(b) Closing Date Balance Sheet and Closing Schedule. As soon as practicable
after the Closing Date, but no later than the ninetieth (90th) day following
the Closing Date, the Buyer shall prepare and deliver to the Seller: (i) a
balance sheet of the Business as of the close of business on the day
immediately prior to the Closing Date (the "Closing Date Balance Sheet"), and
(ii) a schedule (the "Closing Schedule") setting forth a calculation of the
Net Working Capital of the Business as of the close of business on the day
immediately prior to the Closing Date (determined in accordance with the
methodology set forth on Exhibit A) (the "Closing Date Net Working Capital"),
and the amount, if any, by which the Closing Date Net Working Capital is less
than or greater than the Estimated Net Working Capital. The Buyer shall make
available to the Seller and its auditors all records and work papers used in
preparing the Closing Date Balance Sheet and the Closing Schedule. The Seller
shall conduct a physical inventory prior to the Closing Date for the purpose
of preparing the relevant portions of the Closing Date Balance Sheet and the
Closing Schedule and the Inventory shall be valued in accordance with
Seller\'s past practice set forth on Exhibit A. The Buyer, and its independent
auditors and financial advisors, if any, shall have the right to observe the
taking of such physical inventory.

(i) Protest Notice. Within thirty (30) days after the Buyer\'s delivery of the
Closing Date Balance Sheet and the Closing Schedule to the Seller, the Seller
may deliver written notice (the "Protest Notice"), to the Buyer, setting forth
any objections, and the basis therefor, which the Seller may have to the
Closing Date Balance Sheet or the Closing Schedule. Any Protest Notice shall
specify in reasonable detail the nature of any disagreement so asserted.
Except for such items that are specifically disputed in a Protest Notice, the
amounts set forth on the Closing Date Balance Sheet and the Closing Schedule
shall be final. The failure of the Seller to deliver such Protest Notice
within the prescribed time period will constitute the Seller\'s acceptance of
the Closing Date Balance Sheet and the Closing Schedule prepared and delivered
by the Buyer. If the Seller delivers a Protest Notice within the prescribed
time period, then the Buyer and the Seller will use Reasonable Efforts to
resolve any disagreements as to the computation of the Closing Date Net
Working Capital, within twenty (20) days after delivery of the Closing Date
Balance Sheet and the Closing Schedule. Any undisputed amount due from the
Buyer to the Seller or the Seller to the Buyer, as the case may be, (an
"Interim Payment") shall be paid within five (5) Business Days after delivery
of the Protest Notice. 

(ii) Resolution of Protest. If the Buyer and the Seller are unable to resolve
any disagreement with respect to the calculation of the Closing Date Net
Working Capital within twenty (20) days following the delivery of any Protest
Notice, then either the Seller or the Buyer may refer the items in dispute to
Deloitte LLP (the "Independent Accountant"). In such case, the Seller and the
Buyer will jointly retain the Independent Accountant and direct it to render a
written report setting forth its determination of the Closing Date Net Working
Capital, resolving any and all items in dispute (as set forth in the Protest
Notice), not later than thirty (30) days after acceptance of its retention.
The Seller and the Buyer shall each submit to the Independent Accountant a
binder setting forth their respective computations of the Closing Date Net
Working Capital and specific information, evidence and support for their
respective positions as to all items in dispute. Neither the Seller nor the
Buyer shall have or conduct any communication, either written or oral, with
the Independent Accountant without the other Party either being present or
receiving a concurrent copy of any written communication. The Independent
Accountant may conduct a conference concerning the objections and
disagreements between the Seller and the Buyer, at which conference each of
the Seller and the Buyer shall have the right to (i) present its documents,
materials and other evidence included in its binder (previously provided to
the Independent Accountant and the other Party) and (ii) have present its or
their advisors, accountants, counsel and other Representatives. The Seller and
the Buyer, and their respective Representatives, shall cooperate fully with
the Independent Accountant during its engagement and respond on a timely basis
to all requests for information or access to documents or personnel made by
the Independent Accountant, all with the intent to fairly and in good faith
resolve all disputes relating to the Closing Date Net Working Capital as
promptly as reasonably practicable. The Independent Accountant shall conduct
its review, resolve all disputes and, to the extent necessary, compute the
Closing Date Net Working Capital based solely on the binders submitted by the
Seller and the Buyer (not by independent review). The findings and
determinations of the Independent Accountant as set forth in its written
report shall be deemed final, conclusive and binding upon the Parties. In
resolving any disputed item, the Independent Accountant (A) may not assign a
value to any particular item greater than the greatest value for such item
claimed by either the Seller or the Buyer, or less than the lowest value for
such item claimed by either the Seller or the Buyer, in each case as presented
to the Independent Accountant, (B) shall be bound by the principles set forth
in this Section 2.2 (including that all calculations shall be made in
accordance with the methodology set forth on Exhibit A), and (C) shall limit
its review to matters specifically set forth in the Protest Notice. The fees
and expenses of the Independent Accountant shall be borne by the Seller, on
the one hand, and the Buyer, on the other hand, based upon the percentage that
the amount not awarded to the Seller or the Buyer bears to the amount actually
contested by the Seller or the Buyer.

(iii) Dispute Resolution. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, any disputes regarding amounts shown in the Closing Date Balance
Sheet or the Closing Schedule shall be resolved solely and exclusively as set
forth in this Section 2.2(b). The scope of the disputed items to be resolved
by the Independent Accountant shall be limited to whether the Closing Date
Balance Sheet and the Closing Schedule were prepared in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement. The findings and determinations of the Independent
Accountant as set forth in its written report shall be deemed final,
conclusive and binding upon the Parties and shall not be subject to collateral
attack for any reason. The Parties shall be entitled to have a judgment
entered on such written report in any court of competent jurisdiction. 

(c) Final Net Working Capital Adjustment. Within five (5) Business Days after
the final determination of the Closing Date Balance Sheet and the Closing
Schedule, or the failure of the Seller to submit a timely Protest Notice: (i)
if the Closing Date Net Working Capital is less than the Estimated Net Working
Capital, then the Seller shall pay to the Buyer the amount of such difference
(taking into account any Interim Payments already made) by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the bank account(s) specified by the Buyer, or
(ii) if the Closing Date Net Working Capital is greater than the Estimated Net
Working Capital, then the Buyer shall pay to the Seller the amount of such
difference (taking into account any Interim Payments already made) by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to the bank account(s) specified by
the Seller. All payments made pursuant to this Section 2.2(c) shall be treated
by all Parties as an adjustment to the Purchase Price.

Section 2.3 Allocation of Purchase Price.

(a) Purchase Price Allocation. The Parties agree to allocate the Purchase
Price (plus Assumed Liabilities, to the extent properly taken into account
under the Code and applicable Treasury Regulations) among the Purchased Assets
in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations
promulgated thereunder and the principles set forth on Schedule 2.3 (the
"Purchase Price Allocation"). Within five (5) days after the final
determination of the Closing Date Balance Sheet and the Closing Schedule as
provided in Section 2.2, the Buyer shall deliver to the Seller a draft
Purchase Price Allocation. The Seller shall have the right to review such
draft Purchase Price Allocation and shall notify the Buyer in writing of any
objections within thirty (30) days after receipt of such draft Purchase Price
Allocation. The Parties shall cooperate in good faith to reach agreement on
the disputed items or amounts, if any. If the Parties are unable to reach an
agreement regarding the Purchase Price Allocation, then within thirty (30)
days following receipt by the Buyer of the Seller\'s written objections, any
disagreement shall be resolved by the Independent Accountants whose
involvement shall be limited solely to disputed items. The Purchase Price
Allocation, as prepared by the Buyer if no timely written objection by the
Seller shall have been given, as adjusted pursuant to any agreement between
the Parties or as determined by the Independent Accountants, shall be final
and binding on the Parties. Any fees and expenses of the Independent
Accountants shall be borne equally by the Seller and the Buyer. Subject only
to any adjustments to the Purchase Price as provided in this Agreement, the
Parties agree (i) to be bound by the Purchase Price Allocation, (ii) to act in
accordance with the Purchase Price Allocation in the preparation of financial
statements and filing of all Tax Returns (including filing Form 8594 with the
United States federal Tax Return for the taxable year that includes the
Closing Date) and in the course of any Tax audit, Tax review or Tax litigation
relating thereto, and (iii) to take no position and to cause their Affiliates
to take no position inconsistent with the Purchase Price Allocation for Tax
purposes, including United States federal and state income Tax and foreign
income Tax. Not later than thirty (30) days prior to filing their respective
Forms 8594 (and analogous state forms) relating to the transaction
contemplated by this Agreement, each Party shall deliver to the other Parties
a copy of its Form 8594 (and analogous state forms). In the event that a
Governmental Authority disputes the Purchase Price Allocation, the Party
receiving notice of such dispute shall promptly notify the other Party, and
the Parties shall reasonably cooperate to defend the Purchase Price Allocation
in any applicable proceeding.

(b) Post‑Closing Adjustment to the Purchase Price Allocation. In the event of
any adjustment to the Purchase Price Allocation, the Parties shall timely file
with the applicable Governmental Authority any additional information required
to be filed under applicable Tax Law.

Section 2.4 No Set‑Off. No Party shall have the right to set off any amount to
which such Party is entitled under this Agreement for indemnification or
otherwise against any payment such Party is required to make under this
Agreement or under any Other Agreement.

Section 9.4 Employee Matters.

(a) Employee Transfer.

(1) The Seller shall update Schedule 3.18 no later than ten (10) days prior to
the Closing Date to reflect, with respect to the Business Employees, the most
current information required to be included on such Schedule for the Business
Employees of the Seller, including, all hires, promotions, demotions,
terminations, transfers or other status, compensation and benefit changes and
attrition, and further accruals or reductions in the Ordinary Course of
Business, and as soon as reasonably practicable prior to the Closing Date, the
Seller shall provide the Buyer with written notice of any changes to the most
recent updated Schedule 3.18. The Buyer shall (1) offer employment to each
Business Employee of the Seller who is Active (as hereafter defined) as of the
Closing Date; provided, however, that such offer shall be contingent upon (i)
such Business Employee\'s timely completion of Form I-9 and confirmation of
employment authorization by E-Verify, (ii) such Business Employee's execution
of the Buyer\'s offer letter (such offer letter will contain only the
applicable contingencies provided for in this Section 9.4(a)), and (iii) with
respect to salaried Business Employees, such Business Employee's execution of
the Buyer's standard confidentiality agreement (collectively, the "Hiring
Conditions"), and (2) hire each Business Employee who satisfies the Hiring
Conditions and accepts the offer of employment. The Buyer may rescind any such
offer of employment if the Business Employee fails to satisfy the applicable
Hiring Conditions; in which case, such Business Employee shall not be
considered to have been employed by the Buyer. The Buyer shall have no
Liabilities with respect to any Business Employee who fails to satisfy the
Hiring Conditions or who does not accept the Buyer's offer of employment. In
addition, for any Business Employee who is not Active as of the Closing Date,
the Buyer shall, within its sole discretion, consider for employment any such
Business Employee who presents himself or herself to the Buyer for "Active"
employment in the Business on or prior to the first anniversary of the Closing
Date. The terms and conditions of any such offer of employment shall be in the
Buyer\'s sole discretion, subject to applicable Law. Each Business Employee of
the Seller to whom the Buyer makes an offer of employment, who accepts the
Buyer\'s offer of employment, who satisfies the Buyer\'s Hiring Conditions,
and who actually commences employment with the Buyer is referred to herein as
a "Hired Employee." For purposes of this Section 9.4(a), a Business Employee
shall be "Active" if the Business Employee is not listed as "inactive" on
Schedule 3.18 or any updated information provided with respect to Schedule
3.18.

(2) The Seller shall be liable for and shall pay all wages, salaries, change
of control payments, payroll taxes and employee benefits due, owing or accrued
for all employees (including Business Employees and Hired Employees) through
the Closing Date. All claims incurred or liabilities incurred or otherwise
asserted under the Seller\'s Plans shall be the responsibility of the Seller,
and the Buyer shall not have any liability with respect to such claims or
liabilities. 

(3) With respect to any Business Employee who is not Active on the Closing
Date, who presents himself or herself to the Buyer for Active employment in
the Business on or prior to the first anniversary of the Closing Date, and who
satisfies the Hiring Conditions, but is not employed by the Buyer, the Buyer
shall be liable for all employment claims and liabilities (including the
actual amounts paid under such COBRA continuation coverage for claims of such
Business Employee (less the aggregate amount paid by such Business Employee
for COBRA continuation coverage under the applicable Seller\'s Plans to which
such Business Employee is entitled to receive such coverage and timely elects
and fully pays for the cost of such coverage) that arise out of the Seller's
termination of such Business Employee as a result of the Buyer's decision not
to employ such Business Employee (but not for claims that arise out of any
other act or omission of the Seller for which Seller shall remain liable).

(4) For each Hired Employee whose employment with the Buyer subsequently
terminates, the Buyer shall offer COBRA continuation coverage under its
applicable group health plans to such Hired Employee (and any eligible
dependents) if such Business Employee is entitled to receive such coverage.
The Seller remains obligated to offer, and continue to provide or arrange to
provide, COBRA continuation coverage to those employees of the Seller whose
employment terminated prior to the Closing Date, to all Business Employees who
do not become Hired Employees of Buyer, and to all other employees of the
Seller for whom the Buyer is not obligated to offer COBRA continuation
coverage.

(b) Buyer Plans. With respect to each benefit plan, program, practice, policy
or arrangement maintained by the Buyer following the Closing Date and in which
any of the Hired Employees participate as determined by the Buyer (the "Buyer
Plans"), for purposes of determining eligibility to participate and for
vesting purposes (but not for accrual of benefits other than determining the
level of vacation pay accrual), service with the Seller (or predecessor
employers to the extent the Seller provides past service credit) shall be
treated as service to the Buyer, except to the extent such service credit
would result in any duplication of benefits. For each self-funded health
benefit plan of the Buyer, the Buyer shall cause there to be waived any pre-
existing condition, exclusion, and waiting period with respect to
participation and coverage under any such health benefit plan in which such
Hired Employees may be eligible to participate after the Closing and give
effect, in determining any deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket
limitations, to claims incurred and amounts paid by, and amounts reimbursed
to, Hired Employees during the applicable plan year in which such transfer
occurs, provided (i) that the Seller provides all data reasonably requested by
the Buyer to the Buyer within three (3) business days of the Closing, and (ii)
that such Hired Employees and dependents were enrolled in comparable Seller
Plans as of the Closing and continuously thereafter until the effective time
of coverage in the new health benefit plan of the Buyer; provided, however,
that the foregoing shall not apply to the extent it would result in
duplication of benefits nor any refunds in amounts already paid. To the extent
that the Buyer maintains any fully insured health benefit plan, the Buyer
shall use Reasonable Efforts to obtain the agreement of any applicable
insurance carrier under the relevant insurance contract for each health
benefit plan of the Buyer in which the Hired Employees become participants to
comply with the immediately preceding sentence.



(c) 401(k) Rollovers. If permitted by the applicable Buyer Plan and subject to
and in accordance with the terms and such conditions of such Buyer Plan and
applicable law, the Buyer may permit the Hired Employees to make a direct
rollover contribution of their cash account balances and rollovers of any
outstanding loans (but no other in-kind assets) in the Seller\'s defined
contribution plan known as the Hearthside Food Solutions 401(k) Plan, to the
applicable Buyer Plan.



(d) Cafeteria Plan. The Buyer shall have in effect as of the Closing Date
flexible spending reimbursement accounts under a cafeteria plan qualifying
under Section 125 of the Code (the "Buyer\'s Cafeteria Plan") that provide
benefits to Hired Employees that are comparable to those provided by the
flexible spending reimbursement accounts under the Hearthside Food Solutions
LLC Health Flexible Spending Plan and Hearthside Food Solutions LLC Dependent
Care Flexible Spending Account Plan (collectively, the "Seller\'s Cafeteria
Plan") and Buyer agrees to cause Buyer\'s Cafeteria Plan to accept a spin-off
of the flexible spending reimbursement accounts from Seller\'s Cafeteria Plan
and to honor and continue through the end of the calendar year in which the
Closing Date occurs the elections made by each Hired Employee under the
Seller\'s Cafeteria Plan in respect of the flexible spending reimbursement
accounts that are in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date provided
that the Seller provides all data reasonably requested by the Buyer to the
Buyer within three (3) business days of the Closing. As soon as practicable
following the Closing Date, the Seller shall cause to be transferred from the
Seller\'s Cafeteria Plan to Buyer\'s Cafeteria Plan the excess, if any, of the
aggregate accumulated contributions to the flexible spending reimbursement
accounts made during the year in which the Closing Date occurs by Hired
Employees over the aggregate reimbursement payouts made for such year from
such accounts to the Hired Employees. If the aggregate reimbursement payouts
from the flexible spending reimbursement accounts under the Seller\'s
Cafeteria Plan made during the year in which the Closing Date occurs to Hired
Employees exceed the aggregate accumulated contributions to such accounts for
such year by the Hired Employees, the Buyer shall cause such excess to be
transferred to the Seller as soon as practicable following the Closing Date.
On and after the Closing Date, the Buyer shall assume and be solely
responsible for all claims by Hired Employees under the Seller\'s Cafeteria
Plan, whether incurred prior to, on or after the Closing Date, that have not
been paid in full as of the Closing Date.



(e) PTO Obligations. Following the Closing, each Hired Employee will be
permitted to "roll over" one hundred percent (100%) of his or her hours of
paid time off (including personal time off and vacation) that is accrued but
unused by such Hired Employee as of the Closing Date (the "Rollover PTO"). On
the Closing Date, the Seller shall notify the Buyer of the name and an
estimate of the number of Rollover PTO hours accrued for each Hired Employee.
Within ten (10) days after the Closing Date, the Seller shall provide the
Buyer with the actual number of Rollover PTO hours accrued for each Hired
Employee. The Buyer shall credit each Hired Employee with paid time off under
Buyer\'s policies, in an amount equal to such actual number of Rollover PTO
accrued for such Hired Employee as of the Closing Date. If such Hired Employee
terminates employment with the Buyer prior to using his or her Rollover PTO,
in addition to any paid time off then accrued under the Buyer\'s policies, the
Buyer shall pay such Hired Employee an amount equal to any such unused
Rollover PTO upon such employment termination. On the Closing Date, the
Purchase Price will be decreased by the estimated value of the Rollover PTO
with respect to each Hired Employee. If the actual value of the Rollover PTO
with respect to each Hired Employee calculated by the Seller within ten (10)
days after the Closing Date is greater than the estimated value of the
Rollover PTO with respect to each Hired Employee calculated by the Seller as
of the Closing Date, then the Seller shall promptly deliver to the Buyer an
amount of cash equal to such difference. If the actual value of the Rollover
PTO with respect to each Hired Employee calculated by the Seller within ten
(10) days after the Closing Date is less than the estimated value of the
Rollover PTO with respect to each Hired Employee calculated by the Seller as
of the Closing Date, then the Buyer shall promptly deliver to the Seller an
amount of cash equal to such difference. Following the Closing Date, subject
to the foregoing, Hired Employees shall be subject to the applicable policies
of the Buyer relating to paid time off in effect from time to time.



(f) WARN Act. The Buyer shall be responsible to provide any required notice
under the WARN Act, or any state plant closing or notification Law, or similar
Law in other jurisdictions, with respect to any "plant closing" or "mass
layoff" (as defined in the WARN Act) or group termination or similar event
affecting Hired Employees and occurring on or after the Closing Date. In
addition, the Buyer shall be responsible for all Liabilities under the WARN
Act or similar state statute, arising out of the failure of the Buyer to offer
employment to Business Employees.



(g) Employee Information. Following the date of this Agreement, the Seller
shall use Reasonable Efforts to promptly provide the Buyer with information
and data reasonably requested by the Buyer relating to the Hired Employees or
in connection with the Buyer\'s rights and obligations under this Article IX,
including exchanging information and data relating to employee benefits, Plan
coverage (except to the extent prohibited by applicable Law), and providing
copies of child support orders, qualified medical child support orders, tax
levies, garnishments, qualified domestic relations orders and other wage or
other deductions affecting the Hired Employees.



(h) Bonuses. With respect to salaried Business Employees, Seller shall pay an
estimated pro-rata portion (from January 1, 2013 to the Closing Date) of the
2013 annual bonus accrued but unpaid bonuses as of the Closing Date to its
employees including those who become Hired Employees on or as soon as
practicable after the Closing Date. With respect to non-salaried Business
Employees, Seller shall accrue an estimated pro rata portion (from January 1,
2013 to the Closing Date) of the 2013 annual bonus with respect to such non-
salaried Business Employees and Buyer shall assume such accrued amounts to the
extent included in the Closing Date Net Working Capital.



(i) No Third Party Beneficiaries. Nothing contained herein shall be construed
as requiring, and neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates shall take any
action that would have the effect of requiring, the Buyer or any of its
Affiliates to continue any specific employee benefit plans. The provisions of
this Section 9.4 are for the sole benefit of the Parties and nothing herein,
expressed or implied, is intended or shall be construed to (i) constitute an
amendment to any of the compensation and benefits plans maintained for or
provided to employees of the Seller prior to or following the Closing or (ii)
confer upon or give to any Person, other than the Parties and their respective
permitted successors and assigns, any legal or equitable or other rights or
remedies under or by reason of any provision of this Agreement.



Section 9.5 Confidentiality.

(a) Non‑Disclosure of Confidential Information. From and after the Closing
Date, each of the Seller, on the one hand, and the Buyer, on the other hand
(as such, a "Restricted Party") shall not, directly or indirectly, disclose or
use at any time (and shall cause its Affiliates and Representatives not to
disclose or use) any Confidential Information owned by the other Party
(whether or not such information is or was developed by it, and, for these
purposes, the Buyer not the Seller shall be deemed to own all Confidential
Information regarding the Purchased Assets and Assumed Liabilities), except to
the extent that such disclosure or use is directly related to and required by
the performance of its duties to the other Party or as required by Law or as
otherwise provided hereunder. From and after the Closing Date, each Restricted
Party further agrees to take commercially reasonable steps, to the extent
within its control, to safeguard such Confidential Information owned by the
other Party and to protect it against disclosure, misuse, espionage, loss and
theft. In the event any of the Restricted Parties is required by Law to
disclose any Confidential Information owned by the other Party, such
Restricted Party shall promptly notify the other Party in writing, which
notification shall include the nature of the legal requirement and the extent
of the required disclosure, and shall cooperate with the other Party\'s
reasonable requests to preserve the confidentiality of such Confidential
Information consistent with applicable Law. For purposes of this Agreement,
"Confidential Information" means all information of a confidential or
proprietary nature (whether or not specifically labeled or identified as
"confidential"), in any form or medium, that relates to a Party\'s business or
its suppliers, distributors, customers, independent contractors or other
business relationships that has been obtained or acquired by or otherwise
become known to the Restricted Party on or before the Closing Date.
Confidential Information includes the following as they relate to a Party\'s
business and, in each case, to the extent a Party obtains a commercial benefit
from the secret nature of such information: internal business information
(including information relating to strategic and staffing plans and practices,
business, training, marketing, promotional and sales plans and practices,
cost, rate and pricing structures, accounting and business methods and
potential acquisition candidates); identities of, individual requirements of,
and specific contractual arrangements with, the business\'s suppliers,
distributors, customers, independent contractors or other business relations
and their confidential information; trade secrets, know-how, compilations of
data and analyses, techniques, systems, formulae, research, records, reports,
manuals, documentation, models, data and databases relating thereto; and
inventions, innovations, improvements, developments, methods, designs,
analyses, drawings, and reports, and, with respect to the Seller, any
information regarding the Seller (and not solely related to the Business)
contained in Individual E-mail Histories. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Confidential Information does not include such information which: (A) at the
time of disclosure is publicly available or thereafter becomes publicly
available through no act or omission of a 

Restricted Party; (B) in the case of Confidential Information unrelated to the
Business, is thereafter disclosed or furnished to the Restricted Party by a
third party who is not known by such Restricted Party to have acquired the
information under an obligation of confidentiality; or (C) in the case of
Confidential Information unrelated to the Business, is independently developed
by the Restricted Party without the use of or reference to Confidential
Information after the Closing Date.

(b) Specific Performance; Injunctive Relief. Each Party acknowledges and
agrees that in the event of a breach by the other Party or any of its
Representatives of any of the provisions of subsection (a) above, the non-
breaching Party may suffer irreparable harm for which no adequate remedy at
law would exist, and damages may be difficult to determine. Consequently, in
the event of any such breach, the non-breaching Party or its successors or
assigns may, in addition to other rights and remedies existing in their favor,
apply to any court of law or equity of competent jurisdiction for specific
performance or injunctive or other relief in order to enforce or prevent any
violations of the provisions of subsection (a) above, in each case, without
the requirement of posting a bond or proving actual damages.

Section 9.6 Further Assurances. In case at any time after the Closing any
further actions are necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement, each of the Parties shall take such further actions (including the
execution and delivery of such further instruments and documents) as the other
Party may reasonably request in order to effectuate the intent of this
Agreement and to provide such other party in all material respects with the
intended benefits of this Agreement, all at the sole cost and expense of the
requesting Party (unless the requesting Party is entitled to indemnification
therefor under Article X).

Section 9.7 Excluded Assets and Excluded Liabilities. Any asset (including all
remittances and all mail and other communications) that is an Excluded Asset
and that is or comes into the possession, custody or control of the Buyer or
any of the Buyer\'s Affiliates (including its or their successors in interest
or assigns) must forthwith be transferred, assigned and conveyed by the Buyer
or such Affiliate to the Seller. Until such transfer, assignment and
conveyance, the Buyer and the Buyer\'s Affiliates do not have any right, title
or interest in such asset nor may they use the same; rather, they hold such
asset in trust for the benefit of the Seller. Any asset (including all
remittances and all mail and other communications) that is a Purchased Asset
and that is or comes into the possession, custody or control of the Seller or
any of the Seller\'s Affiliates (including its or their successors in interest
or assigns) must forthwith be transferred, assigned and conveyed by the Seller
or such Affiliate to the Buyer. Until such transfer, assignment and
conveyance, the Seller and the Seller\'s Affiliates do not have any right,
title or interest in such asset nor may they use the same; rather, they hold
such asset in trust for the benefit of the Buyer. In furtherance of the
foregoing. after the Closing, the Seller shall promptly (and in any event
within five (5) Business Days of receipt) deliver to the Buyer any funds
collected by Seller after the Closing in respect of any Acquired Accounts
Receivable relating to the Business that were part of the Purchased Assets. 

Section 9.8 Restricted Activities.

(a) For a period of two (2) years commencing on the Closing Date, the Seller
shall not, and it shall cause each of its controlled Affiliates not to, (i)
engage in any of the Restricted Businesses within the United States or Canada
(the "Territory"), or (ii) directly or indirectly (including through any
controlled Affiliate or otherwise), solicit for hire or hire any Hired
Employee, or, either directly or indirectly (including through any controlled
Affiliate or otherwise), hire or solicit for hire on behalf of any third
Person any Hired Employee. The Seller acknowledges that a breach or threatened
breach of this Section 9.8 would give rise to irreparable harm to the Buyer,
for which monetary damages would not be an adequate remedy, and hereby agrees
that in the event of a breach or threatened breach by the Seller of any such
obligations, the Buyer shall, in addition to any and all other rights and
remedies that may be available to it in respect of such breach or threatened
breach, be entitled to equitable relief, including a temporary restraining
order, an injunction, specific performance and any other relief that may be
available from a court of competent jurisdiction (without any requirement to
post bond). The Seller acknowledges that the restrictions contained in this
Section 9.8 are reasonable and necessary to protect the legitimate interests
of the Buyer and constitute a material inducement to the Buyer to enter into
this Agreement and consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
In the event that any covenant contained in this Section 9.8 should ever be
adjudicated to exceed the time, geographic, product or service or other
limitations permitted by applicable Law in any jurisdiction, then any court is
expressly empowered to reform such covenant, and such covenant shall be deemed
reformed, in such jurisdiction to the maximum time, geographic, product or
service or other limitations permitted by applicable Law. The covenants
contained in this Section 9.8 and each provision hereof are severable and
distinct covenants and provisions. The invalidity or unenforceability of any
such covenant or provision as written shall not invalidate or render
unenforceable the remaining covenants or provisions hereof, and any such
invalidity or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or
render unenforceable such covenant or provision in any other jurisdiction.

(b) For the purposes of this Section 9.8, the "Restricted Businesses" with
respect to the Seller and its controlled Affiliates shall mean the manufacture
or production of (a) private label granola products, granola cereal or
granola-based snack products (other than granola bars) for sale directly to
retailers or other retail customers, (b) the Seller\'s or any of its
Affiliates\' own brand of granola products, granola cereal or granola-based
snack products (other than granola bars) for sale; provided, that, for the
avoidance of doubt, the co-manufacture of private label granola, branded
granola, private-label granola cereal, branded granola cereal, private-label
granola-based snack products and branded granola-based snack products, in each
case, on behalf of third parties, shall not constitute a Restricted Business.
Further, the term, "Related Business" as used in this Section 9.8 shall mean
any aspect of the Business that is not a Restricted Business.

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in this Section 9.8 shall
be construed to restrict the Seller or any of its Subsidiaries from (i)
engaging in the Related Businesses or (ii) acquiring a Person, whether through
a business combination, acquisition or otherwise, whose total gross revenues
acquired by the Seller (including revenues of Affiliates of such Person only
to the extent acquired) generated from the Restricted Businesses within the
Territory does not exceed Twenty-Five percent (25%) of the consolidated total
gross revenues from all lines of business acquired by the Seller conducted by
such Person during the twelve month period immediately preceding such
acquisition; provided, that none of the assets or personnel of the Seller or
any of its Subsidiaries (the "Restricted Facilities") owned as of the time of
such acquisition shall be utilized directly or indirectly in the Restricted
Businesses conducted by such acquired Person, assets or business during the
period ending on the second anniversary on the Closing Date. 

(d) The Seller shall not consolidate or merge with or into any other Person
(whether or not affiliated with the Seller) or engage in successive
consolidations or mergers in which the Seller or its successor or successors
is a party or parties, or sell, convey, transfer or otherwise dispose of all
or substantially all of its assets or business or the assets or business of
its successor or successors to any other Person (whether or not affiliated
with the Seller or its successor or successors) unless, in each such instance,
prior to or contemporaneous with the consummation of any such transaction, the
Person formed by such consolidation, or the Person into which the Seller is
merged, or the Person which acquires such property, enters into an agreement
with the Buyer in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Buyer
whereby such Person agrees that none of Restricted Facilities acquired by such
Person shall be utilized directly or indirectly in the Restricted Businesses
and that such Person shall comply with the covenant set forth in clause (ii)
of Section 9.8(a), in each case during the period ending on the second
anniversary on the Closing Date; provided, however, that such Person\'s
obligations with respect to the covenant set forth in clause (ii) of Section
9.8(a) shall be limited to the Hired Employees identified on Schedule 9.8.

Section 9.9 Transferred Cellular Phone Numbers. As soon as possible after the
Closing, the Seller shall cause any Transferred Cellular Phone Numbers that
remain with the Seller at the Closing to be transferred to the Persons
directed by the Buyer.

and limitations set forth in this Article X, the Seller shall indemnify,
defend and hold harmless the Buyer Indemnified Parties from and against any
and all Losses sustained or incurred by any Buyer Indemnified Party arising
out of or resulting from:

(a) any inaccuracy or breach of a representation or warranty made by the
Seller in Article III of this Agreement, or in any of the Other Agreements;
provided, however, that for purposes of determining whether there has been a
breach or inaccuracy of such representations and warranties (other than the
first sentence of Section 3.6 (Absence of Certain Changes)) and the amount of
any Losses due to such breach or inaccuracy, all "Material Adverse Effect" or
"Material Adverse Change" qualifications and other materiality qualifications
and similar qualifications contained in such representations and warranties
shall be disregarded; or

(b) any breach by the Seller or the failure of the Seller to perform, observe

Parties from and against any and all Losses sustained or incurred by any
Seller Indemnified Party arising out of or resulting from:

(a) any inaccuracy or breach of a representation or warranty made by the Buyer

Section 10.5 Indemnification Procedure for Third Party Claims and
Environmental Claims.

(a) Third Party Claims. In the event that subsequent to the Closing any Person
that is or may be entitled to indemnification under this Agreement (an
"Indemnified Party") receives notice of the assertion of any claim, issuance
of any order or the commencement of any action or proceeding by any Person who
is not a Party or an Affiliate of a Party, including any domestic or foreign
court or Governmental Authority (a "Third Party Claim"), against such
Indemnified Party and for which a Party is or may be required to provide
indemnification under this Agreement (an "Indemnifying Party"), such
Indemnified Party shall promptly give written notice thereof, together with a
statement of any available information regarding such Third Party Claim to
such Indemnifying Party; provided that the failure of the Indemnified Party to
give prompt notice to the Indemnifying Party shall not affect the Indemnified
Party\'s right to indemnification hereunder except to the extent that the
Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced as a result of such failure. The
Indemnifying Party shall have the right upon written notice to the Indemnified
Party (the "Defense Notice"), within thirty (30) days after receipt from the
Indemnified Party of notice of such Third Party Claim, to assume, control and
conduct, at its expense and by its own counsel (provided such counsel is
reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party), the defense against such
Third Party Claim in its own name, or if necessary in the name of the
Indemnified Party, so long as: (i) the Indemnifying Party provides the
Indemnified Party with evidence reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party
that the Indemnifying Party has the financial resources to defend against the
Third Party Claim and fulfill its indemnification obligations hereunder; (ii)
the Third Party Claim involves only money damages and does not seek an
injunction or other equitable relief or relate to any criminal proceeding,
action, indictment, allegation or investigation; (iii) settlement of, or an
adverse judgment with respect to, a Third Party Claim which involves or
otherwise pertains to any of the ten largest customers (by revenue) or
suppliers (by amount spent) of the Indemnified Party would not, in the good
faith judgment of the Indemnified Party, likely establish a precedential
custom or practice materially adverse to the continuing business interests or
the reputation of the Indemnified Party; and (iv) the Indemnifying Party
diligently pursues the same in good faith. In the event that the Indemnifying
Party does not elect to conduct the defense of the subject Third Party Claim,
then the Indemnified Party may conduct the defense of the subject Third Party
Claim. If the Indemnifying Party does elect as provided above to conduct the
defense of the subject Third Party Claim, then the Indemnified Party will
cooperate with and make available to the Indemnifying Party such assistance
and materials as may be reasonably requested by it, and the Indemnified Party
shall have the right, at its expense, to participate in the defense assisted
by counsel of its own choosing (at its own cost, for which it shall not be
entitled to indemnification) and the Indemnifying Party shall keep such
counsel reasonably informed of the status and other matters related to such
Third Party Claim; provided, that the Indemnified Party shall have the right
to compromise and settle the Third Party Claim only with the prior written
consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed. If an offer is made to settle a Third Party
Claim, which offer complies with the last sentence of this Section 10.5, and
the Indemnifying Party desires to accept and agree to such offer, the
Indemnifying Party will give prompt written notice to the Indemnified Party to
that effect. If the Indemnified Party fails to consent to such firm offer
within twenty (20) calendar days after its receipt of such notice, the
Indemnified Party may continue to contest or defend such Third Party Claim
and, in such event, the maximum Liability of the Indemnifying Party as to such
Third Party Claim will not exceed the amount of such settlement offer, plus
costs and expenses paid or incurred by the Indemnified Party through the date
such settlement offer is given to the Indemnified Party and which amount is
otherwise indemnifiable hereunder. All settlements effected by the
Indemnifying Party hereunder must be approved in advance by the Indemnified
Party (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or 

delayed) unless such settlement (1) effects a complete release of the
Indemnified Party with respect to the Third Party Claim; (2) does not require
a payment by the Indemnified Party; (3) does not contain an admission of
liability on the part of the Indemnified Party; and (4) if applicable to a
Third Party Claim which involves or otherwise pertains to any of the ten
largest customers (by revenue) or suppliers (by amount spent) of the Business,
will not be likely, in the good faith judgment of the Indemnified Party, to
establish a precedential custom or practice materially adverse to the
continuing business interests or the reputation of the Indemnified Party, in
which case no consent of the Indemnified Party shall be required.

(b) Environmental Claims. Notwithstanding the terms and conditions set forth
in Section 10.5(a), the Parties agree that in the event a claim for
indemnification is made by any Buyer Indemnified Party relating to any claimed
breach of Section 3.15 (Compliance with Environmental Requirements) (the
"Environmental Claims"), then, in addition to the procedures set forth in
Section 10.5(a), if the Seller elects to assume the defense of any
Environmental Claim, the Seller shall have full control over any actions,
including, any remedial action, negotiation or litigation (and the settlement
thereof) in connection with any such Environmental Claim all at the sole cost
and expense of the Seller; provided, however, that (i) the Buyer Indemnified
Parties shall cooperate with, and provide access to, the Seller in responding
to or remediating any Environmental Claim, including managing or assuming the
control of any investigation, sampling, cleanup or other Remediation
("Remedial Action"); provided that, (1) Seller shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cause such Remedial Action to not unreasonably interfere
with operations, as then currently conducted, by the Buyer at any Acquired
Leased Real Property; (2) such Remedial Action shall comply with the terms and
conditions of the Lease for such Acquired Leased Real Property (so long as
such terms are substantially similar to the applicable terms in effect as of
the date hereof); (3) such Remedial Action shall be conducted by a licensed
environmental consultant reasonably acceptable to the Buyer; (4) the Seller
shall provide the Buyer and the landlord under the Lease for such Acquired
Leased Real Property with a reasonable opportunity to comment on all work
plans or submissions to any Governmental Authority relating to any such
Remedial Action; (5) the Seller shall indemnify the Buyer with respect to any
Losses for physical damage to the Buyer\'s property or facility or personal
injury directly caused by the Seller after the Closing Date while accessing
any Acquired Leased Real Property for the purpose of exercising the Seller\'s
management or control of the Remedial Action; and (6) the Remedial Action
shall be conducted in accordance with Environmental Requirements and shall not
result in any judgment, order, decree or legally-binding agreement with a
third party that imposes any Liabilities on the Buyer without the Buyer\'s
prior written consent, (ii) in the event that any Remedial Action with respect
to an Environmental Claim is required by Law or the terms and conditions of
the Lease for such Acquired Leased Real Property (so long as such terms are
substantially similar to the applicable terms in effect as of the date
hereof), the Seller shall only be responsible for remediating or cleaning up
to the least stringent applicable clean‑up criteria and requirements under
Environmental Requirements or the Lease for the Acquired Leased Real Property
(including, in the case of any Remedial Action, least stringent applicable
cleanup standards and the use of risk-based remedies, engineering controls and
land use restrictions, as appropriate, and non-residential risk‑based
criteria) unless a Governmental Authority shall impose different clean-up
criteria or requirements, in which event the criteria or requirements imposed
by the Governmental Authority shall establish the extent of Seller\'s
responsibility, and (iii) the Buyer Indemnified Parties agree not to object to
the recording or implementation of any deed restrictions and institutional
controls necessary to allow use of such non-residential clean-up criteria. 

Section 10.6 Calculation of Losses.

(a) The amount of any Losses payable under this Article X by the Indemnifying
Party shall be (i) net of any amounts actually recovered by the Indemnified
Party under applicable insurance policies or from any other Person alleged to
be responsible therefor, and (ii)(a) increased to take account of any net Tax
cost actually incurred by the Indemnified Party arising from the receipt of
indemnity payments hereunder (grossed up for such increase), and (b) reduced
to take account of any net Tax benefit actually realized by the Indemnified
Party arising from the incurrence or payment of any such indemnified amount.
In computing the amount of any such Tax cost or Tax benefit, the Indemnified
Party shall be deemed to recognize all other items of income, gain, loss,
deduction or credit before recognizing any item arising from the receipt of
any indemnity payment hereunder or the incurrence or payment of any
indemnified amount. If the Indemnified Party receives any amounts under
applicable insurance policies, or from any other Person alleged to be
responsible for any Losses, subsequent to an indemnification payment by the
Indemnifying Party, then such Indemnified Party shall promptly reimburse the
Indemnifying Party for any payment made or expense incurred by such
Indemnifying Party in connection with providing such indemnification payment
up to the amount received by the Indemnified Party, net of any direct,
out‑of‑pocket expenses reasonably incurred by such Indemnified Party in
collecting such amount. The Indemnified Party shall use Reasonable Efforts to
collect any amounts available under such insurance coverage or from such other
Person alleged to have responsibility therefor. Each Party hereby waives, to
the extent permitted under its applicable insurance policies, any subrogation
rights that its insurer may have with respect to any indemnifiable Losses.
Nothing in this Section 10.6 requires any Indemnified Party to carry any
particular type or amount of insurance coverage.

(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the
Indemnifying Party shall not be liable under this Article X for any (i) Losses
relating to any matter to the extent that (A)(1) there is included in the
Latest Balance Sheet a specific liability or reserve relating to such matter,
(2) such matter is an Assumed Liability, and (3) the Losses related to such
matter do not exceed the amount of such specific liability or reserve; (B) the
Indemnified Party shall have otherwise been fully compensated for such matter
pursuant to the Purchase Price adjustment under Section 2.2; or (C) the
Indemnified Party shall have otherwise been compensated for such matter
pursuant to, or the Loss was taken into account under, any other provision of
this Agreement, so as to avoid duplication or "double counting" of the same
Loss; (ii) Losses for punitive damages brought by the Indemnified Party
against the Indemnifying Party (other than Losses for punitive damages which
are part of a Third Party Claim); or (iii) Losses determined or calculated
based upon any multiplier of profits, earnings or cash flow.

(c) The Indemnified Parties shall take, and shall cause their respective
Affiliates to take, Reasonable Efforts to mitigate and otherwise minimize
their Losses to the maximum extent reasonably possible upon and after becoming
aware of any event which would reasonably be expected to give rise to any
Losses.

(d) The Parties intend that each representation, warranty, covenant and
agreement contained in this Agreement has independent significance. If any
Party has breached any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
contained in this Agreement in any respect, the fact that there exists another
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement relating to the same subject
matter (regardless of the relative levels of specificity) which the Party has
not breached shall not detract from or mitigate the fact that the Party is in
breach of the first representation, warranty, covenant or agreement.

Section 10.7 Limitation on Indemnification.

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the
Seller shall not be liable hereunder to the Buyer Indemnified Parties pursuant
to Section 10.3(a) as a result of any breach of any of the representations or
warranties of the Seller set forth in Article III (other than the Fundamental
Representations or Section 3.20 (Sufficiency of Assets) or with respect to a
claim for fraud on the part of the Seller) if, with respect to any individual
item of Loss, such item is less than Forty Thousand Dollars ($40,000) (each, a
"Minor Claim"); subject, however, to a maximum of ten (10) Minor Claims, after
which Seller\'s liability to the Buyer Indemnified Parties pursuant to Section
10.3(a) shall not be limited by this Section 10.7(a). 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the
Seller shall not be liable hereunder to the Buyer Indemnified Parties pursuant
to Section 10.3(a) as a result of any breach of any of the representations or
warranties of the Seller set forth in Article III (other than the Fundamental
Representations or Section 3.20 (Sufficiency of Assets) or to a claim for
fraud on the part of the Seller), except to the extent that the Losses
incurred by the Buyer Indemnified Parties as a result of such breaches shall
exceed in the aggregate three-quarters of one percent (0.75%) of the Purchase
Price to be paid by the Buyer at the Closing, and then only to the extent of
such excess (the "Deductible"); provided however, in no case will any Minor
Claims permitted under Section 10.7(a) be included or considered as Losses for
purposes of calculating or administering the Deductible.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, (i)
the Liability of the Seller under Section 10.3(a) as a result of any breach of
any of the representations or warranties of the Seller set forth in Article
III (other than the Fundamental Representations, Section 3.15 (Compliance with
Environmental Requirements) or Section 3.20 (Sufficiency of Assets) or with
respect to a claim for fraud on the part of the Seller), shall not exceed in
the aggregate ten percent (10%) of the Purchase Price to be paid by the Buyer
at Closing, and (ii) the Liability of the Seller under Section 10.3(a) as a
result of any breach of the representations or warranties of the Seller set
forth in Section 3.15 (Compliance with Environmental Requirements) shall not
exceed, in the aggregate, the difference of (A) fifteen percent (15%) of the
Purchase Price to be paid by the Buyer at Closing, minus (B) any amounts paid
to the Buyer in respect of Liabilities of the Seller described in clause (i)
of this Section 10.7(c) (the limitations forth in this Section 10.7(c), as
applicable, are referred to herein as the "Cap Amount").

(d) Except as provided in Section 10.3, no claim shall be brought or
maintained by the Buyer or its Affiliates or their respective successors or
permitted assigns against any officer, director, equityholder or employee
(present or former) of the Seller, and no recourse shall be brought or granted
against any of them, by virtue of or based upon any alleged misrepresentation
or inaccuracy in or breach of any of the representations, warranties or
covenants of the Seller set forth or contained in this Agreement or any
Exhibit or Schedule hereto or any certificate delivered hereunder, except to
the extent that the same shall have been the result of knowing and intentional
fraud by any such Person (and in the event of such knowing and intentional
fraud, such recourse shall be brought or granted solely against the Seller and
the Person or Persons committing such knowing and intentional fraud), provided
that, in the event of any such fraud, nothing herein shall prohibit or prevent
the Buyer and its successors or permitted assigns from claiming or seeking
rescission of the transactions consummated under this Agreement and any other
remedy available at law or in equity against the Seller.

(e) The Buyer and its successors and permitted assigns, hereby waive any right
to seek contribution or other recovery from any officer, director,
equityholder or employee (present or former) of the Seller, or any officer,
director or employee (present or former) of the Seller that any of them may
now or in the future have under any Environmental Requirements. The Buyer and
its successors and permitted assigns hereby release all officers, directors,
equityholders and employees (present or former) of the Seller, and all
officers, directors or employees (present or former) of the Seller from any
and all such claims, demands and causes of action that any of them may now or
in the future have under such Environmental Requirements.

(f) All indemnification payments made hereunder shall be treated by all
Parties as an adjustment to the Purchase Price. 

(g) For avoidance of doubt, the limitations contained in Section 10.7(a),
Section 10.7(b) and Section 10.7(c) (i.e., the "Minor Claims," the
"Deductible" and the "Cap Amount") do not apply to a claim for indemnification
under Section 10.3(a) with respect to claims made under any of the Fundamental
Representations or Section 3.20 (Sufficiency of Assets), or under Section
10.3(b), Section 10.3(c), Section 10.3(d) or Section 10.3(e) or under Article
II, or to a claim based upon fraud on the part of the Seller. In the event
that a claim may be made by any Buyer Indemnified Party under Section 10.3(a)
and also under any one or more of Section 10.3(b), Section 10.3(c), Section
10.3(d) or Section 10.3(e) relating to the same underlying set of facts or
circumstances, the limitations contained in Section 10.7(a), Section 10.7(b)
and Section 10.7(c) (i.e., the "Minor Claims," the "Deductible" and the "Cap
Amount") shall not apply to such claim; provided, however, that in no event
shall the Buyer Indemnified Party be entitled to recover more than the amount
of the Losses incurred, paid or sustained by the Buyer Indemnified Party as a
result of such claim.

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the
Seller shall have no duty to indemnify any Buyer Indemnified Party with
respect to any Environmental Claims (i) for which remediation costs incurred
by Buyer Indemnified Parties were in connection with actions taken to achieve
more stringent cleanup standards than set forth in Section 10.5(b)(ii) or (ii)
arising from any conditions of contamination identified through any
environmental sampling or analysis by the Buyer or any of its Affiliates or
their respective Representatives unless such sampling or analysis was
affirmatively required by Environmental Law or mandated by Governmental
Authority.

Section 10.8 Exclusion of Other Remedies. The Parties agree that, from and
after the Closing Date, the indemnification or reimbursement obligations of
the Parties set forth in this Article X shall constitute the sole and
exclusive remedies of the Parties for any Losses based upon, arising out of or
otherwise in respect of the matters set forth in this Agreement and the Other
Agreements and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. The
provisions of this Section 10.8 shall not, however, prevent or limit a cause
of action (a) on account of fraud, (b) under Section 2.2(b) to enforce any
decision or determination of the Independent Accountant, or (c) under Section
13.16 to obtain an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of any
covenants set forth in this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms
and provisions hereof.

Section 10.9 Notice of Claims. Promptly after any Indemnified Party has
received notice of or has knowledge of any claim for indemnification
hereunder, or the commencement of any Third Party Claim or proceeding, the
Indemnified Party must, as a condition precedent to a claim with respect
thereto being made against the Indemnifying Party pursuant to Section 10.3 or
Section 10.4, give the Indemnifying Party written notice of such claim or the
commencement of such Third Party Claim or proceeding. Such notice must state
the nature and the basis of such claim or Third Party Claim or proceeding and,
if reasonably possible, an estimate of the amount thereof. The failure of any
Indemnified Party to give notice as provided herein relieves the Indemnifying
Party of its obligations under this Article X if and only if the failure to
timely give such notice is materially prejudicial to the Indemnifying Party\'s
ability to adequately defend such claim or Third Party Claim or proceeding
(and the Indemnifying Party did not otherwise have knowledge of such claim or
Third Party Claim or proceeding) or if the notice was not given prior to the
expiration of any applicable time limitation periods set forth in Section 10.1
or Section 10.2, as applicable.

ARTICLE XI

TERMINATION 

Section 11.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior
to the Closing:

(a) by the mutual written consent of the Buyer and the Seller;

(b) by the Buyer in writing, without Liability of the Buyer on account of such

material breach of this Agreement), if the Closing shall not have occurred on
or before July 1, 2013 (the "Outside Date");

(c) by the Seller in writing, without Liability of the Seller on account of
such termination (provided that the Seller is not otherwise in material
default or in material breach of this Agreement), if the Closing shall not
have occurred on or before the Outside Date;

(d) by the Buyer in writing, if satisfaction of any of the conditions in
Section 7.1 or Section 7.2 is or becomes impossible (other than by reason of
the Buyer\'s failure to comply with its obligations under this Agreement) and
the Buyer has not waived in writing such condition on or before the Closing;

(e) by the Seller in writing, if satisfaction of any of the conditions in
Section 7.1 or Section 7.3 is or becomes impossible (other than by reason of
the Seller\'s or the Seller\'s failure to comply with any of its obligations
under this Agreement) and the Seller has not waived in writing such condition
on or before the Closing;

(f) by the Buyer in writing, in the event of any material breach of this
Agreement by the Seller, which breach remains uncured ten (10) days following
written notice by the Buyer to the Seller of such breach;

(g) by the Seller in writing, in the event of any material breach of this
Agreement by the Buyer, which breach remains uncured ten (10) days following
written notice by the Seller to the Buyer of such breach; or

(h) by any Party if any court, judicial authority or Governmental Authority of
competent jurisdiction shall have enacted, promulgated, enforced or entered
any injunction, order, decree or ruling, taken any other action or failed to
take any other action which, in any such case, has become final and
non‑appealable and has the effect of making the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement illegal, or otherwise preventing
or prohibiting consummation of such transactions; provided, however, that the
provisions of this Section 11.1(h) shall not be available to any Party unless
such Party shall have used commercially reasonable efforts to oppose any such
action or to have such action vacated or made inapplicable to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 11.2 Effect of Termination. Except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, in the event of termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section
11.1, all obligations under this Agreement shall terminate and shall be of no
further force or effect; provided, however, that (a) the rights and
obligations of the Parties set forth in Article X, this Section 11.2, Article
XII and Article XIII, inclusive, shall survive such termination, and (b) no
termination of this Agreement shall release, or be construed as releasing, any
Party from any Liability to any other Party which may have arisen under this
Agreement prior to termination or for any breach of this Agreement.
