shall promptly cause to be paid to the Person(s) entitled thereto a check or
wire transfer of "same day" funds in the amount to which such Person(s) are

other provisions as Parent and the Company may   
-9-        reasonably agree, and (ii) instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of Company Certificates for payment of the Company
Merger Consideration. Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of any Company
Certificate, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed and
completed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other
documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions Parent and/or the
Surviving Company shall promptly cause to be paid to the Person(s) entitled
thereto a check in the amount to which such Person(s) are entitled pursuant
to Section 4.2(a), after giving effect to any required tax withholdings and
such Company Certificate shall then be canceled. No interest will be paid or
will accrue on the amount payable upon the surrender of any Company
Certificate.   (iii) If payment is to be made to a Person other than the
registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, it shall be a condition of
such payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed
or otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such
payment shall pay any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the
payment to a person other than the registered holder of the Certificate
surrendered or establish to the satisfaction of the Surviving Stockholder or
the Surviving Company (as the case may be), or to the satisfaction of the
Paying Agent, that such tax has been paid or is not applicable.   (iv) For

(including any interest received with respect thereto) made available to the
Paying Agent in respect of the payments to be made pursuant to Section 4.1(a)
which have not been disbursed to holders of CPI Certificates at the CPI

as general creditors thereof with respect to the cash payable upon due
surrender of their CPI Certificates.   (ii) One hundred and eighty days
following the Company Merger Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Company

law. Parent or the Surviving Company, as applicable, shall pay all charges
and expenses, including those of the Paying Agent, in connection with the
exchange of cash for CPI Shares or Company Shares.    -11-        
(e) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event any Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in
customary amount as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it
with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will pay in exchange
for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the consideration due such
holder pursuant to Section 4.1(a) or Section 4.2(a) upon due surrender of the
CPI Shares or Company Shares represented by such Certificate.   4.4.
Dissenters\' Rights. If any Dissenting Stockholder shall be entitled to be
paid the "fair value" of his or her CPI Shares or Company Shares, as provided
in Section 262 of the DGCL, CPI or the Company, as the case may be, shall
give Parent prompt notice thereof and Parent shall have the right
to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any
such demands. None of CPI, the Company, the Surviving Stockholder or the
Surviving Company shall, except with the prior written consent of Parent,
voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle,
any such demand for payment. If any Dissenting Stockholder shall fail to
perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost the right to dissent, the
CPI Shares or Company Shares held by such Dissenting Stockholder shall
thereupon be treated as though such CPI Shares or Company Shares had been
converted into the CPI Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 4.1(a) or the
Company Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 4.2(a), as the case may
be.   4.5. Adjustment to Merger Consideration Amounts. The net after
tax proceeds of the cash received by the Company in payment of the Purchase
Price (as defined in the Asset Purchase Agreement) (the "Adjusted After Tax
Proceeds Amount") shall be determined by the Company in good faith, taking
into account the information reflected on the final and binding After Tax
Proceeds Schedules as defined in Section 4.5(c), at least five days prior to
the Closing. Such determination shall be made using the same methodology that
was used to calculate the net after tax proceeds to be received by the
Company in payment of the Purchase Price (as defined in the Asset Purchase
Agreement) as reflected in Section 4.5 of the Company Disclosure Letter (the
"After Tax Proceeds Amount").    -12-         (a) Increase in
After-Tax Proceeds of Asset Sale. If the Adjusted After Tax Proceeds Amount
exceeds the After Tax Proceeds Amount, the amount of the CPI Merger
Consideration or the Company Merger Consideration (as the case may be) to be
received by each Eligible CPI Shareholder (as hereinafter defined) or
Eligible Company Shareholder (as hereinafter defined) (as the case may be)
in respect of each Recapped Share or Company Share (as the case may be) shall
be increased by the result of (i) the amount of such excess divided by
(ii) 50,603,522 (the "Fully Diluted Number"). For purposes hereof, an
"Eligible CPI Shareholder" shall be any holder of Recapped Shares other than
CPI and an "Eligible Company Shareholder" shall be any holder of Company
Shares (other than Parent, the Surviving Stockholder, or any direct or
indirect subsidiary of Parent, the Surviving Stockholder, or the Company or
any direct or indirect subsidiary of the Company).   (b) Decrease in After-
Tax Proceeds of Asset Sale. If the Adjusted After Tax Proceeds Amount is less
than the After Tax Proceeds Amount, the amount of the CPI Merger
Consideration or the Company Merger Consideration (as the case may be) to be
received by each Eligible CPI Shareholder or Eligible Company Shareholder (as
the case may be) in respect of each Recapped Share or Company Share (as the
case may be) shall be reduced by the result of (i) the amount of such
shortfall divided by (ii) the Fully Diluted Number. It is understood
and agreed, notwithstanding the foregoing, that the Fully Diluted Number will
be appropriately adjusted if the Company Merger Consideration would otherwise
be reduced pursuant to this Section 4.5(b) to an amount equal to, or below
the exercise price of outstanding Company Options (as hereinafter
defined).   (c) Net After Tax Proceeds Information. This subsection (c)
shall not apply to the methodology reflected in Section 4.5 of the Company
Disclosure Letter.   (i) The Company shall (A) provide access to Parent and
its representatives to all information and personnel relevant to the
calculation of the After Tax Proceeds Schedules (as defined below) and the
Adjusted After Tax Proceeds Amount as may be reasonably requested by Parent
or its representatives on an ongoing basis from the date of this Agreement to
the date that is five days before the Closing Date; (B) as soon as reasonably
practicable, but no later than June 10, 2001, furnish to Parent (1) a
calculation of the earnings and profits of the Transferred   
-13-        Subsidiaries (as defined in the Asset Purchase Agreement),
calculated by KPMG LLP ("KPMG") using its reasonable best efforts which
reflects the most recent audited financial statements of the Company (the
"Foreign EandP; Calculation"), (2) a proposed allocation of purchase price
among the Purchased Assets (as defined in the Asset Purchase Agreement)
prepared pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement (the "Purchase Price
Allocation"); and (3) a revised After Tax Proceeds Amount taking into account
the most recent applicable information including the Foreign EandP; Calculation
and the proposed Purchase Price Allocation (the "Revised After Tax Proceeds
Amount") (collectively, the "Interim After Tax Proceeds Schedules"); and (C)
as soon as reasonably practicable, but no later than 15 days prior to the
Closing, furnish to Parent the final Purchase Price Allocation to be
reflected in the Asset Purchase Agreement (the "Final Purchase Price
Allocation") and a revised Foreign EandP; Calculation taking into
account, using reasonable best efforts, the earnings and profits of the
Transferred Subsidiaries between the date of the most recent audited
financial statements of the Company and the date that is 15 days prior to
Closing, along with all documentation used to support such calculation (the
"Revised Foreign EandP; Calculation") (collectively, the "Final After Tax
Proceeds Schedules" and together with the Interim After Tax Proceeds
Schedules, the "After Tax Proceeds Schedules"). Each of the After Tax
Proceeds Schedules shall be prepared as to properly reflect the resolution of
any objection made by Parent pursuant to clause (ii) of this subsection
(c).   (ii) Unless Parent provides specific written notice to the Company
of an objection (A) in the case of an Interim After Tax Proceeds Schedule, no
later than the tenth day following Parent\'s receipt thereof or (B) in the
case of a Final After Tax Proceeds Schedule, not later than the fifth day
following Parent\'s receipt thereof, such Interim After Tax Proceeds Schedule
or Final After Tax Proceeds Schedule, as the case may be, shall then become
binding upon the Company and Parent for purposes of this Agreement. If
Parent, by written notice to the Company no later than such tenth or fifth
day, as the case may be, objects to an item reflected on an Interim After Tax
Proceeds Schedule or a Final After Tax Proceeds Schedule, as the case may be,
such After Tax Proceeds Schedule shall not become binding for purposes of
this Agreement, the Company and Parent shall discuss such objection in good
faith and, if they reach written agreement amending the After Tax Proceeds
Schedule, such After Tax Proceeds Schedule as amended by such written   
-14-        agreement shall become binding upon the Company and Parent
for purposes of this Agreement;   (iii) If the Company and Parent do not
reach such written agreement (A) in the case of an Interim After Tax Proceeds
Schedule, no later than the tenth day following Parent\'s delivery to the
Company of such notice of objection or (B) in the case of a Final After Tax
Proceeds Schedule, no later than the third day following Parent\'s delivery
to the Company of such notice of objection, those aspects of the After Tax
Proceeds Schedule as to which such objection was made shall be submitted for
arbitration by a big five accounting firm acceptable to, and independent of,
the Company and Parent, (the "Accounting Firm") (whose fees shall be paid
equally by the Company and Parent), which shall arbitrate the dispute and
submit a written statement of its adjudication, which statement, when
delivered to the Company and to Parent, shall become final and binding upon
the Company and Parent for purposes of this Agreement. The scope of the
disputes to be resolved by the Accounting Firm is limited to whether
the amounts set forth on the After Tax Proceeds Schedule (A) were the result
of errors of fact or mathematical errors, (B) are supportable based on the
books and records of the Company (C) are in accordance with the Company\'s
prior accounting practices generally and, if appropriate, are consistent with
the methodology used to calculate foreign earnings and profits in prior years
and (D) are substantially in compliance with Section 312 of the Internal
Revenue Code. The Accounting Firm is not to make any other determination.
The determination of the Accounting Firm, which in no case shall be made
later than the fifth day prior to the Closing Date, shall constitute an
arbitral award that is final, binding and unappealable and upon which a
judgment may be entered by any court having jurisdiction thereof.   (iv)
Parent shall have the right to object to the computation of the After Tax
Proceeds Amount only to the extent such objection relates to errors of fact
or mathematical errors. Specific written notice of such objection may
be provided to the Company at any time on or prior to May 25, 2001. The
Company and Parent shall discuss such objection in good faith and, if they
reach written agreement regarding such objection, such agreement shall be
properly reflected in the Revised After Tax Proceeds Amount. If the Company
and Parent do not reach written agreement regarding such objection prior to
the date that Parent receives the Revised After Tax Proceeds Amount from
the     -15-        Company, such objection shall be deemed an
objection to the Revised After Tax Proceeds Amount under clause (ii) of this
subsection (c).   ARTICLE V   Representations and Warranties   5.1.
Representations and Warranties of CPI. Except as set forth in the disclosure
letter attached hereto as Exhibit A (the "CPI Disclosure Letter"), CPI hereby
represents and warrants to Parent and CPI Merger Sub that:   (a)
Organization, Good Standing and Qualification. CPI is a corporation duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State
of Delaware and has all requisite corporate or similar power and authority to
own, lease and operate its properties and assets and to carry on its business
as presently conducted and is duly qualified to do business and is in good
standing as a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction where the ownership,
leasing or operation of its properties or conduct of its business requires
such qualification. CPI has made available to Parent a complete and correct
copy of CPI\'s certificate of incorporation and bylaws, each as amended to
date. CPI\'s certificate of incorporation and bylaws so delivered are in
full force and effect. CPI does not have any Subsidiaries other than the
Company and the Subsidiaries of the Company.   As used in this Agreement,
"CPI Material Adverse Effect" means a material adverse effect on the
financial condition, business, assets or results of operations of CPI,
assuming and after giving effect to the consummation of the Assets Purchase
and the other transactions contemplated by the Asset Purchase Agreement;
provided, however, that any such effect resulting from any change in economic
or business conditions generally or in the pharmaceutical industry
specifically shall not be considered when determining whether an CPI Material
Adverse Effect has occurred.   As used in this Agreement, the term
"Subsidiary" means, with respect to CPI, the Company, Parent, CPI Merger Sub
or Company Merger Sub, as the case may be, any entity, whether incorporated
or unincorporated, of which at least a majority of the securities or
ownership interests having by their terms ordinary voting power to elect a
majority of the      16    board of directors or other persons
performing similar functions is directly or indirectly owned or controlled by
such party or by one or more of its respective Subsidiaries or by such party
and any one or more of its respective Subsidiaries; provided, however, that,
for purposes of this Agreement, the Company shall not be deemed to be a
Subsidiary of CPI.   (b) Capital Structure. The authorized capital stock of
CPI consists and, at all times prior to the Recapitalization, will consist,
of 97,000 CPI First Preferred Shares, of which 92,343.4 shares were
outstanding on May 2, 2001, 1,000,000 CPI Second Preferred Shares, of which
544,076.75 shares were outstanding on May 2, 2001, 5,000,000 CPI Third

1,500 CPI Class A Common Shares, of which 0 shares were outstanding on May 2,
2001, 13,500 CPI Class B Common Shares, of which 11,172 shares were
outstanding on May 2, 2001, and 1,500 CPI Class C Common Shares, of which
1,306 shares were outstanding on May 2, 2001. As of and following the
Recapitalization, the authorized capital stock of CPI will consist of
23,508,000 Recapped Shares, of which 23,508,000 will be outstanding
immediately prior to the CPI Merger Effective Time. All of the outstanding
shares of capital stock of CPI have been duly authorized and are (and
following consummation of the Recapitalization will be) validly issued, fully
paid and nonassessable. As of the date of this Agreement, CPI has no shares
of capital stock reserved for issuance or subject to issuance, except that,
as of May 2, 2001, there were 1,306 CPI Class A Common Shares reserved
for issuance upon conversion of CPI Class C Common Shares. As of the Closing,
there will be no shares of capital stock reserved for issuance or subject to
issuance. Except with respect to the Recapitalization and as set forth above
or in the certificate of incorporation of CPI, there are no preemptive or
other outstanding rights, options, warrants, conversion rights, stock
appreciation rights, redemption rights, repurchase rights, agreements,
arrangements or commitments to issue or sell any shares of capital stock or
other securities of CPI or any securities or obligations convertible or
exchangeable into or exercisable for, or giving any Person a right to
subscribe for or acquire, any securities of CPI, and no securities or
obligations evidencing such rights are authorized, issued or outstanding. CPI
does not have outstanding any bonds, debentures, notes or other obligations
the holders of which have the right to vote (or convertible into or
exercisable    -17-   for securities having the right to vote) with the
stockholders of CPI on any matter ("CPI Voting Debt"). Except as set forth in
Section 5.1(b) of the CPI Disclosure Letter, CPI does not own, directly or
indirectly, any capital stock, membership interest, partnership interest,
joint venture interest or other equity interest in any person.   (c)
Corporate Authority; Approvals. (i) CPI has all requisite corporate power and
authority and has taken all corporate action necessary in order to execute,
deliver and perform its obligations under this Agreement and the Memorandum
of Understanding and to consummate the CPI Merger, subject only to approval
of this Agreement and the other transactions contemplated hereby by a
majority of the votes entitled to be cast by the holders of the CPI
Shares, voting together as a single class (the "CPI Requisite Vote"). Each of
this Agreement and the Memorandum of Understanding has been duly and validly
executed and delivered by CPI and, assuming the due authorization, execution
and delivery by the Company, Parent, CPI Merger Sub and Company Merger Sub,
constitutes a valid and binding agreement of CPI enforceable against CPI in
accordance with its terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent
transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws of general
applicability relating to or affecting creditors\' rights and to general
equity principles (the "Bankruptcy and Equity Exception").   (ii) The Board
of Directors of CPI has unanimously (A) approved (i)the Memorandum of
Understanding and (ii) this Agreement subject to the corporate actions
required to be taken with respect to the Recapitalization, (B) determined the
advisability of entering into this Agreement and (C) recommended that the
stockholders of CPI adopt this Agreement.   (d) Governmental Filings; No
Violations. (i) Other than the filings and/or notices (A) pursuant to Section
1.4, (B) pursuant to the HSR Act, (C) pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), (D) pursuant to the European
Community Merger Control Regulation and (E) required to be made with any
Governmental Entity (as defined below) in any jurisdiction outside the United
States, no notices, reports or other filings are required to be made by CPI
with, nor are any consents, registrations, approvals, permits or
authorizations required to be obtained by CPI from, any    
-18-    governmental or regulatory authority, agency, commission, body or
other governmental entity (each, a "Governmental Entity") in connection with
the execution and delivery of this Agreement by CPI and the consummation by
CPI of the CPI Merger, except those that the failure to make or obtain are
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably likely to have an CPI
Material Adverse Effect or prevent, materially delay or materially impair the
ability of CPI to consummate the CPI Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.   (ii) The execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement and the Memorandum of Understanding by CPI do
not, and the consummation by CPI of the CPI Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby will not, constitute or result in (A) a breach or
violation of, or a default under, the certificate of incorporation or bylaws
of CPI or the comparable governing instruments of any of its Subsidiaries, or
(B) a breach or violation of, a default under, the termination (or right of
termination), amendment (or right of amendment), cancellation (or right of
cancellation) or acceleration of any obligations, or a loss of a material
benefit under, or the creation of a lien, liability, pledge, security
interest, Claim or similar encumbrance on or the loss of any assets of CPI
(with or without notice, lapse of time or both) pursuant to, any
material agreement, lease, sublease, contract, license, note, mortgage,
indenture, arrangement or other obligation not otherwise terminable by the
other party thereto on 90 days\' or less notice ("Contract") binding upon CPI
or, assuming compliance with the DGCL and all Laws requiring the filings and
or notices described in Section 5.1(d)(i), any Law (as defined in Section
5.2(j)) or governmental or non-governmental permit, concession, franchise or
license to which CPI is subject.   (e) Litigation and Liabilities. There
are no (i) civil, criminal or administrative actions, suits, claims,
hearings, arbitrations, litigations, investigations or proceedings
(collectively, "Claims") pending or, to the knowledge of the officers or
directors of CPI, threatened against CPI or (ii) material obligations or
material liabilities, whether or not accrued, contingent or otherwise
(collectively, "Obligations") relating to CPI other than Claims
and Obligations relating to this Agreement or the Company.    
-19-       (f) Taxes. CPI (i) has prepared in good faith and duly and
timely filed (taking into account any extension of time within which to file)
all Tax Returns (as defined below) required to be filed by it, and all such
Tax Returns are complete and correct in all material respects; (ii) has paid
all Taxes (as defined below) required to have been paid that are shown as due
on such Tax returns, except with respect to matters contested in good faith;
and (iii) has not waived any statute of limitations with respect to Taxes or
agreed to any extension of time with respect to a Tax assessment or
deficiency. As of the date hereof, there are not pending or, to the knowledge
of CPI, threatened in writing, any audits, examinations, investigations or
other proceedings in respect of Taxes or Tax matters.   CPI has not (i)
filed a consent under Section 341(f) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the "Code") or analogous provision of state, local or foreign law;
(ii) been a member of an affiliated group of corporations filing a
consolidated United States federal Tax Return, nor has any liability for the
Taxes of another person, including liability arising from the application of
Treasury Regulation ss. 1.1502-6 or any analogous provision of state, local
or foreign law, or as a transferee or successor, by contract or otherwise; or
(iii) entered into a closing agreement pursuant to Section 7121 of the Code
or similar provision for purposes of state, local or foreign taxes relating
to Taxes due from CPI. Assuming the representations and warranties of the
Company set forth in Section 5.2(m) with respect to whether the Company
has ever been a "United States real property holding corporation" are true
and accurate in all respects, CPI has never been a "United States real
property holding corporation" within the meaning of Section 897 of the Code.
There are no liens or encumbrances for Taxes on any of the assets of CPI
except for statutory liens for Taxes not yet due or payable. As of the date
hereof, CPI has no "undistributed personal holding company income" as defined
in Section 545 (a) of the Code. CPI has delivered to Parent true, correct and
complete copies of all federal Tax Returns for all open Tax years,
examination reports and statements of deficiencies. The Recapitalization of
CPI immediately prior to the CPI Merger will not give rise to federal income
tax liability of CPI.   As used in this Agreement, the term (i) "Tax"
(including, with correlative meaning, the terms "Taxes", and "Taxable")
includes all federal, state, local and foreign income, profits, franchise,
gross receipts, environmental,     -20-   customs duty, capital stock,
severances, stamp, payroll, sales, employment, unemployment, disability, use,
property, withholding, excise, production, value added, occupancy and other
taxes, duties or assessments of any nature whatsoever, together with all
interest, penalties and additions imposed with respect to such amounts and
any interest in respect of such penalties and additions, and (ii) "Tax
Return" includes all returns and reports (including elections, declarations,
disclosures, schedules, estimates and information returns) required to be
supplied to a Tax authority relating to Taxes.   5.2. Representations and
Warranties of the Company. Except as set forth in the disclosure letter
attached hereto as Exhibit B (the "Company Disclosure Letter") or the Company
Reports (as hereinafter defined) filed prior to the date hereof, the Company
hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Company Merger Sub that:   (a)
Organization, Good Standing and Qualification. Each of the Company and its
Subsidiaries is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of its respective jurisdiction of organization and

operate its properties and assets and to carry on its business as presently
conducted (after giving effect to the Assets Purchase and the
other transactions contemplated by the Asset Purchase Agreement) and is duly
qualified to do business and is in good standing as a foreign corporation in
each jurisdiction where the ownership, the leasing or operation of its
properties or conduct of its business (after giving effect to the Assets
Purchase and the other transactions contemplated by the Asset Purchase
Agreement) requires such qualification, except where the failure to be so
qualified or in good standing is not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect (as defined
below). The Company has made available to Parent a complete and correct copy
of the Company\'s and its Subsidiaries\' certificates of incorporation and
bylaws, each as amended to date. The Company\'s and its Subsidiaries\'
certificates of incorporation and bylaws so delivered are in full force and

a material adverse effect on the financial condition, business, assets or
results of     -21-    operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries
taken as a whole, assuming and after giving effect to the consummation of the
Assets Purchase and the other transactions contemplated by the Asset Purchase
Agreement; provided, however, that any such effect resulting from any change
in economic or business conditions generally or in the pharmaceutical
industry specifically shall not be considered when determining whether a
Company Material Adverse Effect has occurred. Section 5.2(a) of the Company
Disclosure Letter contains a true and accurate list of all of the
Subsidiaries of the Company other than the Transferred Subsidiaries (as
defined in the Asset Purchase Agreement). Except for its interest in its
Subsidiaries, the Company does not own, directly or indirectly, any capital
stock, membership interest, partnership interest, joint venture interest or
other equity interest in any person.   (b) Capital Structure. The authorized
capital stock of the Company consists of 80,000,000 Company Common Shares, of
which 33,465,711 shares were outstanding on May 2, 2001, and 13,056,800
Company Class B Common Shares, of which 12,224,835 shares were outstanding on

and are validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. As of May 2, 2001,
4,095,017 options and 817,959 deferred stock awards were outstanding, all of
which were granted pursuant to the Stock Plans (as defined below). Since May
2, 2001 and prior to the date hereof, the Company has not issued (i) any
Company Shares other than pursuant to the exercise of any Company Options and
Stock Awards or (ii) any Company Options or Stock Awards. As of the date of
this Agreement, the Company has no Company Shares reserved for issuance or
subject to issuance, except that, as of May 2, 2001, there were 12,224,835
Company Common Shares reserved for issuance upon conversion of the Company
Class B Common Shares, and as of May 2, 2001, 2,126,904 Company Common Shares
reserved for issuance pursuant to the Company\'s 1977 Restricted Stock Award
Plan, as amended (the "1977 Restricted Stock Plan") and 3,172,663
Company Common Shares reserved for issuance pursuant to the Company\'s 1996
Long-Term Incentive Plan (the "1996 LTIP" and, together with the 1977
Restricted Stock Plan, the "Stock Plans"). Each of the outstanding shares of
capital stock or other equity interests of each of the Company\'s
Subsidiaries is duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable
and, except for directors\' qualifying and nominee shares, owned by the
Company or a direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, free
and clear of any lien,    -22-   pledge, security interest, claim or
similar encumbrance and free of any other restriction (including any
restriction on the right to vote, sell or otherwise dispose of such capital
stock or other ownership interests), except for restrictions imposed by
applicable securities laws. Except as set forth above there are no
authorized, issued or outstanding Company Shares or other shares of capital
stock or other securities of the Company and no preemptive or
other outstanding rights, options, warrants, conversion rights, stock
appreciation rights, redemption rights, repurchase rights, agreements,
arrangements or commitments to issue or sell any shares of capital stock or
other securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any securities
or obligations convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for, or giving
any Person a right to subscribe for or acquire, any securities of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, and no securities or obligations evidencing such
rights are authorized, issued or outstanding. The Company does not have
outstanding any bonds, debentures, notes or other obligations the holders of
which have the right to vote (or convertible into or exercisable for
securities having the right to vote) with the stockholders of the Company on
any matter ("Company Voting Debt").   (c) Corporate Authority; Approval and
Fairness. (i) The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority and
has taken all corporate action necessary in order to execute, deliver and
perform its obligations under this Agreement and the Memorandum of
Understanding and to consummate this Agreement, subject only to approval of
this Agreement and the other transactions contemplated hereby by a majority
of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of the Company Shares, voting
together as a single class (the "Company Requisite Vote"). Each of this
Agreement and the Memorandum of Understanding has been duly and validly
executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming the due authorization,
execution and delivery by CPI, Parent, CPI Merger Sub and Company Merger Sub,
constitutes a legal, valid and binding agreement of the Company enforceable
against the Company in accordance with its terms, subject to the Bankruptcy
and Equity Exception.   (ii) The Board of Directors of the Company at a
meeting duly called and held has unanimously by those present (A) approved
this Agreement, the Memorandum of Understanding and the Company Merger and
the other transactions contemplated hereby, (B) determined the advisability
of entering into this Agreement and (C)     -23-   recommended that
the stockholders of the Company adopt this Agreement. The Board of Directors
of the Company has received the opinion of its financial advisor, J.P. Morgan
Securities Inc., to the effect that the Company Merger Consideration to be
received by the holders of the Company Shares in the Company Merger is fair
to such holders from a financial point of view and has received the
opinion of its financial advisor, Houlihan Lokey Howard and Zukin, Inc., to the
effect that the Company Merger is fair to the holders of the Company Shares
from a financial point of view. It is agreed and understood that each such
opinion is for the benefit of the Company\'s Board of Directors and may not
be relied on by Parent, CPI Merger Sub or Company Merger Sub.   (d)
Governmental Filings; No Violations. (i) Other than the filings and/or
notices (A) pursuant to Sections 1.4 and 1.5, (B) pursuant to the HSR Act,
(C) pursuant to the Exchange Act, (D) pursuant to Environmental
Laws, including the New Jersey Industrial Site Recovery Act and the
Connecticut Property Transfer Act, (E) pursuant to the European Community
Merger Control Regulation, or (F) required to be made with any Governmental
Entity in any jurisdiction outside the United States, no notices, reports or
other filings are required to be made by the Company with, nor are any
consents, registrations, approvals, permits or authorizations required to be
obtained by the Company from, any Governmental Entity in connection with the
execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company, the consummation by
CPI of the CPI Merger or the consummation by the Company of the Company
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, except those that the
failure to make or obtain are not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect or prevent,
materially delay or materially impair the ability of the Company to
consummate the Company Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.   (ii) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement
and the Memorandum of Understanding by the Company do not, and the
consummation by the Company of the Company Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby will not, constitute or result in (A) a breach or
violation of, or a default under, the certificate of incorporation or bylaws
of the Company or the comparable governing instruments of any of its
Subsidiaries, or (B) a breach or violation of, a default under, a termination
(or right of termination), amendment (or right of amendment), cancellation
(or right of cancellation) or acceleration of     -24-   any
obligations, or a loss of a material benefit under, or the creation of
a lien, liability, pledge, security interest, Claim or similar encumbrance on
or the loss of any assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (with
or without notice, lapse of time or both) pursuant to, any Contract binding
upon the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or, assuming compliance with the
DGCL and all Laws requiring the filings and or notices described in Section
5.1(d)(i), any Law (as defined in Section 5.2(j)) or governmental or non-
governmental permit, concession, franchise or license to which the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries is subject, except, in the case of clause (B) above,
for any breach, violation, default, termination (or right of termination),
amendment (or right of amendment), cancellation (or right of cancellation) or
acceleration, creation, change or loss that, individually or in the
aggregate, is not reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect.   (e) Company Contracts. Section 5.2(e) of the Company Disclosure
Letter lists (i) any Contracts (other than Contracts which constitute
Purchased Assets) the performance of which involves consideration in excess
of $1,500,000, (or that are otherwise material to the Company) other than
distribution, license, purchase or supply agreements entered into in the
ordinary course of business, consistent with past practice and contracts
included in the Assets Purchase (collectively, "Company Contracts") and (ii)
to the knowledge of the Company, no Company Contracts limit the freedom of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to engage in any line of business or
to compete with any Person beyond the term of such Company Contract. The
Company has made available to Parent a correct and complete copy of each
written Contract listed in Section 5.2(e) of the Company Disclosure Letter.
To the knowledge of the Company, each Contract listed in Section 5.2(e) of
the Company Disclosure Letter is a valid and binding agreement and is in full
force and effect.   (f) Company Reports; Financial Statements. (i) The
Company has delivered to Parent each registration statement, report, proxy

2000 (the "Audit Date"), including (A) the Company\'s Annual Report on Form
10-K for the year ended March 31, 2000, and (B) the Company\'s Quarterly
Reports on Form 10-Q for the periods ended December 31, 2000, each in the
form (including exhibits, annexes and any amendments thereto) filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC")    
-25-   (collectively, including any such reports filed subsequent to the
date hereof and as amended, the "Company Reports"). As of their respective
dates, (or, if amended, as of the date of such amendment) the Company Reports
did not, and any Company Reports filed with the SEC subsequent to the date
hereof will not, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state a material fact required to be stated or incorporated by reference
therein or necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in light
of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading. Each of the
consolidated balance sheets included in or incorporated by reference into the
Company Reports (including the related notes and schedules) fairly presents,
or (in the case of Company Reports filed after the date of this Agreement)
will fairly present, the consolidated financial position of the Company and
its Subsidiaries as of its date and each of the consolidated statements of
earnings, retained earnings and comprehensive earnings and consolidated
statements of cash flows and of changes in financial position included in or
incorporated by reference into the Company Reports (including any related
notes and schedules) fairly presents, or (in the case of Company Reports
filed after the date of this Agreement) will fairly present, the results of
operations, retained earnings and changes in financial position, as the case
may be, of the Company and its Subsidiaries for the periods set forth therein
(subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to notes and normal year-end
audit adjustments that will not be material in amount or effect), in each
case in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") con
sistently applied during the periods involved, except as may be
noted therein.   (ii) The combined balance sheet and combined statement of
earnings included in the audited pro forma statement of the Company and its
Subsidiaries (excluding the Business (as defined in the Asset Purchase
Agreement)) as of March 31, 2000, in each case including the notes and
schedules thereto, all included in Section 5.2(f) of the Company Disclosure
Letter (the "Audited Pro Forma Financial Statements") and the unaudited pro
forma combined balance sheet and combined statements of earnings of the
Company and its Subsidiaries (excluding the Business) as of the nine months
ended December 31, 2000, in each case including any notes and schedules
thereto, all included in Section 5.2(f) of the Company Disclosure Letter (the
"Interim Pro Forma Financial Statements") fairly present the combined
financial position of the Company and its Subsidiaries (excluding the    
-26-     Business) as of their respective dates and the balance sheet and
statement of earnings in the Audited Pro Forma Financial Statements fairly
present the results of operations (excluding the Business) for the periods
set forth therein, in each case in accordance with GAAP and the accounting
principles summarized therein, except as may be noted therein, and subject in
the case of the Interim Pro Forma Financial Statements to normal year-end
adjustments and the absence of footnotes and similar presentation items
therein.   (iii) Except as set forth in Section 5.2(d) of the Company
Disclosure Letter, Section 5.2(f) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth
(i) the outstanding amount of long term Indebtedness of the Company as of
December 31, 2000, and (ii) a list of the Contracts containing the terms of
such Indebtedness. "Indebtedness" shall mean, without duplication,(i) all
obligations for repayment of borrowed money, including guarantees of such
obligations, or for the deferred purchase or acquisition price of property or
services (excluding trade accounts payable and accrued liabilities which
arise in the ordinary course of business) which are, in accordance with GAAP,
includable as a liability on a consolidated balance sheet of the Company, and
(ii) all amounts representing the capitalization in accordance with GAAP of
rentals payable by the Company or a Subsidiary (other than pursuant to a
lease under which the Company or a Subsidiary is the lessor).   (g) Absence
of Certain Changes. Except for actions contemplated by this Agreement and
except as reflected, reserved or otherwise disclosed in the Audited Pro Forma
Financial Statements, the Interim Pro Forma Financial Statements and the
financial statements included in or incorporated by reference in the Company
Reports filed prior to the date hereof, since the Audit Date, the Company and
its Subsidiaries have conducted their respective businesses only in, and have
not engaged in any material transaction other than according to, the ordinary
and usual course of such businesses and there has not been (i) any change in
the financial condition, business or results of operations of the Company and
its Subsidiaries that, individually or in the aggregate, has had or is
reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect; (ii) any
action taken by the Company or its Subsidiaries during the period from the
Audit Date through the date of this Agreement, that would constitute a breach
of Sections 6.1(b)(iii)(A), 6.1(b)(iii)(D), 6.1(b)(iii)(E), 6.1(b)(iv),
6.1(b)(vi), 6.1(b)(viii)(A), 6.1(b)(ix), 6.1(b)(x),    
-27-    6.1(b)(xiii) and 6.21(b); or (iii) any action taken by the Company
or its Subsidiaries during the period from the Audit Date through the date of
this Agreement, making any tax election or permitting any insurance policy
naming it as a beneficiary or loss-payable payee to be canceled or
terminated, in each case, except in the ordinary and usual course of
business.   (h) Litigation and Liabilities. Except as reflected, reserved
or otherwise disclosed in the Audited Pro Forma Financial Statements, the
Interim Pro Forma Financial Statements and the financial statements included
in or incorporated by reference in the Company Reports filed prior to the
date hereof, there are no (i) Claims pending or threatened against the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (ii) Obligations relating to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries which would be required to be reflected,
reserved or otherwise disclosed in the financial statements of the Company
under GAAP if occurring on a date covered by such financial statements,
including those relating to matters involving any Environmental Law (as
defined in Section 5.2(l)), of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, except
for such Claims or Obligations that could have been incurred in accordance
with Section 6.1(b) had the provisions of such Section been applicable at
such time or as are not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably likely
to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries nor any of their respective properties is or are subject to any
order, writ, judgment, injunction, decree or award, which individually or in
the aggregate, is reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect.   (i) Employee Benefits.   (i) A true and correct copy of each
bonus, deferred compensation, pension, retirement, profit-sharing, thrift,
savings, employee stock ownership, stock bonus, stock purchase, restricted
stock, deferred stock, stock option, employment, termination, collective
bargaining, change-of-control, severance, compensation, medical, health or
other plan, agreement, policy or arrangement that covers current or former
employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries (the "Employees") or current or
former directors of the Company (the "Directors") (the "Compensation and
Benefit Plans") and any trust agreement, insurance contract or other funding
instrument forming a part of such Compensation and Benefit Plans has been
made     -28-     available to Parent prior to the date hereof other
than Compensation and Benefit Plans maintained in the United States that are
not material individually or in the aggregate, and Compensation and Benefit
Plans maintained outside of the United States that are not individually
material. With respect to each Compensation and Benefit Plan, the Company has
also made available to Parent prior to the date hereof, if applicable, (i)
any summary plan description and other written communications (or a
description of any oral communications) by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to their employees concerning the extent of the benefits
provided under a Compensation and Benefit Plan, other than such written or
oral communications that do not alter the terms of the plan and (ii) for the
two most recent years (A) the Form 5500 and attached schedules, (B) audited
financial statements and (C) actuarial valuation reports. The Compensation
and Benefit Plans are listed in Section 5.2(i) of the Company Disclosure
Letter, other than those Compensation and Benefit Plans maintained in the
United States that are not material individually or in the aggregate
and Compensation and Benefit Plans maintained outside of the United States
that are not individually material.   (ii) Each Compensation and Benefit
Plan has been established and administered substantially in accordance with
its terms, and is in compliance in all material respects with applicable
provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended
("ERISA"), and other applicable Laws. Each Compensation and Benefit Plan that
is an "employee pension benefit plan" within the meaning of Section 3(2) of
ERISA and that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code
(a "Pension Plan") has received a favorable determination letter from the
Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS"), and neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries is aware of any circumstances likely to result in revocation of
any such favorable determination letter. As of the date hereof, there is no
pending or, to the knowledge of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
threatened, material litigation, administrative investigation, auditor
proceeding or claim (other than routine claims for benefits in the ordinary
course) relating to the Compensation and Benefit Plans. Neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in a transaction with respect to any
Compensation and Benefit Plan that, assuming the taxable period of
such transaction expired as of the date hereof, would subject the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries to a material tax or    -29-    penalty
imposed by either Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502 of ERISA.   (iii)
As of the date hereof, no liability under Subtitle C or D of Title IV of
ERISA has been or is expected to be incurred by the Company or any Subsidiary
with respect to any ongoing, frozen or terminated "single-employer plan",
within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(15) of ERISA, currently or
formerly maintained by any of them, or the single-employer plan of any entity
which is considered one employer with the Company under Section 4001 of ERISA
or Section 414 of the Code (an "ERISA Affiliate"). The Company and its
Subsidiaries have not incurred and do not expect to incur any withdrawal
liability with respect to a multiemployer plan under Subtitle E to Title IV
of ERISA, and no such multiemployer plan is in reorganization or insolvent
(as those terms are defined in ERISA Sections 4241 and 4245, respectively).
No notice of a "reportable event", within the meaning of Section 4043 of
ERISA for which the 30-day reporting requirement has not been waived, has
been required to be filed for any Pension Plan or by any ERISA Affiliate
within the 24-month period ending on the date hereof.   (iv) All
contributions required to be made under the terms of any Compensation and
Benefit Plan as of the date hereof have been timely made or have been
reflected on the most recent consolidated balance sheet filed or incorporated
by reference in the Company Reports prior to the date hereof. Neither any
Pension Plan nor any single-employer plan of an ERISA Affiliate has an
"accumulated funding deficiency" (whether or not waived) within the
meaning of Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA.   (v) Under
each Pension Plan which is a single-employer plan, as of the last day of the
most recent plan year ended prior to the date hereof, the actuarially deter
mined present value of all "benefit liabilities", within the meaning of
Section 4001(a)(16) of ERISA (as determined on the basis of the actuarial
assumptions contained in the Pension Plan\'s most recent
actuarial valuation), did not exceed the then current value of the assets of
such Pension Plan.   (vi) Neither the Company nor its Subsidiaries have any
obligations for retiree health and life benefits under any Compensation and
Benefit Plan.     -30-      (vii) Neither the execution of this
Agreement or the Asset Purchase Agreement nor the consummation of the Assets
Purchase, the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Asset Purchase Agreement will(x) entitle any Employees or
Directors of the Company or its Subsidiaries to severance pay, (y) accelerate
the time of payment or vesting or trigger any payment of compensation or
benefits under, increase the amount payable or trigger any other material
obligation pursuant to, any of the Compensation and Benefit Plans or (z)
result in any breach or violation of, or a default under, any of the
Compensation and Benefit Plans.   (viii) No event has occurred and no
condition exists that would subject the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
either directly or by reason of their affiliation with any ERISA Affiliate,
to any material tax, fine, lien, penalty or other liability imposed by ERISA,
the Code or other applicable Laws, rules and regulations, except for such
liabilities which, individually or in the aggregate, are not reasonably
likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.   (ix) All employee
benefit plans maintained outside of the United States comply in all respects
with applicable local law except for such failures to comply as would not,
individually or in the aggregate, result in a Company Material Adverse
Effect.   (j) Compliance with Laws; Permits. (i) The businesses of each of
the Company and its Subsidiaries have not been, and are not being, conducted
in violation of any federal, state, local or foreign law, statute, ordinance,
rule, regulation, judgment, order, injunction, decree, Claim award,
settlement or stipulation, agency requirement, license or permit of any
Governmental Entity (collectively, "Laws"), except for violations that,
individually or in the aggregate, are not reasonably likely to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect. The Company and its Subsidiaries have not received
any notices of violations with respect to any Laws, except for violations
which, individually or in the aggregate, are not be reasonably likely to have
a Company Material Adverse Effect.   (ii) Each product (other than products
included in the Assets Purchase) subject to the jurisdiction of the Food and
Drug Administration under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, as amended
(the "FDCA") or the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, as amended (the "PDMA")
or subject to     -31-     the jurisdiction of the Drug Enforcement
Agency under the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970,
as amended (the "CSA") which is manufactured, tested, distributed, held
and/or marketed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is being
manufactured, held and distributed in compliance with all applicable
requirements under the FDCA, the PDMA and the CSA including, but not limited
to, those relating to investigational use, premarket clearance,
good manufacturing practices, labeling, promotion and advertising, record
keeping, filing of reports and security, sampling, distributing, importing or
exporting, except for such failures so to comply that, individually or in the
aggregate, are not reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect.   (k) Takeover Statutes. No "fair price", "moratorium", "control
share acquisition" or other similar antitakeover statute or regulation
(including, without limitation, Section 203 of the DGCL) (each, a "Takeover
Statute") is, or at the CPI Merger Effective Time or Company Merger Effective
Time will be, applicable to CPI, the Company, the CPI Shares, the Company
Shares, the Assets Purchase, the Mergers or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or the Asset Purchase Agreement. Assuming the
accuracy of Parent\'s representations and warranties contained in Section
5.3(d) (Ownership of Shares), the Board of Directors of the Company has taken
all action so that Parent will not be prohibited from entering into a
"business combination" with the Company as an "interested stockholder" (in
each case as such term is used in Section 203 of the DGCL) as a result of the
execution of this Agreement, the Asset Purchase Agreement or the consummation
of the Assets Purchase or the Mergers.   (l) Environmental Matters. Except
for such matters as are not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, the Company and its
Subsidiaries, the properties currently owned, leased or operated by the
Company and its Subsidiaries and the properties and facilities currently or
formerly owned, leased or operated by the Company and its Subsidiaries:  
(i) are, and at all previous times have been, in compliance with
all applicable Environmental Laws;   (ii) are not the subject of any
pending Claim or written notice alleging the violation of any, or
liability     -32-     under, applicable Environmental Laws and no
such notice is threatened;   (iii) are not currently subject to any order,
settlement, judgment or decree arising under or relating to any Environmental
Law;   (iv) have not had any air emissions or wastewater discharges
of Hazardous Substances except as permitted under applicable Environmental
Laws; and   (v) Hazardous Substances have not been generated,
transported, treated, stored, disposed of, arranged to be disposed of,
released or threatened to be released at, on, from or under any of the
properties, assets or facilities currently owned, leased or operated or
formerly owned, leased or operated by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
in violation of, or in a manner or to a location that has resulted, or to the
knowledge of the Company would be reasonably expected to result, in liability
under or related to, any Environmental Laws.   As used in this Agreement,
the term (i) "Environmental Law" means any applicable Law, regulation, code,
license, permit, order, decree or injunction (A) governing the protection of
the environment, (including air, water, soil and natural resources) or as
relating to exposure to Hazardous Substances, human health or (B) the use,
storage, handling, release or disposal of Hazardous Substances and (ii)
"Hazardous Substance" means any substance presently listed, defined,
designated or classified as hazardous, toxic or radioactive under
any applicable Environmental Law and any other material or substance that
is regulated, or that could reasonably be expected to result in liability,
under any Environmental Law including petroleum and any derivative or by-
products thereof, asbestos and asbestos containing materials and
polychlorinated biphenyls.   (m) Taxes. The Company and each of its
Subsidiaries (i) have prepared in good faith and duly and timely filed
(taking into account any extension of time within which to file) all Tax
Returns required to be filed by any of them and all such Tax Returns are
complete and correct in all material respects; (ii) have paid all Taxes that
are shown as due on such Tax Returns, except with respect to matters
contested in good faith; and (iii) have not waived any statute of limitations
with respect to Taxes     -33-     or agreed to any extension of time
with respect to a Tax assessment or deficiency. As of the date hereof, there
are not pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened in writing,
any audits, examinations, investigations or other proceedings in respect of
Taxes or Tax matters. Except as are not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, the Company has
not (i) filed a consent under Section 341(f) of the Code or analogous
provision of state, local or foreign law; (ii) been a member of an affiliated
group of corporations filing a consolidated United States federal Tax Return
(other than a group the common parent of which was the Company), nor has any
liability for the Taxes of another person (other than Subsidiaries of the
Company which are members of an affiliated group of corporations filing a
consolidated United States federal Tax Return the common parent of which is
the Company), including liability arising from the application of Treasury
Regulation ss. 1.1502-6 or any analogous provision of state, local or foreign
law, or as a transferee or successor, by contract or otherwise; (iii) entered
into a closing agreement pursuant to Section 7121 of the Code or similar
provision for purposes of state, local or foreign taxes relating to Taxes due
from the Company. The Company has never been a "United States real property
holding corporation" within the meaning of Section 897 of the Code. There are
no liens or encumbrances for Taxes on any of the assets of the Company,
except for (i) statutory liens for Taxes not yet due or payable, (ii) liens
for Taxes that are being contested in good faith which such contest is
disclosed in Section 5.2(m) of the Company Disclosure Letter, and (iii)
any other liens for Taxes that are not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably likely have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company has
withheld all Taxes required to have been withheld and paid in connection with
amounts paid or owing to any employee, independent contractor, creditor,
stockholder or other third party. The Company has delivered to Parent true,
correct and complete copies of all federal Tax Returns for all open Tax
years, examination reports and statements of deficiencies. The Company and
its Subsidiaries have disclosed on its federal income Tax Return all
positions taken therein that could give rise to a substantial understatement
of federal income Tax within the meaning of Section 6662 of the Code. The
unpaid Taxes of the Company did not, as of December 31, 2000 exceed the
reserve for Tax liability (other than any reserves for deferred Taxes
established for timing differences between book and Tax income) set forth on
the Interim Pro Forma Financial     -34-     Statements and will not,
as of the Closing Date, exceed that reserve as adjusted for the passage of
time through the Closing Date consistent with past practice of the Company in
filing its Tax Returns. Sofibel S.A.R.L. ("Sofibel") is, and has been since
its formation, a corporation for United States federal income
tax purposes.    (n) Labor Matters. As of the date hereof, neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is the subject of any material proceeding
asserting that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has committed an unfair
labor practice or seeking to compel it to bargain with any labor union or
labor organization, nor is there pending or, to the knowledge of the Company,
threatened, nor has there been for the past five years, any labor strike,
dispute, walk-out, work stoppage, slow-down or lockout involving the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries. No action, suit complaint, charge, arbitration,
inquiry, proceeding or investigation by or before any court, governmental
agency, administrative agency or commission brought by or on behalf of any
employee, prospective employee, former employee, retiree, labor organization
or other representative of the employees is pending or, to the knowledge of
the Company, threatened against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that
is reasonably likely to be adversely decided and if so adversely decided,
individually or in the aggregate, is reasonably likely to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect. As of the date hereof, the Company and its
Subsidiaries are in compliance with all obligations pursuant to the Worker
Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 1988 ("WARN") and all other
notification and bargaining obligations arising under any collective
bargaining agreement, statute or otherwise, except as are not, individually
or in the aggregate, reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall, at any time
within the sixty (60) day period prior to the Closing Date, effectuate
a "plant closing" or "mass layoff," as those terms are defined in WARN or
any state or local law, affecting in whole or in part any site of
employment, facility, operating unit or employee.   (o) Insurance. All
material fire and casualty, general liability, business interruption, product
liability, and sprinkler and water damage insurance policies maintained by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries are in full force and effect, and the
Company and its Subsidiaries are not in     -35-     material default
thereunder except for any such failures to maintain insurance policies or
defaults thereunder that, individually or in the aggregate, are
not reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.   (p)
Intellectual Property.   (i) The Company and/or each of its Subsidiaries
owns, or is licensed or otherwise possesses rights to use all patents,
inventions, discoveries, formulae, processes, domain names, trademarks, trade
names, service marks, copyrights, works of authorship, technology, know-how,
computer software programs, computer applications and trade secrets and all
other intellectual property ("IP") that are owned or used in the business of
the Company and its Subsidiaries as currently conducted (after giving effect
to the Assets Purchase and the other transactions contemplated by the Asset
Purchase Agreement), (collectively "Company IP") except for any such failures
to own, be licensed or possess as are not reasonably likely, individually or
in the aggregate, to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.   (ii) Except
for such matters not reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect:   (A) neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is, nor will
it be  as a result of the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the 
performance of its obligations hereunder, in violation of any licenses, 
sublicenses and other agreements used in the business of the Company and  its
Subsidiaries as currently conducted (other than any licenses,  sublicenses or
other agreements relating to the Purchased Assets) as to  which it is a party
and pursuant to which it is authorized to use any IP  owned by a third party
(collectively, "Third-Party IP");   (B) no Claims with respect to any
Company IP (other than claims  relating to intellectual property rights held
or used in connection with  the Purchased Assets) are currently pending or,
to the knowledge of the  Company, are threatened by any Person;   (C) to
the knowledge of the Company, there is no impairment, dilution  or other
violation or misuse, unauthorized use, infringement or  misappropriation of
any of the Company IP by any third party, or by the    -36-     
Company of any Third-Party IP used in the business as currently conducted;  
(D) the Company and its Subsidiaries have taken commercially  reasonable
steps to protect, maintain and safeguard the confidentiality of  any Company
IP as used in the business as currently conducted, the value of  which relies
upon the maintenance of confidentiality;   (E) the Company IP, together with
the IP licensed to the Company  pursuant to the Ancillary Agreements,
constitute all the IP used in the  business of the Company as currently
conducted; and   (F) to the knowledge of the Company, all Company IP is
valid and  subsisting.   (q) Brokers and Finders. Neither the Company, CPI
nor any of their respective subsidiaries has employed any broker or finder or
incurred any liability for any brokerage fees, commissions or finders fees in
connection with Mergers, the Assets Purchase or the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement or the Asset Purchase Agreement, except that the Company
has employed (i) J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. as its financial advisor, whose
fees will be paid by the Company in accordance with the arrangements with
J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., which arrangements have been disclosed in
writing to Parent prior to the date hereof, (ii) the Company has employed
Houlihan Lokey Howard and Zukin, Inc. as its financial advisor, whose fees will
be paid by the Company in accordance with the arrangements with Houlihan
Lokey Howard and Zukin, Inc. which arrangements have been disclosed in writing
to Parent prior to the date hereof and (iii) CPI has employed an appraiser to
advise CPI with respect to the Recapitalization, whose fees will be paid as

Company Disclosure Letter lists all of the real property of the Company or
its Subsidiaries other than the real property transferred pursuant to the
Assets Purchase. Section 5.2(r) of the Company Disclosure Letter also lists
all real property owned, leased or operated by the Company or its
Subsidiaries and disposed of during the 20 years prior to the date of this
Agreement. Except as set forth in Section 5.2(r) of the Company Disclosure
Letter and other than with respect to disposed property, the Company has
good, valid and marketable title to, or a valid leasehold interest in,    
-37-     all of its properties or assets except for defects in title,
easements, restrictive covenants and similar encumbrances or impediments that
would not, individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably likely to result
in a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company will use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain all consents necessary to transfer the currently
leased real property set forth in Section 5.2(r) of the Company Disclosure
Letter in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
the Asset Purchase Agreement.    5.3. Representations and Warranties of
Parent, CPI Merger Sub and Company Merger Sub. Parent, CPI Merger Sub and
Company Merger Sub hereby represent and warrant to CPI and the Company
that:   (a) Organization, Good Standing and Qualification. (i) Each of

organization and has all requisite corporate or similar power and authority
to own, lease and operate its properties and assets and to carry on its
business as presently conducted and is duly qualified to do business and is
in good standing as a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction where the
ownership, the leasing or operation of its properties or conduct of its
business requires such quali- fication, except where the failure to be so
qualified or in good standing is not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably likely to prevent or impair the ability of Parent, CPI Merger Sub
or Company Merger Sub to consummate the Mergers or affect the validity of
either Merger.   (ii) Each of Parent, Company Merger Sub and CPI Merger Sub
was formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the transactions
contemplated hereby and has not carried on any activities to date other than
those incident to its formation and the consummation of this Agreement.

hereby. Parent, CPI Merger Sub and Company Merger Sub each has the requisite
corporate power and authority and has taken all corporate action necessary in
order to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under this Agreement
and the Memorandum of     -38-     Understanding and to consummate
the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated hereby and no other
corporate proceedings on the part of Parent, CPI Merger Sub and Company
Merger Sub are necessary to authorize this Agreement and the Memorandum of
Understanding or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. This
Agreement has been duly adopted by the sole stockholder of CPI Merger Sub and

case in accordance with applicable Law and the applicable certificate of
incorporation and bylaws of such corporations. Each of this Agreement and the

inquiries or the making of any proposal or offer with respect to a merger,
reorganization, share exchange, consolidation, purchase, or similar
transaction involving (A) more than 15% of the consolidated assets of the
Company primarily related to the Business (a "Consumer Products Acquisition
Proposal"); (B) more than 15% of the consolidated assets of the Company other
than assets primarily related to the Business (such assets, the "Healthcare
Business" and such a proposal, a "Healthcare Acquisition Proposal"); or (C)
more than 15% of the outstanding equity securities of the Company or
more than 15% of each of the consolidated assets related to the Business and
the consolidated assets related to the Healthcare Business (a "Company
Acquisition Proposal", any Consumer Products Acquisition Proposal, Healthcare
Acquisition Proposal or Company Acquisition Proposal being referred to as an
"Acquisition Proposal"); (ii) engage in any negotiations concerning, or
provide any confidential information or data to, or have any substantive
discussions with, any Person relating to an Acquisition Proposal, or
otherwise facilitate any effort or attempt to make or implement an
Acquisition Proposal (including by entering into any letter of intent or
similar document or any contract, agreement or commitment with any Person
making such an Acquisition Proposal) or (iii) approve, endorse or recommend
any Acquisition Proposal; provided, however, that, prior to the due adoption
of this Agreement by holders of Company Shares constituting the Company
Requisite Vote, nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent the
Company, its directors, officers, agents or other representatives from (A)
complying with its disclosure obligations under federal or state law; (B)
providing information in response to a request therefor by a Person who has
made an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal if the Board of
Directors receives from the Person so requesting such information an executed
confidentiality agreement on terms substantially similar to those contained
in the Confidentiality Agreement (as defined in Section 9.7), it
being understood that such confidentiality     -48-     agreement
will not prohibit the making of an Acquisition Proposal; (C) engaging in any
negotiations or discussions with any Person who has made an unsolicited bona
fide written Acquisition Proposal or entering into an agreement with
such Person solely with respect to the payment by such Person of amounts
payable to Parent pursuant to Section 8.5(b) hereof or to Assets Buyer
pursuant to Section 11.5(b) of the Asset Purchase Agreement; or (D)
approving, endorsing or recommending such an Acquisition Proposal to the
stockholders of the Company (which, in the case of a Healthcare Acquisition
Proposal or Company Acquisition Proposal, shall be deemed to be a withdrawal
or modification of the recommendation of this Agreement by the Board of
Directors of the Company) or, following the termination of the Asset Purchase
Agreement pursuant to Section 11.3(a) thereof, entering into an agreement
with a Person who has made an unsolicited bona fide written Consumer Products
Acquisition Proposal with respect to such Consumer Products Acquisition
Proposal, if and only to the extent that, (i) in each such case referred to
in clause (B), (C) or (D) above, the Board of Directors of the Company
determines in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel) that
failure to take such action would, in light of such Acquisition Proposal and
the terms of this Agreement, be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the
directors under applicable Law and (ii) (x) in the case of clauses (B) and
(C) above, the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith
(after consultation with its financial advisor) that taking the actions
permitted pursuant to such clauses with respect to such Acquisition Proposal
could reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal, assuming such
Acquisition Proposal is consummated and (y) in the case referred to in clause
(D) above, the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith
(after consultation with its financial advisor) that such Acquisition
Proposal is a Superior Proposal. A Consumer Products Acquisition Proposal is
a "Superior Proposal" if (i) the transaction (or series of transactions)
pursuant to such Acquisition Proposal involves the direct or indirect (by
stock acquisition or otherwise) acquisition by a third party of all or
substantially all of the consolidated assets of the Company primarily
related to the Business and (ii) the consummation of such transaction (or
series of transactions) pursuant to such Acquisition Proposal, together with
the consummation of the Mergers pursuant hereto, will be more favorable to
the Company\'s stockholders from a financial point of view than the Assets
Purchase, taken together with such Mergers and, for purposes    
-49-   of the determination to be made in clause (D) above, in the good
faith judgment of the Board of Directors of the Company, it is reasonably
likely to be financed by such third party. A Healthcare Acquisition Proposal
is a "Superior Proposal" if (i) the transaction (or series of transactions)
pursuant to such Acquisition Proposal involves the direct or indirect (by
merger, stock acquisition or otherwise) acquisition by a third party of the
Healthcare Business and (ii) the consummation of such transaction (or series
of transactions) pursuant to such Acquisition Proposal, together with the
consummation of the Assets Purchase and the other transactions contemplated
by the Asset Purchase Agreement, will be more favorable to the Company\'s
stockholders from a financial point of view than the Mergers, taken together
with the Assets Purchase and such other transactions and, for purposes of the
determination to be made in clause (D) above, in the good faith judgment of
the Board of Directors of the Company, it is reasonably likely to be financed
by such third party. A Company Acquisition Proposal is a "Superior Proposal"
if (i) the transaction (or series of transactions) pursuant to such
Acquisition Proposal involves a third party unaffiliated with CPI acquiring,
directly or indirectly, not less than a majority of the outstanding Company
Shares (by merger, stock acquisition or otherwise) or acquiring, directly or
indirectly, all or substantially all of the consolidated assets of the
Company, (ii) such transaction (or series of transactions) is
reasonably likely to be consummated and (iii) the consummation of such
transaction (or series of transactions) pursuant to such Acquisition Proposal
will be more favorable to the Company\'s stockholders from a financial point
of view than the combined effect of the Assets Purchase and the Mergers. The
Company agrees that it will immediately cease and cause to be terminated any
existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any parties conducted
heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposals. The Company agrees that
it will notify Parent immediately if any such inquiries, proposals or offers
are received by, any such information is requested from, or any such
discussions or negotiations are sought to be initiated or continued with, any
of its representatives.   (b) In the event the Company terminates the Asset
Purchase Agreement pursuant to Section 11.3 thereof in order to enter into an
agreement with respect to a Consumer Products Acquisition Proposal that
constitutes a Superior Proposal, Parent, Company Merger Sub and CPI Merger
Sub shall be required to accept (i) the buyer of the Business    
-50-     pursuant to such agreements as a replacement "Assets Buyer" (the
"Substitute Assets Buyer") for purposes hereof and (ii) such agreement as a
replacement "Asset Purchase Agreement" (such agreement and any related
agreements, collectively, the "Substitute APA") for purposes hereof if such
Substitute Assets Buyer and Substitute APA would not, in the good faith
judgment of Parent (as compared with the Asset Purchase Agreement and the
agreements entered into in connection therewith) materially and adversely
affect either Parent\'s rights or obligations hereunder and under the
agreements executed and delivered in connection herewith (including the
voting agreement with CPI and the indemnification agreement and voting
agreement with certain stockholders of CPI) or the Company\'s rights or
obligations hereunder (provided that any term or provision of the Substitute
APA that creates liabilities or obligations on the part of the Company that
will be discharged or satisfied prior to the Closing or will be an Assumed
Liability (as defined in the Asset Purchase Agreement) under the Asset
Purchase Agreement will not, for purposes of the foregoing, be deemed to
materially and adversely affect the Company\'s rights or
obligations hereunder), taking into account all relevant factors, including
the terms and conditions of the Substitute APA and the financial position of
the Substitute Assets Buyer. If the Company should notify Parent that it
intends, subject to not receiving a Section 6.2(b) Notice (as hereinafter
defined), to terminate the Asset Purchase Agreement pursuant to Section
11.3(a) thereof in order to enter into a Substitute APA pursuant to Section
11.3(a) and, prior to, or at the time of delivery of such notice, provides
Parent with a draft of such Substitute APA, Parent will notify the Company
(the "Section 6.2(b) Notice") within three business days of such notice (not
counting the day of receipt) whether, in the exercise of its good faith
judgment, such Substitute APA with the Substitute Assets Buyer would have any
of the material adverse effects described above. If Parent does not provide a
Section 6.2(b) Notice within such three-day period, Parent shall be deemed to
accept the Substitute Assets Buyer and the Substitute APA. For purposes of
this Agreement, upon execution and delivery by the Company of the Substitute
APA, all references herein to the "Assets Purchase" and the "Asset Purchase
Agreement" shall become references to such Substitute APA. It is further
agreed that the giving by the Company to Assets Buyer of the notice that it
intends to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.3(a) in order
to enter into a Substitute Merger Agreement (as defined in the Asset
Purchase Agreement) and the drafts, documents and    
-51-   information contemplated by Section 8.11(c) of the Asset Purchase
Agreement shall not, in and of itself, provide Parent a right to terminate
under Section 8.4 of this Agreement.   6.3. Stockholder Approvals. (a) (i)
Subject to fiduciary obligations under applicable Law, the Board of Directors
of the Company shall recommend approval of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement to the holders of Company Shares and (ii) the Company will
take, in accordance with applicable Law and its certificate of incorporation
and bylaws, all actions necessary to convene a meeting of stockholders to
vote on the Company Merger as promptly as practicable.   (b) CPI will take,
in accordance with applicable Law, its certificate of incorporation and
bylaws, all actions necessary to convene a meeting of stockholders (to be
held or taken prior to the time of the meeting of stockholders of the Company
referred to in Section 6.3(a)) to vote on (or to take action by written
consent approving) the CPI Merger and the Recapitalization Amendment as
promptly as practicable.   6.4. Proxy Statement. The Company shall prepare
and file with the SEC a proxy or consent statement with respect to the
solicitation of consents or proxies relating to the Mergers and the Assets
Purchase (the "Proxy Statement") as promptly as practicable and promptly
thereafter mail the Proxy Statement to the holders of Company Shares. CPI,
the Company and Parent each agrees, as to itself and its Subsidiaries, that
none of the information supplied or to be supplied by it or its Subsidiaries
for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Company\'s Proxy Statement
and any amendment or supplement thereto will, at the date of mailing to
stockholders and at the time of the Company Requisite Vote, contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading.   6.5. Filings; Other Actions; Notification.   (a) CPI, the
Company and Parent shall cooperate with each other and shall use their
respective reasonable best efforts to take or cause to be taken all
appropriate actions, and do or cause to be done all things, necessary,   
-52-     proper or advisable on its part under this Agreement and
applicable Laws to consummate and make effective the Mergers and the Assets
Purchase as promptly as practicable, including preparing and filing as
promptly as practicable all documentation to effect all necessary notices,
reports and other filings and to obtain as promptly as practicable all
consents, registrations, approvals, permits and authorizations necessary or
advisable to be obtained from any third party and/or any Governmental Entity
in order to consummate the Mergers. Subject to applicable Laws and the terms
of any relevant agreements with third parties relating to the exchange of
information, Parent and the Company shall have the right to review in
advance, and to the extent practicable each will consult the other on, all
the information relating to Parent, CPI or the Company, as the case may be,
and any of their respective Subsidiaries, that appear in any filing made
with, or written materials submitted to, any third party and/or
any Governmental Entity in connection with the Mergers and the Assets
Purchase. In exercising the foregoing right, each of CPI, the Company and
Parent shall act reasonably and as promptly as practicable.   (b) CPI, the
Company and Parent, CPI Merger Sub and Company Merger Sub each shall, upon
request by the other, furnish the other with all information concerning
itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers and stockholders and such other
matters as may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with the
Proxy Statement, or any other statement, filing, notice or application made
by or on behalf of Parent, CPI, the Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries to any third party and/or any Governmental Entity in
connection with the Mergers.   (c) CPI, the Company and Parent, CPI Merger
Sub and Company Merger Sub each shall keep the other apprised of the status
of matters relating to completion of the transactions contemplated hereby,
including promptly furnishing the other with copies of notice or other
communications received by Parent, CPI or the Company, as the case may be, or
any of their respective Subsidiaries, from any third party and/or any
Governmental Entity with respect to the Mergers and the Assets Purchase (to
the extent such notice would have any material effect on Parent); provided,
however, that in respect of any communication to or from any Governmental
Entities relating to the Mergers, each Party shall afford the other Party
with advance notice of, and a meaningful opportunity to    
-53-     participate in, any such communications, including, without
limitation, a right to attend, with advisors present, any meetings
(telephonic or in person) with such Governmental Entities.   (d) Without
limiting the generality of the undertakings pursuant to this Section 6.5, the
Company (in the case of clauses (i) and (iii)) and Parent, CPI Merger Sub and
Company Merger Sub (in all cases set forth below) agree to take or cause to
be taken the following actions: (i) provide promptly to any and all federal,
state, local or foreign courts or Governmental Entities with jurisdiction
over enforcement of any applicable antitrust laws (each, a "Government
Antitrust Entity") information and documents requested by any Government
Antitrust Entity or necessary, proper or advisable to permit consummation of
the Mergers; (ii) the proffer by Parent of its willingness to sell or
otherwise dispose of, or hold separate and agree to sell or otherwise dispose
of, such assets, categories of assets or businesses of the Company or Parent
or either\'s respective Subsidiaries (and to enter into agreements with the
relevant Government Antitrust Entity giving effect thereto) no later than
90 days from the date of this Agreement if such action should be
reasonably necessary or advisable to avoid the commencement of a proceeding
to delay, restrain, enjoin or otherwise prohibit consummation of the Mergers
by any Government Antitrust Entity; and (iii) take promptly, in the event
that any permanent or preliminary injunction or other order is entered or
becomes reasonably foreseeable to be entered in any proceeding that would
make consummation of the Mergers in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement unlawful or that would prevent or delay consummation of the
Mergers, any and all reasonable steps (including the appeal thereof, the
posting of a bond or the taking of the steps contemplated by clause (ii) of
this paragraph) necessary to vacate, modify or suspend such injunction or
order so as to permit such consummation on a schedule as close as possible to
that contemplated by this Agreement.   (e) Without limiting the generality
of Section 6.5(a), the Company agrees to provide, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and their
respective officers, employees and advisors, including KPMG, to provide,
reasonable assistance to Parent in connection with the completion of the Debt
Financing contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letter to be consummated
contemporaneously with or at or after the Closing in respect of the
transactions contemplated in this     -54-   Agreement; provided,
however, that the foregoing does not require the executive officers of the
Company to travel outside New York City.   (f) Without limiting the
generality of Section 6.5(a), Parent hereby agrees to use its reasonable best
efforts to enter into definitive documentation with respect to the Debt
Financing as provided for in the Debt Commitment Letter on substantially the
same terms reflected in the Debt Commitment Letter, including using its
reasonable best efforts to satisfy all conditions applicable to Parent in
such definitive agreements. Parent hereby further agrees to use
its reasonable best efforts to negotiate substantially complete forms
(subject to customary review and comment by the banks in the syndicate group)
of definitive agreements with respect thereto prior to the mailing of the
Proxy Statement (although signing may be delayed until a later date). Parent
will keep the Company informed on a regular ongoing basis of the status of
the efforts to obtain such Debt Financing. In the event any portion of such
Debt Financing becomes unavailable in the manner or from the sources
originally contemplated, Parent will use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain any such portion from alternative sources on substantially comparable
terms, if available, or if not substantially comparable, on terms and
conditions reasonably satisfactory to Parent.   6.6. Access. Upon
reasonable notice, and except as may otherwise be required by applicable Law
or the terms of any relevant agreements with third parties, CPI and the
Company shall (and the Company shall cause its Subsidiaries to) afford
Parent\'s officers, employees, counsel, accountants and other authorized
representatives ("Representatives") reasonable access, during normal business
hours throughout the period prior to the Company Merger Effective Time, to
their respective properties, books, Contracts and records, management
and other employees and, during such period, the Company shall (and shall
cause its Subsidiaries to) furnish promptly Parent with all information
concerning its business, properties and personnel as Parent or its
Representatives may reasonably request, provided that no investigation
pursuant to this Section shall affect or be deemed to modify any
representation or warranty made by CPI or the Company and provided, further,
that the foregoing shall not require CPI or the Company to permit any
inspection, or to disclose any information, in the reasonable judgment of CPI
or the Company, as the case may be, would result in the disclosure    
-55-   of any trade secrets of third parties or violate any obligation of
CPI or the Company with respect to confidentiality if CPI or the Company, as
the case may be, shall have used reasonable efforts to obtain the consent of
such third party to such inspection or disclosure. All requests for
information made pursuant to this Section shall be directed to an executive
officer of CPI or the Company, as the case may be, or such Person as may be
designated by any such officer. All such information shall be governed by the
terms of the Confidentiality Agreement (as defined in Section 9.7).   6.7.
Stock Exchange De-listing. The Surviving Company shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause the Company Shares to be de-listed from the New York
Stock Exchange and de-registered under the Exchange Act as soon
as practicable following the Company Merger Effective Time.   6.8. Assets
Purchase.   (a) The Company shall not (i) amend or modify the Asset
Purchase Agreement as in effect on the date hereof or the Ancillary
Agreements or grant any waiver with respect to the Asset Purchase Agreement
or the Ancillary Agreements in a manner that materially and adversely affects
either Parent\'s rights or obligations hereunder or under the Ancillary
Agreements or the Company\'s rights or obligations thereunder or under the
Ancillary Agreements (provided that an amendment or modification to the Asset
Purchase Agreement that creates liabilities or obligations on the part of the
Company that will be discharged or satisfied prior to Closing or will be an
Assumed Liability under the Asset Purchase Agreement will not be deemed to
materially and adversely affect the rights or obligations of the Company)
(ii) terminate the Asset Purchase Agreement pursuant to Section 11.1 without
the prior consent of Parent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned in the case of clause (ii) or (iii) terminate the
Asset Purchase Agreement to accept a Consumer Products Acquisition Proposal
unless such proposal is with a Substitute Assets Buyer that constitutes a
Substitute APA.   (b) Parent, CPI Merger Sub and Company Merger Sub will
cooperate with the Company in causing the Closing contemplated by the Asset
Purchase Agreement and the Closing contemplated by this Agreement to occur
and be effected on the same date and the Closing contemplated by this
Agreement to immediately follow the Closing contemplated by the Asset    
-56-     Purchase Agreement; it being understood and agreed that the
Asset Purchase Agreement will not be consummated until all conditions to
Closing in the Asset Purchase Agreement and this Agreement and the conditions
to the extension of financing by all respective financing sources (both
equity and debt) have been satisfied or waived and the parties to such
agreements and their respective financing sources (both equity and debt) have
entered into an appropriate agreement satisfactory to the Company (the
"Closing Agreement") to such effect, and Parent, CPI Merger Sub and Company
Merger Sub agree that once the Closing contemplated by the Asset Purchase
Agreement is consummated in accordance with the terms thereof and in
accordance with this Section 6.8(b), all conditions to Closing under this
Agreement shall irrevocably be deemed satisfied or waived.   (c) Parent and
its affiliates shall not directly or indirectly (through affiliates or
otherwise), individually or as a group, enter into any agreement or other
arrangement with any party to the Asset Purchase Agreement that would
obligate any party to the Asset Purchase Agreement to refuse or otherwise
fail to cooperate with the Company and its representatives or obligate any
party to the Asset Purchase Agreement to oppose or otherwise act to
thwart the Company\'s efforts to (i) negotiate with respect to a Healthcare
Acquisition Proposal or (ii) enter into a Healthcare Acquisition Proposal
that is a Superior Proposal.   6.9. Publicity. The initial press release
concerning this Agreement and the Mergers shall be a press release, approved
in advance by the Company and Parent, and thereafter the Company and Parent
each shall consult with each other prior to issuing any press releases or
otherwise making public announcements with respect to the Mergers and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and prior to making any
filings with any third party and/or any Governmental Entity (including any
national securities exchange or interdealer quotation service) with respect
thereto, except as may be required by Laws or by obligations pursuant to any
listing agreement with or rules of any national securities exchange or
interdealer quotation service on which the securities of the Company or
Parent are listed or quoted in which case the party required to make the
release shall use reasonable efforts to allow the other party reasonable time
(recognizing the disclosure obligation imposed by federal securities laws) to
comment on such release in advance of such issuance, it being
understood     -57-   that the final form and content of any such
release, to the extent so required, shall be at the final discretion of the
disclosing party.   6.10. Benefits.   (a) Stock Options.   As soon as
practicable after the date hereof, the Company (or the appropriate
administrative body) shall take any necessary actions (including seeking any
required employee consents) so that, at the Company Merger Effective Time,
each then outstanding option granted under the Stock Plans to
purchase Company Shares (a "Company Option"), whether vested or unvested,
shall be canceled, with the holder thereof receiving from the Company at the
Closing an amount of cash equal to the product of (x) the amount, if any, by
which the Company Merger Consideration exceeds the exercise price per Share
subject to such Company Option (whether vested or unvested) and (y) the
number of Company Shares issuable pursuant to the unexercised and outstanding
portion of such Company Option, less any required withholding of taxes. The
Company has provided to Parent a schedule of the exercise price for each
Company Option outstanding on the date hereof.   (b) Stock Awards. As soon
as practicable after the date hereof, the Company (or the appropriate
administrative body) shall take any necessary actions (including seeking any
required employee consents) so that, at the Company Merger Effective Time,
each deferred stock award and restricted stock award ("Stock Award")
outstanding under the 1996 Long Term Incentive Plan shall be fully vested and
shall be canceled with the holder thereof receiving from the Company at the
Closing an amount of cash equal to (i) all accrued but unpaid dividends with
respect thereto and (ii) the product of (A) the Company Merger Consideration
and (B) the number of Company Shares covered by such Stock Award, less any
required tax withholding.   (c) Employee Benefits. Parent agrees that,
during the period commencing at the Company Merger Effective Time and ending
on June 30, 2002, the employees of the Company (other than employees who are
primarily employed in the Business ("Available Employees")) (the "Continuing
Employees") will continue to be provided with benefits under employee benefit
plans (other than plans involving the issuance of equity) that are no less
favorable in the     -58-   aggregate than the benefits currently
provided by the Company and its Subsidiaries to such employees under the
Compensation and Benefit Plans listed in Section 5.2(i) of the Company
Disclosure Letter (excluding such Plans that provide equity-based
compensation and the programs for executive automobile leasing described in
Section 6.1(b)(v) of the Company Disclosure Letter); provided, however, that
Employees covered by a collective bargaining agreement shall not be subject
to the foregoing sentence, but shall be subject to the applicable collective
bargaining agreement.   (d) Service and Assumption of Plan Obligations. In
addition to the obligations set forth in Section 6.10(c), following the
Company Merger Effective Time, Parent shall cause service by the Continuing
Employees with the Company and its Subsidiaries (and any predecessor
entities) to be taken into account for purposes of eligibility to
participate, eligibility to commence benefits, vesting, severance and
vacation entitlement under any benefit plans of Parent or its Subsidiaries in
which such Continuing Employees are entitled to participate (including the
Surviving Company) to the same extent such service is credited pursuant to
the comparable Compensation and Benefit Plan listed in Section 5.2(i) of the
Company Disclosure Letter, except to the extent such credit would cause
duplication of benefits. From and after the Company Merger Effective
Time, Parent shall (i) to the extent satisfied or inapplicable under
similar Compensation and Benefit Plans that are listed in Section 5.2(i) of
the Company Disclosure Letter, cause to be waived any pre-existing condition
limitations under benefit plans of Parent or its Subsidiaries in which
employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries participate and (ii) cause to be
credited to any deductible or out-of-pocket expense of Parent\'s plans any
deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses incurred by such employees and their
beneficiaries and dependents during the portion of the calendar year prior to
participation in the benefit plans provided by Parent and its Subsidiaries.
Parent and the Company acknowledge that the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Asset Purchase Agreement shall, to the extent applicable,
be a "change-in-control" of the Company with respect to all participants
under the Compensation and Benefit Plans listed in Section 5.2(i) of the
Company Disclosure Letter. Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving
Company to assume and agree to perform all employee benefit obligations to
current and former employees under the Compensation and Benefit Plans in
accordance with their terms (including, to the extent not    
-59-     prohibited under the terms of the Compensation and Benefit
Plans, the right to amend or terminate such Compensation and Benefit
Plan).   (e) Severance Pay. Parent shall provide severance pay to
Continuing Employees (other than Employees covered by collective bargaining
agreements) in accordance with the severance plan set forth in Section
6.10(e) of the Company Disclosure Letter and Parent agrees that the Company
shall make the payments contemplated by Section 6.1(b)(v)(I) of the Company
Disclosure Letter at the Closing or, for certain executives, such later time
as provided therein.   (f) Payment of Bonuses. At the first to occur of (i)
such Continuing Employee\'s termination of employment (for any reason other
than for cause (determined in accordance with the Company\'s historical
practices) or (ii) the date on which the 2002 fiscal year bonus is paid, the
Company shall pay to each Continuing Employee (whose employment or other
agreement does not otherwise provide for such payment) a payment equal to a
pro-rata portion of such Employee\'s target bonus, if any, under the
Company\'s annual incentive bonus plan(s) in which such employee is a
participant for the period from April 1, 2001 until the Closing, which
payment shall be a minimum bonus guarantee with respect to the fiscal year
2002 bonus.   (g) Additional Benefit Matters. Prior to the Closing, the
Company shall provide Parent a list of and true and correct copies of any
Compensation and Benefit Plans that were not listed in Section 5.2(i) of the
Company Disclosure Letter. At the Closing, Parent shall deliver executed
letters in the same form as are attached as Exhibit A hereto addressed to the
recipients described therein.   6.11. Expenses. (a) The Surviving Company
shall pay all charges and expenses, including those of the Paying Agent in
connection with the transactions contemplated in Article IV and any transfer
taxes, conveyance taxes and sales taxes, if any, payable in connection with
the consummation of the Mergers. Except as otherwise provided in Section
8.5(b), whether or not the Mergers are consummated, all costs and expenses
incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Mergers and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the party
incurring such expense.     -60-      (b) Notwithstanding the
provisions of Section 6.11(a), in the event that the Asset Purchase Agreement
is terminated and the Company reimburses the expenses of Assets Buyer
pursuant to Section 12.2(b) of the Asset Purchase Agreement, then the Company
may terminate this Agreement and promptly, but in no event later than two
days after the date of such termination, pay all of the charges and expenses
incurred by Parent in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated herein up to a maximum amount of $2,500,000, payable by wire
transfer of same day funds.   6.12. Indemnification; Directors\' and
Officers\' Insurance. (a) Following the Closing Date, Parent shall, and
Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to, indemnify and hold harmless, to
the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law (and Parent shall also
advance expenses as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable
Law provided the Person to whom expenses are advanced provides any
undertaking required by applicable law to repay such advances if it is
ultimately determined that such Person is not entitled to indemnification),
each present and former director, officer, employee and agent of the Company
and the Company\'s current and former Subsidiaries (collectively, the
"Indemnified Parties") against any reasonable costs or expenses (including
reasonable attorneys\' fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or
liabilities (collectively, "Costs") incurred by such director, officer,
employee or agent acting in such capacity in connection with any claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to
matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Company Merger Effective
Time, including the Mergers, the Assets Purchase and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Asset Purchase
Agreement.   (b) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification
under paragraph (a) of this Section 6.12, upon learning of any such claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation, shall promptly notify the
Surviving Company thereof, but the failure to so notify shall not relieve any
party hereto of any liability or obligation it may have to such Indemnified
Party if such failure does not materially prejudice the indemnifying party.
In the event of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation
(whether arising before or after the Company Merger Effective Time), (i)
Parent or the Surviving Company shall have the right to    
-61-   assume the defense thereof and neither Parent nor the Surviving
Company shall be liable to such Indemnified Parties for any legal expenses of
other counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified
Parties in connection with the defense thereof, except that if Parent and the
Surviving Company elect not to assume such defense or counsel for the
Indemnified Parties advises that there are issues which raise conflicts of
interest between Parent, the Surviving Stockholder or the Surviving Company
and the Indemnified Parties, the Indemnified Parties may retain counsel
reasonably satisfactory to them, and Parent or the Surviving Company shall
pay all reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified
Parties promptly as statements therefor are received; provided, however, that
Parent and the Surviving Company shall be obligated pursuant to this
paragraph (b) to pay for only one firm of counsel for all Indemnified Parties
in any jurisdiction unless the use of one counsel for such Indemnified
Parties would present such counsel with an actual or potential conflict of
interest, (ii) the Indemnified Parties will cooperate in the defense of any
such matter and (iii) neither Parent nor the Surviving Company shall
be liable for any settlement effected without its prior written consent;
and provided, further, that none of the parties hereto shall have any
obligation hereunder to any Indemnified Party if and when a court of
competent jurisdiction shall ultimately determine, and such determination
shall have become final and non-appealable, that the indemnification of such
Indemnified Party in the manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by
applicable Law.   (c) The Surviving Company shall maintain the Company\'s
existing officers\' and directors\' liability insurance with existing policy
limits ("DandO; Insurance") for a period of six years after the Company Merger
Effective Time; provided, however, that if the annual premium therefor is in
excess of 200% of the last annual premium paid prior to the date of this
Agreement (on an annualized basis) or if the existing DandO; Insurance expires,
is terminated or canceled during such six-year period, the Surviving Company
will use its best efforts to obtain as much DandO; Insurance as can be obtained
for the remainder of such period for a premium not in excess (on an
annualized basis) of 200% of the last annual premium paid prior to the date
of this Agreement. Notwithstanding any contrary provision of this Agreement,
prior to the Company Merger Effective Time, the Company may, with the consent
of Parent which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, purchase
insurance coverage     -62-     extending for a period of six years
the Company\'s directors\' and officers\' liability insurance coverage in
effect as of the date hereof (covering past or future claims with respect to
periods prior to and including the Company Merger Effective Time, including,
with respect to the Mergers, the Assets Purchase and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Asset Purchase Agreement); provided
that the aggregate premium payable for such insurance shall not exceed 250%
of the last annual premium paid for such coverage prior to the date
hereof.   (d) The Surviving Company will provide at the Closing to each
person who is an officer or director of the Company immediately prior to the
Company Merger Effective Time a copy of a certificate or certificates of
insurance (i) evidencing that it possesses such DandO; Insurance at policy
limits in effect at Closing and (ii) providing that said DandO; Insurance
cannot be canceled except after ten days prior written notice to said
officers and directors; provided, however, that if such DandO; Insurance is
canceled or terminated during the six-year period after the Company Merger
Effective Time, the Surviving Company shall promptly provide the aforesaid
officers and directors with a new certificate or certificates of insurance
regarding such new DandO; Insurance obtained for the remained of such six-year
period.   (e) Parent and CPI Merger Sub agree that all rights to
indemnification existing in favor of the present or former directors,
officers, employees or agents of the Company or any of the Company\'s current
or former Subsidiaries, respectively, as provided for in the certificate of
incorporation or bylaws of the Company, as in effect as of the date hereof,
or as provided for in other agreements which have been made available to
Parent to which the Company is a party, as in effect as of the date hereof,
with respect to matters occurring prior to and as of the Company Merger
Effective Time shall survive the Mergers and shall continue in full force and
effect for a period of not less than the statutes of limitations applicable
to such matters, and Parent agrees to cause the Surviving Stockholder or the
Surviving Company, as the case may be, or another of Parent\'s Subsidiaries,
to comply fully with its obligations hereunder and thereunder.   (f) If
Parent, the Surviving Stockholder, the Surviving Company or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) shall consolidate with or merge into any
other     -63-     corporation or entity and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or (ii) shall transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets
to any individual, corporation or other entity, then, and in each such case,
proper provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent,
the Surviving Stockholder or the Surviving Company, as the case may be, shall
assume all of the obligations set forth in this Section.   (g) The
provisions of this Section are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall
be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties, their heirs and their
representatives.   6.13. Takeover Statute. If any Takeover Statute is or may
become applicable to the Mergers or the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, CPI, the Company and their respective boards of directors
shall grant such approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that
such transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated by this Agreement or by the Mergers and otherwise act to
eliminate or minimize the effects of such statute or regulation on such
transactions.   6.14. Parent Vote. Parent shall vote (or consent with
respect to) or cause to be voted (or a consent to be given with respect to)
any Company Shares and any shares of common stock of CPI Merger Sub or
Company Merger Sub beneficially owned by it or any of its affiliates or with
respect to which it or any of its affiliates has the power (by agreement,
proxy or otherwise) to cause to be voted (or to provide a consent), in favor
of the adoption and approval of this Agreement and the Mergers at any meeting
of stockholders of the Company, CPI Merger Sub or Company Merger Sub,
respectively, at which this Agreement shall be submitted for adoption and
approval and at all adjournments or postponements thereof (or, if applicable,
by any action of stockholders of any of the Company, CPI Merger Sub or
Company Merger Sub by consent in lieu of a meeting).   6.15.

Parent shall execute and deliver to the Company a certificate confirming that
all such materials have been destroyed) all books, contracts, records and
data room contents and other written information and all copies or summaries

permits you to receive benefits thereunder in a manner that does not cause
you to recognize taxable income (for example, as is currently provided under
Sections 104, 105 and 106 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(and successor statutory provisions)), we will maintain such insurance or, if
we do not maintain such insurance, we will provide you such benefits by other
means reasonably satisfactory to you on a tax-free basis. In the future, if
the Internal Revenue Code does not permit such tax benefits to be delivered
by maintaining insurance we may discontinue the underlying insurance, but we
will continue to provide the benefits promised to you under the Plan albeit
not on a tax-free basis.   In the event that you and we have a dispute
regarding the benefits or terms of any of the Agreements or this letter,
Parent will or will cause the Company to reimburseany reasonable legal fees
and expenses incurred by you in seeking to enforce your rights, to the extent
described in this paragraph, unless the Newco Entity that is named in    
-A-1-      your dispute substantially prevails. Your reasonable legal
fees and expenses will be paid promptly as incurred (but in any event within
fifteen days after receipt of notice that you have incurred such fees and
expenses together with documentation of such fees and expenses), not to you,
but to a third party escrow agent satisfactory to both of us, pending
resolution of your claim. Upon notice of a final non-appealable resolution of
your claim and provided that a determination has not been made by the
tribunal or other body hearing the dispute that the Newco Entities named in
your dispute have substantially prevailed in respect of the claims you have
brought and provided that a settlement agreement has not been entered into
providing for a different allocation of legal fees, then the escrow agent
shall pay to you the funds so deposited (plus interest earned thereon). Any
remaining reasonable legal fees or expenses incurred by you in connection
with your claim that were not covered by the money paid to you from the
escrow fund, will be reimbursed by us directly within fifteen business days
of your notice to us of such fees and expenses. If the Newco Entities named
in your dispute substantially prevail, the escrow agent shall return to us
the funds we deposited, plus interest earned thereon and you will not be
entitled to any reimbursement with respect to such legal fees and expenses.
Of course, if a settlement agreement between you and the Newco Entities
provides for a different allocation of legal fees and expenses, then the
escrow agent will disburse the escrowed amounts in a manner consistent
with such settlement agreement.   Until further notice, your claims for
reimbursement of medical expenses should continue to be sent to the Treasurer
of the Company, as provided in the Medical Plan. All other correspondence
regarding these Agreements should be sent to the Vice President of Human
Resources. If you have questions about this letter, please feel free to
contact [PARENT REPRESENTATIVE] or [COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE].
