REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

  

  

Except with respect to any subsection of this Article 3, as disclosed in the

Acquiror concurrently herewith (the "Company Disclosure Schedule") (it being
understood by the parties that the information disclosed in one subsection of
the Company Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to be included in each other

Company hereby makes the representations and warranties set forth in this
Article 3 to and in favor of Acquiror and acknowledges that Acquiror is
relying upon such representations and warranties in connection with the
matters contemplated by this Agreement:

  

  

3.1 Organization, Standing and Power; Subsidiaries.

  

  

(a) The Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of British Columbia, Canada, has all requisite power
and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its
business as now being conducted, and is duly registered, licensed or otherwise
qualified and in good standing to do business in each jurisdiction in which
the nature of its business or the ownership or leasing of its properties
requires it to be so registered, licensed or otherwise qualified, other than
in such other jurisdictions where the failure to be so registered, licensed or
otherwise qualified and to be in such standing would not, either individually
or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect. The Company Governing Documents, copies of which were previously
provided to Acquiror by the Company, are true, complete and correct copies of
such documents as in effect on the date of this Agreement.

  

  

(b) Section 3.1(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a complete
and correct list of each direct and indirect Subsidiary of the Company with
its (i) place of organization, (ii) the type of entity, and (iii) the nature
and percentage of outstanding interests held by the Company, or any Subsidiary
of the Company, in such entity. Each Subsidiary of the Company is a
corporation, limited liability company or partnership duly organized, validly
existing and (where applicable) in good standing under the laws of its
jurisdiction of formation, has all requisite power and authority to own, lease
and operate its properties and to carry on its business as now being
conducted, and is duly registered, licensed or otherwise qualified and in good
standing to do business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its
business or the ownership or leasing of its properties requires it to be so
registered, licensed or otherwise qualified, other than in such jurisdictions
where the failure to be so registered, licensed or otherwise qualified would
not, either individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect. All of the shares of capital stock or other
equity interests of each of the Subsidiaries held by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries are fully paid and nonassessable and are owned by the Company or
a Subsidiary of the Company free and clear of any Lien, except for Liens in
favor of the lenders under the Company Credit Agreement.

Company Shares, and 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, without par value
(the "Company Preferred Stock"). As of December 23, 2010 (the "Company
Capitalization Date"), (i) 49,918,230 Company Shares were issued and
outstanding, all of which are duly authorized, validly issued, fully-paid and
nonassessable and free from preemptive rights, (ii) 21,100 Company Shares were
held in the treasury of the Company, and (iii) no shares of Company Preferred

for issuance pursuant to Company Benefit Plans, 4,609,038 Company Shares
reserved for issuance pursuant to Company Warrants (as defined below) and the
variable number of Company Shares required to be reserved for issuance upon

Company Disclosure Schedule (the "Company Warrants"); and (iii) 6% Amortizing
Convertible Notes convertible into and payable as to principal in Company
Shares at the variable rates determined thereunder by reference to market
prices of the Company Shares. Between the Company Capitalization Date and the

14, 2010, the Company entered into agreements with the holders of the 6%
Amortizing Convertible Notes that limit the holders' conversion rights to an
aggregate of up to 32,000,000 Company Shares from November 15, 2010 through
the fifth trading day prior to any Company shareholder vote on a qualifying
transaction (the "Conversion Period"), and the holders have agreed not to
convert any portion of the 6% Amortizing Convertible Notes into Company Shares
after the Conversion Period. In connection with this Agreement, the
Arrangement or the transaction contemplated hereby, no "Additional Shares" (as
defined in Section 5(c) of the 6% Amortizing Convertible Notes) are required

adjustments normal in nature and amount), (iii) complied as to form, as of
their respective dates of filing with the SEC, in all material respects with
applicable accounting requirements and with the published rules and
regulations of the SEC with respect thereto (except, in the case of unaudited

in accordance with GAAP consistently applied during the periods involved,
except, in each case, as indicated in such statements or in the notes thereto.
The books and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries have been, and are

of the Company or its Subsidiaries or accountants (including all means of
access thereto and therefrom), except for any non-exclusive ownership and non-

adverse effect on the system of internal accounting controls described below
in this Section 3.5(b). The Company (x) has implemented and maintains
disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the
Exchange Act) to ensure that material information relating to the Company,

are reasonably like to adversely affect the Company's ability to record,
process, summarize and report financial information and (ii) any fraud,
whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have
a significant role in the Company's internal controls over financial
reporting. These disclosures were made in writing by management to the
Company's auditors and audit committee, a copy of which has previously been
provided to Acquiror by the Company. There is no reason to believe that the
Company's outside auditors, chief executive officer and chief financial
officer will not be able to give the certifications and attestations required
pursuant to the rules and regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404 of SOX,
without qualification, when next due.

or claim that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in
questionable accounting or auditing practices, and (ii) no attorney
representing the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not employed

(a) The Company shall not, directly or indirectly, through any of its officers
or directors or any employee, representative or agent of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries (including any investment banker, attorney or accountant
retained by it or any of its Subsidiaries) acting, directly or indirectly, at
the direction of any officer or director of the Company, (i) initiate,
solicit, or knowingly encourage inquiries or proposals with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal other than from Acquiror, (ii) engage in any discussions
or negotiations concerning, or provide any confidential information or data to
any Third Party in connection with an Acquisition Proposal (except to notify
such Person as to the existence of the provisions of this Section 6.8), or
knowingly take any other action with the purpose or intention of facilitating
any other inquiries or the making of any proposal that constitutes, or that
reasonably may be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal, or (iii)
except as permitted by Section 6.8(g) below, enter into any agreement (other
than a confidentiality agreement permitted by Section 6.8(b) below) with
respect to any Acquisition Proposal or approve or resolve to approve any
Acquisition Proposal. Neither the Company nor the Company's Board of Directors
shall approve or take any action to render inapplicable to any Acquisition
Proposal any Takeover Statutes or any restrictive provision or any applicable
anti-takeover provision in the Company Governing Documents.

  

  

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to the Effective Date, the Company
may, in response to an unsolicited Acquisition Proposal received by the
Company which did not result from a breach of this Section 6.8, furnish
information to, or enter into discussions or negotiations with, or waive any
standstill with, any Person that has made an unsolicited bona fide written
Acquisition Proposal if, and only to the extent that (A) such Acquisition
Proposal, if consummated, would constitute a Superior Proposal or the
Company's Board of Directors, after consulting with the Company's outside
legal advisors, determines in good faith that such Acquisition Proposal, after
furnishing such information and entering into such discussions or
negotiations, could reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal,
(B) the Company and its Subsidiaries are otherwise in compliance with this
Section 6.8 (including, prior to furnishing such information to, or entering
into discussions or negotiations with, such Person, by providing written
notice to Acquiror to the effect that it is furnishing information to, or
entering into discussions or negotiations with, such Person), (C) prior to
furnishing such information, the Company receives from such Person an executed
confidentiality agreement with terms substantially similar to and no less
favorable to the Company than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement
(it being understood and hereby agreed that such confidentiality agreement
need not contain a "standstill" or similar provision that prohibits such
Person from making an Acquisition Proposal, acquiring the Company or taking
any other related action); provided, however, that the Company may enter into
discussions or negotiations solely with respect to entering into such
confidentiality agreement without breaching this Section 6.8, and (D) the
Company keeps Acquiror informed, on a reasonably current basis, of the status
of any such discussions or negotiations as provided above. In the event that
the Company provides any information to such Person that the Company has not
previously provided to Acquiror, the Company shall promptly provide such
information to Acquiror. The Company shall notify Acquiror within twenty-four
(24) hours after the receipt of any unsolicited Acquisition Proposal, and the
Company shall not disclose any of the terms of the Seminole Letter of Intent,
the Seminole Agreements, or any of the proposed arrangements among Acquiror,
the Company and Seminole to any Person in connection with the furnishing of
information pursuant to this Section 6.8(b), an Acquisition Proposal or
otherwise.

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

51  

  

 

 

 

   
 

(c) The Company shall promptly (and, in any event, within one Business Day)
(i) notify Acquiror of the existence of any proposal, discussion, negotiation
or inquiry received by the Company with respect to any Acquisition Proposal,
the material terms and conditions of any proposal, discussion, negotiation or
inquiry that it may receive and the identity of the Person making such
proposal or inquiry, and any modification of or amendment thereto and (ii)
provide Acquiror a copy of any such proposal or inquiry and any modification
of or amendment thereto. The Company will keep Acquiror reasonably apprised of
any related developments, discussions, and negotiations.

  

  

(d) Except as provided herein, the Company shall immediately cease and cause
to be terminated any existing discussions or negotiations with any Persons
(other than Acquiror) conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal.

  

  

(e) Nothing contained in this Section 6.8 shall prohibit the Company or the
Company's Board of Directors from making any disclosure to the Company's
shareholders if, in the good faith judgment of the Company's Board of
Directors, after consultation with outside counsel, failure to make such
disclosure would be inconsistent with Applicable Law.

  

  

(f) Except as set forth in this Section 6.8(f), neither the Company's Board of
Directors nor any committee thereof shall (i) approve or recommend, or propose
to approve or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) cause or permit the
Company to enter into any letter of intent, agreement in principle,
acquisition agreement or similar agreement with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal or (iii) in connection with an Acquisition Proposal withdraw or
modify in a manner adverse to Acquiror, or publicly propose to withdraw or
modify in a manner adverse to Acquiror, the Company Board Recommendation.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 6.8(f), the Company's
Board of Directors may, at any time, make a Change in Company Board
Recommendation (i) if the Company's Board of Directors receives a Superior
Proposal, and has concluded in good faith, after consultation with the
Company's outside legal advisors, that in light of the Superior Proposal the
failure of the Company's Board of Directors to effect a Change in Company
Board Recommendation would be inconsistent with the directors' exercise of
their fiduciary obligations under Applicable Law; or (ii) in response to any
material event, development, circumstance, occurrence or change in
circumstances or facts not related to an Acquisition Proposal that was not
known to the Board of Directors or senior management of the Company on the
date hereof, that would have a material highly favorable impact on the
business, condition (financial or otherwise), capitalization, assets,
liabilities, operations or financial performance of the Company and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole (an "Intervening Event"), and the Company's
Board of Directors has concluded in good faith, after consultation with the
Company's outside legal advisors, that in light of the Intervening Event, the
failure of the Company's Board of Directors to effect a Change in Company
Board Recommendation would be inconsistent with the directors' exercise of
their fiduciary obligations under Applicable Law; provided, however, that the
following shall not constitute an Intervening Event: changes in the financial
or securities markets or general economic or political conditions in the
world, general conditions in the industry in which the Company and its
Subsidiaries operates, any change in the price of oil or natural gas,
discovery of successful wells, or any oil and gas discovery.

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

52  

  

 

 

 

   
 

(g) At any time prior to the Effective Date, the Company may, in response to a
Superior Proposal that did not result from a breach of this Section 6.8,
terminate this Agreement by written notice to Acquiror and concurrently with
such termination enter into a definitive agreement providing for the
transactions contemplated by such Superior Proposal; provided, however, that
the Company shall not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section
6.8(g), and any purported termination pursuant to Section 6.8(g) shall be void
and of no force or effect, unless, the Company shall have complied with all
the provisions of this Section 6.8, including the notification provisions in
this Section 6.8(g), and with all applicable requirements of Section 8.2(b)
(including the payment of the Damages Fee in accordance therewith) in
connection with such Superior Proposal; and provided further, however, that
the Company shall not exercise its right to terminate this Agreement pursuant
hereto: (1) until after the fourth Business Day following actual receipt by
Acquiror of written notice from the Company advising Acquiror that the Company
has received a Superior Proposal, specifying the material terms and conditions
of the Superior Proposal and attaching the most current versions of the
definitive agreement, all exhibits and other attachments thereto and
agreements (such as shareholder agreements) ancillary thereto to effect such
Superior Proposal, and identifying the Person making such Superior Proposal (a
"Notice of Superior Proposal") and stating that the Company's Board of
Directors intends to cause the Company to exercise its right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant hereto (it being understood and agreed that, prior to any
termination pursuant to this Section 6.8(g) taking effect, any amendment to
the price or any other material term of a Superior Proposal (such amended
Superior Proposal, a "Modified Superior Proposal") shall require a new Notice
of Superior Proposal and a new four Business Day period with respect to such
Modified Superior Proposal) and (2) unless either (A) on or before the
expiration of the five Business Day period following the actual receipt by
Acquiror of any Notice of Superior Proposal, Acquiror does not make such
adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such
Acquisition Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal (a "Matching
Agreement") in response to such Superior Proposal or (B) following receipt of
a Matching Agreement within the five Business Day period, the Company's Board
of Directors (or any duly constituted committee thereof) concludes in good
faith, after consultation with the Company's outside legal advisors and after
taking into consideration the Matching Agreement, that the Superior Proposal
to which the Notice of Superior Proposal relates continues to be a Superior
Proposal.

  

  

(h) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Company or the
Company's Board of Directors from (1) complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule
14e-2(a) or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A under the 1934 Act or any analogous
Canadian laws, (2) disclosing factual information regarding the business,
financial condition or results of operations of Acquiror or the Company or the
fact that an Acquisition Proposal has been made, the identity of the party
making such proposal or the material terms of such proposal in the Proxy
Circular or otherwise, to the extent that Company or the Company's Board of
Directors in good faith determines that such information, facts, identity or
terms is required to be disclosed under Applicable Law or that failure to make
such disclosure would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
Applicable Law or (3) from making any required disclosure to the Company's
Shareholders if the Company's Board of Directors determines in good faith,
after consultation with outside counsel, that such action is necessary for the
Company's Board of Directors to comply with its fiduciary duties under
Applicable Law; provided, however, that any statement or disclosure made by or
on behalf of the Company's Board of Directors (other than a "stop, look and
listen communication" of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the
Exchange Act, and within the time period contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f)(3))
shall be deemed to be a Change in Company Board Recommendation unless it is

reaffirming the Company Board Recommendation in connection with such statement
or disclosure.

and independent contractors of the Company and any of its Subsidiaries
pursuant to any such agreements, plans or arrangements in connection with (A)
the occurrence of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (B)

U.S.$5,000,000. The amount of any payments made pursuant to Section 3.12(i)
will be paid in shares of Acquiror Common Stock or in cash or in any
combination thereof, as determined by Acquiror in its sole discretion, except

Directors may, at its discretion, make amendments to such agreements solely to
allocate the severance dollar amounts to comply with the U.S.$5,000,000 cap,
in the form of amendment that is reasonably acceptable to Acquiror. Within
thirty (30) days after the execution of this Agreement, the Company will
furnish to Acquiror a list of how the Company will allocate the severance
dollar amounts in compliance with the U.S.$5,000,000 cap. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if the shares of Acquiror Common Stock are not registered and are

to participate in Acquiror's benefit plans, to substantially the same extent
as, and not more favorably than, similarly situated employees of Acquiror.

  

  

(b) Acquiror shall, to the extent permitted by Acquiror benefits plans, (i)
waive, or shall cause to be waived, any applicable pre-existing condition
exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage
requirements in any replacement or successor welfare benefit plan in which any
Continuing Employee is eligible to participate following the Closing to the
extent such exclusions or waiting periods were inapplicable to, or had been
satisfied by, such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Closing under
the analogous Company Benefit Plan in which such Continuing Employee
participated, (ii) provide, or cause to be provided, each Continuing Employee
with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid prior to the Closing (to
the same extent such credit was given under the analogous Company Benefit Plan
prior to the Closing) in satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket
requirements and (iii) recognize service prior to the Closing with the Company
and any of its Subsidiaries for purposes of eligibility to participate and
vesting (and, in respect of vacation benefits, determination of level of
benefits) to the same extent such service was recognized by the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries under the analogous Company Benefit Plan in which such
Continuing Employee participated immediately prior to the Closing (excluding
severance benefits which the Parties agree shall be covered pursuant to
Section 6.12); provided that the foregoing shall not apply to the extent it
would result in any duplication of benefits for the same period of service,
provided further, that the foregoing shall not apply to the extent the consent
of any third party is required, if Acquiror has used its commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain the consent of such third party and such third
party has denied their consent or providing such benefits would cause Acquiror

that, in lieu of the number of Company Shares otherwise issuable upon the
exercise thereof, the holder shall be entitled to receive the number of shares
of Acquiror Common Stock which the holder would have been entitled to receive
as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Plan of Arrangement if,
immediately prior to the Effective Time, such holder had been the registered
holder of the number of Company Shares to which such holder was theretofore
entitled upon such exercise, and to the extent provided for in the terms of
the Company Option or Company Warrant, there shall be a corresponding
proportionate adjustment of the exercise price of any such Company Option or
Company Warrant; provided, further, that, to the extent that the Company has
the right to terminate or cancel any Company Options or Company Warrants for
no consideration pursuant to and in accordance to the respective terms
thereof, the Company shall take all necessary action to terminate or cancel
such Company Options and Company Warrants.

Subsidiaries will not change, modify, or amend any of the existing agreements
with Seminole without the prior written consent of Acquiror, except as
provided in the immediately preceding sentence.

(a) by mutual consent of Acquiror and the Company in a written instrument;

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

63  

  

 

 

 

   
 

(b) by either Acquiror or the Company, upon written notice to the other Party,

Regulatory Approval has denied granting of such Requisite Regulatory Approval
and such denial has become final and non-appealable; or any Governmental
Entity of competent jurisdiction shall have issued an Order or ruling or taken
any other action permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting
the Arrangement, and such injunction, Order or ruling or other action has
become final and non-appealable; provided, however, that (i) the Party seeking
to terminate this Agreement shall have used its reasonable best efforts to
remove or lift such injunction, Order or ruling and (ii) the right to
terminate this Agreement under this Section 8.1(b) shall not be available to
any Party whose failure to comply with Section 6.7 or any other provision of
this Agreement has been the cause of, or resulted in, the denial of the
Requisite Regulatory Approval or such Order, ruling or other action;

  

  

(c) by either Acquiror or the Company, upon written notice to the other Party,
if the Arrangement shall not have been consummated on or before March 31,
2011, or April 15, 2011, as contemplated by Section 6.20; provided, however,
that the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 8.1(c) shall not
be available to any Party whose failure to comply with any provision of this
Agreement has been the cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the Effective
Time to occur on or before such date;

  

  

(d) by either Acquiror or the Company, if the Required Company Vote has not
been obtained by reason of the failure to obtain the required vote upon a
final vote taken at the Company Meeting (or any adjournment or postponement
thereof); provided, however, that the Company shall not be entitled to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(d) if any of the
shareholders party to a Support Agreement shall have breached any of their
obligations thereunder, and either Party shall not be entitled to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(d) if such Party's failure to
comply with any provision of this Agreement has been the cause of, or resulted
in, the failure to obtain the required vote upon a final vote taken at the
Company Meeting;

  

  

(e) by Acquiror, upon written notice to the Company, if:

  

  

(i) (A) the Company Board fails to make or has withdrawn or changed the

Company shall have entered into any agreement with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal, or (C) the Company Board shall have resolved to do any of the
foregoing or publicly announced its intention to do any of the foregoing;

  

  

(ii) a bona fide Acquisition Proposal is publicly announced, proposed, offered
or made to the Company Shareholders or to the Company and not publicly
withdrawn and the Company Shareholders do not approve the Arrangement as
required in the Interim Order or the Arrangement is not submitted for their
approval;

  

  

(iii) the Company accepts, recommends, approves or enters into an agreement to
implement a Superior Proposal, or publicly announces its intention to do any
of the foregoing;

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

64  

  

 

 

 

   
 

(iv) the Company has breached any of the covenants and agreements set forth in

petition or initiated insolvency proceedings, or involuntary bankruptcy
proceedings or insolvency proceedings have been brought against the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries.

  

  

(f) by the Company in accordance with the terms and conditions of Section
6.8(g); and

  

  

(g) if any of the conditions precedent set forth in Sections 7.1, 7.2 or 7.3
hereof shall have not been satisfied or waived by the Party or Parties for
whose benefit such condition is provided on or before the date required for
the performance thereof, by the Party for whose benefit the condition
precedent is provided upon written notice to the other Party. Such notice
shall specify in reasonable detail all breaches of covenants, representations
and warranties or other matters which the Party delivering such notice is
asserting as the basis for the non-fulfillment of the applicable condition
precedent.

  

  

8.2 Effect of Termination.

  

  

(a) In the event of termination of this Agreement by either the Company or
Acquiror as provided in Section 8.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become
void, and there shall be no liability or obligation on the part of Acquiror or
the Company, except with respect to Section 6.6 (Access to Information;
Confidentiality), Section 6.9 (Fees and Expenses), this Section 8.2 (Effect of
Termination), and Article 9 (General Provisions), which shall survive such
termination and except that no Party shall be relieved or released from any
liabilities or damages arising out of its willful breach of this Agreement.

  

  

(b) If at any time after the execution of this Agreement and prior to its
termination:

  

  

(i) the Board of Directors fails to make or has withdrawn or changed the
Company Board Recommendation referred to in Section 3.14 in a manner adverse
to Acquiror or shall have resolved to do so or publicly announced its
intention to do so prior to the Effective Date;

  

  

(ii) prior to the termination of this Agreement, a bona fide Acquisition
Proposal is publicly announced, proposed, offered or made to the Company
Shareholders or to the Company and not publicly withdrawn and the Company
Shareholders do not approve the Arrangement as required in the Interim Order
or the Arrangement is not submitted for their approval, and (whether prior to
or following the termination of this Agreement) such Acquisition Proposal, an
amended version thereof or any other Acquisition Proposal relating to the
Company is consummated within twelve (12) months of the date the first
Acquisition Proposal is publicly announced, proposed, offered or made
(provided that for purposes of this Section 8.2(b)(ii), each reference to
"20%" in the definition of Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to reference
"50%" for an arrangement, amalgamation, merger or stock acquisition and "50%"
for an assets acquisition);

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

65  

  

 

 

 

   
 

(iii) the Company accepts, recommends, approves or enters into an agreement to
implement a Superior Proposal, or publicly announces its intention to do any
of the foregoing; or

  

  

(iv) the Company is in breach of its covenants in Section 6.8, and the Company
fails to cure such breach within five (5) Business Days after receipt of
written notice thereof from Acquiror (except that no cure period shall be
provided for a breach which by its nature cannot be cured and, in no event,
shall any cure period extend beyond March 31, 2011, or April 15, 2011, as
contemplated by Section 6.20),

  

  

then in the event of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section
8.1, the Company shall pay to Acquiror in immediately available funds to an
account designated by Acquiror on the later of the date of termination of this
Agreement or within ten (10) Business Days after the first to occur of the
events described above, and after such event but prior to payment of such
amount, the Company shall be deemed to hold such funds in trust for Acquiror,
U.S.$4,000,000 (the "Damages Fee").

  

  

(c) If at any time after the execution of this Agreement and prior to its
termination, (i) the Required Company Vote has not been obtained by reason of
the failure to obtain the required vote upon a final vote taken at the Company
Meeting (or any adjournment or postponement thereof), and (ii) none of the
circumstances in Section 8.2(b) exist, then in the event of the termination of
this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1, the Company shall pay to Acquiror its
reasonable, properly documented expenses incurred in connection with this
Agreement and the proposed Arrangement and related matters, including without
limitation attorneys' fees and expenses (the "Transaction Expenses"), in
immediately available funds to an account designated by Acquiror within ten
(10) Business Days after the occurrence of the event described above, and
after such event but prior to payment of such amount, the Company shall be
deemed to hold the Transaction Expenses in trust for Acquiror; provided,
however, that the Transaction Expenses shall not exceed the amount of the
Damages Fee.

  

  

(d) Each of the Parties acknowledges and agrees that the payment amounts set
out in Section 8.2(b) and Section 8.2(c) includes a payment of liquidated
damages which is a genuine pre-estimate of the damages that Acquiror will
suffer or incur as a result of the event giving rise to such damages and
resultant termination of this Agreement and is not a penalty. The Company
irrevocably waives any right it may have to raise as a defense that any such
liquidated damages are excessive or punitive. For greater certainty, each of
the Parties agrees that the payment of the applicable amounts pursuant to
Section 8.2(b) or Section 8.2(c), as applicable, is the sole monetary remedy
of Acquiror for the occurrence of events or circumstances covered by Section
8.2(b) or Section 8.2(c), provided however, that this limitation shall not
apply in the event of fraud or willful breach of this Agreement by the
Company. Furthermore, nothing herein shall preclude a Party from seeking
injunctive relief to restrain any breach or threatened breach of the covenants
or agreements set forth in this Agreement or the Confidentiality Agreement or
otherwise to obtain specific performance of any of such acts, covenants or
agreements, without the necessity of posting bond or security in connection
therewith or to pursue other judicial remedies for breaches of the provisions
of this Agreement other than those covered by Section 8.2(b) or Section
8.2(c).

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

66  

  

 

 

 

   
 

8.3 Amendment. This Agreement may be amended by the Parties, by action taken
or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors, at any time before or
after approval of the matters presented in connection with this Agreement by
the shareholders of the Company, but, after any such approval, no amendment
shall be made which by Law requires further approval by such shareholders
without such further approval. This Agreement may not be amended except by an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the Parties hereto.

  

  

8.4 Amendment to the Plan of Arrangement. The Parties may agree to amend the
Plan of Arrangement as set forth in Article 6 of the Plan of Arrangement.

  

  

8.5 Extension; Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the Parties,
by action taken or authorized by their respective Board of Directors, may, to
the extent permitted by Applicable Law, (i) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other Party, (ii)
waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained herein
or in any document delivered pursuant hereto, and (iii) waive compliance with
any of the agreements or conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the
part of a Party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if
set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such Party. The failure
of a Party to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall
not constitute a waiver of those rights. No single or partial exercise of any
right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder shall preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or
privilege. Any waiver shall be effective only in the specific instance and for
the specific purpose for which given and shall not constitute a waiver to any
subsequent or other exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege
hereunder.

9.3 Interpretation. When a reference is made in this Agreement to Sections,
Exhibits or Schedules, such reference shall be to a Section of or Exhibit or
Schedule to this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents
and headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and
shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.
Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in this
Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation." The phrase "made available" in this Agreement shall mean that the
information referred to has been made available by the Party to whom such
information is to be made available. The phrases "herein," "hereof,"
"hereunder" and words of similar import shall be deemed to refer to this
Agreement as a whole, including the Exhibits and Schedules hereto, and not to
any particular provision of this Agreement. The word "or" shall be inclusive
and not exclusive. Any pronoun shall include the corresponding masculine,
feminine and neuter forms. An "affiliate" of, or a Person "affiliated" with, a
specified Person, is a Person that directly, or indirectly through one or more
intermediaries, controls, or is controlled by, or is under common control

68  

  

 

 

 

   
 

9.4 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of
which shall be considered one and the same agreement and this Agreement shall
become effective when such counterparts have been signed by each of the
Parties and delivered to the other Parties, it being understood that the
Parties need not sign the same counterpart.

  

  

9.5 Entire Agreement; No Third Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement (including
the documents and the instruments referred to herein) (a) constitutes the
entire agreement and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both
written and oral, between the Parties with respect to the subject matter
hereof, other than the Confidentiality Agreement, which shall survive the
execution and delivery of this Agreement and (b) except as provided in Section
6.10 (which is intended for the benefit of only the Persons specified
therein), is not intended to confer upon any Person other than the Parties
hereto any rights or remedies hereunder. Neither this Agreement nor any other
document delivered in connection with this Agreement shall create or be deemed
to create or permit any personal liability or obligation on the part of any
officer or director of either Party or any of their Subsidiaries, absent any
act of fraud.

  

  

9.6 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, except with respect to the
provisions regarding the mechanics and consummation of the Arrangement, which
shall be governed by the laws of the Province of British Columbia.

  

  

9.7 Severability. Any term or provision of this Agreement which is invalid or
unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction, be
ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability and, unless
the effect of such invalidity or unenforceability would prevent the Parties
from realizing the major portion of the economic benefits of the Arrangement
that they currently anticipate obtaining therefrom, shall not render invalid
or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this Agreement or
affect the validity or enforceability of any of the terms or provisions of
this Agreement in any other jurisdiction. If any provision of this Agreement
is so broad as to be unenforceable, the provision shall be interpreted to be
only so broad as is enforceable.

  

  

9.8 Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations of the Parties hereunder shall be assigned by either of the
Parties hereto (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior
written consent of the other Party, and any attempt to make any such
assignment without such consent shall be null and void. Subject to the
preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit
of and be enforceable by the Parties and their respective successors and
permitted assigns.

  

  

9.9 Submission to Jurisdiction. Each Party hereto irrevocably submits to the
jurisdiction of the courts located in Delaware, for the purposes of any suit,
action or other Proceeding arising out of this Agreement or any transaction
contemplated hereby. Each Party hereto agrees to commence any Proceeding
relating hereto only in the courts in Delaware. Each Party hereto irrevocably
and unconditionally waives any objection to the laying of venue of any
Proceeding arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby in any court in Delaware, and hereby further irrevocably and
unconditionally waives and agrees not to plead or claim in any such court that
any such Proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an
inconvenient forum. Each Party hereto further irrevocably consents to the
service of process out of any of the aforementioned courts in any such suit,
action or other Proceeding by the mailing of copies thereof by mail to such
Party at its address set forth in this Agreement, such service of process to
be effective upon acknowledgment of receipt of such registered mail; provided
that nothing in this Section 9.9 shall affect the right of any Party to serve
legal process in any other manner permitted by law. The consent to
jurisdiction set forth in this Section 9.9 shall not constitute a general
consent to service of process in Delaware and shall have no effect for any
purpose except as provided in this Section. The Parties hereto agree that a
final judgment in any such Proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced
in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided
by Law.

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

69  

  

 

 

 

   
 

9.10 Enforcement. The Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the
event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms on a timely basis or were otherwise
breached. It is accordingly agreed that the Parties shall be entitled to an
injunction or other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and
to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in any
court identified in the Section 9.9 above, this being in addition to any other
remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.

  

  

9.11 WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH OF THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVES TRIAL BY JURY IN
ANY JUDICIAL PROCEEDING INVOLVING, DIRECTLY, IN ANY MATTERS (WHETHER SOUNDING
IN TORT, CONTRACT OR OTHERWISE) IN ANY WAY ARISING OUT OF, RELATED TO, OR
CONNECTED WITH, THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.
