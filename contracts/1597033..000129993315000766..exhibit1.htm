shall pay 25% (150-100 / 300-100) of the Consultants fees and expenses. The

and/or for that of any person, firm, company and/or other entity (other than
the Company) and whether through the medium of any company, corporation
and/or any other entity Controlled by it (for which purpose there shall be
aggregated with its shareholding or ability to exercise Control over the
shares held or Controlled by any person connected with or any company or
other entity related to the Vendor) or as principal, partner, director,
consultant and/or agent;    

"Restricted Business" means the operation of a GDS System and/or the carrying
on of a marketing and/or distribution business for a GDS System, but shall
not include the business conducted by Infini in Japan in the manner such
business has been conducted prior to the date of this Agreement;   

       | 7.3.2  |   | The Vendor undertakes with the Purchaser and
the Group Companies that Vendor will not, and will procure and ensure that no
entity Controlled by the Vendor will, in any Relevant Capacity during the
Prohibited Period:  
---|---|---|--- 
     

       | (i)  |   | be directly or indirectly engaged in
the Restricted Business in the Prohibited Territory;  
---|---|---|--- 
     

       | (ii)  |   | directly or indirectly carry on and/or have
an ownership interest in, and/or have an economic interest which
is substantially equivalent to ownership in, for its own account
either alone or in partnership and/or be concerned in any Relevant Capacity
in, any entity which is engaged in the Restricted Business in the
Prohibited Territory, save for the holding of or trading in less than five
per cent of the outstanding share capital of a corporation the shares of
which are listed on any stock exchange and/or any existing interests held
as at the date of this Agreement in compliance with the General Agreement;  
---|---|---|--- 
     

       | (iii)  |   | make any public statement that (1)
Subscribers in the Prohibited Territory should use a GDS other than a
GDS distributed by the Company and/or the Purchaser Group ("Alternate
GDS"); (2) an Alternate GDS is Owner Carriers preferred GDS for GDS
Services or a statement of similar meaning or (3) disparages in a
material respect the GDS Services offered by any Group Company and/or by any
GDS distributed by the Company; and/or  
---|---|---|--- 
     

       | (iv)  |   | solicit (1) an existing Subscriber of any
GDS distributed by the Company and/or any of its Affiliates to
discontinue or substantially reduce its use of GDS Services through such GDS
and instead use the GDS Services of an Alternate GDS, and/or (2)
any Subscriber of any Alternate GDS to not select and/or use the
GDS Services distributed by the Company or any of its Affiliates.  
---|---|---|--- 
     

       | 7.3.3  |   | Vendor undertakes with the Purchaser that it
will not, and will procure and ensure that no entity Controlled by the Vendor
will, in any Relevant Capacity during the period commencing on (i) the day
immediately following the Completion Date and ending on the first anniversary
of the Completion Date and (ii) the first anniversary of the Completion Date
and ending on the second anniversary of the Completion Date: directly or
indirectly induce and/or seek to induce any person who is, during the period
stated in (i) and (ii) above, an employee or consultant of any Group Company
to become employed, whether as employee, consultant or otherwise, by the
Vendor or any entity Controlled by the Vendor, whether or not such employee
or consultant would thereby commit a breach of his contract with any Group
Company. The placing of an advertisement of a post available to a member of
the public generally and the recruitment of a person through an employment
agency shall not constitute a breach of this Clause 7.3.3 provided that none
of Vendor and/or any entity Controlled by the Vendor encourage or advise such
agency to approach any such employee. The employment or engagement by Vendor,
and/or any entity Controlled by the Vendor, of any person who prior to
Completion is/was a secondee or representative of that person in a
Group Company, details of which are contained in Schedule 7.3.3, shall not
constitute a breach of this Clause 7.3.3.  
---|---|---|--- 
     

       | 7.3.4  |   | While the restrictions set out in Clauses 7.3.2
and 7.3.3 are considered by the Parties to be reasonable in all the
circumstances and no greater than is reasonable and necessary for the
protection of the Group Companies and the Purchaser, it is agreed that if any
one or more of such restrictions shall either taken by itself or
themselves together be adjudged to go beyond what is reasonable in all the
circumstances for the protection of any Group Companys or the Purchasers
legitimate interest but would be adjudged reasonable if any particular
restriction or restrictions were deleted or if any part or parts of the
wording thereof were deleted, restricted or limited in any particular manner
then the said restrictions shall apply with such deletions, restrictions
and/or limitations, as the case may be.  
---|---|---|--- 
     

       | 7.3.5  |   | The Purchaser agrees that nothing in this
Clause 7.3 shall prohibit or restrict the Vendor and/or any entity Controlled
by the Vendor from having any direct or indirect ownership interest in INFINI
which is held by Vendor and/or any entity Controlled by the Vendor at the
date of this Agreement and carrying on the business of INFINI.  
---|---|---|--- 
     

       | 7.3.6  |   | The restrictions imposed in this Clause 7.3 are
separate, distinct and several, so that the unenforceability of any
restriction does not affect the enforceability of the other restrictions.  
---|---|---|--- 
     

       | 7.3.7  |   | Without affecting any other rights or remedies
that the Company may have, the Vendor acknowledges that the Company and/or
the Purchaser may be irreparably harmed by any breach on the part of the
Vendor of the terms in this Clause 7.3 and that damages alone may not
necessarily be an adequate remedy. Accordingly, the Company and the Purchaser
will each be entitled to the remedies of injunction, specific performance
and other equitable relief, or any combination of these remedies, for any
threatened or actual breach of its terms, and no proof of special damages
will be necessary to enforce this Clause 7.3.  
---|---|---|--- 
     

     7.4  |   | Undertakings relating to Regulatory Approvals  
---|---|--- 
     

       | 7.4.1  |   | The Parties agree with and undertake to one
another that no notifications, filings, submissions or any other
communication to any Competition Authority or other Government Entity in
relation to or regarding any aspect of the transactions contemplated under
the Definitive Agreements shall be made without the prior written consent of
the Vendor and the Purchaser. However, in the event of a
disagreement, Purchaser will be able to determine the appropriate response or
the form of relevant notification, filing, submission or any other
communication.  
---|---|---|--- 
     

       | 7.4.2  |   | In the event that any Competition Authority or
other Government Entity nevertheless requests any details, clarifications,
information or documents from the Purchaser, the Vendor and the Purchaser
shall cooperate and use reasonable endeavours to ensure that all relevant
details, information and documents required by such Competition Authority or
other Government Entity be given to such Competition Authority or other
Government Entity within the time frames prescribed by such
Competition Authority or other Government Entity, the Vendor and the
Purchaser agree that any response to such Competition Authority or other
Government Entity shall be made by the Vendor and the Purchaser in
consultation with one another.

     7.5  |   | INFINI  
---|---|--- 
      

The Purchaser and the Vendor shall each use their best endeavours to procure
the entry by the Company into the Infini Dividends Agreement and the entry by

---|---|--- 
      

Vendor hereby agrees that upon Completion, Purchaser and the Group Companies
shall have the sole right to the use of the name "Abacus" and any derivatives

conducted by the Group Companies at any time within the thirty-six (36)
months prior to Completion), including any name or mark confusingly similar
thereto (collectively, the "Company Marks"), and Vendor shall not, and shall
not permit any member of the Vendor Group to, use such Company Marks or any
variation or simulation thereof. In furtherance thereof, at Completion, or
as soon as legally practicable thereafter (but in any event within thirty
(30) days after Completion), Vendor shall, and shall cause each member of
the Vendor Group to, remove any Company Mark from its legal name by
appropriate legal procedures in the jurisdiction of its organization and in
each jurisdiction where such entity has registered to do business.   

     7.7  |   | Cash Dividend  
---|---|--- 
     

       | 7.7.1  |   | Subject to Clause 7.7.2 but notwithstanding the
provisions of the Shareholders Agreement, the Vendor and the Purchaser shall
procure that, to the fullest extent possible whilst enabling the Company to
retain sufficient cash to meet the Group Companies normal and foreseeable
working capital and capital expenditure requirements, the Companys profits
available for lawful distribution shall be distributed to the Vendor and the
Purchaser (as existing shareholders of the Company as at the date of this
Agreement) by way of special dividend pursuant to article 116 of the articles
of association of the Company prior to Completion.  
---|---|---|--- 
     

       | 7.7.2  |   | Unless otherwise agreed, the Vendor and the
Purchaser shall procure that the aggregate special dividend referred to in
Clause 7.7.1 shall:  
---|---|---|--- 
     

       | (a)  |   | in no event exceed the amount of distributable
reserves of the Company under the Companies Act at the date of the
declaration; and  
---|---|---|--- 
     

       | (b)  |   | be declared and remitted as close as reasonably
practicable prior to Completion and after satisfaction of the conditions
precedent set out in Clause 3.  
---|---|---|--- 
     

     7.8  |   | Representations and Warranties Insurance  
---|---|--- 
     

       | 7.8.1  |   | As at the date of this Agreement the Purchaser
has obtained the representations and warranties insurance policy described in
Schedule 15 (the "RandW; Insurance") and the Vendor and the Purchaser shall
equally share the cost of obtaining the RandW; Insurance.  
---|---|---|--- 
     

       | 7.8.2  |   | Vendor shall, and shall procure that the Group
Companies, provide any assistance reasonably requested by Purchaser in
connection with obtaining the RandW; Insurance, including providing any and all
information reasonably requested by the insurance underwriters in order to
underwrite the RandW; Insurance (provided that this obligation does not extend
to providing any representations, warranties or undertakings to the
underwriters in respect of which the Vendor and / or any of the Owner
Carriers would have any potential liability).  
---|---|---|--- 
     

       | 7.8.3  |   | Regardless of whether the Purchaser has a valid
claim under the RandW; Insurance, then, notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement and the Definitive Agreements, the Purchaser agrees that:  
---|---|---|--- 
     

       | (a)  |   | the Vendor shall have no liability in respect of;
and  
---|---|---|--- 
     

       | (b)  |   | none of the Purchaser Group will be entitled to
make, and must not make, and hereby irrevocably waives any right it may have
to make, and must procure that none of the Purchaser Group makes, and
irrevocably waives any right it may have to make,  
---|---|---|--- 
      

any Relevant Claim against the Vendor in respect of or arising out of a breach
of any Vendors Warranty (other than a Title and Authority Warranty, in which
case the Vendors liability shall be as provided in Clause 8.1.1) in this
Agreement, save in respect of a Relevant Claim against the Vendor relating
directly to the fraud of the Vendor.   

     7.9  |   | Retention of Amounts by Vendor  
---|---|--- 
      

On and following the Completion and until the Settlement Date, Vendor shall
not (a) declare and/or pay any dividend and/or make any distribution (in cash
or in kind) to its shareholders or (b) make any payment or incur any
liability or obligation to a person (including to any Owner Carrier or
Affiliate of an Owner Carrier) that would, in either case, cause Vendor to
hold less than US$35,000,000 in Net Vendor Cash. "Net Vendor Cash" means (a)
cash or cash equivalents of the Vendor (excluding pledged cash, escrowed cash
or other restricted cash), _minus_ (b) Indebtedness of Vendor, _minus_ (c)
current liabilities of Vendor, but for the avoidance of doubt, excluding any
Indebtedness or current liabilities in respect of the Vendors obligations
under Clause 4.3.6.   

     7.10  |   | Existence of Vendor; No Reorganization  
---|---|--- 
      

On and following the Completion and until the expiration of the Prohibited
Period, Vendor (a) shall preserve and maintain in full force and effect its
corporate existence, (b) shall not amend or alter its certificate of

constitutional or organizational documents to the extent such amendment or
alteration would have a material adverse effect on its ability to
timely perform its obligations under this Agreement, (c) shall not merge or
consolidate with any company, limited liability partnership, partnership,
business trust or other venture, or enter into any demerger transaction or
participate in any other type of corporate reconstruction or reorganization,
and (d) shall not make any order, present any petition, pass any resolution
or convene any meeting for the winding-up, judicial management or dissolution
of Vendor, except as required by law.   

7.11 Third Party Beneficiary Status    

Effective as of the Completion, Vendor agrees that it shall no longer be a
third party beneficiary to (a) the agreements and contracts listed on
Schedule 7.11 or (b) any other agreement or contract to which the Company,
any Group Company, Purchaser and/or any Purchaser Affiliate is a party if, in
the case of this Sub-Clause 7.11(b), were the Vendor to remain a third party
beneficiary, this would be contrary to intention of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, other than with respect to any
indemnification and/or contribution provisions contained therein.   

     8  |   | INDEMNITY AND CLAIMS AGAINST THE VENDOR  
---|---|--- 
     

     8.1  |   | Indemnity  
---|---|--- 
      

In consideration of the Purchaser entering into this Agreement on the basis of
the Vendors Warranties and the undertakings of the Vendor contained in this
Agreement and to the extent that the same will be fulfilled down to, and will
be true and correct in all respects and not misleading at, Completion as if
they had been entered into afresh at Completion with reference to the facts
and circumstances existing on such day, the Vendor hereby unconditionally and
irrevocably undertakes that it will indemnify and keep the Purchaser and any
other Purchaser Group member harmless from and against all and any Losses
which the Purchaser and the relevant member of the Purchaser Group suffers or
incurs as a result of or in relation to:   

       | 8.1.1  |   | any breach of any of the Title and Authority
Warranties; and  
---|---|---|--- 
     

       | 8.1.2  |   | any breach of any obligation or undertaking by
the Vendor in the Definitive Agreements.  
---|---|---|--- 
     

     8.2  |   | Relevant Claims Procedures.  
---|---|--- 
      

The provisions of Schedule 13 (Relevant Claims Procedures) shall apply in
relation to each Relevant Claim, including any claim for indemnification
under Clause 8.1 (each, an "Indemnification Claim").   

     8.3  |   | Limitations  
---|---|--- 
      

Save in respect of a Relevant Claim against the Vendor relating directly to
the fraud of the Vendor, the Vendors liability for all Relevant Claims shall
be limited so that the maximum aggregate liability in respect of all Relevant
Claims (including any Indemnification Claims) shall be equal to the Final
Purchase Consideration.   

     8.4  |   | Withholding and Deductions  
---|---|--- 
      

All the sums payable by any party (the "Payor") pursuant to this Clause 8
shall be paid free and clear of all deductions, withholdings, set-offs or
counterclaims whatsoever save only as may be required by law. If at any time
any applicable law, regulation or regulatory requirement requires the Payor
to make any deduction or withholding from any payment made in respect of any
amount due from the Payor hereunder, the amount so due shall be increased
to the extent necessary to ensure that, after the making of such deduction or
withholding, the recipient receives, on the due date for such payment, a net
sum equal to the sum which it would have received had no such deduction or
withholding been required to be made.   

     8.5  |   | Indemnities Separate  
---|---|--- 
      

Each of the indemnities in this Agreement constitutes a separate and
independent obligation from the other obligations in this Agreement, shall
give rise to a separate and independent cause of action and shall apply
irrespective of any indulgence granted by the Purchaser to the Vendor.   

     8.6  |   | Purchase Price  
---|---|--- 
      

The satisfaction of any Relevant Claim by the Vendor shall be deemed to
constitute a reduction in the consideration payable by the Purchaser for the
sale of the Sale Shares.

---|---|--- 
      

No announcement or circular in connection with the existence or the subject
matter of this Agreement shall be made or issued by or on behalf of any Party
(or their respective Affiliates) without the prior written approval of the
Purchaser (in the case of an announcement or circular made or issued by or on
behalf of the Vendor, any member of the Vendor Group or any member of any
Owner Carriers OC Group) or the Vendor (in the case of an announcement or

a circular shall consult (through such Party in the case of a regulated or
listed Affiliate) with the relevant Parties referred to above insofar as is
reasonably practicable before complying with such an obligation;

Purchasers purchase of the Sale Shares so long as all disclosures relating
to the identity of the Vendor and the terms of the acquisition of the Sale
Shares are limited to accurate factual statements; or

       | (iii)  |   | any announcement or circular that is consistent
