Corporation until their successors have been duly elected or appointed and
qualified, or their earlier death, resignation or removal.

 

ARTICLE II

CONVERSION OF SHARES; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

Section 2.01 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company or holders of any shares of Company Common Stock or any capital stock
of Merger Sub:

 

(a) _Cancellation of Certain Company Common Stock_. Each share of Company
Common Stock (a " _Share_ " and collectively, the " _Shares_ ") that is owned
by Parent, Merger Sub or any other direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary
of Parent and each Share owned by the Company or any direct or indirect
wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (and in each case not held on behalf
of third parties) (each such Share being an " _Excluded Share_ " and
collectively, " _Excluded Shares_ ") shall automatically be canceled and
retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in
exchange therefor.

(b) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Each Share (other than Excluded
Shares and Dissenting Stockholder Shares) issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and shall thereafter
represent the right to receive, subject to _Section 2.02(b)(v),_ (i) an
amount in cash equal to $9.89 without interest (the " _Cash Consideration_ "),
(ii) the principal amount of $3.30 of a Convertible Note on the terms and
conditions set forth in the form of Indenture attached hereto as  _Exhibit B_
(the " _Convertible Note Consideration_ ") and (iii) that number of validly
issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of common stock, par value $0.01
per share, of Parent (the " _Parent Common Stock_ ") (the " _Stock
Consideration_ ") equal to the quotient determined by dividing $3.31 by the
Measurement Price and rounding the result to the nearest 1/100,000 of a share
(the " _Exchange Ratio_ ")  _provided_ , _however_ , that if the Measurement
Price is less than $27.51, the Exchange Ratio will be 0.120 and if the
Measurement Price is greater than $33.62, the Exchange Ratio will be 0.098
(the Stock Consideration, together with the Cash Consideration, and the
Convertible Note

 



-3-  Consideration, the " _Merger Consideration_ "). From and after the Effective
Time, subject to _Section 2.02(h)_, all of such Shares (other than Excluded
Shares and Dissenting Stockholder Shares) shall no longer be outstanding and
shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each
certificate (a " _Certificate_ ") representing any Shares (other than Excluded
Shares and Dissenting Stockholder Shares) and each non-certificated Share
represented by book-entry (a " _Book-Entry Share_ ") (other than Excluded
Shares and Dissenting Stockholder Shares) shall thereafter represent only the
right to receive the Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor
as contemplated by _Section 2.02(b)(v)_ and any dividends or other
distributions to which holders become entitled upon the surrender of such
Certificate or receipt of an "agents message" in accordance with _Section
2.02_, all without interest. " _Measurement Price_ " means the volume weighted
average price per share of Parent Common Stock (rounded down to the nearest
cent) on the New York Stock Exchange (" _NYSE_ ") for the thirty (30)
consecutive trading days ending on (and including) the third (3rd) trading day
immediately prior to the Effective Time (as reported by The Wall Street
Journal for each such trading day, or, if not reported by The Wall Street
Journal, any other authoritative source mutually agreed by Parent and the
Company).

 

(c) _Conversion of Merger Sub Common Stock_. Each share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly issued,
fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per
share, of the Surviving Corporation and shall constitute the only outstanding
shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

(d) _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, shares of Company Common Stock that are issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time which are held by a stockholder who
did not vote in favor of the Merger (or consent thereto in writing) and
who (a) is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such shares
pursuant to and (b) complies in all respects with, the provisions of Section
262 of the DGCL (the " _Dissenting Stockholder Shares_ ", and
each stockholder holding Dissenting Stockholder Shares, a " _Dissenting
Stockholder_ ") shall not be converted into or be exchangeable for the right
to receive the Merger Consideration, but instead such Dissenting Stockholder
shall be entitled to receive such consideration as may be determined to be
due to such Dissenting Stockholder pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL (and at
the Effective Time, such Dissenting Stockholder Shares shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist,
and such Dissenting Stockholder shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the rights set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL), unless and
until such Dissenting Stockholder shall have failed to perfect or shall have
effectively withdrawn or lost rights to appraisal under the DGCL. If any
Dissenting Stockholder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively
withdrawn or lost such right, such Dissenting Stockholders shares of Company
Common Stock shall thereupon be treated as if they had been converted into and
become exchangeable for the right to receive, as of the Effective Time, the
Merger Consideration for each such share of Company Common Stock, in
accordance with _Section 2.01_, without any interest thereon and less any
applicable

 



-4-  withholding taxes. The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any
written demands for appraisal of any shares of Company Common Stock, attempted
withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the
DGCL and received by the Company relating to stockholders rights of appraisal
and (ii) the opportunity to participate in and direct all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the DGCL. The Company
shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment
with respect to any such demands for appraisal of any shares or settle or
offer to settle any such demands.

 

Section 2.02 _Payment for Securities; Surrender of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Paying Agent_. At or immediately following the Effective Time, Parent
shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with a paying agent selected
by Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Company (the " _Paying Agent_ "),
for the benefit of the holders of Shares, (i) a number of Convertible Notes
sufficient to deliver the aggregate Convertible Notes Consideration, (ii)
certificates representing the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued as
Stock Consideration (or appropriate alternative arrangements shall be made by
Parent if uncertificated shares of Parent Common Stock will be issued) and
(iii) a cash amount in immediately available funds equal to the aggregate Cash
Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to _Section
2.02(b)(v)_ (the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The Paying Agent agreement pursuant to
which Parent shall engage the Paying Agent shall be in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to the Company. The Cash Consideration portion of such
Merger Consideration made available to the Paying Agent shall be invested by
the Paying Agent, as directed by Parent; _provided_ that such investments
shall be in (i) obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America,
(ii) commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys
Investors Services, Inc. or Standard and Poors, respectively, (iii) deposit
accounts, certificates of deposit or bankers acceptances of, repurchase or
reverse repurchase agreements with, or Eurodollar time deposits purchased
from, commercial banks, each of which has capital, surplus and undivided
profits aggregating more than $1.0 billion (based on the most recent financial
statements of such bank which are then publicly available at the SEC
or otherwise), (iv) money market funds having a rating in the highest
investment category granted by a recognized credit rating agency at the time
of investment or (v) a combination of the foregoing, in each case, pending
payment thereof by the Paying Agent to the holders of Shares pursuant to this
_Article II_. Any interest and other income resulting from such investment
shall become a part of the Exchange Fund, and any amounts in excess of the
level required to make prompt cash payment of the Cash Consideration shall be
promptly returned to the Surviving Corporation. To the extent that there are
losses with respect to such investments, or the Exchange Fund diminishes for
other reasons below the level required to make prompt cash payment of the
Cash Consideration as contemplated hereby, Parent shall promptly replace or
restore the cash in the Exchange Fund lost through such investments or other
events so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all times maintained at a
level sufficient for the Paying Agent to promptly make such cash payments. For
the avoidance of doubt, the Exchange Fund deposited with the Paying Agent at
or immediately following the Effective Time shall include the portion of
the Cash Consideration or the shares of Parent Common Stock or Convertible
Notes that would otherwise be payable to the Dissenting Stockholders in
respect of their Dissenting Stockholder Shares.

 



-5- (b) _Procedures for Surrender_.

 

(i) _Certificates_. Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the
Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record (as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time) of a Certificate whose Shares were converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration at the Effective Time pursuant to this
Agreement: (A) a letter of transmittal in customary form, reasonably
acceptable to Parent and the Company (" _Letter of Transmittal_ "), which
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the
Paying Agent, and shall otherwise be in such form and have such other
provisions as Parent may reasonably specify after consultation with the
Company; and (B) instructions for effecting the surrender of the Certificates
in exchange for the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant
to the provisions of this _Article II_. Upon surrender of Certificates for
cancellation to the Paying Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be
appointed by Parent, and upon delivery of a Letter of Transmittal, duly
executed and in proper form with respect to such Certificates, and such other
documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of
such Certificates shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (x) the
Merger Consideration into which such shares of Company Common Stock have been
converted pursuant to _Section 2.01(b)_ and (y) any cash in lieu of
fractional shares that the holder has the right to receive pursuant to
_Section 2.02(b)(v)_ and in respect of any dividends or other distributions
that the holder has the right to receive pursuant to this _Section 2.02(b)_.

 

(ii) _Book-Entry Shares_. Any holder of Book-Entry Shares whose Shares were
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration at the Effective
Time pursuant to this Agreement shall not be required to deliver a Certificate
or an executed Letter of Transmittal to the Paying Agent to receive the Merger
Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to this
Agreement. In lieu thereof, each such holder shall, upon receipt by the Paying
Agent of an "agents message" (or such other evidence, if any, of surrender as
the Paying Agent may reasonably request) be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor (x) the Merger Consideration into which such shares of Company Common
Stock have been converted pursuant to _Section 2.01_ and (y) any cash in lieu
of fractional shares that the holder has the right to receive pursuant to
_Section 2.02(b)(v)_ and in respect of any dividends or other distributions
that the holder has the right to receive pursuant to this _Section 2.02(b)_.
Payment of the Merger Consideration with respect to Book-Entry Shares shall
only be made to the person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares are
registered.

 



-6- (iii) _Transfer of Shares_. In the event of a transfer of ownership
of Company Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of the
Company, payment may be made and the Merger Consideration may be issued to a
person other than the person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is
registered, if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise
be in proper form for transfer and the person requesting such payment pays any
transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason of the payment of the
Merger Consideration to a person other than the registered holder of the
Certificate so surrendered or shall establish to the satisfaction of Parent
that such Taxes either have been paid or are not required to be paid.

 

(iv) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares of Parent Common
Stock_. No dividends or other distributions declared or made after the
Effective Time with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock with a record
date after the Effective Time will be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
Certificate or Book-Entry Share with respect to the shares of Parent Common
Stock represented thereby, and no cash payment in lieu of any fractional
shares will be paid to any such holder, until the holder of such Certificate
or Book-Entry Share surrenders such Certificate or Book-Entry Share. Subject
to the effect of escheat, Tax or other applicable laws, following surrender
of any such Certificate or Book-Entry Share, the holder of the Certificate or
Book-Entry Share representing whole shares of Parent Common Stock issued in
exchange therefor will be paid, without interest, (i) promptly, the amount of
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
and theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock
and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other
distributions, with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to
surrender and a payment date occurring after surrender, payable with respect
to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock.

 

(v) _No Fractional Shares; No Fractional Convertible Notes_.

 

(A) No fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued in the Merger,
but in lieu thereof each former holder of Shares otherwise entitled to a
fractional share of Parent Common Stock (after aggregating all fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock issuable to such holder) will be entitled to
receive, from the Paying Agent in accordance with the provisions of this
_Section 2.02(b)(v)_, a cash payment (rounded to the nearest whole cent) in
lieu of such fractional share of Parent Common Stock representing such
holders proportionate interest, if any, in the proceeds from the sale by
the Paying Agent (reduced by any fees of the Paying Agent attributable to
such sale) in one or more transactions of shares of Parent Common Stock equal
to the excess of (A) the aggregate number of shares of Parent Common Stock to
be delivered to the Exchange Agent by Parent pursuant to _Section 2.02(b)_
over (B) the aggregate number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock to be
distributed to the holders of Shares pursuant to _Section 2.02(b)_ (such
excess, the " _Excess Shares_ "). The parties acknowledge that payment of the
cash consideration in lieu of issuing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock
was not separately bargained-for consideration but merely represents a
mechanical rounding off for purposes of avoiding the expense

 



-7-  and inconvenience to Parent that would otherwise be caused by the issuance
of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock. As soon as reasonably practicable
after the Effective Time, the Paying Agent, as agent for the holders of
Shares that would otherwise receive fractional shares of Parent Common Stock,
shall sell the Excess Shares at the then-prevailing prices on the NYSE in the
manner provided in _Section 2.02(b)(v)(B)_.

 

(B) The sale of the Excess Shares by the Paying Agent, as agent for the
holders of Shares that would otherwise receive fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock, shall be executed on the NYSE through one or more member firms
of the NYSE and shall be executed in round lots to the extent practicable.
Until the proceeds of such sale or sales have been distributed to the holders
of Shares, the Paying Agent shall hold such proceeds in trust for the holders
of Shares that would otherwise receive fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock (the " _Common Shares Trust_ "). The Paying Agent shall determine
the portion of the Common Shares Trust to which each former holder of Shares
shall be entitled, if any, by multiplying (I) the amount of the aggregate
proceeds comprising the Common Shares Trust by (II) a fraction, (x) the
numerator of which is the amount of the fractional share interest to which
such former holder of Shares would otherwise be entitled and (y) the
denominator of which is the aggregate amount of fractional share interests to
which all holders of Shares would otherwise be entitled.

(C) No fraction of a Convertible Note shall be issued pursuant to the issuance
of Convertible Note Consideration in the Merger, but in lieu thereof each
former holder of Shares otherwise entitled to any fractional Convertible Notes
(after aggregating all fractional Convertible Notes issuable to such holder)
will be entitled to receive, from the Paying Agent in accordance with the
provisions of this _Section 2.02(b)(v)_, a cash payment (rounded to the
nearest whole cent) in lieu of such fractional Convertible Notes equal to the
face value of such fractional Convertible Notes. The parties acknowledge that
payment of the cash consideration in lieu of issuing fractional Convertible
Notes was not separately bargained-for consideration but merely represents a
mechanical rounding off for purposes of avoiding the expense
and inconvenience to Parent that would otherwise be caused by the issuance of
fractional Convertible Notes.

(D) As soon as practicable after the determination of the amount of cash, if
any, to be paid to holders of Shares in lieu of any fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock and Convertible Notes, the Paying Agent shall make
available such amounts to such holders of shares of Parent Common Stock and
Convertible Notes without interest, subject to and in accordance with _Section
2.02_.

 



-8- (c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock; Closing of
Transfer Books_. As of the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the
Company shall be closed, and there shall be no further registration of
transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of the Shares that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than registrations
of transfers to reflect, with customary settlement procedures, trades effected
prior to the Effective Time. The Merger Consideration paid in accordance with
the terms of this _Article II_ upon surrender of any Shares shall be deemed
to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such
Shares. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Shares outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with
respect to such Shares except as otherwise provided for herein or by
applicable law. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent
for any reason, they shall be canceled and, subject to the procedures set
forth in _Section 2.02(b)_, exchanged as provided in this _Article II_ ,
except as otherwise required by law.

 

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund; Abandoned Property_. Any portion of the
Exchange Fund (including any interest or other income received by the Paying
Agent with respect to all of the funds made available to it) that remains
undistributed to the holders of the Shares for one year after the Effective
Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation, upon demand, and any
holders of the Shares who have not theretofore complied with this _Article II_
shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation as general creditor
thereof (subject to abandoned property, escheat and other similar laws)
for payment of their claim for Merger Consideration.

(e) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in  _Section
2.02(d)_, none of Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent or any of their respective directors, officers, employees and agents
shall be liable to any holder of a Share for Merger Consideration
delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar law. If any Certificate (or affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof as provided in _Section 2.02(g)_) shall not have been surrendered
prior to the date on which the Merger Consideration represented by such
Certificate would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
Governmental Authority, any such Merger Consideration shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable law, become the property of the Surviving
Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any person previously
entitled thereto.

(f)  _Withholding Rights_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
each of Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent, as
applicable, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration
payable pursuant to, or in accordance with, this Agreement to any person such
amounts as Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent,
as applicable, are required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making
of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "
_Code_ ") or any other provision of applicable federal, state, local or
foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld by
Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as the
case may be, such deducted and withheld amounts shall be (i) remitted by
Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as
applicable, to the applicable Governmental Authority, and (ii) treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the person in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, Merger Sub, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as the case may be.

 



-9- (g) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate shall
have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that
fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed
and, if required by Parent, the posting by such person of a bond in such
reasonable amount as Parent may direct as indemnity against any claim that
may be made against it or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such
Certificate, the Paying Agent shall issue, or pay or cause to be paid, in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger
Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional shares and any dividends and
distributions on such Certificate, in each case deliverable in respect thereof
pursuant to this Agreement.

 

(h) _Adjustments to Merger Consideration_. In the event that the Company or
Parent changes the number of shares of Company Common Stock, Parent Common
Stock or securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for shares
of Company Common Stock or Parent Common Stock, as applicable, issued and
outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a result of a reclassification,
stock split (including a reverse stock split), stock dividend or distribution,
subdivision, exchange or readjustment of shares, or other similar transaction,
then any number or amount contained herein which is based upon the price of
Parent Common Stock, including the Measurement Price, or the number of shares
of Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock, as the case may be, the Stock
Consideration, Convertible Note Consideration, the Cash Consideration and any
other similarly dependent items shall be equitably adjusted to reflect such
change; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this _Section 2.02(h)_ shall
be deemed to permit or authorize any party hereto to effect any such change
that it is not otherwise authorized or permitted to undertake pursuant to
this Agreement.

Section 2.03 _Treatment of Company Employee Stock Plan_. The Company will
adopt resolutions and provide all required notices to effect the following:

(a) _Effect on Vested Company Stock Options_. Subject to any written
agreement between the relevant holder and Parent and/or the Company, at the
Effective Time, each Company Stock Option (or portion thereof) that is
outstanding, vested, and unexercised as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time (or that vests as a result of the occurrence of the Effective Time) (each
a " _Vested Company Option_ "), shall without any action on the part of
Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holder thereof, other than the Company
delivering any notices required pursuant to the terms of the Company Employee
Stock Plan, be converted into and shall become a right to receive an amount in
cash (without interest) to be paid through the Companys payroll system equal
to the product of: (1) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time
and (2) the excess, if any, of (A) the sum of (x) the Stock Consideration
multiplied by the Measurement Price, (y) the principal amount of the
Convertible Note Consideration, and (z) the Cash Consideration less (B) the
exercise price per share of such Company Stock Option (the " _Option Payment_
"), less any required Tax withholdings. Each then outstanding and unvested
Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, that is held by

 



-10-  a non-employee director or person who shall not continue to provide services
to the Company or any subsidiary on or after the Effective Time shall vest in
full as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and be treated as a Vested
Company Option under this Agreement. At or immediately following the Effective
Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with the Company,
for the benefit of the holders of Company Stock Options, a cash amount in
immediately available funds equal to the aggregate amount of the Option
Payments to be paid through the Companys payroll systems.

 

(b) _Effect on Unvested Company Options_. Subject to any written agreement
between the relevant holder and Parent and/or the Company, as of the
Effective Time, each Company Stock Option that is outstanding and unexercised
as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than a Vested Company
Option), shall be assumed by Parent and shall be converted into a
Parent Stock Option in accordance with this _Section 2.03_. Each such Parent
Stock Option as so assumed and converted shall continue to have, and shall be
subject to, the same terms and conditions as applied to the Company Stock
Option immediately prior to the Effective Time (but taking into account any
changes thereto provided for in the applicable Company Employee Stock Plan, in
any award agreement or in such Company Stock Option by reason of this
Agreement or the Merger). As of the Effective Time, each such Parent Stock
Option as so assumed and converted shall be exercisable for that number of
whole shares of Parent Common Stock determined by multiplying the number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Equity Award Exchange Ratio,
rounded down to the nearest whole share, at a per share exercise price
determined by dividing the per share exercise price of such Company Stock
Option immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Equity Award Exchange
Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole cent; _provided_ , _however_ , that
each Company Stock Option (i) which is an "incentive stock option" (as defined
in Section 422 of the Code) shall be adjusted in accordance with the
requirements of Section 424 of the Code, and (ii) shall be adjusted in a
manner which complies with Section 409A of the Code. Promptly following the
Effective Time, but in no event more than ten (10) Business Days after the
Closing Date, Parent shall issue to each holder of an outstanding Company
Stock Option that is converted into a Parent Stock Option hereunder a document
evidencing the foregoing assumption of such Company Stock Option by Parent.

(c) _Effect on Company Restricted Stock Units_. Subject to any written
agreement between the relevant holder and Parent and/or the Company, as of the
Effective Time, each Company Restricted Stock Unit (or portion thereof) that
is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (but excluding,
for the avoidance of doubt, any Company Restricted Stock Unit (or portion
thereof) that becomes vested as a result of the consummation of the Merger and
is settled in Shares that, in turn, converts into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.01 shall be assumed by Parent and
shall be converted into a Parent Restricted Stock Unit in accordance with this
_Section 2.03_. Each such Parent Restricted Stock Unit as so assumed and
converted shall continue to have, and shall be subject to, the same terms and
conditions as applied to the Company Restricted Stock Unit immediately prior
to the Effective Time (but taking into account any changes thereto provided
for in the 

 



-11-  Company Employee Stock Plan, in any award agreement or in such Company
Restricted Stock Unit by reason of this Agreement or the Merger). As of the
Effective Time, each such Parent Restricted Stock Unit as so assumed and
converted shall represent the right to receive that number of whole shares of
Parent Common Stock determined by multiplying the number of shares of Company
Common Stock subject to such Company Restricted Stock Unit immediately prior
to the Effective Time by the Equity Award Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the
nearest whole share. Promptly following the Effective Time, but in no event
more than ten (10) Business Days after the Closing Date, Parent shall issue
to each holder of a Company Restricted Stock Unit that is converted into a
Parent Restricted Stock Unit a document evidencing the foregoing assumption of
such Company Restricted Stock Unit by Parent. Each then outstanding Company
Restricted Stock Unit immediately prior to the Effective Time, that is held
by a non-employee director or person who shall not continue to provide
services to the Company on or after the Effective Time shall vest in full as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time and settled in Shares that, in
turn, convert into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to
Section 2.01.

 

(d) _Effect on Company LTIP Awards_. As of the Effective Time, each Company
LTIP Award that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall by its terms and without any action on the part of Parent or the
Company, become fully vested and converted into the right to receive a payment
(each, an " _LTIP Payment_ "), calculated in accordance with the applicable
LTIP Plan, and payable in accordance with the terms thereof. Following the
Effective Time, Parent shall pay, or cause to be paid, each LTIP Payment in
accordance with the terms of the applicable LTIP Plan and any applicable
award agreement.

(e) _Form S-8_. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time (but in no
event later than ten Business Days following the Effective Time), Parent shall
cause to be filed with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any
successor form), if available for use by Parent, relating to the shares of
Parent Common Stock issuable with respect to such Parent Stock Options, Parent
Restricted Stock Units, and Company LTIP Awards eligible for registration
on Form S-8.

(f) _Definitions_. For purposes of this Section 2.03: 

(i) " _Equity Award Exchange Ratio_ " shall mean the sum of (1) the Exchange
Ratio, (2) the quotient of: (A) the principal amount of the Convertible Note
Consideration divided by (B) the Equity Award Measurement Price and rounding
the result to the nearest 1/100,000 of a share, and (3) the quotient of: (A)
the Cash Consideration divided by (B) the Equity Award Measurement Price and
rounding the result to the nearest 1/100,000 of a share.

 

(ii) " _Equity Award Measurement Price_ " means the volume weighted average
price per share of Parent Common Stock (rounded to the nearest cent) on the
NYSE for the ten (10) consecutive trading days ending on (and including) the

the Wall Street Journal, any other authoritative source mutually agreed by
Parent and the Company).

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

 

Section 3.01 _Representations and Warranties of the Company_. Except as set
forth in (i) the letter dated the date of this Agreement and delivered to
Parent by the Company concurrently with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement (it being understood that, other than in the case of _Section
3.01(c)_ (Authority), _Section 3.01(s)_ (Vote Required), or _Section
3.01(u)_ (Takeover Laws Inapplicable), disclosure of any item in any section
or subsection of such disclosure letter shall also be deemed to be disclosed
with respect to any other section or subsection only if the relevance of such
item is readily apparent from the face of such disclosure) (the " _Company
Disclosure Letter_ ") or (ii) to the extent the qualifying nature of such
disclosure is readily apparent therefrom, as set forth in the Company SEC
Reports publicly filed with the SEC on or after January 1, 2014 and at least
two calendar days prior to the date hereof (but excluding any forward-looking
statements, or statements that are predictive, forward-looking or

qualify the representations and warranties set forth in _Section 3.01(c)_
(Authority),  _Section 3.01(s)_ (Vote Required), or _Section 3.01(u)_
(Takeover Laws Inapplicable)), the Company represents and warrants to Parent
as follows:

whether or not applicable to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,

material increase in the amount of, compensation or benefits due any current
or former employee, director or officer of the Company or its subsidiaries,

benefits with respect to any such employee, director or officer or (C)
an entitlement of any such employee, director or officer to severance pay,
unemployment compensation or any other payment or other benefit.

deferred compensation plan" subject to Section 409A of the Code (A)

Company or any of its subsidiaries and who is not treated as an employee for
federal income tax purposes by the Company or its subsidiaries is not an
employee under applicable law or for any purpose including, without
limitation, for Tax withholding purposes or Company Employee Benefit Plan
participation purposes. The Company and its subsidiaries have no material
liability by reason of an individual who performs or performed services for
the Company or its subsidiaries in any capacity being improperly excluded

Company Material Adverse Effect. There are no Environmental Claims, actions or

person, on the other hand), or any "off-balance sheet arrangements"

schedules, annexes, supplements and other related documents), each dated on
or about the date of this Agreement (as amended, modified, supplemented,
replaced or extended from time to time after the date of this Agreement in
compliance with this Agreement, the " _Debt Financing Commitments_ "), from
each of the financing sources identified therein (collectively, the " _Debt
Financing Sources_ "), pursuant to which the Debt Financing Sources have
committed, subject to the terms and conditions thereof, to provide debt
financing in the amounts set forth therein for the purpose of funding the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Affiliate Sale
(collectively, the " _Debt Financing_ "), together with a customarily redacted
fee letter from the Debt Financing Sources related to the Debt Financing (the
" _Fee Letter_ ").

(ii) Except for the Fee Letter or as expressly set forth in the Debt
Financing Commitments, as of the date of this Agreement, there are no side
letters or other agreements, Contracts or written arrangements to which Parent
or any of its affiliates is a party related to the funding or investing, as
applicable, of the Debt Financing which could reasonably be expected to
adversely affect the availability of the Debt Financing contemplated by the
Debt Financing Commitments. Assuming satisfaction of the conditions set forth
in _Section 6.01 _(to the extent any such condition is a condition under the
control of the Company) and _Section 6.03_, Parent does not have any reason
to believe, as of the date of this Agreement, that it or any of its
subsidiaries or affiliates will be unable to satisfy all conditions to be
satisfied by it, its subsidiaries and its controlled affiliates with respect
to any of the Debt Financing Commitments at the time it, its subsidiaries and
its affiliates is required to consummate the Closing hereunder or that the
Debt Financing will not be available to Parent or its affiliates party thereto
at the Closing, including any reason to believe that any of the Debt Financing
Sources will not perform their respective funding obligations under the Debt
Financing Commitments in accordance with their respective terms and
conditions.

 

(iii) As of the date hereof, there are no conditions precedent or other
contingencies (including pursuant to any "flex" provisions) related to the
funding of the full amount of the Debt Financing pursuant to the Debt
Financing Commitments, other than as expressly set forth in the Debt Financing
Commitments. Assuming the Debt Financing is funded in accordance with the
Debt Financing Commitments, the net proceeds contemplated by the Debt
Financing Commitments, together with other financial resources of Parent,
whether directly held or available for use by Parent, and its controlled
affiliates including cash on hand and the proceeds of loans under existing
credit facilities of Parent or its controlled affiliates on the Closing Date
and funds that will be provided by controlled affiliates of Parent pursuant to
the Affiliate Sale Agreement, in the aggregate, shall provide Parent and
Merger Sub with cash proceeds on the Closing Date sufficient for the

paid pursuant to _Article II_, any fees and expenses of or payable by Parent,
Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation in connection with the Merger and the
Debt Financing and any indebtedness required to be repaid, redeemed, retired,
canceled, terminated or otherwise satisfied in connection with the Merger

be repaid, redeemed, retired, canceled, terminated or otherwise satisfied in
connection with the Merger).

 

(iv) As of the date of this Agreement, the Debt Financing Commitments are in
full force and effect and constitute valid and binding obligations of Parent
and any of its affiliates party thereto and, to the knowledge of Parent, each
other party thereto, enforceable in accordance with their terms against Parent
and any of its affiliates party thereto and, to the knowledge of Parent, each
other party thereto (except as such enforcement may be subject to applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws, now
or hereafter in effect, relating to creditors rights generally, and general
equitable principles) and, as of the date of this Agreement, no event has
occurred that, with or without notice, lapse of time, or both, would
reasonably be expected to constitute a default or breach or a failure to
satisfy a condition precedent on the part of Parent or any affiliate of
Parent or, to the knowledge of Parent, any other party thereto under the terms
and conditions of the Debt Financing Commitments. Parent (or its applicable
affiliate) has paid in full any and all commitment fees or other fees
required to be paid pursuant to the terms of the Debt Financing Commitments
and the Fee Letters on or before the date of this Agreement. As of the date

modified, amended or otherwise altered (and no such modification, amendment or
alteration is contemplated by Parent or, to the knowledge of Parent, any other
party thereto) and (ii) none of the respective commitments under any of the
Debt Financing Commitments have been withdrawn, terminated or rescinded (and
no such withdrawal, termination or recission is contemplated by Parent or, to
the knowledge of Parent, any other party thereto).

 

(v) Neither Parent nor Merger Sub is entering into this Agreement or the Debt
Financing Commitment with the intent to hinder, delay or defraud either

and equity awards pursuant to _Article II_ , payment of all amounts required

the issuance of the Convertible Notes pursuant to the Merger, and payment of
all related fees and expenses, each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation

value" of the assets of such person will, as of

 



-48-  such date, exceed (i) the value of all "liabilities of such person,
including contingent and other liabilities," as of such date, as such quoted

engaged or proposed to be engaged following such date, and (c) such person

liabilities, as they mature. For purposes of this definition, "not have an
unreasonably small amount of capital for the operation of the businesses
in which it is engaged or proposed to be engaged" and "able to pay its
liabilities, including contingent and other liabilities, as they mature" means
that such person will be able to generate enough cash from operations,

bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws, now
or hereafter in effect, relating to creditors rights generally, and
general equitable principles) and, as of the date of this Agreement, no event
has occurred that, with or without notice, lapse of time, or both, would
reasonably be expected to constitute a default or breach or a failure to
satisfy a condition precedent on the part of Parent or any affiliate of
Parent or, to the knowledge of Parent, any other party thereto under the terms
and conditions of the Affiliate Sale Agreement. As of the date hereof, the
Affiliate Sale Agreement has not been modified, amended or otherwise altered

not in compliance in all material respects with the terms of any such Permits,
except for any such claim or notice as would not be material to Parent and

individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect: (A) each

each of the Parent, Merger Sub, and each of their respective subsidiaries, is,
and since January 1, 2012 has been, in compliance in all material respects

applicable laws governing the collection or use (including the storage,
display, transfer, dissemination and other disposition) of any personal or

material privacy policies, programs or other notices that concern Parents,
Merger Subs or any of their respective subsidiaries collection or use of any
personal information of any person. Since January 1, 2012, (A) to the

security breaches, (2) complaints or notices to Parent or any of its
subsidiaries, or (3) audits, proceedings or investigations conducted or
claims asserted by any other person (including any Governmental Authority)

storage, display, transfer, dissemination and other disposition) of any
personal or other sensitive information of any person, or any material
violation of applicable law, by Parent or any of its subsidiaries, and (B) no
such claim is pending or, to the knowledge of the Parent, threatened,

or otherwise in order for Parent to consummate the Merger; and (ii) the
affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of common
stock of Merger Sub entitled to vote thereon is the only vote of the holders
of any class or series of capital stock of Merger Sub necessary for Merger Sub
to adopt this Agreement and approve and consummate the Merger and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(q) _Taxes_. Except as has not had, and would not reasonably be expected to
have, a Parent Material Adverse Effect, Parent and each of its subsidiaries
have filed all material Tax Returns required to be filed by any of them and
have paid, or have adequately reserved (in accordance with GAAP) for the
payment of, all material Taxes required to be paid (whether or not shown on
any Tax Returns). The most recent financial statements contained in the Parent
SEC Reports reflect an adequate reserve (in accordance with GAAP) for all
material Taxes payable by the Company and its subsidiaries through the date of
such financial statements. No material deficiencies for any Taxes have been
asserted or assessed, or proposed, against Parent or any of its subsidiaries
that are not subject to adequate reserves (in accordance with GAAP). No audit
or other examination of any Tax Return of Parent or any of its subsidiaries
is presently in progress, nor has Parent or any of its subsidiaries been
notified of any request for such an audit or other examination.

receive from the Company certain estimates, projections, forecasts and other
forward-looking information, as well as certain business plan and cost-related
plan information, regarding the Company, its subsidiaries and their respective
business and operations. Parent and Merger Sub hereby acknowledge that there
are uncertainties inherent in attempting to make such estimates, projections,
forecasts and other forward-looking information, with which Parent and Merger
Sub are familiar, that Parent and Merger Sub are taking full responsibility
for making their own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of all estimates,
projections, forecasts and other forward-looking information, as well as such

its subsidiaries, nor any of their respective stockholders, members,
directors, officers, employees, affiliates, advisors, agents or
Representatives, nor any other person, has made or is making any
representation or warranty with respect to such estimates, projections,
forecasts, forward-looking information, business plans or cost-related plans.
Except for the representations and warranties contained in Article III,
Parent acknowledges that neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries nor
any Representative of any such persons or any of their respective subsidiaries
makes, and Parent acknowledges that it has not relied upon or otherwise
been induced by, any other express or implied representation or warranty by
or on behalf of any of such persons or with respect to any other information

entering into or participating in discussions or negotiations with, any person
(and such persons Representatives) in response to an unsolicited, written
Company Takeover Proposal (that is not withdrawn) made after the date hereof
that the Company Board or any committee thereof concludes in good faith, after
consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel,
constitutes or would reasonably be expected to result in a Company Superior
Proposal, if (A) such Company Takeover Proposal did not result from a
material breach of this _Section 4.03_ with respect to such Company Takeover
Proposal, (B) the Company Board or any committee thereof concludes in good
faith that, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, the failure to
take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable law, and (C) the Company has received (and provided a copy to
Parent) from the person making such Company Takeover Proposal an executed
confidentiality agreement between the Company and such person containing terms
and conditions that are substantially similar to those contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of June 8, 2015 (the " _Confidentiality
Agreement_ "), between Parent and the Company; _provided_ , _however_ , that
such confidentiality agreement shall not be required to include a direct or
indirect standstill provision. The Company shall promptly (and in any event
within twenty four (24) hours) make available to Parent and its
Representatives any nonpublic information concerning the Company and its
subsidiaries that is provided to the person making such Company
Takeover Proposal or its Representatives that was not previously made
available to Parent or its Representatives and provide Parent with written
notice confirming that such disclosure is being made pursuant to the Companys
obligations under this  _Section 4.03(a)_. For purposes of this Agreement, "
_Company Takeover Proposal_ " means any _bona fide_ proposal or offer from any
person or "group" (as defined in or under Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act)

constitutes or generates 20% or more of the net revenues, net income or
assets (including equity securities) of the Company and its subsidiaries,

representing 20% or more of the consolidated assets of the Company and its

course of business consistent with past practice, (ii) any direct or indirect

offer that if consummated would result in any person beneficially owning 20%
or more of any class of voting securities of the Company, (iv) any merger,
consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, reorganization or other
similar transaction pursuant to which the holders of Company Common Stock
immediately preceding such transaction hold, directly or indirectly, (A) less
than 80% of the equity interests in the surviving or resulting entity of such
transaction or (B) businesses or assets that constitute less than 80% of the
consolidated assets of the Company and its subsidiaries (v) any liquidation,
dissolution or similar transaction involving the Company or any subsidiary of
the Company or Company Joint Venture (including, for the avoidance of doubt
any Tax Equity Fund) that is or that owns, operates or controls a Company
Material Business, in each case other than the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement; _provided_ , however, that no proposal, offer or transaction
involving any Tax Equity Investor, lender, or customer, but to which
the Company is not party, shall be deemed to be a "Company Takeover Proposal;
_provided_ , _further_ , _however_ , that all (A) actions undertaken in
accordance with the Tax Equity Transaction Documents and (B)
offers, indications and inquiries, the negotiation of and any preparation for
the entry into and the entry into new Company Joint Ventures that the Company
believes would have been Tax Equity Funds if they had been entered into prior
to the date hereof shall be deemed not to be Company Takeover Proposals. The
Company agrees that in the event any of its controlled affiliates or
subsidiaries or Representatives takes any action which, if taken by the
Company, would constitute a breach of this  _Section 4.03_, the Company
shall be deemed to be in breach of this _Section 4.03_; _provided_ ,
_further_ , _however_ , for the avoidance of doubt, that no Tax Equity
Investor or lender shall be deemed to be a Representative of the Company, any
of its subsidiaries or any Company Joint Venture.

(b) The Company shall promptly, and in no event later than twenty-four (24)
hours after the directors or officers of the Company become aware of the
occurrence of any event set forth in clauses (i) and (ii) below, and in any
event within forty-eight (48) hours, after its receipt of (i) any Company
Takeover Proposal or (ii) any indication of interest or request for nonpublic
information in connection with a Company Takeover Proposal, advise Parent
orally and in writing of such Company Takeover Proposal or request (including
providing the identity of the person or group of persons making or submitting
such Company Takeover Proposal or request and (A) if it is in writing, a copy
of such Company Takeover Proposal and any related draft agreements or (B) if
it is oral, a reasonably detailed summary thereof). The Company shall promptly
advise Parent orally and in writing with respect to any change to the material
terms of any such Company Takeover Proposal (and in no event later than 48
hours following any such change or, solely if such change is with respect to
the purchase price offered, in no event later than 24 hours following such
change in purchase price).

 

(c) Upon the execution of this Agreement, the Company shall, and shall cause
its subsidiaries and its and their respective officers, directors and
employees, and shall instruct and use its reasonable best efforts to cause its
controlled affiliates and its and their respective Representatives to,
immediately cease and terminate any existing activities, discussions
or negotiations between the Company or any of its controlled affiliates or
subsidiaries or any of their respective officers, directors, employees or

 



-62-  Representatives, on the one hand, and any other person, on the other hand
(other than Parent, Merger Sub and each of their respective Representatives)
that relate to any Company Takeover Proposal and shall promptly deliver a
written notice to each such person to the effect that the Company is ending
all activities, discussions and negotiations with such person with respect to
any Company Takeover Proposal, effective on the date of this Agreement, and
shall use its reasonable best efforts, including through the exercise of any
contractual rights, to obtain the prompt return or destruction of any
confidential information previously furnished to such persons within
twelve (12) months of the date hereof. Subject to any waivers that may be
granted pursuant to and in accordance with _Section 4.03(d)(iii)_, during the
period from the date of this Agreement through the Effective Time or, if

, the Company shall enforce, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable
law, the provisions of any confidentiality, standstill or similar agreement to
which it or any of its subsidiaries is a party relating to or entered into in
connection with a proposed business combination involving the Company (or
other proposed transaction that is within the scope of the term " _Company
Takeover Proposal_ ") (a " _Standstill Agreement_ "), including by obtaining
injunctions to prevent any breaches of such Standstill Agreements and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions thereof; _provided_ , _however_
, that the Company may waive any Standstill Agreement to the extent necessary
to allow the counterparty thereof to make a confidential Company Takeover
Proposal to the Company Board prior to receipt of the Company Stockholder
Approval in compliance with this Agreement if (and only if) the Company Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and
outside legal counsel, that failure to take such action would be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties under applicable law.

 

(d) Subject to _Section 4.03(e)_ and _Section 4.03(f)_, none of the Company,
the Company Board or any committee thereof may: (i) (A) withhold, withdraw,
qualify or modify, or publicly propose to withhold, withdraw, qualify or
modify, the recommendation of the Company Board or any committee thereof that
the Companys stockholders adopt the Merger and the transactions contemplated
hereby (the " _Company Recommendation_ "), (B) fail to include the Company
Recommendation in the Joint Proxy/S-4, (C) approve, endorse, recommend or
otherwise declare advisable (publicly or otherwise) or propose to approve,
endorse or recommend, or otherwise declare advisable (publicly or otherwise)

Recommendation within ten (10) Business Days after Parent so requests in
writing, after the first public announcement of a Company Takeover Proposal by
the Company or by the party that made the Company Takeover Proposal (any of
the foregoing, a " _Company Change of Recommendation_ "); (ii) enter into a
letter of intent, agreement in principle, memorandum of understanding, merger
agreement, asset or share purchase or share exchange agreement, option
agreement, confidentiality agreement (other than a confidentiality agreement
pursuant to _Section 4.03(a)_) or other similar agreement (a " _Takeover
Agreement_ ") relating to a Company Takeover Proposal; or (iii) grant any
waiver, amendment or release under any Standstill Agreement, any Takeover Law
or any Takeover Provisions; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company may
waive any Standstill Agreement, Takeover Law or any Takeover Provisions to the
extent necessary to allow the counterparty thereof to make a confidential
Company Takeover Proposal to the Company Board prior to receipt of the Company
Stockholder Approval in compliance with this Agreement if (and only if) the
Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial
advisors and outside legal counsel, that failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law.



 



-63- (e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Company
Board or any committee thereof may, prior to the receipt of the Company
Stockholder Approval, (i) effect a Company Change of Recommendation in respect
of a Company Takeover Proposal or Intervening Event and (ii) prior to the
expiration of the Post-Signing Period, terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 7.01(h)_ in order to enter into a written definitive agreement
providing for a Company Takeover Proposal, in the case of clause (i) and
clause (ii) if (and only if): (A) either (1) a written Company Takeover
Proposal is made to the Company after the date of this Agreement and has not
been withdrawn or (2) an Intervening Event has occurred and is continuing (B)
such Company Takeover Proposal or Intervening Event did not result from any
material breach of _Section 4.03_; (C) the Company Board or applicable
committee thereof determines in good faith after consultation with its
financial advisors and outside legal counsel that (1) in the case of a
Company Change of Recommendation in respect of a Company Takeover Proposal,
such Company Takeover Proposal constitutes a Company Superior Proposal or in
the case of a Company Change of Recommendation in respect of an Intervening
Event, such Intervening Event has occurred and is continuing and (2) failure
to take such action would be inconsistent with the Company Boards fiduciary
duties under applicable law; (D) the Company provides Parent three (3)
Business Days (the " _Recommendation Change Notice Period_ ") prior written
notice that if at the expiration of the Recommendation Change Notice Period,
such Company Takeover Proposal continues to be a Company Superior Proposal,
or such Intervening Event is continuing, as applicable, it intends to take
such action (a " _Recommendation Change Notice_ "), which notice shall include
the information with respect to such Company Superior Proposal that is
specified in _Section 4.03(b)_ (it being understood that (x) such
Recommendation Change Notice and any amendment or update to such notice and
the determination to so deliver such notice shall not constitute a Company
Change of Recommendation for purposes of this Agreement and (y) any material
revision or amendment to the terms of any Company Superior Proposal
(including, any change to the pricing thereof) shall require a new
Recommendation Change Notice, except that the Recommendation Change Notice
Period shall extend until the later to occur of (i) the expiration of the
initial Recommendation Change Notice Period and (ii) two (2) Business Days
following the date of such new Recommendation Change Notice); (E) during the
Recommendation Change Notice Period, the Company negotiates in good faith with
Parent and its Representatives, if requested by Parent, regarding any
adjustments or modifications to the terms of this Agreement; and (F) at the
end of the Recommendation Change Notice Period, the Company Board or
applicable committee again makes the determination in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors (and after
taking into account any adjustments or modifications proposed by Parent
during the Recommendation Change Notice Period), (1) that in the case of a
Company Change of Recommendation in respect of a Company Takeover Proposal,
such Company Takeover Proposal continues to be a Company Superior Proposal or
in the case of a Company Change of Recommendation in respect of an Intervening
Event, such Intervening Event is continuing and (2) that the failure to take
such action would be 

 



-64-  inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law. For purposes of
this Agreement, " _Company Superior Proposal_ " means any written Company
Takeover Proposal (that is not withdrawn), that did not result from a
material breach of this _Section 4.03_, and that the Company Board or
committee thereof determines in good faith, after consultation with its
financial advisors and outside legal counsel, (x) is reasonably likely to be
consummated in accordance with its terms, and (y) if consummated, would be
more favorable (taking into account such factors that the Company Board deems
relevant including (i) all financial and strategic considerations that the
Company Board deems relevant, relevant legal, financial, regulatory and other
aspects of such Company Takeover Proposal and the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) the identity of the third
party making such Company Takeover Proposal and (iii) the conditions,
prospects, timing for completion and likelihood of consummation in accordance
with its terms of such Company Takeover Proposal and the financing of such
Company Takeover Proposal) to the Companys stockholders than the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (taking into account all
of the terms of any proposal by Parent to amend or modify the terms of the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement), except
that the references to "20%" (including the reference to 20% in the definition
of "Company Material Business" in clause (i) of the definition of Company
Takeover Proposal) and 80% in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) of the definition
of "Company Takeover Proposal," in _Section 4.03_ shall each be deemed to be
a reference to 50.01% and 49.99%, respectively. For purposes of this
Agreement, an " _Intervening Event_ " means an event, fact, circumstance,
development or occurrence that materially affects the business, assets or
operations of the Company, its subsidiaries and the Company Joint Ventures,
taken as a whole, that is unknown to and is not reasonably foreseeable by the
Company Board as of the date of this Agreement and becomes known to the
Company Board prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval and does not
relate to a Company Takeover Proposal; provided, that in no event shall
changes in law constitute an Intervening Event.

(f) Nothing contained in this  _Section 4.03_ or elsewhere in this Agreement
shall prohibit the Company or the Company Board (or any committee thereof),
directly or indirectly through its Representatives, from (i) disclosing to the
Companys stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9
promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii) making any disclosure to its
stockholders if the Company Board (or any committee thereof) has determined,
after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to do so
would be inconsistent with applicable law; _provided_ , _however_ , that if
such disclosure relates to a Company Takeover Proposal, any disclosure made
pursuant to clause (i) or (ii) of this  _Section 4.03(f)_ (other than any
disclosure made in connection with a Company Change of Recommendation
permitted by _Section 4.03(e)_), shall be deemed to constitute a Company
Change of Recommendation unless the Company Board shall expressly publicly
reaffirm the Company Recommendation in such disclosure (it being understood,
however, that the disclosure of a "stop, look and listen" notice of the type
contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act in and of
itself shall not be deemed a Company Change of Recommendation).

 



-65- (g) If the Company Board or any committee thereof has determined to provide
a Recommendation Change Notice with respect to a Company Takeover Proposal
that constitutes a Company Superior Proposal, the parties hereby agree that,
subject to compliance with _Section 4.03(e)_ (except as modified by this 
_Section 4.03(g)_), and in order to enable the Company Board or committee
thereof to be sufficiently comfortable that such Company Superior Proposal
will remain available to the Company when and if this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to  _Section 7.01(d)_, the Company may enter into a binding letter
agreement (the " _Conditional Commitment"_ ) with the third party making such
Company Superior Proposal (the " _Committed Bidder_ "), which Conditional
Commitment (i) may provide that such Committed Bidder is obligated, on behalf
of the Company, to pay the Company Termination Fee and any other fee or
expense required to be paid by the Company pursuant to the relevant provisions
of  _Section 7.03_ of this Agreement in accordance with the terms thereof,
(ii) may attach as an exhibit thereto a fully negotiated agreement and plan of
merger relating to such Company Superior Proposal and (iii) may provide
that the Company shall enter into such agreement and/or such agreement
automatically become binding on the Company only on and after (and in no event
before) both (A) the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its
terms and (B) the payment by the Company of the Company Termination Fee or
any other fee or expense required to be paid under _Section 7.03_ and (C)
without limiting Parents or Merger Subs obligations under this Agreement,
shall not provide for the imposition of any liability or obligation on Parent
or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates following the termination of this
Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties further agree that in
the circumstances described in the immediately preceding sentence, until the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, (1) in no event
may the Conditional Commitment permit the Committed Bidder to make any SEC or
other regulatory filings in connection with the transactions contemplated by
Conditional Commitment until the termination of this Agreement, unless
otherwise required by law and (2) except as permitted by this _Section 4.03_,
the Company shall otherwise remain subject to all of its obligations under
this Agreement applicable thereto.

Section 4.04 _Other Actions_. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth
in this Agreement, including _Section 5.03_, (and provided that Parents
obligations to arrange and obtain the Debt Financing shall be governed solely
by _Section 4.05_) the Company and Parent shall cooperate with each other
and use (and shall cause their respective subsidiaries and controlled
affiliates to use) their respective reasonable best efforts to take or cause
to be taken all actions, and do or cause to be done all things, reasonably
necessary, proper or advisable on its (or their) part under this Agreement
and applicable law to (i) consummate and make effective the Merger as soon as
practicable and (ii) cause the satisfaction of all conditions set forth in
_Article VI_.

 

Section 4.05 _Financing_.

 

(a) _Efforts to Obtain the Financing_. Parent shall use its (and shall cause
its controlled affiliates to use their) reasonable best efforts to (i) take,
or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things
reasonably necessary, proper or advisable to arrange, obtain and consummate
the Debt Financing described in the Debt Financing Commitments on the terms
and conditions described therein, (ii) maintain in effect the Debt Financing
Commitments until the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and
comply with its, and cause its controlled affiliates to comply with their,
respective obligations thereunder, (iii) negotiate and enter into (and cause
its

 



-66-  controlled affiliates to negotiate and enter into) definitive agreements
with respect to, and including as contemplated in, the Debt Financing
Commitments on the terms and conditions (including the flex provisions, if
applicable) contained in the Debt Financing Commitments and Fee Letter or, if
available, on other terms that are, in the aggregate, not materially less
favorable to Parent (and its controlled affiliates, as applicable) than the
terms and conditions contained in the Debt Financing Commitments and would not
adversely affect in a material manner (including with respect to timing,
taking into account the expected timing of the Marketing Period) the ability
of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated herein,
(iv) to satisfy (or, if deemed advisable by Parent, in its sole discretion,
seek a waiver of) on a timely basis all conditions to funding in the Debt
Financing Commitments (other than any condition where the failure to be so
satisfied is a direct result of the Companys failure to furnish information
required to be furnished pursuant to _Section 4.05(b)_) and to consummate the
Debt Financing at or prior to the Closing (it being understood that any
bridge facility described in the Debt Financing Commitments may be terminated
or reduced in accordance with the terms of the applicable Debt Financing
Commitment); (v) to cause the Debt Financing Sources to fund the Financing at
or prior to the Closing, including by enforcing such persons funding
obligations (and the rights of Parent and its controlled affiliates) under the
Debt Financing Commitments; and (vi) to fully pay, or cause to be fully paid,
all commitment or other fees arising pursuant to the Debt Financing
Commitments as and when they become due. Parent shall not agree (and shall not
permit any of its controlled affiliate to agree) to any amendments or
modifications to, or grant any waivers of, any condition or other provision
under the Debt Financing Commitments without the prior written consent of the
Company to the extent such amendments, modifications or waivers would
reasonably be expected to (A) reduce the aggregate amount of cash proceeds
available from the Debt Financing such that such cash proceeds, together with
the financial resources of Parent and its controlled affiliates including cash
on hand and the proceeds of loans under existing credit facilities of Parent
or its subsidiaries on the Closing Date, in the aggregate, are insufficient to
fund the amounts required to be paid by Parent or Merger Sub under this
Agreement and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including, without limitation, to repay or refinance the
indebtedness contemplated to be repaid or refinanced by the Debt Financing),
(B) impose new or additional conditions, otherwise amend any of the conditions
to the Debt Financing or otherwise be reasonably likely to prevent or delay
or impair the ability of Parent (or any of its controlled affiliates) to
obtain the Debt Financing or consummate the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (C) prevent or delay (taking into account the
Marketing Period) the Closing or funding of the Debt Financing, (D) adversely
impact the ability of Parent to enforce its, or any of its controlled
affiliates ability to enforce their, rights against the other parties to the
Debt Financing Commitments or the definitive agreements with respect thereto,
in each case, relating to the funding thereunder, (E) provide for terms and
conditions (including any "flex" provisions) that are, in the aggregate,
materially less favorable to Parent (or any of its controlled affiliates) and
the Company than those in the Debt Financing Commitments or (F) make the
funding of the Debt Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining
the Debt Financing) materially less likely to occur; _provided_ , that subject
to the foregoing, Parent may consent to, replace or amend

 



-67-  the Debt Financing Commitments to add or replace lenders, lead arrangers,
bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities that have not executed the
Debt Financing Commitments as of the date hereof. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, Parent or Merger Sub shall give the Company
prompt notice (w) of any breach or default (or threatened breach or default)
by any party to any of the Debt Financing Commitments as well as any material
disputes or disagreements between or among any parties to the Debt Financing
Commitments, in each case, of which Parent or Merger Sub become aware, (x) of
the receipt of any written notice or other written communication from
any Debt Financing Party with respect to any breach, default, termination or
repudiation by any party to any of the Debt Financing Commitments or any
definitive document related to the Debt Financing or any provisions of the
Debt Financing Commitments or any definitive document related to the Debt
Financing, (y) if Parent and Merger Sub determine in good faith that they or
any of Parents controlled affiliates will not be able to satisfy any of their
obligations with respect to the Debt Financing, or that they will otherwise
not be able to obtain, some or any portion of the Debt Financing prior to the
Termination Date, including any determination that any of the Debt Financing
Parties will not perform their respective funding obligations under the Debt
Financing Commitments in accordance with their respective terms and conditions
or (z) of any termination or waiver, amendment or other modification of the
Debt Financing Commitments. If any portion of the Debt Financing contemplated
by the Debt Financing Commitments or any of the proceeds from the Affiliate
Sale become unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated (including
flex provisions, if applicable), and such portion is required to fund
any portion of the aggregate Cash Consideration and any fees, expenses and
other amounts contemplated to be paid by Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving
Corporation pursuant to this Agreement, including any indebtedness of the
Company that will be due and payable in connection with the Closing, Parent
and Merger Sub shall take any and all actions necessary (and shall cause
Parents controlled affiliates to take all actions necessary) to arrange and
obtain in replacement thereof alternative financing from alternative sources
in an amount sufficient to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and fund any portion of the aggregate Cash Consideration and fees,
expenses and other amounts contemplated to be paid by Parent, Merger Sub or
the Surviving Corporation pursuant to this Agreement, including any
indebtedness of the Company that will be due and payable at the Closing, as
promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event but in no event
later than the date on which the Closing would otherwise occur pursuant to
Section 1.02. Any reference in this Agreement to (1) the " _Debt Financing_ "
shall include any such alternative financing, (2) the " _Debt
Financing Commitments_ " shall include the commitment letter (including any
related exhibits, schedules, annexes, supplements and other related documents)
and the corresponding fee letter with respect to any such alternative
financing, and (3) the " _Debt Financing Parties_ " shall include the
financing institutions contemplated to provide any such alternative financing.
Parent shall keep, and shall cause its controlled affiliates to keep, the
Company informed on a reasonably current basis in reasonable detail of the
status of their efforts to arrange the Debt Financing and the structuring and
consummation of the Affiliate Sale and shall provide to the Company copies of
all Debt Financing Commitments (including any related fee letters
(customarily redacted), exhibits, schedules, annexes, supplements and other
related documents). Parent and

 



-68-  Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that, notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, the obligations to perform their respective
agreements hereunder, including to consummate the Closing subject to the
terms and conditions hereof, are not conditioned on obtaining of the Debt
Financing or any other financing or the consummation of the Affiliate Sale,
_and_ Parent and Merger Sub each acknowledge and agree that obtaining the
Debt Financing or any other financing is not a condition to the Closing and
that consummating the Affiliate Sale is not a condition to the Closing.
Whether or not the Debt Financing has been obtained or the Affiliate Sale has
been consummated, Parent and Merger Sub will each continue to be obligated,
subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Section
6.01 and Section 6.03, to consummate the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. The Company acknowledges that the covenants
and obligations contained in this _Section 4.05_ and the Debt Financing
Commitments are the sole and exclusive covenants and obligations of Parent and
its subsidiaries and each of their respective Representatives in connection
with obtaining the Debt Financing; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent and
Merger Sub expressly acknowledge and agree that Parents and Merger Subs
obligations to hold the Closing and consummate the Merger (including pursuant
to Section 1.02 and Section 1.03) shall not in any way be conditioned upon
whether the Debt Financing is available or has been obtained or whether the
Affiliate Sale has closed and, for avoidance of doubt, that Parent and Merger
Sub shall be required to hold the Closing and consummate the Merger on any
date, if so required pursuant to the terms and conditions of _Section 1.02_,
regardless of whether the Debt Financing is available or has been obtained as
of such date or whether the Affiliate Sale has closed as of such date.

(b) _Financing Cooperation_. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall use
reasonable best efforts to provide to Parent and Merger Sub, and shall cause
each of its subsidiaries to use its reasonable best efforts to provide, and
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its Representatives, including
legal and accounting advisors, to provide, in each case at Parents sole
expense, all cooperation reasonably requested by Parent and Merger Sub that is
reasonably necessary in connection with arranging, obtaining and syndicating
the Debt Financing and causing the conditions in the Debt Financing
Commitments to be satisfied, which cooperation may include:

 

(i) assisting with the preparation of Offering Documents, registration
statements, confidential information memoranda and similar documents required
in connection with the Debt Financing,

(ii) preparing and furnishing to Parent and the Debt Financing Parties as
promptly as practicable all Required Information and all other pertinent
information and disclosures relating to the Company and its subsidiaries
(including their businesses, operations, financial projections and prospects)
as may be reasonably requested by Parent, customary to assist in preparation
of the Offering Documents and reasonably necessary to consummate the Debt
Financing and identifying any portion of such information that constitutes
material non-public information,

 



-69- (iii) having the Company designate members of senior management of the Company
to execute customary authorization letters with respect to Offering Documents
and participate in a reasonable number of presentations, road shows, due
diligence sessions, drafting sessions and sessions with ratings agencies in
connection with the Debt Financing, including direct contact between such
senior management of the Company and its subsidiaries and the Debt Financing
Parties and other potential lenders in the Debt Financing,

 

(iv) assisting Parent in obtaining any corporate credit and family ratings
from any ratings agencies contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitments,

from the Companys independent auditors with respect to the Required
Information,

 

(vi) assisting in the preparation of, and executing and delivering, definitive
financing documents, including guarantee and collateral documents and
providing customary closing certificates as may be required in connection with
the Debt Financing and other customary documents as may be reasonably
requested by Parent,

 

(vii) facilitating actions reasonably required for the pledging of collateral
for the Debt Financing,

 

(viii) assisting the Debt Financing Parties in benefiting from the existing
lending relationships of the Company and its subsidiaries,

(ix) requesting and using reasonable best efforts to obtain from the Companys
existing lenders such customary documents in connection with refinancings as
reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the Debt Financing and
collateral arrangements, including customary payoff letters, lien releases and
instruments of termination or discharge, 

(x) furnishing Parent and the Debt Financing Parties with all documentation
and other information reasonably determined by the Debt Financing Parties to
be required by Governmental Authorities with respect to the Debt Financing
under applicable "know your customer" and anti-money laundering rules and
regulations, including the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing
Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001, as
amended,

(xi) cooperating with Parent, and taking all corporate actions, subject to
the occurrence of the Closing, reasonably requested by Parent to permit the
consummation of the Debt Financing,

 



-70- (xii) cooperating with Parent to obtain such legal opinions, surveys and
title insurance as reasonably requested by Parent or any of the Debt
Financing Parties in connection with the Debt Financing, and

 

(xiii) providing monthly financial statements (to the extent the Company
customarily prepares such financial statements) in the form and within the
time such statements are customarily prepared by the Company;

_provided_ , _however_ , that (A) nothing in this _Section 4.05(b)_ shall
require such cooperation to the extent it would interfere unreasonably with
the business or operations of the Company or its subsidiaries, (B) neither the
Company nor any of its subsidiaries shall be required to (1) incur any
liability (including any liability for Taxes, whether by withholding or
otherwise) that is not contingent upon the Closing or, without limitation of
the foregoing, execute any definitive financing documents (except
the authorization letter delivered pursuant to the foregoing clause (iii))
prior to the Closing or any other agreement, certificate, document or
instrument that would be effective prior to the Closing, (2) waive or amend
any terms of this Agreement or agree to pay any fees or reimburse any
expenses prior to the Closing for which it has not received prior
reimbursement or is not otherwise indemnified by or on behalf of Parent, (3)
give any indemnities that are effective prior to the Closing, (4) provide any
information the disclosure of which is prohibited under applicable law or is
legally privileged, or (5) take any action that will conflict with or violate
its organizational documents or any applicable laws or would result in a
violation or breach of, or default under, any agreement to which the Company
or any of its subsidiaries is a party, (C) the requirement to provide the
assistance described in clauses (vi), (vii), (ix) and (xi) above shall be
conditioned on the actual occurrence of the Closing. In addition, no action,
liability or obligation of the Company, any of its subsidiaries or any of
their respective Representatives pursuant to any certificate,
agreement, arrangement, document or instrument relating to the Debt Financing
will be effective until the Closing, and (D) the only financial information
the Company or its subsidiaries shall be required to deliver shall be the
Required Information. Nothing in this Agreement will require (y) any officer
or Representative of the Company or any of its subsidiaries to deliver any
certificate or opinion or take any other action that would reasonably be
expected to result in personal liability to such officer or Representative,
or (z) the members of the Companys Board of Directors as of the date hereof
to approve any financing or definitive agreements related thereto prior to the
Closing.

 

(c) _Current Information_. The Company hereby consents to the reasonable use
of the Companys and its subsidiaries marks and logos in connection with the
Debt Financing in a form and manner mutually agreed with the Company (such
consent by the Company not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed); _provided_ , _however_ , that such marks and logos are used in a
manner that is not intended, or reasonably likely, to harm or disparage the
Company or any of its subsidiaries or the reputation or goodwill of the
Company or any of its subsidiaries. The Company shall, use its reasonable
best efforts, as promptly as practicable, to update or correct any Required
Information to the extent required, as determined by the Company in its
reasonable discretion, so that such Required Information does not contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to

 



-71-  state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order
to make the Required Information, in light of the circumstances under which
the statements contained in the Required Information are made, not
misleading; provided, however, for avoidance of doubt, that the Marketing
Period shall in no event be deemed to have not commenced or to be extended in
connection with any update to the Required Information provided pursuant to
this _Section 4.05(b)_.

(d) _Confidentiality_. All non-public or other confidential
information provided by the Company or any of its Representatives pursuant to
this Agreement will be kept confidential in accordance with the
Confidentiality Agreement, except that Parent and Merger subsidiary will be
permitted to disclose such information to any financing sources or
prospective financing sources and other financial institutions and investors
that are or may become parties to the Debt Financing and to any underwriters,
initial purchasers or placement agents in connection with the Debt Financing
(and, in each case, to their respective counsel and auditors) so long as such
persons (i) agree to be bound by the Confidentiality Agreement as if parties
thereto, or (ii) are subject to other confidentiality
undertakings substantially similar to those in the Confidentiality Agreement
or otherwise reasonably satisfactory to the Company and of which the Company
is a beneficiary.

 

(e) _Indemnity and Reimbursement_. Parent shall promptly, upon written request
by the Company, reimburse the Company, its subsidiaries and affiliates for

subsidiaries and affiliates contemplated by this _Section 4.05_ and shall
indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its subsidiaries and affiliates and
their respective Representatives from and against any and all
losses, damages, claims, costs or expenses suffered or incurred by any of
them of any type in connection with Parents arrangement of any Debt Financing

information prepared or provided by the Company or any of its subsidiaries or
affiliates or any of their respective Representatives, and the foregoing
obligations shall survive termination of this Agreement.

actions and do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to close the Affiliate Sale, including (i) negotiate and enter into
(and cause its controlled affiliates to negotiate and enter into) any
agreements and other documents required to be entered into in connection with
consummating the Affiliate Sale, (ii) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions
to the closing of the Affiliate Sale and consummate the Affiliate Sale at or
prior to the Closing (iii) cause the other parties to the Affiliate Sale to

agree) to any amendments or modifications to, or grant any waivers of, any
condition or other provision under the Affiliate Sale Agreement without the
prior written consent of the

 



-72-  Company to the extent such amendments, modifications or waivers would
reasonably be expected to (A) reduce the aggregate amount of proceeds to
Parent from the Affiliate Sale, (B) impose new or additional conditions to,
or otherwise amend any of the conditions to the Affiliate Sale Agreement or
the Debt Financing, or otherwise be reasonably likely to prevent or delay or
impair the ability of Parent (or any other party to the Affiliate Sale
Agreement) to consummate the Affiliate Sale, obtain the Debt Financing and the
payment of the purchase price pursuant to the Affiliate Sale to Parent or the
consummate the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, (C) prevent or delay (taking into account the Marketing
Period) the Closing, the consummation of the Affiliate Sale or the funding of
the Debt Financing, (D) adversely impact the ability of Parent to enforce its,
or any of its affiliates ability to enforce their, rights against the other
parties to the Affiliate Sale Agreement or the definitive agreements with
respect thereto, in each case, relating to the consummation of the Affiliate

default (or threatened breach or default) by any party to the Affiliate Sale
Agreement as well as any material disputes or disagreements between or among
any parties to the Affiliate Sale Agreement, in each case, of which Parent or
Merger Sub become aware or (z) of any termination or waiver, amendment or
other modification of the Affiliate Sale Agreement. Parent shall not agree to
terminate the Affiliate Sale Agreement, and Parent shall take all and any
necessary actions to keep the Affiliate Sale Agreement in effect and shall not
take any action or omit to take any action that would provide a right
of termination to any other party to the Affiliate Sale Agreement.

ARTICLE V

 

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

 

Section 5.01 _Company Stockholders  Meeting; Preparation of the Joint
Proxy/S-4_.

 

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this
Agreement, (i) the Company shall prepare (with Parents reasonable
cooperation) the Proxy Statement, (ii) Parent shall prepare and cause to be
filed with the SEC the Joint Proxy/S-4 in which the Proxy Statement will be
included with respect to the Parent Common Stock and Convertible Notes
issuable in the Merger. Each of the Company and Parent shall use its
reasonable best efforts to (A) have the Joint Proxy/S-4 declared effective
under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after such filing, (B)
ensure that the Joint Proxy/S-4 complies in all material respects with the
applicable provisions of the Exchange Act or Securities Act, and (C) keep the
Joint Proxy/S-4 effective for so long as necessary to complete the Merger.
Each of the Company and Parent shall furnish all information concerning
itself, its controlled affiliates and the holders of its shares to the other
and provide such other assistance as may be reasonably requested in connection
with the preparation, filing and distribution of the Joint Proxy/S-4. The
Joint Proxy/S-4 shall include the Fairness Opinion, the information that
included the basis for rendering such opinion, any Company projections
provided to Parent and the Financial Advisor that are referred to in the
Fairness Opinion and all other information reasonably requested by

 



-73-  each party to be included therein. Each of the Company and Parent shall
promptly notify the other upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC or any
request from the SEC for amendments or supplements to the Joint Proxy/S-4,
and shall, as promptly as practicable after receipt thereof, provide the other
with copies of all material correspondence between it and its Representatives,
on one hand, and the SEC, on the other hand, and all written comments with
respect to the Joint Proxy/S-4 or the Joint Proxy/S-4 received from the SEC
and advise the other party of any oral comments with respect to the Joint
Proxy/S-4 or the Joint Proxy/S-4 received from the SEC. The Company and Parent
shall use their reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as practicable
to any comment from the SEC with respect to the Joint Proxy/S-4.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, and except in connection with any Company
Change of Recommendation in accordance with _Section 4.03_ (which the
Company may include in the Proxy Statement and which Parent shall describe in
the Form S-4 and Joint Proxy/S-4 at the Companys request) and other than
pursuant to Rule 425 of the Securities Act with respect to press releases made
in compliance with _Section 5.07_, prior to filing the Joint Proxy/S-4 (or
any amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC
with respect thereto, each of the Company and Parent shall cooperate and
provide the other a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such
document or response in advance (including the proposed final version of such
document or response) and consider in good faith any comments provided by the
Company or Parent or any of their respective Representatives with respect
thereto. Parent shall advise the Company, promptly after it receives notice
thereof, of the time of effectiveness of the Joint Proxy/S-4, the issuance of
any stop order relating thereto or the suspension of the qualification of the
Parent Common Stock or Convertible Notes issuable in connection with the
Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, and Parent shall use its
reasonable best efforts to have any such stop order or suspension lifted,
reversed or otherwise terminated. Parent shall also use its reasonable best
efforts to take any other action required to be taken under the Securities
Act, the Exchange Act, any applicable foreign or state securities or
"blue sky" laws and the rules and regulations thereunder in connection with
the issuance of the Parent Common Stock or Convertible Notes in the Merger,
and the Company shall furnish all information concerning the Company, the
Company subsidiaries and the holders of the Company Common Stock as may be
reasonably requested in connection with any such actions.

(b) If, at any time prior to the date of effectiveness under the Securities
Act (with respect to the Joint Proxy/S-4), the Company or Parent discovers
that any information relating to the Company or Parent, or any of their
respective affiliates, officers or directors, should be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to the Joint Proxy/S-4 so that such document would not
include any untrue of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
made therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not
misleading, the party that discovers such information shall as promptly as
practicable notify the other party and an appropriate amendment or supplement
describing such information shall be filed with the SEC as promptly as
practicable after the other party has had a reasonable opportunity to review
and comment thereon, and, to the extent required by applicable law,
disseminated to the Companys stockholders.

 



-74- (c) Unless a Company Change of Recommendation in respect of a Company Takeover
Proposal or Intervening Event shall have occurred during the Post-Signing
Period, promptly following the Post-Signing Period, (i) the Company shall take
all steps necessary under applicable law, the Companys certificate of
incorporation, bylaws and the rules of NYSE to duly call, give notice of,
convene and hold the Company Stockholders Meeting for the purpose of securing
the Company Stockholder Approval, as promptly as practicable under applicable
law, and use all reasonable efforts to solicit or cause to be solicited from
its stockholders proxies in favor of adoption of this Agreement (including,
distribute to the Company stockholders the Proxy Statement in accordance with
applicable federal and state law and recommend to such stockholders the
approval of the Merger, this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby), (ii) take all other reasonable action necessary to secure the Company
Stockholder Approval and (iii) cooperate and consult with the Parent with
respect to each of the foregoing matters. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, the Company may postpone or adjourn the
Company Stockholders Meeting if (a) the Company is required to postpone
or adjourn the Company Stockholders Meeting by applicable law, order or a
request from the SEC or its staff, (b) the Company Board or any authorized
committee thereof shall have determined in good faith (after consultation with
outside legal counsel) that it is necessary or appropriate to postpone or
adjourn the Company Stockholders Meeting, including in order to give holders
of Company Common Stock sufficient time to evaluate any information or
disclosure that the Company has sent to such holders or otherwise made
available to holders of Company Common Stock by issuing a press release,
filing materials with the SEC or otherwise (including in connection with any
Company Change of Recommendation) or (c) if on the date for which the Company
Stockholders Meeting is originally scheduled, the Company has not received
proxies representing a sufficient number of shares to conduct business at the
meeting; _provided_ , _however_ , that, solely with respect to the
postponement or adjournment set forth in clause (c), such adjournment or
postponement (i) shall only be for one time and for a period of up to ten
Business Days, and (ii) Parent shall have the right to require such
postponement or adjournment in such circumstance. Notwithstanding the
foregoing or anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the parties
acknowledge and agree that a Company Change of Recommendation that occurs
following the Post-Signing Period shall not affect or modify the obligations
to call, give notice of and hold the Company Stockholders Meeting as set
forth in this _Section 5.01(c)_, unless Parent exercises its termination
rights pursuant to Article VII hereof and, as a result, the Company pays to
Parent the Company Termination Fee, and that unless (x) this Agreement is
terminated in accordance with Article VII, if applicable, or (y) a Company
Change of Recommendation in respect of a Company Takeover Proposal
or Intervening Event shall have occurred during the Post-Signing Period (to
the extent applicable pursuant to Article VII) (which, in the case of clause
(y), shall only result in the Company no longer being required pursuant to the
terms of this  _Section 5.01(c)_ to solicit proxies from its stockholders),
the Company shall take all of the actions contemplated by this _Section
5.01(c)_ regardless of whether the Board of Directors of the Company has
approved, endorsed or recommended another Company Takeover Proposal or has
withdrawn, modified or amended the Company Recommendation, and will submit
this Agreement for adoption by the stockholders of the Company at such Company
Stockholders Meeting. The Company shall keep the Parent updated with respect
to the proxy solicitation results as reasonably requested by Parent.

(d) If requested by Parent, the Company shall promptly conduct a "broker
search" as contemplated by and in accordance with Rule 14c-7 promulgated under
the Exchange Act with respect to the mailing of the Joint Proxy/S-4 (based on
an assumed mailing date requested by Parent).

 



-75- Section 5.02 _Access to Information; Confidentiality; Effect of Review_.

 

(a) _Access_. From the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time, the
Company shall, and shall cause each of its subsidiaries and each of their
respective Representatives to use reasonable efforts to: (i) provide to Parent
and Merger Sub and their respective Representatives reasonable access during
normal business hours in such a manner as not to interfere unreasonably with
the operation of the business conducted by the Company or any of its
subsidiaries, upon prior written notice to the Company, to the officers,
employees, auditors, properties, offices and other facilities of the
Company and its subsidiaries and to the books and records thereof; and (ii)
furnish promptly to Parent and Merger Sub and their respective Representatives
such information concerning the business, properties, contracts, assets and
liabilities of the Company and its subsidiaries as Parent and Merger Sub or
their respective Representatives may reasonably request; _provided_ that the
foregoing shall not require the Company or any of its subsidiaries or
Representatives to furnish any such materials that are otherwise publicly
available; _provided_ , _further_ , that the Company shall not be required to
(or to cause any of its subsidiaries to) afford such access or furnish such
information to the extent that the Company believes in good faith that doing
so would: (A) result in a loss of attorney-client privilege or work-product
protection; (B) violate any obligations of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries with respect to confidentiality to any third party or otherwise
breach, contravene or violate any then effective Contract to which the Company
or any of its subsidiaries is a party; or (C) breach, contravene, or violate
any applicable law (including the HSR Act or any other antitrust
or competition law); _provided_ , _further_ , that the Company shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any consents of third parties that
are necessary to allow such information to be disclosed to Parent, Merger Sub
and their respective Representatives and shall otherwise use commercially
reasonable efforts to allow for such access or disclosure in a manner that
does not result in a breach of clauses (A), (B) or (C), including pursuant to
the use of "clean room" arrangements pursuant to which Representatives of
Parent could be provided access to such information). Notwithstanding anything
contained in this Agreement to the contrary, neither party shall be required
to provide any access or make any disclosure to the other pursuant to this
_Section 5.02_ to the extent such access or information is reasonably
pertinent to a litigation where the Company or any of its affiliates, on the
one hand, and Parent or any of its affiliates, on the other hand, are adverse
parties. Parent and the Company may, as each deems advisable and necessary,
reasonably designate any competitively sensitive material to be provided to
the other under this _Section 5.02_ as "Outside Counsel Only Material." Such
materials and information contained therein shall be given only to the outside
counsel of the recipient and will not be disclosed by such outside counsel to
employees, officers or directors of the recipient unless express permission
is obtained in advance from the source of the materials (Parent or the
Company, as the case may be) or its legal counsel. Any access to the Companys
properties shall not unreasonably interfere with the operations
thereon, shall be subject to the Companys reasonable security measures and
insurance requirements and shall not include the right to perform any
"invasive" environmental testing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any access to
any Leased Real Property shall be subject to the Companys reasonable

-76- (b) To the extent that any of the information or material furnished pursuant
to this _Section 5.02_ or otherwise in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement may include material subject to the attorney-client privilege, work
product doctrine or any other applicable privilege concerning pending or
threatened legal proceedings or governmental investigations, the parties
understand and agree that they have a commonality of interest with respect to
such matters and it is their desire, intention and mutual understanding that
the sharing of such material is not intended to, and shall not, waive or
diminish in any way the confidentiality of such material or its continued
protection under the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other
applicable privilege. All such information that is entitled to protection
under the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other applicable
privilege shall remain entitled to such protection under these privileges,
this Agreement, and under the joint defense doctrine. All information
provided pursuant to _Section 5.02(a)_ shall be subject to the applicable
terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.

Section 5.03  _Regulatory Matters; Reasonable Best Efforts_.

(a) On the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, each party
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Closing to occur, including
using reasonable best efforts to take all actions reasonably necessary to
comply promptly with all legal requirements that may be imposed on it or its
subsidiaries with respect to the Closing. Each party shall not take any
actions that would or that would reasonably be expected to, result in any of
the conditions set forth in _Article VI_ not being satisfied. Without limiting
the foregoing or the provisions set forth in _Section 5.03(b)_ (and subject
to the terms and limitations in _Section 5.03(b)_), each party shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the Closing to occur on or prior to the
Termination Date. Nothing in this _Section 5.03_ shall impose any obligation
on Parent with respect to obtaining or arranging the Debt Financing, it being
agreed that Parents obligations with respect to such matters shall be
governed solely by  _Section 4.05_ and the Debt Financing Commitments.

(b) Each of the Company and Parent shall as promptly as practicable but in no
event later than ten (10) calendar days following the execution and delivery
of this Agreement, file or cause to be filed with the United States Federal
Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ ") and the United States Department of Justice
(the " _DOJ_ ") the notification and report form, if any, required for the
transactions contemplated hereby and any supplemental information requested in
connection therewith pursuant to the HSR Act and shall as promptly as
reasonably practicable provide any supplemental information requested by
applicable Governmental Authorities relating thereto. Any such notification
and report form or supplemental information shall be in substantial compliance
with the requirements of the HSR Act, as applicable. Each of the Company and
Parent shall consult with one another (and their respective advisers) as to
the form and content of any notification and report form or supplemental
information supplied to any Governmental Authority, and allow the Company or
Parent, as applicable (and their respective advisers) to review the same (as
may be redacted to remove any estimate of the valuation of the

 



-77-  Company, its business or shares, any identification of or discussion with
respect to other potential acquirers or to preserve any applicable privilege)
in advance of submission and make such amendments as either may reasonably
request. Each of the Company and Parent shall furnish to the other such
necessary information and reasonable assistance as the other may request in
connection with its preparation of any filing or submission that is necessary
under the HSR Act. The Company and Parent shall keep each other apprised of
the status of any communications with, and any inquiries or requests for
additional information from, the FTC, the DOJ and any other applicable
Governmental Authority and shall respond as promptly as reasonably
practicable to any such inquiry or request and shall as promptly as reasonably
practicable provide any supplemental information requested in connection with
the filings made hereunder pursuant to the HSR Act, and, to the extent
permitted by any Governmental Authority: (i) to the extent reasonably
practicable, inform each party prior to all material communications (including
material telephone calls and meetings) with a Governmental Authority, (ii)
allow either party the opportunity to participate in any such calls and
meetings to the extent reasonably practicable, and (iii) allow each party (and
their respective advisers) to review any material written
communications before submission and to make such amendments to such
communications as either the Company or Parent may reasonably request. Each
party shall provide the other (and their advisers) with a final copy of any
notification, report form or any other supplemental information submitted to
and any other material written communications with any Governmental Authority,
to the extent permitted by law. Each party shall use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain any clearance required under the HSR Act for the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
pursuant to a request for an early termination of the waiting period
thereunder. For purposes of this _Section 5.03_, the "reasonable
best efforts" of Parent shall include promptly opposing any motion or action
for a temporary, preliminary or permanent injunction against the Merger or any
portion thereof, including any legislative, administrative or judicial action,
and taking any and all steps necessary to have vacated, lifted, reversed,
overturned, avoided, eliminated or removed any decree, judgment, injunction or
other order (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) that restricts,
prevents or prohibits the consummation of the Merger or any other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement under the HSR Act, and take any
and all actions necessary to that effect, including, but not limited to,
proposing, negotiating, offering to commit and effecting (and if such offer
is accepted, committing to and effecting), by undertaking, consent decree,
hold separate order or otherwise, to the sale, divestiture, license or
disposition of any assets or businesses of Parent or its subsidiaries or
affiliates or of the Company or its subsidiaries or the Company Joint
Ventures, or otherwise offer or commit to take any action (including any
action that limits the freedom of action, ownership or control with respect
to, or ability to retain or hold, any of the business, assets, product lines,
properties or services of Parent or its subsidiaries or affiliates or of the
Company or its subsidiaries or the Company Joint Ventures) or agree to any
other remedy as a condition to obtaining any clearance required under the HSR
Act; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing herein shall require (and
"reasonable best efforts" shall in no event require) Parent or any of its
subsidiaries or affiliates to agree to or take any action that, individually
or in the aggregate, would have a material adverse effect on Parent, the
Company and their respective subsidiaries and affiliates (including the Tax
Equity

 



-78-  Funds), taken as a whole, following the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby. Parent and its subsidiaries shall refrain from taking,
directly or indirectly, any action (including engaging in, or agreeing to
engage in, transactions in the industries in which the Company and the
Companys subsidiaries operate) that would reasonably be expected to delay or
prevent clearance under the HSR Act for the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

(c) In addition to the obligations under _Section 5.03(b)_, each of Parent
and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain, and to
cooperate in obtaining, all Consents from third parties, including
Governmental Authorities (other than pursuant to efforts with respect to the
HSR Act referenced in  _Section 5.03(b)_), necessary or appropriate to
permit the consummation of the Merger and to provide, and cooperate in
providing, notices to, and make or file, and cooperate in the making or filing
of, registrations, declarations or filings with, third parties required to be
provided prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that no party
shall be required to pay or commit to pay any significant amount to (or incur
any significant liability or obligation in favor of) any third party that is
not a Governmental Authority from whom any such Consent, notice, registration,
declaration or filing may be required (other than nominal filing or
application fees).

 

(d) Nothing in this _Section 5.03_ shall obligate Parent or the Company or
any of their respective subsidiaries to take any action that is not
conditional upon the Closing.

(e) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing subsections of _Section
5.03_, the Company and Parent shall (i) take all action necessary to ensure
that no Takeover Law, or Takeover Provision is or becomes applicable to the
Merger, this Agreement, the Voting Agreement or any of the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) if any Takeover Law or Takeover
Provision becomes applicable to the Merger, this Agreement, the Voting
Agreement or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement or the
Voting Agreement, take all action necessary to ensure that the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as
promptly as reasonably practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement
and otherwise to minimize the effect of such Takeover Law or Takeover
Provision on the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 

Section 5.04 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) Following the Effective Time and for a period ending on the first
anniversary of the Effective Time (the " _Benefit Period_ "), Parent shall
provide, or shall cause to be provided, to officers and employees of the
Company and its subsidiaries as of the Effective Time (" _Affected Employees_
") who continue to be employed by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of
their respective subsidiaries following the Effective Time during such period,
(i) base salaries and wage rates and cash bonus and commission opportunities
substantially comparable to the total base salaries and wage rates and cash
bonus and commission opportunities in the aggregate provided to the Affected
Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) employee benefits
(other than any defined benefit pension benefits, retiree or life insurance
benefits, and nonqualified

 



-79-  deferred compensation benefits) that are substantially comparable, in the
aggregate, to such employee benefits (other than any defined benefit pension
benefits, retiree or life insurance benefits, and nonqualified deferred
compensation benefits) that similarly situated officers and employees of
Parent and its subsidiaries receive during the Benefit Period, taking into
account all relevant factors, including duties, geographic location, tenure,
qualifications and abilities.

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company and its subsidiaries shall take
or cause to be taken all actions necessary to, effective as of immediately
prior to the Closing Date, (i) terminate their participation in each Company
Employee Benefit Plan that is not sponsored or maintained solely by the
Company or any of its subsidiaries and is listed on _Section 5.04(b)_ of the
Company Disclosure Letter (each, an " _Other Employee Benefit Plan_ "), (ii)
ensure that the person that sponsors or maintains such Other Employee
Benefit Plans assumes and retains the sponsorship of and is solely
responsible for all liabilities and obligations (whether current or
contingent) relating to or at any time arising under or in connection with
each Other Employee Benefit Plan, including all liabilities and obligations
under Code Section 4980B with respect to all "MandA qualified beneficiaries" as
defined in Treasury Regulation Section 54.4980B-9, (iii) with respect to an
Other Employee Benefit Plan that is a defined contribution 401(k) plan, fully
vest all Affected Employees in their account balances or accrued benefits (as
applicable) under such Other Employee Benefit Plan (as applicable), and (iv)
make all employer contributions that would have been made on behalf of the
Affected Employees had the transactions contemplated by this Agreement not
occurred, regardless of any service or end-of-year employment requirements,
but prorated for the portion of the plan year that ends on the Closing Date.
As soon as practicable following the Closing Date, each Affected Employee who
immediately prior to the Closing Date is a participant in the Other Employee
Benefit Plan that is a defined contribution 401(k) plan shall be entitled to
elect a "direct rollover" (as described in Section 401(a)(31) of the Code of
his or her account balance (including the promissory notes of any outstanding
participant loans) in accordance with the terms of such plan and the
requirements of applicable law.

(c) For purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting and level of vacation
or severance benefits (but not for benefit accrual purposes) under the
employee benefit plans, programs and policies of Parent and its subsidiaries
in which any Affected Employee may participate during the Benefit Period
(including the Company Employee Benefit Plans) (the " _New Plans_ "), each
Affected Employee shall be credited with his or her years of service with the
Company and its subsidiaries and their respective predecessors before the
Effective Time, to the same extent and for the same purpose as such Affected
Employee was entitled, immediately before the Effective Time, to credit for
such service under any similar Company Employee Benefit Plan in which such
Affected Employee participated or was eligible to participate immediately
prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ that such service credit shall not be
provided (i) under any defined benefit pension plans or retiree medical plans
or programs of Parent and its affiliates or with respect to the level of
allocations to any retirement plans of Parent and its affiliates, or (ii) if
it would result in a duplication of benefits. In addition, and without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, with respect to the plan year in
which the Effective Time occurs, Parent shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause (A)

 



-80-  each Affected Employee to be immediately eligible to participate, without
any waiting time, in any and all New Plans that are group health plans to the
extent coverage under such New Plan is replacing comparable coverage under a
Company Employee Benefit Plan in which such Affected Employee participated
immediately before the Effective Time (such plans, collectively, the " _Old
Plans_ "), and (B) for purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental,
pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any Affected Employee, any evidence
of insurability requirements, all pre-existing condition exclusions and
actively-at-work requirements of such New Plans to be waived for such
Affected Employee and his or her covered dependents to the extent such
requirements and exclusions were waived for such Affected Employee and his or
her covered dependents under the Old Plans. With respect to the plan year in
which the Effective Time occurs, Parent shall cause any eligible expenses
incurred under an Old Plan that is a group health plan by any Affected
Employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year
of the Old Plan ending on the Closing Date to be taken into account under
such New Plan that the Affected Employee participates following the Effective
Time for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-
of-pocket requirements, treatment or visit limitations, or similar
limitations applicable to such Affected Employee and his or her covered
dependents for the applicable plan year in which the Effective Time occurs;
_provided_ that such amount was taken into account for the same purpose under
the similar Company Employee Benefit Plan for such period and would not result
in the duplication of benefits.

(d) Subject to any written agreement between the relevant individual and
Parent and/or the Surviving Corporation that, in each case, is entered into
following the date hereof, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, assume and honor the obligations of the Company and its
subsidiaries under all employment, severance, consulting, LTIP Plans and other
compensation contracts between either the Company or any of its subsidiaries,
on the one hand, and any current or former director, officer or employee
thereof, on the other hand, solely to the extent such Contracts are listed on
_Section 3.01(l)(i)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, and all provisions for
vested benefits (including benefits vested as a result of the occurrence of
the Effective Time), or other vested amounts earned or accrued through the
Effective Time under the Company Employee Benefit Plans, in accordance with
their terms as in effect on the date hereof. The parties hereto acknowledge
and agree that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement constitute a
"change of control" for purposes of the Company Employee Stock Plans, the LTIP
Plans and all employment and severance contracts disclosed on  _Section
3.01(l)(i)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter.

(e) The provisions of this _Section 5.04_ are solely for the benefit of the
parties to this Agreement and nothing in this _Section 5.04_, express or
implied, shall confer upon any current or former employee, officer, director
or independent contractor or any other person any rights or remedies of any
nature whatsoever (including any third-party beneficiary rights) under or by
reason of this _Section 5.04_. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed
as an amendment to any Company Employee Benefit Plan, New Plan or other
compensation or benefit plan, program, policy, agreement, contract or
arrangement for any purpose. No provision of this Agreement, express or
implied, shall create any right in any employee or officer of the Company or
any of its subsidiaries (or

 



-81-  any other current or former director, officer, employee or independent
contractor or other person) to employment or continued employment by Parent or
any of its affiliates, including the Surviving Corporation, or receipt or
continued receipt of any specific benefit or compensation, or preclude the
ability of Parent or any of its affiliates, including the Surviving
Corporation, to terminate the employment of any employee or officer at any
time and for any reason.

Section 5.05 _Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance_.

 

(a) Each of Parent and the Company agrees that, to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable law, all rights to indemnification, advancement of
expenses and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at
or prior to the Effective Time now existing in favor of the current or former
directors and officers, and the fiduciaries currently indemnified under
benefit plans of the Company and its subsidiaries, as provided in their
respective certificate or articles of incorporation, by-laws (or comparable
organizational documents) or other agreements providing
indemnification, advancement or exculpation, shall survive the Merger and
shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms, that
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to honor all such rights and that
for six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, no such provision in any
certificate or articles of incorporation, by-laws (or comparable
organizational document) or other agreement shall be amended, modified or
repealed in any manner that would adversely affect the rights or protections
thereunder to any such individual with respect to acts or omissions occurring
at or prior to the Effective Time. From and after the Effective Time, Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries to assume
all indemnification agreements in effect as of the date of this Agreement and
to otherwise honor and perform, in accordance with their respective terms,
each of the covenants contained in this _Section 5.05(a)_.

 

(b) For six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall maintain in effect the directors and officers liability
(and fiduciary) insurance policies currently maintained by the Company
covering acts or omissions occurring on or prior to the Effective Time with
respect to those persons who are currently covered by the Companys
respective directors and officers liability (and fiduciary) insurance
policies on terms with respect to such coverage and in amounts no less
favorable to the Company Indemnified Parties than those set forth in the
relevant policy in effect on the date of this Agreement; _provided_ that the
annual cost thereof shall not exceed 350% of the annual cost of such policies
as of the date hereof. If such insurance coverage cannot be maintained for
such cost, Parent shall maintain the most advantageous policies of directors
and officers insurance otherwise obtainable for such cost. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company may purchase a six-year "tail" prepaid policy on
terms and conditions no less favorable to the Company Indemnified Parties
than the existing directors and officers liability (and fiduciary) insurance
maintained by the Company, covering without limitation the transactions
contemplated hereby; _provided_  that the aggregate cost thereof shall not
exceed 350% of the annual cost of the directors and officers liability (and
fiduciary) insurance maintained by the Company as of the date hereof. If such
"tail" prepaid policy has been obtained by the Company prior to the Effective
Time, it shall satisfy the obligations set forth in the first two sentences of
this paragraph (b).

 



-82- (c) For six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, Parent shall,
and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, indemnify and hold harmless
each present director and officer of the Company or any of its subsidiaries
(in each case, for acts or failures to act in such capacity), determined as of
the date hereof, and any person who becomes such a director or officer
between the date hereof and the Effective Time (collectively, the " _Company
Indemnified Parties_ "), against any costs or expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees, costs and expenses), judgments, fines, losses, claims,
amounts paid in settlement, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with
any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, arising out of or relating to matters
existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or
claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time (including any matters
arising in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement),
to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law (and the Surviving
Corporation shall also advance expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees,
costs and expenses) to such persons as incurred to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable law; _provided_ that the person to whom expenses
are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is
ultimately determined that such person is not entitled to indemnification.

 

(d) The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this
_Section 5.05_ shall not be terminated or modified by such parties in a
manner so as to adversely affect any Company Indemnified Party, or any other
person entitled to the benefit of _Section 5.05(a)_ and _Section 5.05(b)_,
as the case may be, to whom this  _Section 5.05_ applies without the consent
of the affected Company Indemnified Party, or such other person, as the case
may be. If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) shall consolidate with or merge into any other
corporation or entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation
or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) shall transfer all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any individual, corporation
or other entity, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made
so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as
the case may be, shall assume all of the obligations of Parent, or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, set forth in this _Section
5.05(a)_.

(e) The provisions of this _Section 5.05_ are (i) intended to be for the
benefit of, and, from and after the Effective Time, will be enforceable by,
each of the Company Indemnified Parties and (ii) in addition to, and not in
substitution for or in limitation of, any other rights to indemnification,
advancement of expenses, exculpation or contribution that any such person may
have by contract or otherwise.

 

Section 5.06 _Fees and Expenses_. Except as provided in this _Section 5.06_,
and _Section 7.03_, and whether or not the Merger is consummated, all fees
and expenses incurred in connection with the Merger, this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the party
incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not the Merger is consummated,
except that each of the Company and Parent shall each bear and pay one half of
the costs and expenses (other than attorneys fees and expenses) incurred in
connection with the filings of the premerger notification and report
forms under the HSR Act (including filing fees).

 



-83- Section 5.07 _Public Announcements_. Except (A) as may be required by
applicable law or any listing agreement with a national securities exchange,
in which case, to the extent reasonably practicable and as permitted by
applicable law, reasonable best efforts to consult with the other party hereto
shall be made prior to any such release or public statement or (B) in
connection with any actions by the Company or Company Board permitted by
_Section 4.03(e)_, or Parents response thereto, or any communication made in
accordance with  _Section 4.03_, the Company and Parent shall, and shall
cause their subsidiaries to, consult with each other before issuing any press
release, making any other public statement or scheduling any press conference
or conference call with investors or analysts with respect to this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and, except for any public
statement or press release as may be required by applicable law, order of a
court of competent jurisdiction or any listing agreement with or rule of
NYSE, shall not, and shall cause their subsidiaries not to, issue any such
press release, make any such other public statement or schedule any such press
conference or conference call before that consultation and providing each
other the opportunity to review and comment upon any such press release or
public statement. The initial press release of the parties announcing the
execution of this Agreement shall be a joint press release of Parent and the
Company in a form that is mutually agreed.

Section 5.08 _Stockholder Litigation_. In the event that any stockholder
litigation related to this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement is brought, or to the Companys knowledge,
threatened in writing, against the Company and/or the members of the Company
Board after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time (the "
_Transaction Litigation_ "), the Company shall promptly (and in any event
within 24 hours) notify Parent of any such Transaction Litigation and shall
keep Parent reasonably informed with respect to the status thereof. Parent
shall have the right, at its sole discretion, to participate in the defense or
settlement of any Transaction Litigation, and, in any event, the Company shall
not settle, compromise, come to an arrangement regarding or agree to settle,
compromise or come to an arrangement regarding any Transaction Litigation,
without Parents prior written consent; _provided_ , that after the time the
Company Stockholder Approval is obtained, if requested by Parent, the Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts to defend or to settle, any unresolved
Transaction Litigation in consultation with Parent.

 

Section 5.09 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, each of
Parent and the Company Board, or an appropriate committee of non-employee
directors thereof, shall adopt a resolution consistent with the interpretive
guidance of the SEC so that the disposition by any officer or director of the
Company who is a covered person of the Company for purposes of Section _16_
of the Exchange Act (" _Section 16_") of Shares or other equity interest in
the Company (including derivative securities) pursuant to this Agreement and
the Merger shall be an exempt transaction for purposes of Section 16\.

Section 5.10 _Notices of Certain Events_. From and after the date of this
Agreement until the Effective Time, each of the Company and Parent shall
promptly notify the other in writing upon becoming aware of (a) the
occurrence, or non-occurrence, of any event that, individually or in the
aggregate, would reasonably be expected to cause any condition to the

 



-84-  obligations of any party hereto to effect the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement not to be satisfied or (b) the
failure of any such party to comply with or satisfy any covenant or agreement
to be complied with or satisfied by it pursuant to this Agreement which,
individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to result in
any condition to the obligations of any party to effect the Merger not to be
satisfied. The delivery of any notice pursuant to this _Section 5.10_ shall
not cure any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
requiring disclosure of such matter prior to the date of this Agreement or
otherwise limit or affect the remedies available hereunder to any party. From
and after the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, each party
hereto shall promptly notify the other party hereto of any written notice or
other written communication from any Governmental Authority or from any
person alleging that the consent of such Governmental Authority or person is
or may be required in connection with the Merger or any other transaction
contemplated by this Agreement.

 

Section 5.11 _Stock Exchange Listing; Delisting; Convertible Notes_.

to be issued in the Merger to be approved for listing on the NYSE, subject to
official notice of issuance, prior to the Closing Date.

reasonable actions to cause the delisting of Company Common Stock from the

as soon as practicable following the Effective Time.

(c) At or prior to the Closing, Parent shall cause the Indenture to be
executed by and between the Parent and the Trustee (as such term is defined
in the Indenture) and delivered to the Company.

available at all times, free of preemptive rights, shares of Parent Common
Stock for the purpose of enabling Parent to satisfy any obligation to issue
shares of Parent Common Stock upon conversion of the Convertible Notes to be
issued in the Merger.

Section 5.12 _Reserved_.

to or substantially concurrently with the termination of this Agreement, an

Parent; or

 



-90- (b) Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.01(g)_ and (i)
prior to such termination, a Company Takeover Proposal shall have been made or
publicly announced or shall have otherwise been communicated to the Company or
the Company Board, and (ii) within twelve (12) months after such termination
the Company shall enter into a written definitive agreement providing for the
consummation of a Company Takeover Proposal (which is subsequently
consummated) or shall consummate a Company Takeover Proposal, then the Company
shall pay to Parent by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account designated in writing by Parent, on the date of consummation of such
Company Takeover Proposal, an amount equal to the Company Termination Fee. For
purposes of this  _Section 7.03(b)_ the term " _Company Takeover Proposal_ "
shall have the meaning ascribed to such term in _Section 4.03(a)_, except
that all references to the "20%" and "80%" amounts in such definition shall
be deemed to be references to "50.01%" and "49.99%," respectively.

(c) If this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section 7.01(g)_,
the Company shall (i) pay to Parent or its designee by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by Parent
within two (2) Business Days following delivery of the notice of termination
all of the documented, out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Parent, Merger Sub
or their respective affiliates in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby up to a maximum of $15,000,000 (the "
_Expense Reimbursement_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that if the Company
Termination Fee is paid following the payment of the Expense Reimbursement
pursuant to this  _Section 7.03(c)_, any amounts paid pursuant to this
_Section 7.03(c)_ shall be deducted from the payment of the Company
Termination Fee.

 

Section 7.04 _Termination Fees_. If Parent shall receive full payment of the
Company Termination Fee (as reduced for any payment of the Expense
Reimbursement) pursuant to _Section 7.03_, then (i) the receipt of the
Company Termination Fee by Parent shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of
Parent, Merger Sub and each of their respective subsidiaries and
their respective stockholders and affiliates against the Company, any of the
Companys subsidiaries, any Company Joint Venture and each of their respective
former, current and future Representatives, stockholders, general and limited
partners, managers, members, affiliates and assignees and each former,
current or future Representative, stockholder, general or limited partner,
manager, member, affiliate or assignee of any of the foregoing (each, a "
_Company Related Party_ "), for any loss or damage suffered as a result of
the failure of the Merger to be consummated or for any breach or failure to
perform hereunder, and (ii) following such receipt, no Company Related Party
shall have any further liability or obligation with respect to this Agreement
(or the termination hereof) or the transactions contemplated hereby;
_provided_ , _that_ , payment of the Company Termination Fee shall not release
any party from liability for Willful Breach. In no event shall the Company be
required to pay the Company Termination Fee more than once. The Company,
Parent and Merger Sub each acknowledge that the agreements contained in
_Section 7.03_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and that, without these agreements, neither Parent, Merger Sub nor
the Company would not enter into this Agreement, and that any amounts payable
pursuant to _Section 7.03_ do not constitute a 

 



-91-  penalty but constitute payment of liquidated damages and that the liquidated
damages amount is reasonable in light of the substantial but indeterminate
harm anticipated to be caused by the other partys breach or default under
this Agreement, the difficulty of proof and calculation of loss and damages,
the inconvenience and non-feasibility of otherwise obtaining an adequate
remedy, the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while
negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the
expectation of the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby and the value of the transactions to be consummated
hereunder.

not rely upon the representations and warranties in this Agreement as
characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this
Agreement or as of any other date. This Agreement is the product of
negotiation by the parties having the assistance of counsel and other
advisers. It is the intention of the parties that this Agreement not be
construed more strictly with regard to one party than with regard to the
other.

conditions contained in this Agreement. Any such extension or waiver shall be
valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such

rights.

breach or threatened breach by any other party of any covenant or obligation
contained in this Agreement, the non-breaching party shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to

this being in addition to any other remedy which may be available to
such non-breaching party at law or in equity, including monetary damages.

Section 8.12 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement

enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this

possible to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law in an acceptable
manner to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to
the extent possible.

more of the total voting power of the Companys Common Equity, or has the
power, directly or indirectly, to elect a majority of the members of the

2 (2) the Company consolidates with, enters into a binding share exchange,

total voting power of all outstanding classes of the Common Equity of the
surviving or transferee Person and such holders proportional voting power
immediately after such transaction vis-a-vis each other with respect to the
securities they receive in such transaction will be in substantially the same
proportions as their respective voting power vis-a-vis each other immediately
prior to such transaction will not constitute a "Change in Control"; or

the extent the Company continues to own at least 51% of the voting power of
any of the Companys Yieldco Subsidiaries (including TerraForm Power) the
stock of which has been offered to the public, the offering to the public

at its option, fix in advance a record date for the determination of Holders
entitled to give such request, demand, authorization, direction, notice,
consent, election, waiver or other Act, but the Company shall have
no obligation to do so. If such a record date is fixed, such request, demand,
authorization, direction, notice, consent, election, waiver or other Act may
be given before or after such record date, but only the Holders of record at
the close of business on the record date shall be deemed to be Holders for
the purposes of determining whether Holders of the requisite proportion of the
Outstanding Notes have authorized or agreed or consented to such request,
demand, authorization, direction, 

 



14  notice, consent, election, waiver or other Act, and for that purpose the
Outstanding Notes shall be computed as of the record date; provided that no
such authorization, agreement or consent by the Holders on such record date
shall be deemed effective unless it shall become effective pursuant to the

otherwise.

 

Each Note shall be dated the date of its authentication.

 

No Note shall be entitled to any benefit under this Indenture or be valid or
obligatory for any purpose unless there appears on such Note a certificate of
authentication substantially in the form provided for herein executed by an
authorized signatory of the Trustee by manual signature, and such certificate
upon any Note shall be conclusive evidence, and the only evidence, that
such Note has been duly authenticated and delivered hereunder.

Section 2.05 _Temporary Notes_. Pending the preparation of Physical Notes,
the Company may execute, and upon Company Order the Trustee shall authenticate
and deliver, temporary Notes that are printed, lithographed, typewritten,
mimeographed or otherwise produced, in any authorized denomination,
substantially of the tenor of the Physical Notes in lieu of which they are
issued and with such appropriate insertions, omissions, substitutions and
other variations as the Officer executing such Notes may determine, as
evidenced by such Officers execution of such Notes; _provided_ that any such
temporary Notes shall bear legends on the face of such Notes as set forth in
the Form of Note attached hereto as _Exhibit A _and/or Section 2.11.

 



16 After the preparation of Physical Notes, the temporary Notes shall be
exchangeable for Physical Notes upon surrender of the temporary Notes at any
office or agency of the Company designated pursuant to Section 5.02, without
charge to the Holder. Upon surrender for cancellation of any one or more
temporary Notes, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall, upon
receipt of a Company Order, authenticate and deliver, in exchange therefor a
like principal amount of Physical Notes of authorized denominations. Until so
exchanged, the temporary Notes shall in all respects be entitled to the same
benefits under this Indenture as Physical Notes.

Section 2.06 _Registration; Registration of Transfer and Exchange._

(a) The Company shall cause to be kept at the applicable Corporate Trust
Office of the Trustee in the continental United States a register (the
register maintained in such office and in any other office or agency
designated pursuant to Section 5.02 being herein sometimes collectively
referred to as the "Register") in which, subject to such reasonable
regulations as it may prescribe, the Company shall provide for the
registration and transfer of Notes. The Trustee is hereby appointed registrar
(the "Registrar") for the purpose of registering the transfer and exchange of
the Notes as herein provided.

Upon surrender for registration of transfer of any Note at an office or agency
of the Company designated pursuant to Section 5.02 for such purpose, the
Company shall execute, and upon receipt of a Company Order the Trustee shall
authenticate and deliver, in the name of the designated transferee or
transferees, one or more new Notes of any authorized denomination and of a
like aggregate principal amount and tenor, each such Note bearing such
restrictive legends as may be required by this Indenture (including the Form
of Note attached hereto as _Exhibit A_ and Section 2.11).

At the option of the Holder and subject to the other provisions of Section
2.11, Notes may be exchanged for other Notes of any authorized denomination
and of a like aggregate principal amount and tenor, upon surrender of the
Notes to be exchanged at such office or agency. Whenever any Notes are so
surrendered for exchange, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall,
upon receipt of a Company Order, authenticate and deliver, the Notes which the
Holder making the exchange is entitled to receive.

 

All Notes issued upon any registration of transfer or exchange of Notes shall
be the valid obligations of the Company evidencing the same debt, and
entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture as the Notes surrendered
upon such registration of transfer or exchange.

 

Every Note presented or surrendered for registration of transfer or for
exchange shall (if so required by the Company or the Trustee) be
duly endorsed, or be accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form
satisfactory to the Company and the Registrar duly executed, by the Holder
thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing.

 

No service charge shall be made for any registration of transfer or exchange
of Notes, but the Company and the Registrar may require payment of a sum
sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed
in connection with any registration of transfer or exchange of Notes, other
than exchanges pursuant to Section 2.11 not involving any transfer.

 



17 Neither the Company nor the Registrar shall be required to exchange or
register a transfer of any Note in the circumstances set forth in Section
2.11(a)(iv).

(b) Neither any members of, or participants in, the Depositary (collectively,
the "Agent Members") nor any other Persons on whose behalf any Agent Member
may act shall have any rights under this Indenture with respect to any Global
Note registered in the name of the Depositary or any nominee thereof, or
under any such Global Note, and the Depositary or such nominee, as the case
may be, may be treated by the Company, the Trustee, the Agents and any of
their respective agents as the absolute owner and Holder of such Global Note
for all purposes whatsoever. Neither the Trustee nor any Agent shall have any
liability, responsibility or obligation to any Agent Members or any other
Person on whose behalf Agent Members may act with respect to (i) any
ownership interests in the Global Note, (ii) the accuracy of the records of
the Depositary or its nominee, (iii) any notice required hereunder, (iv) any
payments under or with respect to the Global Note or (v) actions taken or not
taken by any Agent Members.

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall prevent the Company,
the Trustee, any Agent or any of their respective agents from giving effect
to any written certification, proxy or other authorization furnished by the
Depositary or such nominee, as the case may be, or impair, as between the
Depositary, its Agent Members and any other Person on whose behalf an Agent
Member may act, the operation of customary practices of such Persons governing
the exercise of the rights of a Holder of any Note. The registered Holder of a
Global Note may grant proxies and otherwise authorize any Person, including
Agent Members and persons that may hold interests through Agent Members, to
take any action that a Holder is entitled to take under this Indenture or the
Notes.

 

Section 2.07 _Reserved._

 

Section 2.08 _Reserved._

 

Section 2.09 _Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost and Stolen Notes_. If any mutilated
Note is surrendered to the Trustee, the Company shall execute, and the
Trustee shall, upon Company Order, authenticate and deliver, in exchange
therefor a new Note of like tenor and principal amount and bearing a number
not contemporaneously outstanding. If there shall be delivered to the Company
and the Trustee (i) evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss
or theft of any Note and (ii) such security or indemnity as may be required by
them to save each of them and any agent of either of them harmless, then, in
the absence of written notice to the Company or the Trustee that such Note
has been acquired by a protected purchaser, the Company shall execute, and the
Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in lieu of any such destroyed, lost or
stolen Note, a new Note of like tenor and principal amount and bearing a
number not contemporaneously outstanding.

 



18 In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Note has become due and
payable, the Company in its discretion may, instead of issuing a new Note,
pay such Note.

Upon the issuance of any new Note under this Section 2.09, the Company or
Trustee may require payment by the Holder of a sum sufficient to cover any tax
or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any
other expenses (including the fees and expenses of the Trustee) connected
therewith.

Every new Note issued pursuant to this Section 2.09 in lieu of any destroyed,
lost or stolen Note shall constitute an original additional contractual
obligation of the Company, whether or not the destroyed, lost or stolen Note
shall be at any time enforceable by anyone, and shall be entitled to all the
benefits of this Indenture equally and proportionately with any and all other
Notes duly issued hereunder.

The provisions of this Section 2.09 are exclusive and shall preclude (to the
extent lawful) all other rights and remedies with respect to the replacement
or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes.

 

Section 2.10 _Persons Deemed Owners_. Subject to the rights of Holders as of
the Regular Record Date to receive payments of interest on the related
Interest Payment Date, prior to due presentment of a Note for registration of
transfer, the Company, the Trustee, each Agent, and any of their respective
agents may treat the Person in whose name such Note is registered in
the Register as the owner of such Note for the purpose of receiving payment
of the principal of such Note and for all other purposes whatsoever, whether
or not such Note be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee, the Agents
nor any of their respective agents shall be affected by notice to the
contrary.

Section 2.11 _Transfer and E_ _xchange_.

 

(a) _Provisions Applicable to All Transfers and Exchanges_.

 

(i) Subject to the restrictions set forth in this Section 2.11, Physical Notes
and beneficial interests in Global Notes may be transferred or exchanged from
time to time as desired, and each such transfer or exchange will be noted by
the Registrar in the Register.

 

(ii) All Notes issued upon any registration of transfer or exchange in
accordance with this Indenture will be the valid obligations of the Company,
evidencing the same debt, and entitled to the same benefits under this
Indenture as the Notes surrendered upon such registration of transfer or
exchange.

 

(iii) No service charge will be imposed on any Holder of a Physical Note or
any owner of a beneficial interest in a Global Note for any exchange or
registration of transfer, but each of the Company, the Trustee or the
Registrar may require such Holder or owner of a beneficial interest to pay a
sum sufficient to cover any transfer tax, assessment or other governmental
charge imposed in connection with such registration of transfer or exchange.

 



19 (iv) Unless the Company specifies otherwise, none of the Company, the
Trustee, the Registrar or any co-Registrar will be required to exchange or
register a transfer of any Note (i) that has been surrendered for conversion
or (ii) as to which a Fundamental Change Purchase Notice has been delivered
and not withdrawn, except to the extent any portion of such Note is not
subject to the foregoing.

(v) Neither the Trustee nor any Agent will have any obligation or duty to
monitor, determine or inquire as to compliance with any restrictions on
transfer imposed under this Indenture or under applicable law with respect to
any transfer of any interest in any Note (including any transfers between or
among Depositary participants or beneficial owners of interests in any Global
Note) other than to require delivery of such certificates and other
documentation or evidence as are expressly required by, and to do so if and
when expressly required by the terms of, this Indenture, and to examine the
same to determine substantial compliance as to form with the express
requirements hereof.

 

(b) _In General; Transfer and Exchange of Beneficial Interests in Global
Notes._ So long as the Notes are eligible for book-entry settlement with the
Depositary, unless otherwise required by law or by Section 2.11(c):

(i) all Notes will be represented by one or more Global Notes5;

(ii) every transfer and exchange of a beneficial interest in a Global Note
will be effected through the Depositary in accordance with the Applicable
Procedures and the provisions of this Indenture; and

 

(iii) each Global Note may be transferred only as a whole and only (A) by the
Depositary to a nominee of the Depositary, (B) by a nominee of the Depositary
to the Depositary or to another nominee of the Depositary or (C) by the
Depositary or any such nominee to a successor Depositary or a nominee of such
successor Depositary.

 

(c) _Transfer and Exchange of Global Notes for Physical Notes_.

 

(i) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Indenture, each Global Note
will be exchanged for Physical Notes if the Depositary delivers notice to the
Company that:

(A) the Depositary is unwilling or unable to continue to act as Depositary;
or

(B) the Depositary is no longer registered as a clearing agency under the
Exchange Act or is otherwise no longer permitted under applicable law to
continue as Depositary for such Global Note;



   5  | NTD: To be updated if physical notes are issued. 
---|--- 
 



20  and, in each case, the Company promptly delivers a copy of such notice to
the Trustee and the Company fails to appoint a successor Depositary within 90
days after receiving notice from the Depositary.

In each such case, the Company will, in accordance with Section 2.04, promptly
execute, and, upon receipt of a Company Order, the Trustee will, in
accordance with Section 2.04, promptly authenticate and deliver, for each
beneficial interest in each Global Note so exchanged, an aggregate principal
amount of Physical Notes equal to the aggregate principal amount of such
beneficial interest, registered in such names and in such authorized
denominations as the Depositary specifies.

 

(ii) In addition, if an Event of Default has occurred with regard to the Notes
represented by the relevant Global Note and such Event of Default has not
been cured or waived, any owner of a beneficial interest in a Global Note may
deliver a written request through the Depositary to exchange such beneficial
interest for Physical Notes.

 

In such case, (A) the Registrar will deliver notice of such request to the
Company and the Trustee, which notice will identify the aggregate principal
amount of such beneficial interest and the CUSIP of the relevant Global Note;
(B) the Company will, in accordance with Section 2.04, promptly execute, and,
upon receipt of a Company Order, the Trustee, in accordance with Section
2.04, will promptly authenticate and deliver, to such owner, for the
beneficial interest so exchanged by such owner, Physical Notes registered in
such owners name having an aggregate principal amount equal to the aggregate
principal amount of such beneficial interest as the Depositary specifies; and
(C) the Trustee, in accordance with the Applicable Procedures, will cause the
principal amount of such Global Note to be decreased by the
aggregate principal amount of the beneficial interest so exchanged. If all of
the beneficial interests in a Global Note are so exchanged, such Global Note
will be deemed surrendered to the Trustee for cancellation, and the Trustee
will cause such Global Note to be cancelled in accordance with the Trustees
customary procedures and the Applicable Procedures.

(d) _Transfer and Exchange of Physical Notes_. __

(i) If Physical Notes are issued, a Holder may transfer a Physical Note
by: (A) surrendering such Physical Note for registration of transfer to the
Registrar, together with any endorsements or instruments of transfer required
by any of the Company, the Trustee or the Registrar; and (B) satisfying all
other requirements for such transfer set forth in this Section 2.11. Upon the
satisfaction of conditions (A) and (B) of the immediately preceding sentence,
the Company, in accordance with Section 2.04, will promptly execute and
deliver to the Trustee, and the Trustee, upon receipt of a Company Order,
will, in accordance with Section 2.04, promptly authenticate and deliver, in
the name of the designated transferee or transferees, one or more new Physical
Notes, of any authorized denomination, having like aggregate principal
amount.

 



21 (ii) If Physical Notes are issued, a Holder may exchange a Physical Note
for other Physical Notes of any authorized denominations and aggregate
principal amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of the Notes to be
exchanged by surrendering such Notes, together with any endorsements or
instruments of transfer required by any of the Company, the Trustee or the
Registrar, at any office or agency maintained by the Company for such purposes
pursuant to Section 5.02. Whenever a Holder surrenders Notes for exchange, the
Company, in accordance with Section 2.04, will promptly execute and deliver
to the Trustee, and the Trustee, upon receipt of a Company Order and in
accordance with Section 2.04, will promptly authenticate and deliver the Notes
that such Holder is entitled to receive, bearing registration numbers not
contemporaneously outstanding.

(iii) If Physical Notes are issued, a Holder may transfer or exchange a
Physical Note for a beneficial interest in a Global Security by (A)
surrendering such Physical Note for registration of transfer or exchange,
together with any endorsements or instruments of transfer required by any of
the Company, the Trustee or the Registrar, at any office or agency maintained
by the Company for such purposes pursuant to Section 5.02; (B) satisfying all
other requirements for such transfer set forth in this Section 2.11; and (C)
providing written instructions to the Trustee to make, or to direct the
Registrar to make, an adjustment in its books and records with respect to the
applicable Global Note to reflect an increase in the aggregate principal
amount of the Notes represented by such Global Note, which instructions will
contain information regarding the Depositary account to be credited with such
increase. Upon the satisfaction of conditions (A), (B), and (C), the Trustee
will cancel such Physical Note and cause, in accordance with the Applicable
Procedures, the aggregate principal amount of Notes represented by such Global
Note to be increased by the aggregate principal amount of such Physical Note,
and will credit or cause to be credited the account of the Person specified
in the instructions provided by the exchanging Holder in an amount equal to
the aggregate principal amount of such Physical Note. If no Global Notes are
then Outstanding, the Company, in accordance with Section 2.04, will promptly
execute and deliver to the Trustee, and the Trustee, upon receipt of a Company
Order and in accordance with Section 2.04, will authenticate, a new Global
Note in the appropriate aggregate principal amount.

 

Section 2.12 _Purchase of Notes; Cancellation_. The Company may, to the extent
permitted by law, and directly or indirectly (regardless of whether such
Notes are surrendered to the Company), purchase Notes in the open market or by
tender offer at any price or by private agreement. The Company will cause any
Notes so purchased (other than Notes purchased pursuant to cash-settled swaps
or other derivatives) to be surrendered to the Trustee for cancellation. For
the avoidance of doubt, any such Notes purchased by the Company will be
retired and no longer Outstanding hereunder.

 



22 The Company shall deliver to the Trustee for cancellation any Notes previously
authenticated and delivered hereunder that the Company may have acquired in
any manner whatsoever, and may deliver to the Trustee for cancellation any
Notes previously authenticated hereunder which the Company has not issued and
sold. The Trustee shall promptly cancel all Notes surrendered for
registration of transfer, exchange, payment, purchase, repurchase, conversion
or cancellation in accordance with its standard procedures. If the Company
shall acquire any of the Notes in any manner whatsoever, such acquisition
shall not operate as a redemption or satisfaction of the indebtedness
represented by such Notes unless and until the same are delivered to the
Trustee for cancellation. The Notes so acquired, while held by or on behalf of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, shall not entitle the Holder thereof
to convert the Notes. The Company may not issue new Notes to replace Notes it
has paid in full or delivered to the Trustee for cancellation.

 

The Registrar shall retain, in accordance with its customary procedures,
copies of all letters, notices and other written communications received
pursuant to this Section 2.12. The Company shall have the right to inspect and
make copies of all such letters, notices or other written communications at
any reasonable time upon the giving of reasonable written notice to
the Registrar.

Section 2.13 _CUSIP Numbers_. In issuing the Notes, the Company may use
"CUSIP" numbers (if then generally in use); provided that the Trustee shall
have no liability for any defect in the CUSIP numbers as they appear on any
Notes, notice, or elsewhere. The Company will promptly notify the Trustee in
writing of any change in the "CUSIP" numbers. 

_Section 2.14 Payment and Computation of Interest_. The Notes will bear cash
interest at a rate of 2.25% per year until the Maturity Date, unless earlier
purchased, converted or redeemed in accordance with the provisions herein.
Interest on the Notes will accrue from the most recent date on which interest
has been paid or duly provided for or, if no interest has been paid or duly
provided for, (x) in the case of the Initial Notes, [] or (y) in the case of
any other Notes, the date of original issuance of such Notes. Interest will be
paid to the Person in whose name a Note is registered at the Close of
Business on the Regular Record Date immediately preceding the relevant
Interest Payment Date semiannually in arrears on each Interest Payment Date;
_provided_ that, if any Interest Payment Date, Maturity Date or Fundamental
Change Purchase Date of a Note falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the
required payment will be made on the next succeeding Business Day and no
interest on such payment will accrue in respect of the delay. Interest on the
Notes shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve
30-day months; _provided_ , _however_ , that for any period in which a
particular interest rate is applicable for less than a full semiannual period,
interest on the Notes will be computed on the basis of a 30-day month and,
for periods of less than a month, the actual number of days elapsed over a
30-day month. __

Unless the context otherwise requires, payments of the Fundamental Change
Purchase Price, principal and interest on any Note, in each case, that are not
made when due will accrue interest per annum at the then-applicable interest
rate from the required payment date.

The Company will pay Additional Interest under certain circumstances as
provided in Section 6.03.

 



23 ARTICLE 3.

 

REPURCHASE AT THE OPTION OF THE HOLDERS

 

Section 3.01 _Purchase at Option of Holders upon a Fundamental Change_. If a
Fundamental Change occurs, then each Holder shall have the right, at such
Holders option, to require the Company to purchase for cash all of such
Holders Notes, or any portion of such Holders Notes that is equal to $100,
or an integral multiple of $100, on a date (the "Fundamental Change Purchase
Date") specified by the Company that is not less than 20 or more than 35
Business Days after the Company provides the Fundamental Change Company
Notice, at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the
Notes to be purchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest to but excluding the
Fundamental Change Purchase Date (the "Fundamental Change Purchase Price");
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that if the Fundamental Change Purchase Date is
after a Regular Record Date and on or prior to the Interest Payment Date to
which it relates, the Company shall instead pay interest accrued to the
Interest Payment Date to the Holder of record of the Note as of the close of
business on Regular Record Date and the Fundamental Change Purchase Price
shall then be equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Note subject to
purchase and will not include any accrued and unpaid interest.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, there shall be no purchase of any Notes
pursuant to this Section 3.01 if the principal amount of the Notes has been
accelerated, and such acceleration has not been rescinded, on or prior to
the Fundamental Change Purchase Date (except in the case of an acceleration
resulting from a Default by the Company in the payment of the Fundamental
Change Purchase Price with respect to such Notes). In the event the principal
amount of the Notes is accelerated following delivery of a Fundamental Change
Company Notice (except in the case of an acceleration resulting from a Default
by the Company in the payment of the Fundamental Change Purchase Price with
respect to such Notes), the Trustee will promptly (i) return to the
respective Holders thereof any Physical Notes tendered to it or (ii) effect
appropriate book-entry transfers to the respective beneficial holders thereof
any beneficial interests in a Global Note tendered to it in compliance with
the Applicable Procedures, in which case, upon such return or transfer, as the
case may be, the Fundamental Change Purchase Notice with respect thereto shall
be deemed to have been withdrawn.

 

Section 3.02 _Fundamental Change Company Notice_.

 

(a) _General_. On or before the 10th Business Day after the occurrence of a
Fundamental Change, the Company shall provide to all Holders of the Notes,
the Trustee and the Paying Agent (in the case of any Paying Agent other than
the Trustee) a written notice (the "Fundamental Change Company Notice") of the
occurrence of such Fundamental Change and of the purchase right at the option
of the Holders arising as a result thereof. Such notice shall be sent to the
Holders in accordance with Section 12.08(c) (with a copy to the Trustee).
Simultaneously with providing such Fundamental Change Company Notice, the
Company shall issue a press release announcing the occurrence of such
Fundamental Change and make the press release available on the Companys
website. Each Fundamental Change Company Notice shall specify:

 

(i) the events causing the Fundamental Change;

 



24 (ii) the Effective Date of the Fundamental Change, and whether the
Fundamental Change is a Make Whole Fundamental Change, in which case the
notice shall state the Effective Date of the Make Whole Fundamental Change;

 

(iii) information about the Holders right to convert the Notes;

 

(iv) information about the Holders right to require the Company to purchase
the Notes;

 

(v) the last date on which a Holder of Notes may exercise the purchase right
pursuant to Section 3.01;

 

(vi) the Fundamental Change Purchase Price;

(viii) the name and address of the Paying Agent and the Conversion Agent, if
applicable;

 

(ix) the applicable Conversion Rate and any adjustments to the applicable
Conversion Rate resulting from the Fundamental Change;

(x) if applicable, that the Notes with respect to which a Fundamental Change
Purchase Notice has been delivered by a Holder may be converted only if the
Holder withdraws the Fundamental Change Purchase Notice in accordance with
Section 3.05;

 

(xi) the procedures required for exercise of the purchase option upon the
Fundamental Change, including that the Holder must exercise the purchase
option prior to the Fundamental Change Expiration Time; and

(xii) that the Holder shall have the right to withdraw any Notes surrendered
for purchase prior to the Fundamental Change Expiration Time and the
procedures required for withdrawal of any such exercise as described in 3.05;

 

(b) No failure of the Company to give the foregoing notices and no defect
therein shall limit the Holders repurchase rights or affect the validity of
the proceedings for the repurchase of the Notes pursuant to Section 3.01.

(c) At the Companys written request, the Trustee shall give the Fundamental
Change Company Notice in the Companys name and at the Companys expense;
provided, however, that, in all cases, the Fundamental Change Company Notice
shall be prepared by the Company; provided, further that the Company shall
have delivered to the Trustee, at least five Business Days before the
Fundamental Change Company Notice is required to be given to the Holders (or
such shorter period agreed to by the Trustee), an Officers Certificate
requesting that the Trustee give such notice and attaching the form of
Fundamental Change Company Notice and including the information required by

 



25  Section 3.02(a). Neither the Trustee nor the Paying Agent shall be
responsible for determining if a Fundamental Change has occurred or for
delivering a Fundamental Change Company Notice to Holders or for the content
of any Fundamental Change Company Notice.

Section 3.03 _Repurchase Procedures_.

 

(a) Purchases of Notes under Section 3.01 shall be made, at the option of the
Holder thereof, upon:

applicable provisions of the Notes and this Indenture.

(b) _Notice to Company_. The Paying Agent shall promptly notify the Company

or beneficial interests in a Global Note by book-entry transfer as specified
in Section 3.03, the Holder of the tendered Note shall (unless such
Fundamental Change Purchase Notice is withdrawn in accordance with Section
3.05) thereafter be entitled to receive solely the Fundamental Change Purchase
Price, in cash with respect to such Note (and any previously accrued and
unpaid interest on such Note, if applicable). Such Fundamental Change Purchase
Price shall be paid to such Holder, provided that the conditions in this
Article 3 have been satisfied (including, without

 



26  limitation, the proper delivery or book-entry transfer of such Note as
required under Section 3.03(a)) and subject to the Paying Agent holding money
sufficient to pay the Fundamental Change Purchase Price, promptly following
the later of the applicable Fundamental Change Purchase Date and the time of
delivery or book-entry transfer of such Note to the Paying Agent by the Holder
thereof in the manner required by Section 3.01.

 

Section 3.05 _Withdrawal of Fundamental Change Purchase Notice_. A Fundamental
Change Purchase Notice may be withdrawn (in whole or in part) by means of a
written notice of withdrawal delivered to the Paying Agent in accordance with
the Fundamental Change Company Notice, as applicable, at any time prior to the
Fundamental Change Expiration Time, as applicable, specifying:

 

(a) the principal amount of the Notes with respect to which such notice of
withdrawal is being submitted;

 

(b) if certificated, the certificate numbers of the withdrawn Notes; and

 

(c) the principal amount, if any, of each Note that remains subject to the
Fundamental Change Purchase Notice, which must be such that the principal
amount of such Holders Notes not purchased equals $100 or an integral
multiple of $100;

_provided_ , _however_ , that if the Notes are Global Notes, the notice must
comply with the Applicable Procedures. __

The Paying Agent will promptly return to the respective Holders thereof any
Physical Notes with respect to which a Fundamental Change Purchase Notice has
been withdrawn in compliance with the provisions of this Section 3.05.

 

Section 3.06 _Deposit of Fundamental Change Purchase Price_. Prior to 11:00
a.m., New York City time, on the Fundamental Change Purchase Date, the
Company shall deposit with the Paying Agent (or, if the Company or a
Subsidiary or an Affiliate of either of them is acting as the Paying Agent,
shall segregate and hold in trust as provided herein) an amount of money
(in immediately available funds if deposited on such Business Day) sufficient
to pay the Fundamental Change Purchase Price of all the Notes or portions
thereof that are to be purchased as of the Fundamental Change Purchase Date.
If the Paying Agent holds money sufficient to pay the Fundamental Change
Purchase Price of the tendered Notes on the Fundamental Change Purchase Date,
then (a) such tendered Notes will cease to be Outstanding and (except as
provided below in clause (b)) interest will cease to accrue thereon (whether
or not book-entry transfer of the Notes is made or whether or not the Notes
are delivered to the Paying Agent) and (b) all other rights of the Holders of
such tendered Notes will terminate (other than (x) the right to receive the
Fundamental Change Purchase Price and (y) the right of the Holder of record on
such Regular Record Date to receive any interest payment pursuant to Section
3.01, if applicable).

 

Section 3.07 _Notes Purchased in Whole or in Part_. Any Note that is to be
purchased pursuant to this Article 3, whether in whole or in part, shall be
surrendered at the office of the Paying Agent (with due endorsement by, or a
written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the
Trustee duly executed by, the Holder thereof or such Holders attorney

 



27  duly authorized in writing) and, to the extent that only a part of the Note
so surrendered is to be purchased, the Company shall execute and, upon receipt
of a Company Order, the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to the Holder
of such Note, without service charge, a new Note or Notes, of any authorized
denomination as requested by such Holder in aggregate principal amount equal
to, and in exchange for, the portion of the principal amount of the Note so
surrendered that is not purchased.

Section 3.08 _Covenant To Comply with Applicable Laws upon Purchase
of Notes_. In connection with any purchase of Notes under Section 3.01, the
Company shall, in each case if required by law, (i) comply with the provisions
of Rule 13e-4, Rule 14e-1 and any other tender offer rules under the Exchange
Act to the extent any such rules are applicable, (ii) file a Schedule TO or
any successor or similar schedule, if required, under the Exchange Act and
(iii) otherwise comply with all U.S. federal or state securities laws
applicable to the Company in connection with offer by the Company to purchase
Notes under Section 3.01, in each case, so as to permit the rights and
obligations under this Article 3 to be exercised in the time and in the manner
specified under this Article 3. 

Section 3.09 _Repayment to the Company_. To the extent that the aggregate
amount of money deposited by the Company pursuant to Section 3.06 exceeds the
aggregate Fundamental Change Purchase Price of the Notes or portions thereof
that the Company is obligated to purchase as of the Fundamental Change
Purchase Date, then, following the Fundamental Change Purchase Date, the
Paying Agent shall, upon demand of the Company, promptly return any such
excess to the Company.

ARTICLE 4.

 

CONVERSION

Section 4.01  _Right To Convert_. (a) Subject to and upon compliance with the
provisions of this Indenture, each Holder shall have the right, at such
Holders option, to convert all or any portion of its Notes at an initial
Conversion Rate of [ ] shares of Common Stock per $100 aggregate
principal amount of Notes (equivalent to an initial Conversion Price of
approximately $[ ] per share of Common Stock) into the Settlement
Amount determined in accordance with Section 4.03(a)(ii), (x) prior to the
Close of Business on the Business Day immediately preceding [three months
prior to maturity], 2020, only upon satisfaction of one or more of the
conditions described in Section 4.01(b), and (y) on or after [insert date
inserted in immediately preceding brackets], 2020, at any time until the
Close of Business on the second Scheduled Trading Day immediately preceding
the stated Maturity Date regardless of whether the conditions described in
Section 4.01(b) are satisfied.

 

(b) (i) A Holder may surrender all or any portion of its Notes for conversion
during any calendar quarter commencing after the quarter ending [the fiscal
quarter in which the notes were issued], 2015 if the Closing Sale Price of the
Common Stock for at least 20 Trading Days (whether or not consecutive) during
the period of 30 consecutive Trading Days ending on the last Trading Day of
the calendar quarter immediately preceding the calendar quarter in which the
conversion occurs, is more than 130% of the

 



28  applicable Conversion Price in effect on each applicable Trading Day.
Neither the Trustee nor the Conversion Agent shall have any obligation (x) to
determine whether the market price condition described in this Section
4.01(b)(i) has been met or (y) to verify the Companys determination regarding
such market price condition.

 

(ii) If, prior to the Close of Business on the Business Day immediately
preceding [three months before maturity ], 2020 the Trading Price per $100
principal amount of Notes on each Trading Day during any ten consecutive
Trading-Day period (the "Measurement Period") is less than 98% of the product
of (x) the Closing Sale Price of the Common Stock on such Trading Day and (y)
the Conversion Rate in effect on such Trading Day, a Holder may surrender
Notes for conversion at any time during the five consecutive Trading Days
following such Measurement Period. Whenever the condition to conversion set
forth in this Section 4.01(b)(ii) has been met, the Company shall so notify
the Holders, the Trustee and the Bid Solicitation Agent and the Conversion
Agent (in each case, if other than the Trustee) in writing. The Trading Price
shall be determined by the Company pursuant to this Section 4.01(b)(ii) and
the definition of "Trading Price" set forth in Section 1.01. The Company shall
provide written notice to the Bid Solicitation Agent (if other than the
Company) of the three independent nationally recognized securities dealers
selected by the Company in accordance with the definition of Trading Price,
along with the appropriate contact information for each. However, the Bid
Solicitation Agent (if other than the Company) shall have no obligation to
solicit market bid quotations for the Company to determine the Trading Price
of the Notes unless the Company has requested such solicitation in writing;
and the Company shall have no obligation to make such request (or, if the
Company is the Bid Solicitation Agent, to determine the Trading Price of the
Notes) unless a Holder of a Note provides it and the Trustee with reasonable
evidence that the Trading Price per $100 principal amount of Notes would
be less than 98% of the product of (x) the Closing Sale Price of the Common
Stock on such Trading Day and (y) the Conversion Rate in effect on such
Trading Day. At such time, the Company shall instruct the Bid Solicitation
Agent in writing to solicit market bid quotations for the Notes from three
independent nationally recognized securities dealers selected by the Company
for the Company to determine (or, if the Company is the Bid Solicitation
Agent, the Company shall determine) the Trading Price per $100 principal
amount of the Notes beginning on such Trading Day and on each successive
Trading Day until the Trading Price per $100 principal amount of Notes for a
Trading Day is greater than or equal to 98% of the product of (x) the Closing
Sale Price of the Common Stock on such Trading Day and (y) the Conversion Rate
in effect on such Trading Day. If, on any Trading Day after the condition to
conversion set forth in this Section 4.01(b)(ii) has been met, the Trading
Price per $100 principal amount of Notes is greater than or equal to 98% of
the product of (x) the Closing Sale Price of the Common Stock on such Trading
Day and (y) the Conversion Rate in effect on such Trading Day, the Company
will so notify the Holders, the Trustee, the Bid Solicitation Agent and the
Conversion Agent (if other than the Trustee) in writing.

 



29 (iii) If the Company elects to issue or distribute, as the case may be, to all
or substantially all holders of the Common Stock to (x) any rights, options
or warrants entitling them to subscribe for or purchase, for a period expiring
within 60 calendar days after the declaration date for such issuance, shares
of the Common Stock, at a price per share that is less than the Closing Sale
Price of the Common Stock on the Trading Day immediately preceding the
declaration date for such issuance; or (y) cash, debt securities (or other
evidence of indebtedness) or other assets or securities (excluding dividends
or distributions in respect of which an adjustment to the Conversion Rate is
made pursuant to Section 4.04(a)), which distribution has a per share value
exceeding 10% of the Closing Sale Price of the Common Stock as of the Trading
Day immediately preceding the declaration date for such distribution, then, in
either case, the Company must deliver notice of such distribution, and of the
Ex-Dividend Date for such distribution, to the Holders at least 35 Scheduled
Trading Days prior to the Ex-Dividend Date for such distribution. After the
Company has delivered such notice, Holders may surrender their Notes for
conversion at any time until the earlier of (a) Close of Business on
the Business Day immediately preceding such Ex-Dividend Date and (b) the
Companys announcement that such issuance or distribution will not take place.
Neither the Trustee nor the Conversion Agent shall have any obligation (I)
to determine whether a distribution described in this Section 4.01(b)(iii)
has occurred or (II) to verify the Companys determination regarding such a
distribution.

 

(iv) If a transaction or event that constitutes a Fundamental Change or a Make
Whole Fundamental Change occurs prior to the Close of Business on the
Business Day immediately preceding [ ], 2020, a holder may
surrender Notes for conversion at any time from and after the date that is 35
Scheduled Trading Days prior to the anticipated effective date of the
transaction or event (or, if later, the date on which the Company gives notice
of such transaction) until the Close of Business on (1) if such transaction or
event is a Fundamental Change, the Business Day immediately preceding the
related Fundamental Change Purchase Date, or (2) otherwise, on the 40th
Scheduled Trading Day immediately following the effective date for such
transaction or event. To the extent commercially reasonably practicable, the
Company will give notice to Holders of the anticipated effective date for such
transaction or event not less than 35 Scheduled Trading Days prior to the
anticipated effective date or, if the Company does not have knowledge of such
transaction or event or the Company determines, in its commercially reasonable
discretion, that it is impractical or inadvisable to disclose the anticipated
effective date of such transaction or event at least 35 Scheduled
Trading Days prior to the anticipated effective date, within one Business Day
of the date upon which the Company receives notice, or otherwise becomes aware
of, such transaction or event, unless the Company determines, in its
commercially reasonable discretion, that it is no longer impractical or
inadvisable to disclose the anticipated effective date of such transaction or
event (but in no event later than the actual effective date of such
transaction or event). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event will the
Company be required to provide such notice to the Holders before the earlier
of (i) the actual effective date

 



30  of such transaction or event and (ii) the earlier of such time as the
Company or its Affiliates (a) have publicly disclosed or acknowledged the
circumstances giving rise to such anticipated transaction or event or (b) are
required to publicly disclose under applicable law or the rules of any stock
exchange on which the Companys equity is then listed the circumstances giving
rise to such anticipated transaction or event. Neither the Trustee nor the
Conversion Agent shall have any obligation to (x) determine whether a
Fundamental Change or Make Whole Fundamental Change has occurred or (y) verify
the Companys determination regarding such occurrence or non-occurrence.

(v) Holders will have the right to surrender Notes for conversion if the
Company is a party to a consolidation, merger or binding share exchange or a
sale, assignment, conveyance, transfer, lease or other disposition of all or
substantially all of the Companys property and assets that does not also
constitute a Fundamental Change, in each case pursuant to which the Common
Stock would be converted into cash, securities or other property. In such
event, Holders will have the right to surrender Notes for conversion at any
time from and including the 35th Scheduled Trading Day prior to the
anticipated effective date of such transaction to, and including, the 40th
Scheduled Trading Day following the effective date of such transaction. To the
extent commercially reasonably practicable, the Company will give notice to
Holders of the anticipated effective date for such transaction not less than
35 Scheduled Trading Days prior to the anticipated effective date or, if the
Company does not have knowledge of such transaction or it determines, in its
commercially reasonable discretion, that it is impractical or inadvisable to
disclose the anticipated effective date of such transaction at least 35
Scheduled Trading Days prior to the anticipated effective date, within one
Business Day of the date upon which the Company receives notice, or otherwise
becomes aware, of such transaction, unless the Company determines, in its
commercially reasonable discretion, that it is no longer impractical or
inadvisable to disclose the anticipated effective date of such transaction
(but in no event later than the actual effective date of such transaction).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event will the Company be required to
provide such notice to Holders before the earlier of (i) the actual
effective date of such transaction and (ii) the earlier of such time as the
Company or its Affiliates (a) have publicly disclosed or acknowledged the
circumstances giving rise to such anticipated transaction or (b) are required
to publicly disclose under applicable law or the rules of any stock exchange
on which the Companys equity is then listed the circumstances giving rise to
such anticipated transaction. Neither the Trustee nor the Conversion Agent
shall have any obligation (x) to determine whether a corporate event
described in this Section 4.01(b)(v) has occurred or (y) to verify the
Companys determination regarding such a corporate event.

 



31 Section 4.02 _Conversion Procedures_.

 

(a) Each Physical Note shall be convertible at the office of the Conversion
Agent and, if applicable, in accordance with the Applicable Procedures.

(b) To exercise the conversion privilege with respect to a beneficial interest
in a Global Note, the Holder must comply with the Applicable Procedures for
converting, and effecting a book-entry transfer to the Conversion Agent of, a
beneficial interest on a Global Note and pay the funds, if any, required by
Section 4.02(f) and any taxes or duties if required pursuant to Section
4.02(g), and the Conversion Agent must be informed of the conversion in
accordance with the customary practice of the Depositary.

 

To exercise the conversion privilege with respect to any Physical Notes, the
Holder of such Physical Notes shall:

 

(i) duly sign and complete a conversion notice in the form set forth in the
Form of Notice of Conversion (the "Conversion Notice") or a facsimile of the
Conversion Notice;

(ii) deliver the Conversion Notice, which is irrevocable, and the Note to the
Conversion Agent;

(iii) if required, furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents;

(iv) if required, pay all transfer or similar taxes as set forth in Section
4.02(g); and

 

(v) if required, make any payment required under Section 4.02(f).

 

If, upon conversion of a Note, any shares of Common Stock are to be issued to
a Person other than the Holder of such Note, the related Conversion Notice
shall include such other Persons name and address.

If a Note has been submitted for repurchase pursuant to a Fundamental Change
Purchase Notice, such Note may not be converted except to the extent such Note
has been withdrawn by the Holder and is no longer submitted for repurchase
pursuant to a Fundamental Change Purchase Notice or unless such
Fundamental Change Purchase Notice is withdrawn in accordance with Section
3.07 prior to the relevant Fundamental Change Expiration Time.

For any Note, the date on which the Holder of such Note satisfies all of the
applicable requirements set forth above with respect to such Note shall be the
"Conversion Date" with respect to such Note.

 

Each conversion shall be deemed to have been effected as to any such Notes (or
portion thereof) surrendered for conversion immediately prior to the Close of
Business on the applicable Conversion Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that
except to the extent required by Section 4.04, the person in whose name any
shares of Common Stock shall be issuable upon conversion, if any, shall be
treated as a stockholder of record (i) as of the Close of Business on the last
VWAP Trading Day of the applicable Conversion Period in a Combination
Settlement and (ii) as of the Close of Business on the Conversion Date in
a Physical Settlement. At the Close of Business on the Conversion Date for a
Note, the converting Holder shall no longer be the Holder of such Note.

 



32 (c) _Endorsement_. Any Notes surrendered for conversion shall, unless
shares of Common Stock issuable on conversion are to be issued in the same
name as the registration of such Notes, be duly endorsed by, or be accompanied
by instruments of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company duly executed
by, the Holder or its duly authorized attorney.

(d) _Physical Notes_. If any Physical Notes in a denomination greater than
$100 shall be surrendered for partial conversion, the Company shall execute
and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to the Holder of the Physical
Notes so surrendered, without charge, new Physical Notes in authorized
denominations in an aggregate principal amount equal to the unconverted
portion of the surrendered Physical Notes.

(e) _Global Notes_. Upon the conversion of a beneficial interest in Global
Notes, the Conversion Agent shall make a notation in its records as to the
reduction in the principal amount represented thereby. The Company shall
notify the Trustee in writing of any conversions of Notes effected through
any Conversion Agent other than the Trustee.

(f) _Interest Due Upon Conversion_. If a Holder converts a Note after the
Close of Business on a Regular Record Date but prior to the Open of Business
on the Interest Payment Date corresponding to such Regular Record Date, such
Holder must accompany such Note with an amount of cash equal to the amount
of interest that will payable on such Note on the corresponding Interest
Payment Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that a Holder need not make such
payment (1) if the Conversion Date follows the Regular Record Date immediately
preceding the Maturity Date; (2) if the Company has specified a Fundamental
Change Purchase Date that is after a Regular Record Date and on or prior to
the corresponding Interest Payment Date; or (3) to the extent of any overdue
interest, if any overdue interest exists at the time of conversion with
respect to such Note.

(g) _Taxes Due upon Conversion_. If a Holder converts a Note, the Company
will pay any documentary, stamp or similar issue or transfer tax due on the
issue of any shares of the Common Stock upon the conversion, unless the tax is
due because the Holder requests that any shares be issued in a name other
than the Holders name, in which case the Holder will pay that tax. The
Conversion Agent may refuse to deliver the certificates representing the
shares of Common Stock being issued in a name other than the Holders name
until the Trustee receives a sum sufficient to pay any tax that is due by
such Holder in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence.

 

(h) Notes may only be converted in multiples of $1,000 unless the beneficial
Holder exercising the Notes is then converting all the Notes it then holds.
If a beneficial Holder seeks to convert Notes in a principal amount other than
a multiple of $1,000 it will be deemed to make a representation that it is
submitting for conversion all of the Notes it then holds. The Company may
request written representation of the same prior to the conversion of any
Notes.

 



33 Section 4.03 _Settlement Upon Conversion._

 

(a) _Settlement_. Subject to this Section 4.03 and Sections 4.06 and 4.07,
upon conversion of any Note, the Company shall pay or deliver, as the case
may be, to Holders, in full satisfaction of its conversion obligation under
Section 4.01, in respect of each $100 principal amount of Notes being
converted, a Settlement Amount consisting of, at the election of the Company,
solely cash ("Cash Settlement"), solely shares of Common Stock (together with
cash in lieu of any fractional share of Common Stock pursuant to Section
4.03(b)) ("Physical Settlement") or a combination of cash and shares of
Common Stock ("Combination Settlement").

(i)  _Settlement Election_. All conversions occurring on or after [three
months prior to maturity], 2020 shall be settled using the same Settlement
Method. Prior to[three months prior to maturity], 2020, the Company will use
the same Settlement Method for all conversions occurring on the same
Conversion Date, but the Company shall not have any obligation to use the same
Settlement Method with respect to conversions that occur on different
Conversion Dates. If the Company elects a Settlement Method (a "Settlement
Election") and a Specified Dollar Amount, if applicable (a "Specified Dollar
Amount Election"), the Company shall provide to the Holders so converting, the
Trustee and the Conversion Agent a notice of such Settlement Method (each
such notice, a "Settlement Election Notice") or such Specified Dollar Amount
(each such notice, a "Specified Dollar Amount Election Notice"), no later
than the Close of Business on the second Trading Day immediately following
the related Conversion Date (or, in the case of any conversions occurring on
or after[three months prior to maturity] , 2020, no later than [three months
prior to maturity], 2020). If the Company does not timely elect a Settlement
Method, the Company shall no longer have the right to elect Cash Settlement or
Physical Settlement, and the Company shall be deemed to have elected
Combination Settlement in respect of its Conversion Obligation, and the
Specified Dollar Amount per $100 principal amount of Notes shall be deemed to
be $100. If the Company elects Combination Settlement but does not timely
notify converting Holders of the Specified Dollar Amount per $100 principal
amount of Notes, such Specified Dollar Amount will be deemed to be $100.

In addition, the Company may, prior to [three months prior to maturity],
2020, at its option, irrevocably elect Combination Settlement with a
particular Specified Dollar Amount for all conversions subsequent to its
notice to Holders thereof by notice of such election to Holders, the Trustee
and the Conversion Agent.

 



34 (ii) _Settlement Amount_. The cash, shares of Common Stock or combination
of cash and shares of Common Stock in respect of any conversion of Notes (the
"Settlement Amount") shall be computed as follows:

 

(A) if the Company elects Physical Settlement, the Company shall deliver to
the converting Holder, in respect of each $100 principal amount of its Notes
being converted, a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the applicable
Conversion Rate, together with cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Common
Stock pursuant to Section 4.03(b);

 

(B) if the Company elects (or is deemed to have elected) Cash Settlement, the
Company shall pay to the converting Holder, in respect of each $100 principal
amount of its Notes being converted, cash in an amount equal to the sum of the
Daily Conversion Values for each of the 25 consecutive VWAP Trading Days
during the related Conversion Period; and

 

(C) if the Company elects (or is deemed to have elected) Combination
Settlement, the Company shall pay or deliver, as the case may be, to the
converting Holder, in respect of each $100 principal amount of its Notes being
converted, an amount of cash and number of shares of Common Stock, if any,
equal to the sum of the Daily Settlement Amounts for each of the 25
consecutive VWAP Trading Days during the related Conversion Period.

__(iii) _Delivery Obligation_. The Settlement Amounts upon conversion of the
Notes will, in the case of cash be paid, by the Company through the Conversion
Agent and in the case of Common Stock, be delivered by the Company through its
stock transfer agent. The Company shall pay or deliver, as the case may be,
the Settlement Amount due in respect of its conversion obligation under this
Section 4.03, (i) on the third Business Day immediately following the relevant
Conversion Date, if the Company elects Physical Settlement, unless
such Conversion Date occurs following the regular record date immediately
preceding the Maturity Date, in which case the Company will make such delivery
(and payment, if applicable) on the Maturity Date and (ii) on the third
Business Day immediately following the last VWAP Trading Day of the related
Conversion Period, in any other case; _provided_ , _however_ , that if prior
to the Conversion Date for any converted Notes, the Common Stock has been
replaced by Reference Property consisting solely of cash, the Company will
pay the conversion consideration due in respect of such conversion on the
tenth Trading Day immediately following the related Conversion Date, and,
notwithstanding the foregoing in this Section 4.03, no Conversion Period will
apply to those conversions. For the avoidance of doubt, in the case of Cash
Settlement or Combination Settlement, if a VWAP Market Disruption Event occurs
on a Scheduled Trading Day during the Conversion Period, or if such Scheduled
Trading day is not a Trading Day for any other reason, then the Daily
Conversion Value or Daily Settlement Amount, as applicable, will be determined
on the next following Trading Day, and delivery of the Settlement Amount will
be delayed accordingly. No interest will accrue on account of such delay. __

 



35 (b) _Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company will
not issue fractional shares of Common Stock as part of the Settlement Amount
due with respect to any converted Note. Instead, if any Settlement Amount
includes a fraction of a share of the Common Stock, the Company will, in lieu
of delivering such fraction of a share of Common Stock, pay an amount of cash
equal to the product of such fraction of a share and (i) in a Physical
Settlement, the Daily VWAP on the relevant Conversion Date, or if such
Conversion Date is not a VWAP Trading Day, the immediately preceding VWAP
Trading Day or (ii) in the case of any other Settlement Method, the Daily VWAP
on the last VWAP Trading Day of the relevant Conversion Period (subject to
Section 4.03(c) immediately below).

 

(c) _Conversion of Multiple Notes by a Single Holder_. If a Holder surrenders
more than one Note for conversion on a single Conversion Date, the Company
will calculate the amount of cash and the number of shares of Common Stock due
with respect to such Notes as if such Holder had surrendered for conversion
one Note having an aggregate principal amount equal to the sum of the
principal amounts of each of the Notes surrendered for conversion by such
Holder on such Conversion Date or, if the Notes surrendered for conversion are
beneficial interests in a Global Note, based on such other aggregate number of
Notes, or beneficial interests therein, being surrendered by the Holder for
conversion on the same date as the Depositary may otherwise request.

 

(d) _Settlement of Accrued Interest and Deemed Payment of Principal_. If a
Holder converts a Note, the Company will not adjust the Conversion Rate to
account for any accrued and unpaid interest on such Note, and the Companys
delivery or payment, as the case may be, of cash, shares of Common Stock or a
combination of cash and shares of Common Stock into which a Note is
convertible will be deemed to satisfy and discharge in full the Companys
obligation to pay the principal of, and accrued and unpaid interest, if any,
on, such Note to, but excluding, the Conversion Date; _provided_ ,  _however_
, that subject to Section 4.02(f), if a Holder converts a Note after the Close
of Business on a Regular Record Date and prior to the Open of Business on the
corresponding Interest Payment Date, the Company will still be obligated to
pay the interest due on such Interest Payment Date to the Holder of such Note
on such Regular Record Date.

As a result, except as otherwise provided in the proviso to the immediately
preceding sentence, any accrued and unpaid interest with respect to a
converted Note will be deemed to be paid in full rather than cancelled,
extinguished or forfeited. In addition, if the Settlement Amount for any Note
includes both cash and shares of Common Stock, accrued and unpaid interest
will be deemed to be paid first out of the amount of cash delivered upon such
conversion.

 

(e) _Notices_. Whenever a Conversion Date occurs with respect to a Note, the
Conversion Agent will, as promptly as possible, and in no event later than
the Business Day immediately following such Conversion Date, deliver to the
Company and the Trustee, if it is not then the Conversion Agent, notice that a
Conversion Date has occurred, which notice will state such Conversion Date,
the principal amount of Notes converted on such Conversion Date and the names
of the Holders that converted Notes on such Conversion Date.

 



36 On the first Business Day immediately following the last VWAP Trading Day of
the Conversion Period applicable to any Note surrendered for conversion in a
Cash Settlement or a Combination Settlement, the Company will deliver a
written notice to the Conversion Agent and the Trustee (if not also the
Conversion Agent) stating the amount of cash and the number of shares of
Common Stock, if any, that the Company is obligated to pay or deliver, as the
case may be, to satisfy its conversion obligation with respect to each Note
converted on such Conversion Date.

 

(f) _Exchange in Lieu of Conversion_. When a Holder surrenders Notes for
conversion, the Company may, at its election, direct the Conversion Agent to
surrender, on or prior to the first Business Day immediately following the
Conversion Date, such Notes to a financial institution designated by the
Company for exchange in lieu of conversion. In order to accept any Notes
surrendered for conversion, the designated financial institution must agree to
pay and/or deliver, as the case may be, in exchange for such Notes, the
Settlement Amount that the Company would be obligated to deliver upon the
conversion of such Notes at the time the Company would otherwise be required
to deliver such consideration. By the Close of Business on the Business Day
immediately following the Conversion Date, the Company will notify the Holder
surrendering Notes for conversion, the Trustee and the Conversion Agent that
it has directed the designated financial institution to make an exchange in
lieu of conversion and that the designated financial institution has agreed to
make such exchange in lieu of conversion. A copy of such notice shall include
wire instructions and delivery instructions and shall be delivered to the
conversion agent and to the designated institution.

 

(i) If the designated institution accepts any such Notes, it will deliver the
amount of cash, if any, and the number of shares of Common Stock, if any, due
upon conversion of such Notes directly to the Holder of such Notes no later
than 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the date the Company would have
otherwise been required to deliver such consideration. In the case of Notes
held through the Depositary, the designated institution shall (a) wire such
cash, if any, to the Holder, (b) process a transfer to such Holder of such
number of shares of Common Stock. Notes exchanged by the designated
institution will remain outstanding. If the designated institution agrees to
accept any Notes for exchange in lieu of conversion but does not timely
deliver the related consideration, or if such designated institution does not
accept the Notes for exchange, the Company will deliver the relevant
consideration to the Holder on the applicable settlement date therefor as if
the Company had not made an exchange in lieu of conversion election.

 

(ii) The Companys designation of a financial institution to which the Notes
may be submitted for exchange does not require the financial institution to
accept any Notes. The Company will not pay any consideration to, and the
Company may, but will not be obligated to, otherwise enter into any agreement
with, the designated institution for or with respect to such designation.

 



37 Section 4.04 _Adjustment of Conversion Rate_. The Conversion Rate will be
adjusted as described in this Section 4.04, except that no adjustment to the
Conversion Rate will be made for a given transaction if Holders of the Notes
will participate in that transaction, without conversion of the Notes, on the
same terms and at the same time as a holder of a number of shares of Common
Stock equal to the principal amount of a Holders Notes (expressed in
thousands) multiplied by the Conversion Rate would participate.

 

(a) If the Company issues solely shares of Common Stock as a dividend or
distribution on all or substantially all shares of the Common Stock, or if
the Company subdivides or combines the Common Stock, the Conversion Rate will
be adjusted based on the following formula:

 

CR1 = CR0 x _OS 1_

 

 OS0

where,



     | CR0 = | the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the
Open of Business on the Ex-Dividend Date of such dividend or distribution, or
immediately prior to the Open of Business on the effective date of such share
split or combination, as applicable; 
---|---|--- 



     | CR1 = | the Conversion Rate in effect immediately after the Open
of Business on such Ex-Dividend Date of such dividend or distribution, or
immediately after the Open of Business on the effective date of such share
split or combination, as applicable; 
---|---|--- 



     | OS0 = | the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Open of Business on such Ex-Dividend Date of such
dividend or distribution, or immediately prior to the Open of Business on the
effective date of such share split or combination, as applicable; and 
---|---|--- 



     | OS1 = | the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding
immediately after giving effect to such dividend or distribution, or
immediately after the effective date of such subdivision or combination of
common stock, as the case may be. 
---|---|--- 

Any adjustment made under this clause (a) will become effective immediately
after the Open of Business on the Ex-Dividend Date for such dividend or
distribution (regardless of whether the dividend or distribution is scheduled
to occur after the Maturity Date), or immediately after the Open of Business
on the effective date of such subdivision or combination of Common Stock, as
the case may be. If such dividend, distribution, subdivision or combination
described in this clause (a) is declared but not so paid or made, the
Conversion Rate shall be immediately readjusted, effective as of the date
the Board of Directors or a duly authorized committee thereof determines not
to pay such dividend or distribution or to effect such subdivision or
combination, to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such
dividend or distribution had not been declared or subdivision or combination
had not been announced.

 



38 (b) If an Ex-Dividend Date occurs for a distribution to all or substantially
all holders of the Common Stock any rights, options or warrants entitling
them, for a period of not more than 60 calendar days from the announcement
date for such distribution, to subscribe for or purchase shares of the Common
Stock, at a price per share less than the average of the Closing Sale Prices
of the Common Stock for the 10 consecutive Trading-Day period ending on, and
including, the Trading Day immediately preceding the announcement date for
such distribution, the Conversion Rate will be increased based on the
following formula



      |  |  |  | 
---|---|---|---|--- 
    CR1 = CR0 x  |  | _OS 0 + X_ |  | 
   | OS0 + Y |  | 
 



     | CR0 = | the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the
Open of Business on the Ex-Dividend Date for such distribution; 
---|---|--- 



     | CR1 = | the Conversion Rate in effect immediately after the Open
of Business on such Ex-Dividend Date for such distribution; 
---|---|--- 



     | OS0 = | the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Open of Business on such Ex-Dividend Date for such
distribution; 
---|---|--- 
 



     | X = | the total number of shares of Common Stock issuable pursuant
to such rights, options or warrants; and 
---|---|--- 



     | Y = | the number of shares of Common Stock equal to the aggregate
price payable to exercise such rights, options or warrants _divided by_ the
average of the Closing Sale Prices of the Common Stock over the 10
consecutive Trading-Day period ending on, and including, the Trading Day
immediately preceding the announcement date for such distribution. 
---|---|--- 
 

Any increase made under this clause (b) will be made successively whenever any
such rights, options or warrants are issued and will become effective
immediately after the Open of Business on the Ex-Dividend Date for such
distribution, regardless of whether the distribution date is scheduled to
occur after the Maturity Date. To the extent that such rights, options or
warrants expire prior to the Maturity Date and shares of Common Stock are not
delivered after the expiration of such rights, options or warrants, the
Conversion Rate shall be decreased to the Conversion Rate that would then be
in effect had the increase with respect to the issuance of such rights,
options or warrants been made on the basis of delivery of only the number of
shares of Common Stock actually delivered. If such rights, options or warrants
were scheduled to be distributed prior to the Maturity Date and are not so
distributed, the Conversion Rate shall be decreased to the Conversion Rate
that would then be in effect if the Ex-Dividend Date for such distribution had
not occurred.

 



39 For purposes of this Section 4.04(b) and Section 4.01(b)(iii)(x), in
determining whether any rights, options or warrants entitle the holders to
subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock at a price that is less than
the average of the Closing Sale Prices of the Common Stock for each Trading
Day in the applicable 10 consecutive Trading-Day period, there shall be taken
into account any consideration the Company receives for such rights, options
or warrants and any amount payable on exercise thereof, with the value of such
consideration, if other than cash, to be determined in good faith by the
Board of Directors or a duly authorized committee thereof.

(c) If an Ex-Dividend Date occurs for a distribution (the "Relevant
Distribution") of shares of the Companys Capital Stock, evidences of the
Companys indebtedness or other assets or property of the Companys or rights,
options or warrants to acquire the Companys Capital Stock or other
securities, to all or substantially all holders of Common Stock (excluding (i)
dividends or distributions and rights, options or warrants as to which an
adjustment was effected under clause (a) or (b) above; (ii) dividends or
distributions paid exclusively in cash; and (iii) Spin-Offs), then the
Conversion Rate will be increased based on the following formula:

 



      |  | 
---|---|--- 
    CR1 = CR0 x |  | _ SP0 _ 
   | SP0 - FMV 
 

where,



     | CR0 = | the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the
Open of Business on the Ex-Dividend Date for such distribution; 
---|---|--- 



     | CR1 = | the Conversion Rate in effect immediately after the Open
of Business on such Ex-Dividend Date for such distribution; 
---|---|--- 



     | SP0 = | the average of the Closing Sale Prices of the Common Stock
over the 10 consecutive Trading Day-period ending on, and including, the
Trading Day immediately preceding the Ex-Dividend Date for such distribution;
and  
---|---|--- 



     | FMV = | the fair market value (as determined in good faith by the
Board of Directors or a duly authorized committee thereof) of the shares of
Capital Stock, evidences of indebtedness, assets or property or rights,
options or warrants distributed with respect to each outstanding share of
Common Stock as of the Open of Business on the Ex-Dividend Date for such
distribution. 
---|---|--- 
 

Any increase made under the above portion of this clause (c) will become
effective immediately after the Open of Business on the Ex-Dividend Date for
such distribution. No adjustment pursuant to the above formula will result in
a decrease of the Conversion Rate. However, if such distribution is scheduled
to be paid or made prior to the Maturity Date and is not so paid or made, the
Conversion Rate shall be decreased to be the Conversion Rate that would then
be in effect if such distribution had not been declared.

 



40  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if "FMV" (as defined above) is equal to or
greater than "SP0" (as defined above), in lieu of the foregoing increase,
each Holder of a Note shall receive, in respect of each $100 principal amount
thereof, at the same time and upon the same terms as holders of the Common
Stock, without having to convert its Notes, the amount and kind of the
Relevant Distribution that such Holder would have received if such Holder
owned a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Conversion Rate in
effect on the Ex-Dividend Date for the distribution. In the case of rights,
options or warrants, if such rights, options or warrants are not so issued,
or if no such rights, options or warrants are exercised prior to their
expiration, the Conversion Rate shall be decreased to be the Conversion Rate
that would then be in effect if the Ex-Dividend Date for the distribution of
such rights, options or warrants had not occurred.

With respect to an adjustment pursuant to this clause (c) where there has
been an Ex-Dividend Date for a dividend or other distribution on the Common
Stock of shares of Capital Stock of any class or series, or similar equity
interest, of or relating to a subsidiary or other business unit, that are,
or, when issued, will be, listed or admitted for trading on a U.S. national
securities exchange (a "Spin-Off"), the Conversion Rate will be increased
based on the following formula:

 



      |  |  |  |  |  | 
---|---|---|---|---|---|--- 
     |  | CR1 = CR0 x |  | _ FMV0 \+ MP0 _ |  | 
   |  | MP0 |  | 
 

where,



     | CR0 = | the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the
Open of Business on the Ex-Dividend Date for such Spin-Off; 
---|---|--- 



     | CR1 = | the Conversion Rate in effect immediately after the Open
of Business on the Ex-Dividend Date for such Spin-Off; 
---|---|--- 



     | FMV0 = | the average of the Closing Sale Prices of the Capital
Stock or similar equity interest distributed to holders of the Common Stock
applicable to one share of the Common Stock over the first 10 consecutive
Trading-Day period commencing on, and including, the Ex-Dividend Date for the
Spin-Off (such period, the "Valuation Period"); and 
---|---|--- 



     | MP0 = | the average of the Closing Sale Prices of Common Stock
over the Valuation Period. 
---|---|--- 

The adjustment to the applicable conversion rate under the preceding
paragraph of this clause (c) will be determined on the last day of the
Valuation Period but will be given effect immediately after the Open of
Business on the Ex-Dividend Date for the Spin-Off. If the Ex-Dividend Date
for the Spin-Off is less than 10 Trading Days prior to, and including, the end
of the Conversion Period in respect of any conversion, references within this
clause (c) to 10 Trading Days shall be deemed to be replaced, solely in
respect of that conversion, with such lesser number of Trading Days as have
elapsed from, and including, the Ex-Dividend Date for the Spin-Off to, and
including, the last VWAP

  



41  Trading Day of such Conversion Period. In respect of any conversion during
the Valuation Period for any Spin-Off, references within this clause (c)
related to 10 Trading Days shall be deemed to be replaced, solely in respect
of that conversion, with such lesser number of Trading Days as have elapsed
from, and including, the Ex-Dividend Date for such Spin-Off to, but excluding,
the relevant Conversion Date.

 

For purposes of the second adjustment formula set forth in this Section
4.04(c), (i) the Closing Sale Price of any Capital Stock or similar equity
interest shall be calculated in a manner analogous to that used to calculate
the Closing Sale Price of the Common Stock in the definition of "Closing Sale
Price" set forth in Section 1.01, (ii) whether a day is a Trading Day (and
whether a day is a Scheduled Trading Day and whether a Market Disruption Event
has occurred) for such Capital Stock or similar equity interest shall be
determined in a manner analogous to that used to determine whether a day is
a Trading Day (or whether a day is a Scheduled Trading Day and whether a
Market Disruption Event has occurred) for the Common Stock, and (iii) whether
a day is a Trading Day to be included in a Valuation Period will be determined
based on whether a day is a Trading Day for both the Common Stock and such
Capital Stock or similar equity interest.

Subject to Section 4.04(g), for the purposes of this Section 4.04(c), rights,
options or warrants distributed to all or substantially all holders of the
Common Stock entitling them to acquire the Companys Capital Stock or other
securities, (either initially or under certain circumstances), which rights,
options or warrants, until the occurrence of a specified event or events (a
"Trigger Event"): (1) are deemed to be transferred with such shares of Common
Stock; (2) are not exercisable; and (3) are also issued in respect of future
issuances of Common Stock, shall be deemed not to have been distributed for
purposes of this Section 4.04(c) (and no adjustment to the Conversion Rate
under this Section 4.04(c) will be required) until the occurrence of the
earliest Trigger Event, whereupon such rights, options or warrants shall be
deemed to have been distributed and an appropriate adjustment (if any is
required) to the Conversion Rate shall be made under this Section 4.04(c). If
any such rights, options or warrants, distributed prior to the Issue Date are
subject to events, upon the occurrence of which such rights, options or
warrants become exercisable to purchase different securities, evidences of
indebtedness or other assets, then the date of the occurrence of any and each
such event shall be deemed to be the date of distribution and Ex-Dividend Date
of such deemed distribution (in which case the original rights, options or
warrants shall be deemed to terminate and expire on such date without exercise
by any of the holders). In addition, in the event of any distribution or
deemed distribution of rights, options or warrants, or any Trigger Event or
other event (of the type described in the preceding sentence) with respect
thereto that was counted for purposes of calculating a distribution amount for
which an adjustment to the Conversion Rate under this Section 4.04(c) was
made, (1) in the case of any such rights, options or warrants which shall all
have been redeemed or purchased without exercise by any Holders thereof, upon
such final redemption or purchase (x) the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted
as if such rights, options or warrants had not been issued and (y) the
Conversion Rate shall then again be readjusted to give effect to such
distribution, deemed distribution or Trigger Event, as the case may be, as
though it were a cash distribution, equal to the per share redemption or
purchase price received by holders of Common Stock with respect to such
rights, options or warrants (assuming each such holder had

 



42  retained such rights, options or warrants), made to all holders of Common
Stock as of the date of such redemption or purchase, and (2) in the case of
such rights, options or warrants which shall have expired or been terminated
without exercise by any holders thereof, the Conversion Rate shall be
readjusted as if such rights and warrants had not been issued.

 

For purposes of Sections 4.04(a) through (c), if any dividend or distribution
to which this Section 4.04(c) applies includes one or both of:

(A) a dividend or distribution of shares of Common Stock to which Section
4.04(a) also applies (the "Clause A Distribution"); or

(B) an issuance of rights, options or warrants entitling holders of
the Common Stock to subscribe for or purchase shares of the Common Stock to
which Section 4.04(b) also applies (the "Clause B Distribution"),

 

then (i) such dividend or distribution, other than the Clause A Distribution
and the Clause B Distribution, shall be deemed to be a distribution to which
this Section 4.04(c) applies (the "Clause C Distribution") and any Conversion
Rate adjustment required to be made under this Section 4.04(c) with respect to
such Clause C Distribution shall be made, (ii) the Clause B Distribution, if
any, shall be deemed to immediately follow the Clause C Distribution and any
Conversion Rate adjustment required by Section 4.04(b) with respect thereto
shall then be made, except that, if determined by the Company, (A) the "Ex-
Dividend Date" of the Clause B Distribution and the Clause A Distribution, if
any, shall be deemed to be the Ex-Dividend Date of the Clause C Distribution
and (B) any shares of Common Stock included in the Clause A Distribution or
the Clause B Distribution shall not be deemed to be "outstanding immediately
prior to the Open of Business on such Ex-Dividend Date" within the meaning
of Section 4.04(b), and (iii) the Clause A Distribution, if any, shall be
deemed to immediately follow the Clause C Distribution or the Clause B
Distribution, as the case may be, except that, if determined by the
Company, (A) the "Ex-Dividend Date" of the Clause A Distribution and the
Clause B Distribution, if any, shall be deemed to be the Ex-Dividend Date of
the Clause C Distribution, and (B) any shares of Common Stock included in the
Clause A Distribution shall not be deemed to be "outstanding immediately prior
to the Open of Business on such Ex-Dividend Date or such effective date"
within the meaning of Section 4.04(a).

 

(d) If an Ex-Dividend Date occurs for a cash dividend or distribution to all,
or substantially all, holders of the outstanding Common Stock (other than any
dividend or distribution in connection with the Companys liquidation,
dissolution or winding up), the Conversion Rate will be increased based on the
following formula:

 



      |  | 
---|---|--- 
    CR1 = CR0 x |  | _ SP0 _ 
   | SP0 - C 
  



43 where,



     | CR0 = | the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the
Open of Business on the Ex-Dividend Date for such dividend or distribution; 
---|---|--- 



     | CR1 = | the Conversion Rate in effect immediately after the Open
of Business on the Ex-Dividend Date for such dividend or distribution; 
---|---|--- 



     | SP0 = | the Closing Sale Price of the Common Stock on the Trading
Day immediately preceding the Ex-Dividend Date for such dividend or
distribution; and 
---|---|--- 
 



     | C = | the amount in cash per share that the Company pays or
distributes to substantially all holders of the Common Stock. 
---|---|--- 
 

Any increase made under this clause (d) shall become effective immediately
after the Open of Business on the Ex-Dividend date for such dividend or
distribution. No adjustment pursuant to the above formula will result in a
decrease of the Conversion Rate. However, if any dividend or distribution
described in this clause (d) is scheduled to be paid or made prior to the
Maturity Date but is not so paid or made, the new Conversion Rate shall be
readjusted to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such
dividend or distribution had not been declared.

 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if "C" (as defined above) is equal to or
greater than "SP0" (as defined above), in lieu of the foregoing increase, each
Holder of a Note shall receive, for each $100 principal amount of Notes, at
the same time and upon the same terms as holders of shares of the Common
Stock, without having to convert its Notes, the amount of cash that such
Holder would have received if such Holder owned a number of shares of Common
Stock equal to the applicable Conversion Rate on the Ex-Dividend Date for
such cash dividend or distribution.

(e) If the Company or any of its Subsidiaries makes a payment in respect of
a tender or exchange offer for the Common Stock, and if the cash and value of
any other consideration included in the payment per share of Common Stock
exceeds the average of the Closing Sale Prices of the Common Stock over the 10
consecutive Trading-Day period commencing on, and including, the Trading Day
next succeeding the last date on which tenders or exchanges may be made
pursuant to such tender or exchange offer (the "Offer Expiration Date"), the
Conversion Rate will be increased based on the following formula:



      |  | 
---|---|--- 
    CR1 = CR0 x |  | _ AC + (SP1 x OS1) _ 
   |  | OS0 x SP1 
 

where,



     | CR0 = | the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the
Open of Business on the Trading Day next succeeding the Offer Expiration Date; 
---|---|--- 
 



44 Open of Business on the Trading Day next succeeding the Offer Expiration Date; 
---|---|--- 



     | AC = | the aggregate value of all cash and any other consideration
(as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or a duly authorized
committee thereof) paid or payable for shares of Common Stock purchased in
such tender or exchange offer; 
---|---|--- 



     | OS0 = | the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the time (the "Offer Expiration Time") such tender or
exchange offer expires (prior to giving effect to such tender or
exchange offer); 
---|---|--- 



     | OS1 = | the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding
immediately after the Offer Expiration Time (after giving effect to the
purchase of all shares accepted for purchase or exchange in such tender or
exchange offer); and  
---|---|--- 



     | SP1 = | the average of the Closing Sale Prices of the Common Stock
over the 10 consecutive Trading-Day period commencing on, and including, the
Trading Day next succeeding the Offer Expiration Date. 
---|---|--- 
 

The adjustment to the Conversion Rate under the preceding paragraph of this
clause (e) will be determined at the Close of Business on the tenth Trading
Day immediately following, but excluding, the Offer Expiration Date but will
be given effect at the Open of Business on the Trading Day next succeeding the
Offer Expiration Date. If the Trading Day next succeeding the Offer
Expiration Date is less than 10 Trading Days prior to, and including, the end
of the Conversion Period in respect of any conversion, references within this
clause (e) to 10 Trading Days shall be deemed to be replaced, solely in
respect of that conversion, with such lesser number of Trading Days as have
elapsed from, and including, the Trading Day next succeeding the Offer
Expiration Date to, and including, the last VWAP Trading Day of such
conversion period. In respect of any conversion during the 10 Trading Days
commencing on, and including, the Trading Day next succeeding the Offer
Expiration Date, references within this clause (e) to 10 Trading Days shall be
deemed to be replaced, solely in respect of that conversion, with such
lesser number of Trading Days as have elapsed from, and including, the
Trading Day next succeeding the Offer Expiration Date to, but excluding, the
relevant Conversion Date. No adjustment pursuant to the above formula will
result in a decrease of the Conversion Rate.

(f) _Special Settlement Provisions_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, if a Holder converts a Note in a Combination Settlement, and the
Daily Settlement Amount for any VWAP Trading Day during the Conversion Period
applicable to such Note:

 

(i) is calculated based on a Conversion Rate adjusted on account of any event
described in Sections 4.04(a) through (e); and 

(ii) includes any shares of Common Stock that, but for this provision, would
entitle their holder to participate in such event;

 



45 then, although the Company will otherwise treat such Holder as the holder of
record of such shares of Common Stock on the last VWAP Trading Day of such
Conversion Period, the Company will not permit such Holder to participate in
such event on account of such shares of Common Stock.

 

In addition, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if a Holder
converts a Note and:

 

(i) Combination Settlement is applicable to such Note and shares of Common
Stock are deliverable to settle the Daily Net Share Settlement Number for a
given Trading Day within the Conversion Period applicable to such Note;

(ii) any distribution, transaction or event described in Sections 4.04(a)-(e)
has not yet resulted in an adjustment to the applicable Conversion Rate on
such Trading Day; and

 

(iii) the shares of Common Stock deliverable in respect of such Trading Day
are not entitled to participate in the relevant distribution or transaction
(because such shares of Common Stock were not held on a related Record Date or
otherwise),

then the Company will adjust the number of shares of Common Stock delivered
in respect of the relevant Trading Day to reflect the relevant distribution or
transaction.

 

If a Holder converts a Note and:

 

(i) Physical Settlement is applicable to such Note;

 

(ii) any distribution or transaction described in Sections 4.04(a)-(e) has not
yet resulted in an adjustment to the applicable Conversion Rate on a given
Conversion Date; and

(iii) the shares of Common Stock deliverable on settlement of the related
conversion are not entitled to participate in the relevant distribution or
transaction (because such shares of Common Stock were not held on a related
Record Date or otherwise),

 

then the Company will adjust the number of shares of Common Stock delivered in
respect of the relevant Trading Day to reflect the relevant distribution or
transaction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Conversion Rate adjustment
becomes effective on any Ex-Dividend Date as described above, and a Holder
that has converted its Notes on or after such Ex-Dividend Date and on or prior
to the related Record Date would be treated as the record holder of shares of
Common Stock as of the related Conversion Date pursuant to Section 4.03 based
on an adjusted Conversion Rate for such Ex-Dividend Date, then,
notwithstanding the foregoing Conversion Rate adjustment provisions, the
Conversion Rate adjustment relating to such Ex-Dividend Date will not be made
for such converting Holder. Instead, such Holder will be treated as if such
Holder were the record owner of the shares of Common Stock on an unadjusted
basis and participate in the related dividend, distribution or other event
giving rise to such adjustment.

 



46 (g) _Poison Pill_. If a Holder converts a Note, to the extent that
the Company has a rights plan in effect, if Physical Settlement applies to
such Note, on the Conversion Date applicable to such Note, and if Combination
Settlement applies to such Note on any VWAP Trading Day in the Conversion
Period applicable to such Note, the Holder converting such Note will receive,
in addition to any shares of Common Stock otherwise received in connection
with such conversion on such Conversion Date or such VWAP Trading Day, as the
case may be, the rights under the rights plan, unless prior to such
Conversion Date or such VWAP Trading Day, as the case may be, the rights have
separated from the Common Stock, in which case, and only in such case, the
Conversion Rate will be adjusted at the time of separation as if the Company
distributed to all holders of the Common Stock, Distributed Property as
described in Section 4.04(c), subject to readjustment in the event of the
expiration, termination or redemption of such rights.

 

(h) _Deferral of Adjustments_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, the Company will not be required to adjust the Conversion Rate unless
such adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least one percent;
_provided, however_ , that any such minor adjustments that are not required to
be made will be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent
adjustment, and _provided, further_ , that any such adjustment of less than
one percent that has not been made shall be made upon the occurrence of (i)
the Effective Date for any Fundamental Change or Make-Whole
Fundamental Change (ii) in the case of any Note to which Physical Settlement
applies, the Conversion Date, and, in the case of any Note to which Cash
Settlement or Combination Settlement applies, each VWAP Trading Day of the
applicable Conversion Period and (iii) every one year anniversary of the date
hereof. In addition, the Company shall not account for such deferrals when
determining whether any of the conditions to conversion have been satisfied or
what number of shares of Common Stock a Holder would have held on a given day
had it converted its Notes.

(i) _Limitation on Adjustments_. Except as stated in this Section 4.04, the
Company will not adjust the Conversion Rate for the issuance of shares of
Common Stock or any securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of
Common Stock or the right to purchase shares of Common Stock or such
convertible or exchangeable securities. If, however, the application of the
formulas in Sections 4.04(a) through (e) would result in a decrease in the
Conversion Rate, then, except to the extent of any readjustment to the
Conversion Rate, no adjustment to the Conversion Rate will be made (other
than as a result of a reverse share split or share combination).

In addition, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Conversion
Rate will not be adjusted:

(i) upon the issuance of any shares of Common Stock pursuant to any present
or future plan providing for the reinvestment of dividends or interest payable
on the Companys securities and the investment of additional optional amounts
in shares of Common Stock under any present or future employee, director or
consultant benefit plan or program of or assumed by the Company or any of the
Companys subsidiaries;

 



47 (ii) upon the issuance of any shares of Common Stock or options or rights
to purchase those shares pursuant to any present or future employee, director
or consultant benefit plan, program or agreement or employee stock purchase
plan of or assumed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries;

 

(iii) upon the issuance of any shares of Common Stock pursuant to any option,
warrant, right or exercisable, exchangeable or convertible security not
described in Section 4.04(i)(ii) immediately above and outstanding as of the
date the Notes were first issued;

 

(iv) for a change in the par value of the Common Stock; or

 

(v) for accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes, if any.

 

For purposes of this Section 4.04, the number of shares of Common Stock at any
time outstanding shall not include shares held in the treasury of the Company
so long as the Company does not pay any dividend or make any distribution on
shares of Common Stock held in the treasury of the Company, but shall include
shares issuable in respect of scrip certificates issued in lieu of fractions
of shares of Common Stock.

Section 4.05 _Discretionary and Voluntary Adjustments._

 

(a) _Discretionary Adjustments_. Whenever any provision of this Indenture
requires the Company to calculate the Closing Sale Prices, the Daily VWAPs or
any function thereof over a span of multiple days (including during an
Conversion Period), the Company will make appropriate adjustments to each, if
any, to account for any adjustment to the Conversion Rate that becomes
effective, or any event requiring an adjustment to the Conversion Rate where
the effective date, Ex-Dividend Date or Offer Expiration Date of the event
occurs, at any time during the period when such Closing Sale Prices, the Daily
VWAPs or function thereof is to be calculated.

(b) _Voluntary Adjustments_. To the extent permitted by applicable law
and applicable requirements of the Exchange, the Company is permitted to
increase the Conversion Rate of the Notes by any amount for a period of at
least 20 Business Days if such increase is irrevocable for such period and the
Board of Directors determines that such increase would be in the Companys
best interest; provided that the Company must give at least 15 days prior
notice of any such increase in the Conversion Rate. To the extent permitted by
applicable law and applicable requirements of the Exchange, the Company may
also (but is not required to) increase the Conversion Rate to avoid or
diminish income tax to holders of Common Stock or rights to purchase shares of
Common Stock in connection with a dividend or distribution of shares (or
rights to acquire shares) or similar event.

 



48 Section 4.06 _Adjustment to Conversion Rate Upon Conversion in Connection with
a Make-Whole Fundamental Change_.6

(a) _Increase in the Conversion Rate_. If a Make-Whole Fundamental Change
occurs and a Holder elects to convert its Notes in connection with such Make-
Whole Fundamental Change, then the Company shall, to the extent provided
herein, increase the Conversion Rate for the Notes so surrendered for
conversion by a number of additional shares of Common Stock (the "Additional
Shares"), as described in this Section 4.06. A conversion of Notes shall be
deemed for these purposes to be "in connection with" a Make-Whole Fundamental
Change if the relevant Conversion Notice is received by the Conversion Agent
during the period from, and including, the Effective Date of the Make-Whole
Fundamental Change up to, and including, the Close of Business on the
Business Day immediately prior to the related Fundamental Change Purchase Date
or, if such Make-Whole Fundamental Change is not also a Fundamental Change,
the 35th Business Day immediately following the Effective Date for such Make-
Whole Fundamental Change (such period, the "Make-Whole Fundamental Change
Period").

(b) _Cash Mergers_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if the
consideration paid to holders of the Common Stock in any Make-Whole
Fundamental Change described in clause (2) of the definition of "Fundamental
Change" is comprised entirely of cash, then, for any conversion of Notes
following the Effective Date of such Make-Whole Fundamental Change, the
payment and delivery obligations upon the conversion of a Note shall be
calculated based solely on the Stock Price for such Make-Whole Fundamental
Change and shall be deemed to be an amount equal to the applicable Conversion
Rate (including any adjustment as described in this Section 4.06) multiplied
by such Stock Price. In such event, the Companys conversion obligation will
be determined and paid to Holders in cash on the third Business Day following
the applicable Conversion Date. Otherwise, the Company will settle any
conversion of the Notes following the Effective Date for a Make-Whole
Fundamental Change in accordance with Section 4.03 (but subject to Section
4.04).

(c) _Determining the Number of Additional Shares_. The number of Additional
Shares, if any, by which the Conversion Rate will be increased for a Holder
that converts its Notes in connection with a Make-Whole Fundamental Change
shall be determined by reference to the table attached as _Schedule A_,
based on the date on which the Make-Whole Fundamental Change occurs or becomes
effective (the "Effective Date"), and the price (the "Stock Price") paid (or
deemed paid) per share of the Common Stock in the Make-Whole Fundamental
Change, as determined under the two immediately following sentences. If the
holders of the Common Stock receive only cash in a Make-Whole Fundamental
Change described in clause (2) of the definition of "Fundamental Change," the
Stock Price shall be the cash amount paid per share of Common Stock.
Otherwise, the Stock Price shall be the average of the Closing Sale Prices of
the Common Stock over the 10 consecutive Trading-Day period ending on, and
including, the Trading Day immediately preceding the Effective Date of the
Make-Whole Fundamental Change.

The brackets will be filled in once the conversion price is determined based
on the methodology of the Companys May 2015 Convertible Notes Indentures. 

---|--- 
 



49 (d) _Interpolation and Limits_. The exact Stock Prices and Effective
Dates may not be set forth in the table in _Schedule A_, in which case:

(i) If the Stock Price is between two Stock Prices in the table or the
Effective Date is between two dates in the table, the number of Additional
Shares shall be determined by a straight-line interpolation between the number
of Additional Shares set forth for the higher and lower Stock Prices and the
earlier and later dates, as applicable, based on a 365- or 366-day year, as
applicable.

(ii) If the Stock Price is greater than $[] per share (subject to adjustment
in the same manner as the Stock Prices set forth in the column headings of the
table in _Schedule A_), no Additional Shares will be added to the Conversion
Rate.

 

(iii) If the Stock Price is less than $[] per share (subject to adjustments
in the same manner as the Stock Prices set forth in the column headings of
the table in _Schedule A_), no Additional Shares will be added to the
Conversion Rate.

 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event will the Conversion Rate be
increased on account of a Make-Whole Fundamental Change to exceed [] shares
of Common Stock per $100 principal amount of Notes, subject to adjustments in
the same manner as the Conversion Rate is required to be adjusted as set forth
in Section 4.04.

 

(iv) The Stock Prices set forth in the column headings of the table in
_Schedule A_ shall be adjusted as of any date on which the Conversion Rate
of the Notes is otherwise required to be adjusted. The adjusted Stock Prices
shall equal the Stock Prices applicable immediately prior to such adjustment,
multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Conversion Rate
immediately prior to such adjustment giving rise to the Stock Price adjustment
and the denominator of which is the Conversion Rate as so adjusted. The number
of Additional Shares set forth in such table shall be adjusted in the
same manner and at the same time as the Conversion Rate is required to be
adjusted as set forth in Section 4.04.

(e)  _Notices_. The Company will notify Holders, the Trustee and the
Conversion Agent of the anticipated Effective Date of any Make-Whole
Fundamental Change and issue a press release as soon as practicable after the
Company first determines the anticipated Effective Date of such Make-Whole
Fundamental Change (and make the press release available on the Companys
website). The Company will use its commercially reasonable efforts to give
notice to Holders of the anticipated Effective Date of such Make-Whole
Fundamental Change not more than 70 Scheduled Trading Days nor less than 35
Scheduled Trading Days prior to the anticipated Effective Date or, if the
Company does not have knowledge of such Make-Whole Fundamental Change or the
Company determines, in its commercially reasonable discretion, that it is
impractical

 



50  or inadvisable to disclose the anticipated Effective Date of such Make-Whole
Fundamental Change at least 35 Scheduled Trading Days prior to the anticipated
Effective Date, within one business day of the date upon which the Company
receives notice, or otherwise becomes aware, of such Make-Whole Fundamental
Change or receives notice, or otherwise becomes aware of, such Make-Whole
Fundamental Change, unless the Company determines, in its commercially
reasonable discretion, that it is no longer impractical or inadvisable to
disclose the anticipated Effective Date of such Make-Whole-Fundamental Change
(but in no event later than the actual Effective Date of such Make-Whole
Fundamental Change). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event will the
Company be required to provide such notice to Holders before the earlier of
(i) the actual Effective Date of such Make-Whole Fundamental Change and (ii)
the earlier of such time as the Company or its Affiliates (a) have publicly
disclosed or acknowledged the circumstances giving rise to such anticipated
Make-Whole Fundamental Change or (b) are required to publicly disclose under
applicable law or the rules of any stock exchange on which the Companys
equity is then listed the circumstances giving rise to such Make-Whole
Fundamental Change.

 

Section 4.07 _Effect of Recapitalization, Reclassification, Consolidation,
Merger or Sale_.

 

(a) _Merger Events_. In the case of:

 

(i) any recapitalization, reclassification or change of the Common Stock
(other than a change in par value, or from par value to no par value, or from
no par value to par value, or as a result of a split, subdivision or
combination for which an adjustment was made pursuant to Section 4.04(a));

 

(ii) any consolidation, merger or combination involving the Company;

 

(iii) any sale, lease or other transfer to a third party of the consolidated
assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries substantially as an entirety;

(iv) any binding share exchange; or

 

(v) a liquidation or dissolution of the Company;

 

and, in each case, as a result of which the Common Stock would be converted
into, or exchanged for, common stock, other securities, other property or
assets (including cash or any combination thereof) (any such event, a "Merger
Event," any such common stock, other securities, other property or assets
(including cash or any combination thereof), "Reference Property," and (i)
the amount and kind of Reference Property that a holder of one share of Common
Stock is entitled to receive in the applicable Merger Event, or (ii) if as a
result of the applicable Merger Event, each share of Common Stock is
converted into, or exchanged for, the right to receive more than a single
type of consideration (determined based in part upon any form of stockholder
election), the per share of Common Stock weighted average of the amounts and
kinds of Reference Property received by the holders of Common Stock that
affirmatively make such an election (disregarding, for these purposes, any
arrangement to deliver cash in lieu of any fractional security or other unit
of Reference Property), a "Unit of Reference Property") then,

 



51  the Company or such successor or purchasing person shall enter into a
supplemental indenture to provide that, at the effective time of such Merger
Event, the consideration due upon conversion of any Notes will be determined
in the same manner as if each reference to any number of shares of Common
Stock in this Article 4 were instead a reference to the same number of Units
of Reference Property (it being understood that no adjustment will be made
pursuant to Sections 4.04(a)-(e) with respect to any portion of Reference
Property that does not consist of Capital Stock), and, prior to or at the
effective time of such Merger Event, the Company or the successor or
purchasing person, as the case may be, shall execute with the Trustee a
supplemental indenture (which shall comply with the Trust Indenture Act as in
force at the date of execution of such supplemental indenture) providing for
such change; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that at and after the effective time
of the Merger Event, (x) the Company will continue to have the right to
determine the Settlement Method upon conversion of the Notes pursuant to
Section 4.03(a)(i) and (y) (i) any amount payable in cash upon conversion of
the Notes in accordance with Section 4.03 and 4.06 shall continue to be
payable in cash, (ii) the number of shares of Common Stock that the Company
would have been required to deliver upon conversion of the Notes in
accordance with Section 4.03 and 4.06 shall instead be deliverable in Units of
Reference Property and (iii) the Daily VWAP and the Closing Sale Price will,
to the extent reasonably possible, be calculated based on the value of a Unit
of Reference Property and the definitions of VWAP Trading Day and VWAP Market
Disruption Event shall be determined by reference to the components of a Unit
of Reference Property.

 

The Company shall not become a party to any Merger Event unless its terms are
consistent with this Section 4.07. Such supplemental indenture described in
the immediately preceding paragraph shall provide for adjustments which shall
be as nearly equivalent to the adjustments provided for in this Article 4 in
the judgment of the Board of Directors or the board of directors of
the successor person. If, in the case of any such Merger Event, the Reference
Property receivable thereupon by a holder of Common Stock includes shares of
stock, securities or other property or assets (including cash or any
combination thereof) of a person other than the successor or purchasing
person, as the case may be, in such Merger Event, then such indenture shall
also be executed by such other person.

 

(b) _Notice of Supplemental Indentures_. The Company shall cause written
notice of the execution of such supplemental indenture to be mailed to each
Holder, at the address of such Holder as it appears on the register of the
Notes maintained by the Registrar, within 20 calendar days after execution
thereof. Failure to deliver such notice shall not affect the legality or
validity of such supplemental indenture. The above provisions of this Section
4.07 shall similarly apply to successive Merger Events. Additionally, if the
Company executes a supplemental indenture pursuant to this Section 4.07, it
shall promptly file with the Trustee an Officers Certificate (in addition to
the documents that the Trustee is entitled to receive under Article 8) briefly
stating the reasons therefor, the kind or amount of cash, securities or
property or asset that will comprise a Unit of Reference Property, any
adjustment to be made with respect thereto and that all conditions precedent
have been complied with.

 

(c) _Prior Notice_. In addition, at least 20 Scheduled Trading Days before any
Merger Event, the Company shall give notice to Holders of such Merger Event,
or, if the Company has not publicly announced such Merger Event at such time,
as promptly as

 



52  practicable after publicly announcing such Merger Event. In any such notice,
the Company shall also specify the composition of the Unit of Reference
Property for such Merger Event, or, if the Company has not determined the
composition of such Unit of Reference Property at such time, the Company will
provide an additional written notice to Holders that states the composition of
such Unit of Reference Property as promptly as practicable after determining
its composition.

Section 4.08 _Certain Covenants_.

 

(a) _Reservation of Shares_. To the extent necessary to satisfy its
obligations under this Indenture, prior to issuing any shares of Common
Stock, the Company will reserve out of its authorized but unissued shares of
Common Stock a sufficient number of shares of Common Stock to permit the
conversion of the Notes.

 

(b) _Certain other Covenants_. The Company covenants that all shares of Common
Stock that may be issued upon conversion of Notes shall be newly issued
shares or treasury shares, shall be duly authorized, validly issued, fully
paid and non-assessable and shall be free from preemptive rights and free from
any tax, lien or charge (other than those created by the Holder or due to a
change in registered owner). The Company shall list or cause to have quoted
any shares of Common Stock to be issued upon conversion of Notes on each
national securities exchange or over-the-counter or other domestic market on
which the Common Stock is then listed or quoted.

(c) _[RESERVED]._

 

Section 4.09 _Responsibility of Trustee_.

 

The Trustee and any Conversion Agent shall not at any time be under any duty
or responsibility to any Holder of Notes to determine or calculate the
Conversion Rate, to determine whether any facts exist which may require any
adjustment of the Conversion Rate, or to confirm the accuracy of any such
adjustment when made or the appropriateness of the method employed, or herein
or in any supplemental indenture provided to be employed, in making the same
or to determine or verify whether any facts exist which make the Notes
eligible for conversion or have caused the Notes to no longer be eligible for
conversion. The Trustee and any other Conversion Agent shall not be
accountable with respect to the validity or value (or the kind or amount) of
any shares of Common Stock or of any other securities or property that may at
any time be issued or delivered upon the conversion of any Notes; and the
Trustee and the Conversion Agent make no representations with respect thereto.
Neither the Trustee nor any Conversion Agent shall be responsible for any
failure of the Company or a designated institution to issue, transfer or
deliver any shares of Common Stock or stock certificates or other securities
or property or cash upon the surrender of any Notes for the purpose of
conversion or to comply with any of the duties, responsibilities or covenants
of the Company contained in this Article 4. The rights, privileges,
protections, immunities and benefits given to the Trustee, including without
limitation its right to be compensated, reimbursed and indemnified, are
extended to, and shall be enforceable by, the Trustee in each of its
capacities hereunder, including its capacity as Conversion Agent.

 



53 Section 4.10 _Notice of Adjustment to the Trustee_. Whenever the Conversion
Rate is adjusted as herein provided, the Company shall promptly file with the
Trustee and any Conversion Agent (if other than the Trustee) an Officers
Certificate (upon which the Trustee and Conversion Agent may conclusively
rely) setting forth the Conversion Rate after such adjustment and setting
forth a brief statement of the facts requiring such adjustment. Unless and
until a Responsible Officer of the Trustee shall have received such Officers
Certificate, the Trustee shall not be deemed to have knowledge of any
adjustment of the Conversion Rate and may assume that the last Conversion Rate
of which it has knowledge is still in effect. Promptly after delivery of such
certificate, the Company shall prepare a notice of such adjustment of the
Conversion Rate setting forth the adjusted Conversion Rate and the date as of
which each adjustment becomes effective and shall deliver such notice of such
adjustment of the Conversion Rate to the Holder of each Note at his or
her last address appearing on the Register provided for in Section 2.06 of
this Indenture, within 20 days after execution thereof. Failure to deliver
such notice shall not affect the legality, effectiveness or validity of any
such adjustment and shall not be an Event of Default under this Indenture.

Section 4.11 _Notice to Holders_.

 

(a) _Notice to Holders Prior to Certain Actions_. The Company shall deliver
notices of the events specified below at the times specified below and
containing the information specified below unless, in each case, (i) pursuant
to this Indenture, the Company is already required to deliver notice of such
event containing at least the information specified below at an earlier time
or, (ii) the Company, at the time it is required to deliver a notice, does not
have knowledge of all of the information required to be included in such
notice, in which case, the Company shall (A) deliver notice at such
time containing only the information that it has knowledge of at such time
(if it has knowledge of any such information at such time), and (B) promptly
upon obtaining knowledge of any such information not already included in a
notice delivered by the Company, deliver notice to each Holder with a copy to
the Trustee containing such information. In each case, the failure by the
Company to give such notice, or any defect therein, shall not affect the
legality or validity of such event.

 

(i) _Voluntary Increases_. If the Company increases the Conversion Rate
pursuant to Section 4.05(b), the Company shall mail to the Holders a notice
of the increased Conversion Rate and the period during which such increased
Conversion Rate will be in effect at least 15 calendar days prior to the date
the increased Conversion Rate takes effect, in accordance with the applicable
law.

(ii) _Dissolutions, Liquidations and Winding-Ups_. If there is a voluntary or
involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding-up of the Company, the
Company shall deliver notice to the Holders as promptly as possible, but in
any event at least 15 calendar days prior to the earlier of (i) the date on
which such dissolution, liquidation or winding-up, as the case may be, is
expected to become effective or occur, and (ii) the date as of which it is
expected that holders of Common Stock of record shall be entitled to exchange
their Common Stock for securities or other property deliverable upon such
dissolution,

 



54  liquidation or winding-up, as the case may be, which notice shall state the
expected effective date and record date for such event, as applicable, and the
amount and kind of property that a holder of one share of the Common Stock is
expected to be entitled, or may elect, to receive in such event. The Company
shall deliver an additional notice to holders, as promptly as practicable,
whenever the expected effective date or record date, as applicable, or the
amount and kind of property that a holder of one share of the Common Stock is
expect to be entitled to receive in such event, changes.

 

(b) _Notices After Certain Actions and Events_. Whenever an adjustment to the
Conversion Rate becomes effective pursuant to Sections 4.04, 4.05 or 4.06,
the Company will (i) file with the Trustee an Officers Certificate stating
that such adjustment has become effective, the Conversion Rate, and the manner
in which the adjustment was computed and (ii) deliver written notice to the
Holders stating that such adjustment has become effective and the Conversion
Rate or conversion privilege as adjusted. Failure to give any such notice, or
any defect therein, shall not affect the validity of any such adjustment.

Section 5.02 _Maintenance of Office or Agency_.

 

The Company will maintain in the continental United States an office of the

Company will give prompt written notice to the Trustee of the location, and
any change in the location, of such office or agency. If at any time the
Company shall fail to maintain any such required office or agency or shall
fail to furnish the Trustee with the address thereof, such presentations,

Office or the office or agency of the Trustee.

 

The Company may also from time to time designate as co-registrars one or more
other offices or agencies where the Notes may be presented or surrendered for
any or all such purposes and may from time to time rescind such designations;
provided that no such designation or rescission shall in any manner relieve
the Company of its obligation to maintain an office or agency in
the continental United States for such purposes. The Company will give prompt
written notice to the Trustee of any such designation or rescission and of any
change in the location of any such other office or agency. The terms "Paying
Agent" and "Conversion Agent" include any such additional or other offices or
agencies, as applicable.

 



55 The Company hereby initially designates the Trustee as the Paying Agent,
Registrar, Conversion Agent, and its Corporate Trust Office shall be
considered as one such office or agency of the Company for each of the
aforesaid purposes. The Company or its Affiliates may act as Paying Agent or
Registrar.

 

 __With respect to any Global Note, the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee
or any Paying Agent shall be the place of payment where such Global Note may
be presented or surrendered for payment or conversion or for registration of
transfer or exchange, or where successor Notes may be delivered in exchange
therefor; _provided_ , _however_ , that any such payment, conversion, 
__presentation, surrender or delivery effected pursuant to the Applicable
Procedures for such Global Note shall be deemed to have been effected at the
place of payment for such Global Note in accordance with the provisions of
this Indenture. _ _

Section 5.03 _Provisions as to Paying Agent._

 

(a) If the Company shall appoint a Paying Agent other than the Trustee, the
Company will cause such Paying Agent to execute and deliver to the Trustee an
instrument in which such agent shall agree, subject to the provisions of this
Section 5.03:

 

(i) that it will hold all sums held by it as such agent for the payment of the
principal of, any premium on, accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on and
Fundamental Change Purchase Price for the Notes in trust for the benefit of
the Holders of the Notes;

 

(ii) that it will give the Trustee prompt written notice of any failure by the

unpaid interest, if any, on or Fundamental Change Purchase Price for the Notes
when the same shall be due and payable; and

 

(iii) that at any time during the continuance of an Event of Default, upon
request of the Trustee, it will forthwith pay to the Trustee all sums so held
in trust.

The Company shall, on or before each due date of the principal of, any premium
on, accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on and Fundamental Change Purchase
Price for the Notes, deposit with the Paying Agent a sum sufficient to pay
such principal, premium, accrued and unpaid interest or Fundamental Change
Purchase Price, as the case may be, and (unless such Paying Agent is the
Trustee) the Company will promptly notify the Trustee in writing of any
failure to take such action, provided that, if such deposit is made on the due
date, such deposit must be received by the Paying Agent by 11:00 a.m., New
York City time, on such date.

(b) If the Company shall act as its own Paying Agent, it will, on or before
each due date of the principal of, any premium on, accrued and unpaid
interest, if any, on or Fundamental Change Purchase Price for the Notes, set
aside, segregate and hold in trust for the benefit of the Holders of the Notes
a sum sufficient to pay such principal, any

 



56  premium, accrued and unpaid interest, if any, or Fundamental Change Purchase
Price, as the case may be, so becoming due and will promptly notify the
Trustee in writing of any failure to take such action and of any failure by
the Company to make any payment of the principal of, premium on, accrued and
unpaid interest on or Fundamental Change Purchase Price for the Notes when the
same shall become due and payable.

 

(c) Anything in this Section 5.03 to the contrary notwithstanding, the Company
may, at any time, for the purpose of obtaining a satisfaction and discharge
of this Indenture, or for any other reason, pay or cause to be paid to the
Trustee all sums held in trust by any Paying Agent hereunder as required by
this Section 5.03, such sums to be held by the Trustee upon the trusts herein
contained and upon such payment by the any Paying Agent to the Trustee, such
Paying Agent (if other than the Company) shall be released from all further
liability with respect to such sums.

 

(d) Subject to any applicable abandoned property law, any money deposited with
the Trustee or any Paying Agent, or then held by the Company, in trust for
the payment of the principal of, any premium on, accrued and unpaid interest,
if any, on or Fundamental Change Purchase Price for any Note and remaining
unclaimed for two years after such principal, premium, accrued and unpaid
interest or Fundamental Change Purchase Price has become due and payable shall
be paid to the Company on written request of the Company contained in an
Officers Certificate, or (if then held by the Company) shall be discharged
from such trust; and the Holder of such Note shall thereafter, as an
unsecured general creditor, look only to the Company for payment thereof, and
all liability of the Trustee or such Paying Agent with respect to such trust
money, and all liability of the Company as trustee thereof, shall thereupon
cease; _provided_ , _however_ , that before the Trustee or such Paying Agent
are required to make any such repayment, the Company shall cause to be
published once, in a newspaper published in the English language, customarily
published on each Business Day and of general circulation in The Borough of
Manhattan, The City of New York, New York, notice that such money remains
unclaimed and that, after a date specified therein, which shall not be less
than 30 calendar days from the date of such publication, any unclaimed balance
of such money then remaining will be repaid to the Company.

 

Section 5.04 _Reports_.

 

The Company will furnish to the Trustee, within 15 calendar days after it is
required to file the same with the Commission pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d)
of the Exchange Act. Any such report, information or document that the Company
files with the Commission through the EDGAR system (or any successor thereto)
will be deemed to be delivered to the Trustee for the purposes of this
Section 5.04 at the time of such filing through the EDGAR system (or such
successor thereto). The Company shall comply with Section 314(a) of the Trust
Indenture Act.

 

Delivery of any such reports, information and documents to the Trustee shall
be for informational purposes only, and the Trustees receipt of such
reports, information and documents shall not constitute actual or constructive
notice of any information contained therein or determinable from information
contained therein, including the Companys compliance with any of
its covenants hereunder (as to which the Trustee is entitled to rely
exclusively on Officers Certificates) or any other agreement or document.

December 31, an Officers Certificate stating whether or not the signers
thereof know of any default of the Company that occurred during the previous
year and whether the Company, to the Officers knowledge, is in default in
the performance or observance of any of the terms, provisions and conditions
of this Indenture and (ii) within 30 days after the occurrence thereof,
written notice in the form of an Officers Certificate of any events that
would constitute Defaults or Events of Default, setting forth the details of
such Defaults or Events of Default, their status and the action the Company is
taking or proposes to take in respect thereof. Such Officers Certificate
shall also comply with any additional requirements set forth in Section 5.07.

Default except in accordance with Section 11.03(i).

Trustee and the Paying Agent an Officers Certificate, prior to the Regular
Record Date for each applicable Interest Payment Date, to that effect stating
(a) the amount of such Additional Interest that is payable and (b) the date
on which such interest is payable. Unless and until a Responsible Officer of
the Trustee receives at the Corporate Trust Office such a certificate, the
Trustee may assume without inquiry that no such Additional Interest is
payable. The Trustee shall have no obligation to calculate or determine, or
verify the Companys calculations or determinations of, the amount of any
Additional Interest payable by the Company under this Indenture. If
the Company has paid Additional Interest directly to the Persons entitled to
it, the Company shall deliver to the Trustee an Officers Certificate setting
forth the particulars of such payment.

for in this Indenture relating to the proposed action have been complied with
and an Opinion of Counsel stating that in the opinion of such counsel all such
conditions precedent, if any, have been complied with, except that in the case
of any such application or request as to which the furnishing of
such documents is specifically required by any provision of this Indenture

or opinion need be furnished; provided that no Opinion of Counsel shall be
required to be delivered in connection with the issuance of the Initial Notes
on the date hereof.

condition or covenant has been complied with.

individual giving the same and may include an express statement to such
effect.

or cause to be done all things necessary to preserve and keep in full force
and effect its corporate existence, rights (charter and statutory) and

the Company.

acts as may be reasonably necessary or proper to carry out more effectively
the purposes of this Indenture.

Company will furnish or cause to be furnished to the Trustee:

(a) semi-annually, not later than the 10th day after each Regular Record Date,

official in an involuntary case or other proceeding commenced against it, (iv)
makes a general assignment for the benefit of creditors, or (v) fails
generally to pay its debts as they become due; or

or any Significant Subsidiary of the Company (i) seeking liquidation,
reorganization or other relief with respect to the Company or such Significant
Subsidiary of the Company or its debts under any bankruptcy, insolvency or
other similar law now or hereafter in effect or (ii) seeking the appointment
of a trustee, receiver, liquidator, custodian or other similar official of the
Company or such Significant Subsidiary of the Company or any substantial part
of its property, and such involuntary case or other proceeding remains
undismissed and unstayed for a period of 60 consecutive days.

 

Section 6.02 _Acceleration; Rescission and Annulment_.

 

(a) If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default specified in
Section 6.01(i) or Section 6.01(j) with respect to the Company) occurs and is
continuing, either the Trustee by written notice to the Company, or the
Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then
Outstanding by written notice to the Company and the Trustee, may declare
100% of the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest, if
any, on all the Notes then Outstanding to be due and payable immediately. If
an Event of Default specified in Section 6.01(i) or Section 6.01(j)
with respect to the Company occurs, 100% of the principal of, premium, if
any, and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on all Notes shall automatically
become immediately due and payable.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 6.02(a), Section 6.04
or any other provision of this Indenture, if, at any time after the principal
of, and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on, the Notes shall have been so
declared due and payable in accordance with Section 6.02(a), and before any
judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction for the payment of
the monies due shall have been obtained, and each of the conditions set forth
in the immediately following clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) is satisfied:

 

(i) the Company delivers or deposits with the Trustee the amount of cash
sufficient to pay all matured installments of principal and interest upon all
the Notes, and the principal of and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on
all Notes which shall have become due otherwise than by acceleration (with
interest on such principal and, to the extent that payment of such interest
is

 



61  enforceable under applicable law, on overdue installments of interest, at
the rate or rates, if any, specified in the Notes to the date of such payment
or deposit), and such amount as shall be sufficient to pay the Trustee its
reasonable compensation and reimburse the Trustee for its reasonable expenses,
disbursements and advances (including the fees and expenses of its agents and
counsel);

 

(ii) rescission and annulment would not conflict with any judgment or decree
of a court of competent jurisdiction; and

 

(iii) any and all Events of Default under this Indenture, other than the non-
payment of the principal of the Notes that became due because of the
acceleration, shall have been cured, waived or otherwise remedied as provided
herein,

__then, the Holders of a majority of the aggregate principal amount of Notes
then Outstanding, by written notice to the Company and to the Trustee, may
waive all Defaults and Events of Default with respect to the Notes (except for
any Default or Event of Default arising from (a) the Companys failure to
pay principal (including the Fundamental Change Purchase Price) of, or any
interest on, any Notes), (b) the Companys failure to pay or deliver the
Settlement Amounts due upon conversion of any Note within the applicable time
period set forth under Section 4.03(a) or (c) the Companys failure to comply
with any provision of this Indenture the modification of which would require
the consent of the Holder of each Outstanding Note affected) and may rescind
and annul the declaration of acceleration resulting from such Defaults or
Events of Default (except for any Default or Event of Default arising from (x)
the Companys failure to pay principal (including the Fundamental Change
Purchase Price) of, or any interest on, any Notes), (y) the Companys failure
to pay or deliver the Settlement Amounts due upon conversion of any Note
within the applicable time period set forth under Section 4.03(a) or (z) the
Companys failure to comply with any provision of this Indenture the
modification of which would require the consent of the Holder of each
Outstanding Note affected) and their consequences; _provided_ , that no such
rescission or annulment will extend to or will affect any subsequent Default
or Event of Default or shall impair any right consequent on such Default or
Event of Default. __

 

Section 6.03 _Additional Interest_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding Section 6.02, to the extent the Company elects, the sole
remedy for an Event of Default (i) relating to any obligations the Company
has or is deemed to have under Section 314(a)(1) of the Trust Indenture Act or
(ii) under Section 6.01(f) relating to the Companys failure to comply with
Section 5.04 (which will be the 60th day after written notice is provided to
the Company in accordance with such an event of default) (such Event of
Default, a "Reporting Event of Default"), will, after the occurrence of such
Reporting Event of Default, (i) consist exclusively of the right to receive
Additional Interest at an annual rate equal to 0.25% of the aggregate
principal amount of the Notes then Outstanding for each day during the 180-day
period beginning on, and including, the day on which such a Reporting Event
of Default occurs during which such Reporting Event of Default is continuing
(or, if applicable, the earlier date on

 



62  which such Reporting Event of Default is cured or waived) and (ii) consist
exclusively of the right to receive Additional Interest on the Notes at an
annual rate equal to 0.50% per annum of the principal amount of such tranche
of notes outstanding for each day during the 185-day period immediately
following such 180-day period, in each case payable in the same manner and on
the same dates as the stated interest payable on the Notes.

(b) If the Reporting Event of Default is continuing on the 366th day after the
date on which such Reporting Event of Default occurred, the Notes will be
subject to acceleration as provided in Section 6.02(a).

(c) In order to elect to pay the Additional Interest as the sole remedy
during the first 365 days after the occurrence of a Reporting Event of
Default, the Company must notify all Holders of Notes, the Trustee and the
Paying Agent in writing of such election on or before the Close of Business
on the fifth Business Day after the date on which such Reporting Event of
Default would otherwise occur. Upon the Companys failure to timely give such
notice of such election or to pay the Additional Interest when due, the Notes
will be immediately subject to acceleration by declaration of the Trustee or
the Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes
Outstanding as provided in Section 6.02. Nothing in this Section 6.03
shall affect the rights of Holders of Notes in the event of the occurrence of
any other Event of Default.

Section 6.04 _Waiver of Past Defaults_. Subject to Section 6.02(b), the
Holders of not less than a majority of the aggregate principal amount of Notes
then Outstanding, by written notice to the Company and to the Trustee, may
waive any Default or Event of Default (except for any Default or Event of
Default arising from (a) the Companys failure to pay principal of, or any
interest on, any Notes), (b) the Companys failure to pay or deliver the
Settlement Amounts due upon conversion of any Note within the applicable time
period set forth under Section 4.03(a), or (c) the Companys failure to comply
with any provision of this Indenture the modification of which would require
the consent of the Holder of each Outstanding Note affected) and rescind any
acceleration resulting from such Default or Event of Default and its
consequences; _provided_ , that no such waiver will extend to or will affect
any subsequent Default or Event of Default or shall impair any
right consequent on such Default or Event of Default.

Section 6.05 _Control by Majority_. The Trustee will not be obligated
to exercise any of its rights or powers at the request of the Holders unless
the Holders have offered to the Trustee security or indemnity satisfactory to
the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense. Subject to this Indenture,
applicable law and the Trustees indemnification, the Holders of a majority
in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Notes may direct in writing
the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy
available to the Trustee or exercising any trust or power conferred on the
Trustee with respect to the Notes. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow
any direction that conflicts with law or this Indenture or that the Trustee
determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any Holder.

Section 6.06 _Limitation on Suits_. Subject to Section 6.07, no Holder will
have any right to institute any proceeding under this Indenture, or for the
appointment of a receiver or Trustee, or for any other remedy under this
Indenture or with respect to the Notes unless:

 



63 (a) the Holder has previously delivered to the Trustee written notice of
a continuing Event of Default;

(b) the Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the then
Outstanding Notes deliver to the Trustee a written request that the Trustee
pursue a remedy with respect to such Event of Default and have offered
reasonable indemnity to the Trustee to institute such proceeding as Trustee;

 

(c) the Trustee has failed to institute a proceeding within 60 days after such
notice, request and offer; and

 

(d) the Trustee has not received from the Holders of a majority in aggregate
principal amount of the then Outstanding Notes a direction inconsistent with
such written request within 60 days after such notice, request and offer.

Section 6.07 _Rights of Holders to Receive Payment and to Convert_.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary elsewhere in this Indenture, the
above limitations set forth under Section 6.06 do not apply to a suit
instituted by a Holder for the enforcement of a payment of the principal
(including the Fundamental Change Purchase Price, if applicable) of, or any
accrued and unpaid interest on, any Note, on or after the applicable due date
or the right to convert the Note or to receive the Settlement Amounts due
upon conversion in accordance with Article 4, and such right to receive any
such payment or delivery, as the case may be, on or after the applicable due
dates shall not be impaired or affected without the consent of such Holder.

 

Section 6.08 _Collection of Indebtedness; Suit for Enforcement by Trustee_. If
an Event of Default specified in Section 6.01(a), 6.01(b), 6.01(c) or 6.01(d)
occurs and is continuing, the Trustee is authorized to recover judgment in its
own name and as trustee of an express trust against the Company for the whole
amount of principal of, premium on, interest on, Fundamental Change Purchase
Price for and the Settlement Amounts due upon the conversion of the Notes and
such further amount as is sufficient to cover the costs and expenses of
collection, including the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements
and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, as well as any other
amounts that may be due under Section 11.07.

 

Section 6.09 _Trustee May Enforce Claims Without Possession of Notes_. All
rights of action and claims under this Indenture or the Notes may be
prosecuted and enforced by the Trustee without the possession of any of the
Notes or the production thereof in any proceeding relating thereto, and any
such proceeding instituted by the Trustee shall be brought in its own name
as trustee of an express trust, and any recovery of judgment shall, after
provision for the payment of the compensation, and reasonable expenses,
disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, be for the
ratable benefit of the Holders in respect of which such judgment has been
recovered.

Section 6.10 _Trustee May File Proofs of Claim_. The Trustee is authorized to
file such proofs of claim and other papers or documents as may be necessary or
advisable to have the claims of the Trustee and the Holders allowed in any
judicial proceedings relative to the Company, its creditors or its property
and, unless prohibited by law or applicable regulations, will be entitled to
collect, receive and distribute any money or other property payable or

 



64  deliverable on any such claims, and any custodian in any such judicial
proceeding is hereby authorized by each Holder to make such payments to the
Trustee, and, in the event that the Trustee consents to the making of such
payments directly to the Holders, to pay to the Trustee any amount due to it
for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the
Trustee, its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Trustee under
Section 11.07. To the extent that the payment of any such compensation,
expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel,
and any other amounts due the Trustee under Section 11.07 out of the
estate in any such proceeding, will be denied for any reason, payment of the
same will be secured by a lien on, and is paid out of, any and all
distributions, dividends, money, securities and other properties that the
Holders may be entitled to receive in such proceeding, whether in liquidation
or under any plan of reorganization or arrangement or otherwise. Nothing
herein contained will be deemed to authorize the Trustee to authorize or
consent to, or to accept or to adopt on behalf of any Holder, any plan of
reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Notes or
the rights of any Holder, or to authorize the Trustee to vote in respect of
the claim of any Holder in any such proceeding.

 

Section 6.11 _Restoration of Rights and Remedies_. If the Trustee or any
Holder has instituted any proceeding to enforce any right or remedy under
this Indenture and such proceeding has been discontinued or abandoned for any
reason, or has been determined adversely to the Trustee or to such Holder,
then and in every such case, subject to any determination in such
proceeding, the Company, the Trustee and the Holders shall be restored
severally and respectively to their former positions hereunder and thereafter
all rights and remedies of the Trustee and the Holders shall continue as
though no such proceeding had been instituted.

Section 6.12 _Rights and Remedies Cumulative_. Except as otherwise provided
with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or
stolen Notes in Section 2.09, no right or remedy herein conferred upon or
reserved to the Trustee or to the Holders is intended to be exclusive of any
other right or remedy, and every right and remedy shall, to the extent
permitted by law, be cumulative and in addition to every other right and
remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or
otherwise. The assertion or employment of any right or remedy hereunder,
or otherwise, shall not prevent the concurrent assertion or employment of any
other appropriate right or remedy.

Section 6.13 _Delay or Omission Not a Waiver_. No delay or omission of the
Trustee or of any Holder to exercise any right or remedy accruing upon any
Event of Default shall impair any such right or remedy or constitute a waiver
of any such Event of Default or an acquiescence therein. Every right and
remedy given by this Article 6 or by law to the Trustee or to the Holders may
be exercised from time to time and as often as may be deemed expedient by the
Trustee (subject to the limitations contained in this Indenture) or by the
Holders, as the case may be.

Section 6.14 _Priorities_. If the Trustee collects any money or
property pursuant to this Article 6, it will pay out the money or property in
the following order:

FIRST: to the Trustee, its agents and attorneys for amounts due under Section
11.07, including payment of all compensation, expenses and liabilities
incurred, and all advances made, by the Trustee and the costs and expenses of
collection;

 



65 SECOND: to the Holders, for any amounts due and unpaid on the principal of,
premium on, accrued and unpaid interest on, the Fundamental Change Purchase
Price for, and any cash due upon conversion of, any Note, without preference
or priority of any kind, according to such amounts due and payable on all of
the Notes; and

 

THIRD: the balance, if any, to the Company or to such other party as a court
of competent jurisdiction directs.

 

The Trustee may fix a record date and payment date for any payment to the
Holders pursuant to this Section 6.14. If the Trustee so fixes a record date
and a payment date, at least 15 calendar days prior to such record date, the
Trustee will deliver to each Holder (at the Companys cost and expense) a
written notice, which notice will state such record date, such payment date
and the amount of such payment.

Section 6.15 _Undertaking for Costs_. All parties to this Indenture agree, and
each Holder, by such Holders acceptance of a Note, shall be deemed to have
agreed, that any court may in its discretion require, in any suit for the
enforcement of any right or remedy under this Indenture, or in any suit
against the Trustee for any action taken or omitted by it as Trustee, the
filing by any party litigant in such suit of an undertaking to pay the costs
of such suit, and that such court may in its discretion assess reasonable
costs, including reasonable attorneys fees, against any party litigant in
such suit, having due regard to the merits and good faith of the claims or
defenses made by such party litigant; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
provisions of this Section 6.15 shall not apply to (i) any suit instituted by
the Trustee, (ii) any suit instituted by any Holder, or group of Holders,
holding in the aggregate more than 10% in aggregate principal amount of the
Notes then Outstanding, (iii) any suit instituted by any Holder for
the enforcement of the payment of the principal (including the Fundamental
Change Purchase Price) of, or any interest on, any Note on or after the
applicable due date expressed or provided for in this Indenture, (iv) any suit
for the enforcement of the right to convert any Note or to receive the
Settlement Amounts due upon conversion of any Note in accordance with the
provisions of Article 4, or (v) any suit for the enforcement of the right of a
beneficial owner to exchange its beneficial interest in a Global Note for a
Physical Note if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing in
accordance with Section 2.11.

 

Section 6.16 _Waiver of Stay, Extension and Usury Laws_. The Company covenants
that, to the extent that it may lawfully do so, it will not at any time
insist upon, plead, or in any manner whatsoever claim or take the benefit or
advantage of, any stay, extension or usury law wherever enacted, now or at any
time hereafter in force, that may affect the covenants or the performance of
this Indenture; and the Company, to the extent that it may lawfully do so,
hereby expressly waives all benefit or advantage of any such law, and
covenants that it will not, by resort to any such law, hinder, delay or impede
the execution of any power herein granted to the Trustee, but will instead
suffer and permit the execution of every such power as though no such law has
been enacted.

 

Section 6.17 _Notices from the Trustee_. If a Default occurs and is continuing
and is known to the Trustee, the Trustee must send notice of such Default to
each Holder within 90 days after such Event of Default has occurred. Except in
the case of a Default in the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, or
interest on any Note or of a Default in the payment or delivery of the
Settlement Amounts due upon conversion of any Note, the Trustee may withhold
notice if and so long as a committee of trust officers of the Trustee in good
faith determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the Holders.

canceled or delivered to the Trustee for cancellation shall have become due
and payable (whether on the Maturity Date, on any Fundamental Change Purchase
Date, upon conversion or otherwise) and the Company shall deposit with the
Trustee, in trust, or deliver to the Holders, as applicable, an amount of
cash (and, to the extent applicable, deliver to the Holders a number of shares
of Common Stock to satisfy the Companys obligations with respect to
outstanding conversions), sufficient to pay all amounts due on all of such

independent certified accountant or other financial professional reasonably
satisfactory to the Trustee, and the Company shall have paid or caused to
be paid all other sums payable hereunder by the Company, then this Indenture
shall cease to be of further effect (except as to (i) rights hereunder of
Holders to receive all amounts owing upon the Notes and the other rights,
duties and obligations of Holders, as beneficiaries hereof with respect to
the amounts, if any, so deposited with the Trustee and (ii) the rights,
obligations, indemnities and immunities of the Trustee hereunder and the
obligations of the Company in respect thereof), and the Trustee, on written
demand of the Company accompanied by an Officers Certificate and an Opinion
of Counsel (each stating that all conditions precedent to the discharge of the
Indenture have been complied with) and at the cost and expense of the
Company, shall execute instruments acknowledging satisfaction and discharge of
this Indenture. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company hereby agrees to
reimburse the Trustee for any costs or expenses thereafter incurred by
the Trustee, including the reasonable fees and expenses of its counsel, and
to compensate the Trustee for any services thereafter rendered by the Trustee
in connection with this Indenture or the Notes.

own Paying Agent), to the Holders of the particular Notes for the payment of
all sums or amounts due and to become due thereon for principal and interest,
if any.

 

Section 7.03 _Paying Agent to Repay Monies Held_. Upon the satisfaction and
discharge of this Indenture, all excess monies then held by any Paying Agent
(if other than the Trustee) shall, upon written request of the Company, be

released from all further liability with respect to such amounts.

case may be, shall have become due and payable, shall be repaid to the Company
by the Trustee on written demand, and all liability of the Trustee shall
thereupon cease with respect to such monies; and the Holders shall thereafter
look only to the Company for any payment that such Holder may be entitled to
collect unless an applicable abandoned property law designates another person.

 

Section 7.05 _Reinstatement_. If the Trustee or the Paying Agent is unable to
apply any monies in accordance with Section 7.02 by reason of any order or
judgment of any court or governmental authority enjoining, restraining or
otherwise prohibiting such application, the Companys obligations under this
Indenture and the Notes shall be revived and reinstated as though no deposit
had occurred pursuant to Section 7.01 until such time as the Trustee or the
Paying Agent is permitted to apply all such amounts in accordance with Section
7.02; provided, however, that if the Company makes any payment of interest
on, principal of or delivery in respect of any Note following the
reinstatement of its obligations, the Company shall be subrogated to the
rights of the Holders of such Notes to receive such payment from the monies
held by the Trustee or Paying Agent.

and power of, the Company under this Indenture, with the same effect as if it
had been named herein as the party of the first part; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that in the case of a sale, assignment, conveyance, transfer, lease or other
disposition to one or more of its Subsidiaries of all or substantially all of
the properties and assets of the Company, the Notes will remain convertible
based on the Settlement Amount, in accordance with Section 4.03 but subject
to adjustment (if any) in accordance with Section 4.06. Such Successor Company
thereupon may cause to be signed, and may issue either in its own name or in
the name of the Company any or all of the Notes issuable hereunder which
theretofore shall not have been signed by the Company and delivered to the
Trustee; and, upon the order of such Successor Company instead of the Company
and subject to all the terms, conditions and limitations in this Indenture
prescribed, the Trustee shall authenticate and shall deliver, or cause to be
authenticated and delivered, any Notes that previously shall have been signed
and delivered by the Officers of the Company to the Trustee for
authentication, and any Notes that such Successor Company thereafter shall
cause to be signed and delivered to the Trustee for that purpose. All the
Notes so issued shall in all respects have the same legal rank and benefit
under this Indenture as the Notes theretofore or thereafter issued in
accordance with the terms of this Indenture as though all of such Notes had
been issued at the date of the execution hereof. In the event of such
consolidation, merger, binding share exchange, sale, assignment,
conveyance, transfer or other disposition to another Person (but not in the
case of a lease), the Person named as the "Company" in the first paragraph of
this Indenture or any successor that shall thereafter have become such in the
manner prescribed in this Article 9 may be dissolved, wound up and liquidated
at any time thereafter and, except in the case of a lease, such Person shall
be released from its liabilities as obligor and maker of the Notes and from
its obligations under this Indenture.

 



71 In case of any such consolidation, merger, binding share exchange, sale,
assignment, conveyance, transfer, lease or other disposition to another
Person, such changes in phraseology and form (but not in substance) may be
made in the Notes thereafter to be issued as may be appropriate.

 

Section 9.03 _Officer s Certificate and Opinion of Counsel to Be Given to
Trustee_. In the case of any such consolidation, merger, binding share
exchange, sale, assignment, conveyance, transfer, lease or other disposition
pursuant to Section 9.01, the Trustee shall receive an Officers Certificate
and an Opinion of Counsel stating that any such consolidation, merger,
binding share exchange, sale, assignment, conveyance, transfer, lease or other
disposition and any such assumption and, if a supplemental indenture is
required in connection with such transaction, such supplemental indenture,
complies with the provisions of this Indenture.

THE TRUSTEE

 

Section 11.01 _Duties and Responsibilities of Trustee_.

 

(a) The Trustee, prior to the occurrence of an Event of Default and after the
curing of all Events of Default which may have occurred, undertakes to
perform such duties and only such duties as are provided in the Trust
Indenture Act and as specifically set forth in this Indenture and no implied
covenants or obligations shall be read into this Indenture against
the Trustee. In case an Event of Default has occurred (which has not been
cured or waived), the Trustee shall exercise such of the rights and powers
vested in it by this Indenture and use the same degree of care in its exercise
as a prudent person would use in the conduct of his or her own affairs.

(b) Prior to the occurrence of an Event of Default and after the curing
or waiving of all Events of Default which may have occurred, and subject to
Sections 315(a) through (d) of the Trust Indenture Act:

 

(i) the duties and obligations of the Trustee shall be determined solely by
the express provisions of this Indenture and applicable law, and the Trustee
shall not be liable except for the performance of such duties and obligations
as are specifically set forth in this Indenture and no implied covenants or
obligations shall be read into this Indenture against the Trustee; and

 



72 (ii) in the absence of bad faith on the part of the Trustee, the Trustee
may conclusively rely as to the truth of the statements and the correctness
of the opinions expressed therein, upon any certificates or opinions furnished
to the Trustee and conforming to the requirements of this Indenture; but, in
the case of any such certificates or opinions which by any provisions hereof
are specifically required to be furnished to the Trustee, the Trustee shall be
under a duty to examine the same to determine whether or not they conform to
the requirements of this Indenture (but need not confirm or investigate the
accuracy of any mathematical calculations or other facts stated therein).

(c) No provision of this Indenture shall be construed to relieve the Trustee
from liability for its own negligent action, its own negligent failure to act
or its own willful misconduct, except that:

 

(i) this subsection (c) does not limit the effect of this Section 11.01;

 

(ii) the Trustee shall not be liable for any error of judgment made in good
faith by a Responsible Officer or Officers of the Trustee, unless the Trustee
was negligent in ascertaining the pertinent facts; and

(iii) the Trustee shall not be liable with respect to any action taken or
omitted to be taken by it in good faith in accordance with the written
direction of the Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of
the Notes at the time Outstanding determined as provided in Section 1.03
relating to the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any
remedy available to the Trustee, or exercising any trust or power conferred
upon the Trustee under this Indenture;

 

(d) Whether or not therein provided, every provision of this Indenture
relating to the conduct or affecting the liability of, or affording
protection to, the Trustee shall be subject to the provisions of this Section
11.01.

(e) The Trustee shall not be liable in respect of any payment (as to the
correctness or calculation of amount, entitlement to receive or any other
matters relating to payment) or notice effected by the Company or any Paying
Agent or any records maintained by any co-Registrar with respect to the
Notes.

(f) If any party fails to deliver a notice relating to an event the fact of
which, pursuant to this Indenture, requires notice to be sent to the Trustee,
the Trustee may conclusively rely on its failure to receive such notice as
reason to act as if no such event occurred.

 

(g) None of the provisions contained in this Indenture shall require the
Trustee to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any financial
liability in the performance of any of its duties or in the exercise of any of
its rights or powers if there is reasonable ground for believing that the
repayment of such funds or adequate indemnity against such risk or
liability is not reasonably assured to it.

 



73 Section 11.02 _[RESERVED]_

 

Section 11.03 _Rights_ of the Trustee.

 

(a) The Trustee may conclusively rely and shall be protected in acting upon
any resolution, certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice,

matters stated in any resolution, certificate, statement, instrument,

Trustee has been advised of the likelihood of such loss or damage and
regardless of the form of action.

 



74 (i) The Trustee shall not be deemed to have notice of any Default or Event
of Default unless written notice of any event which is in fact such a default
is received by a Responsible Officer of the Trustee at the Corporate Trust
Office of the Trustee, and such notice references the Notes and the Indenture.

 

(j) The rights, privileges, protections, immunities and benefits given to the

received by the Trustee shall be placed in a non-interest bearing trust

provide timely written investment direction, and the Trustee shall have no
obligation to invest or reinvest any amounts held hereunder in the absence of
such written investment direction from the Company.

 

(n) The permissive rights of the Trustee enumerated herein shall not be
construed as duties.

 

(o) If at any time the Trustee is served with any judicial or administrative
order, judgment, decree, writ or other form of judicial or administrative
process which in any way affects any trust account, funds held hereunder or
this Indenture (including, but not limited to, orders of attachment or
garnishment or other forms of levies or injunctions or stays relating to the
transfer of funds), the Trustee is authorized to comply therewith in any
manner as it or its legal counsel of its own choosing deems appropriate; and
if the Trustee complies with any such judicial or administrative order,
judgment, decree, writ or other form of judicial or administrative process,
the Trustee shall not be liable to any of the parties hereto or to any other
person or entity even though such order, judgment, decree, writ or process may
be subsequently modified or vacated or otherwise determined to have been
without legal force or effect.

 



75 Section 11.04 _Trustee s Disclaimer._The recitals contained herein and in
the Notes (except in the Trustees certificate of authentication) shall be
taken as the statements of the Company, and the Trustee assumes no
responsibility for the correctness of the same. The Trustee makes no
representations as to the validity or sufficiency of this Indenture or of the
Notes. The Trustee shall not be accountable for the use or application by the
Company of any Notes or the proceeds of any Notes authenticated and delivered
by the Trustee under this Indenture and the Trustee shall not be responsible
for any statement of the Company in this Indenture or in any document issued
in connection with the sale of the Notes.

 

Section 11.05 _Trustee or Agents May Own Notes_. The Trustee or any Agent, in
its individual or any other capacity, may become the owner or pledgee of
Notes with the same rights it would have if it were not Trustee or Agent. The
Trustee is subject to Sections 310(b) and 311 of the Trust Indenture Act.

 

Section 11.06 _Monies to be Held in Trust_. Subject to the provisions of
Section 7.02, all monies and properties received by the Trustee shall, until
used or applied as herein provided, be held in trust for the purposes for
which they were received. Money held by the Trustee in trust hereunder need
not be segregated from other funds except to the extent required by law. The
Trustee shall be under no liability for interest on or the investment of any
money received by it hereunder except as may be agreed in writing from time to
time by the Company and the Trustee.

 

Section 11.07 _Compensation and Expenses of Trustee_. The Company covenants
and agrees to pay to the Trustee from time to time, and the Trustee shall be
entitled to, such compensation for all services rendered by it hereunder in
any capacity (which shall not be limited by any provision of law in regard to
the compensation of a trustee of an express trust) as mutually agreed to from
time to time in writing between the Company and the Trustee, and the Company
will pay or reimburse the Trustee upon its request for all reasonable
expenses, disbursements and advances reasonably incurred or made by the
Trustee in accordance with any of the provisions of this Indenture (including
the reasonable compensation and the expenses and disbursements of its counsel
and of all Persons not regularly in its employ) except any such expense,
disbursement or advance as may arise from its own negligence or willful
misconduct, as determined by a final order of a court of competent
jurisdiction.

The Company also covenants to indemnify each of the Trustee and the Agents
(and their respective officers, directors and employees), in any capacity
under this Indenture and their respective agents for, and to hold each of them
harmless from and against, any and all loss, liability, claim, damage, cost
or expense incurred without negligence or willful misconduct on its own part
and arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of
this trust and the performance of its duties and/or the exercise of its
rights hereunder or in any other capacity hereunder, including the costs and
expenses of defending itself against any claim (whether asserted by the
Company, a Holder or any other Person) of liability in the premises. The
Trustee shall notify the Company promptly of any claim for which it may seek
indemnity. Failure by the Trustee to so notify the Company shall not relieve
the Company of its obligations hereunder. The Company may defend the claim and
the Trustee shall cooperate in the defense; provided, the Company shall not
settle any such claim without the consent of the Trustee (which consent shall
not be unreasonable withheld). The Trustee may have separate counsel and the
Company shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel. The
Company need not pay for any settlement made without its consent.

 



76 The obligations of the Company under this Section 11.07 to compensate or
indemnify the Trustee and to pay or reimburse the Trustee for expenses,
disbursements and advances shall be secured by a lien prior to that of the
Notes upon all property and funds held or collected by the Trustee as such,
except funds held in trust for the benefit of the Holders of particular
Notes. The obligation of the Company under this Section 11.07 shall survive
the payment of the Notes, the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture
and/or the resignation or removal of the Trustee.

 

When the Trustee, any Agent, and any of their respective agents incur expenses
or render services after an Event of Default specified in Section 6.01(i) and
6.01(j) with respect to the Company occurs, the expenses and the compensation
for the services are intended to constitute expenses of administration under
any bankruptcy, insolvency or similar laws.

 

Section 11.08 _Officer s Certificate as Evidence_. Subject to Section 11.01,
whenever in the administration of the provisions of this Indenture the
Trustee shall deem it necessary or desirable that a matter be proved or
established prior to taking or omitting any action hereunder, such matter
(unless other evidence in respect thereof be herein specifically prescribed)
may, in the absence of bad faith on the part of the Trustee, be deemed to be
conclusively proved and established by an Officers Certificate delivered to
the Trustee.

 

Section 11.09 _Conflicting Interests of Trustee_. If the Trustee has or shall
acquire a conflicting interest within the meaning of the Trust Indenture Act,
the Trustee shall either eliminate such interest or resign, to the extent and
in the manner provided by, and subject to the provisions of, this Indenture.

 

Section 11.10 _Eligibility of Trustee_. There shall at all times be a Trustee
hereunder which shall be a Person that is eligible pursuant to the Trust
Indenture Act to act as such and has a combined capital and surplus, together
with its parent (which, in the case of Computershare Trust Company, National
Association is Computershare, Inc.) of at least $50,000,000 (or if
such Person is a member of a bank holding company system, its bank holding
company shall have a combined capital and surplus of at least $50,000,000). If
such Person publishes reports of condition at least annually, pursuant to law
or to the requirements of any supervising or examining authority, then for
the purposes of this Section 11.10 the combined capital and surplus of such
Person shall be deemed to be its combined capital and surplus as set forth in
its most recent report of condition so published. If at any time the Trustee
shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section
11.10, it shall resign immediately in the manner and with the effect
hereinafter specified in this Article.

 

Section 11.11 _Resignation or Removal of Trustee_.

 

(a) The Trustee may at any time resign by giving written notice of such
resignation to the Company and to the Holders of Notes. Upon receiving such
notice of resignation, the Company shall promptly appoint a successor trustee
by written instrument, in duplicate, executed by order of the Board of
Directors, one copy of which instrument shall be delivered to the
resigning Trustee and one copy to the successor trustee. If no successor
trustee shall have been so appointed and have accepted appointment thirty (30)
days after such notice of resignation is given to the Company and the Holders,
the resigning Trustee may, upon ten (10) Business Days notice to the

 



77  Company and the Holders, appoint a successor identified in such notice or
may petition, at the expense of the Company, any court of competent
jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor trustee, or, if any Holder
who has been a bona fide Holder of a Note or Notes for at least six (6) months
may, subject to the provisions of Section 6.15, on behalf of himself and all
others similarly situated, petition any such court for the appointment of a
successor trustee. Such court may thereupon, after such notice, if any, as it
may deem proper and prescribe, appoint a successor trustee.

 

(b) In case at any time any of the following shall occur:

 

(i) the Trustee shall fail to comply with Section 11.09 after written request
therefor by the Company or by any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder of a
Note or Notes for at least six (6) months; or

(ii) the Trustee shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions
of Section 11.10 and shall fail to resign after written request therefor by
the Company or by any such Holder; or

 

(iii) the Trustee shall become incapable of acting, or shall be adjudged a
bankrupt or insolvent, or a receiver of the Trustee or of its property shall
be appointed, or any public officer shall take charge or control of the
Trustee or of its property or affairs for the purpose of rehabilitation,
conservation or liquidation;

 

then, in any such case, the Company may remove the Trustee and appoint a
successor trustee by written instrument, in duplicate, executed by order of
the Board of Directors, one copy of which instrument shall be delivered to the
Trustee so removed and one copy to the successor trustee, or, subject to the
provisions of Section 6.15, any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder of a
Note or Notes for at least six (6) months may, on behalf of himself and all
others similarly situated, petition any court of competent jurisdiction for
the removal of the Trustee and the appointment of a successor trustee; 
_provided, however_ , that if no successor Trustee shall have been appointed
and have accepted appointment thirty (30) days after either the Company or the
Holders has removed the Trustee, the Trustee so removed may petition at
the Companys expense any court of competent jurisdiction for an appointment
of a successor trustee. Such court may thereupon, after such notice, if any,
as it may deem proper and prescribe, remove the Trustee and appoint a
successor trustee.

 

(c) The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes at
the time Outstanding may at any time remove the Trustee and nominate a
successor trustee which shall be deemed appointed as successor trustee unless,
within ten (10) days after notice to the Company of such nomination, the
Company objects thereto, in which case the Trustee so removed or any Holder,
or if such Trustee so removed or any Holder fails to act, the Company, upon
the terms and conditions and otherwise as in Section 11.11(a) provided, may
petition any court of competent jurisdiction for an appointment of a
successor trustee.

 



78 (d) Any resignation or removal of the Trustee and appointment of a
successor trustee pursuant to any of the provisions of this Section 11.11
shall become effective upon acceptance of appointment by the successor trustee
as provided in Section 11.12.

 

Section 11.12 _Acceptance by Successor Trustee_. Any successor trustee
appointed as provided in Section 11.11 shall execute, acknowledge and deliver
to the Company and to its predecessor trustee an instrument accepting such
appointment hereunder, and thereupon the resignation or removal of the
predecessor trustee shall become effective and such successor trustee,
without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become vested with all the
rights, powers, duties and obligations of its predecessor hereunder, with like
effect as if originally named as trustee herein; but, nevertheless, on the
written request of the Company or of the successor trustee, the trustee
ceasing to act shall, upon payment of any amount then due it pursuant to the
provisions of Section 11.07, execute and deliver an instrument transferring to
such successor trustee all the rights and powers of the trustee so ceasing to
act. Upon request of any such successor trustee, the Company shall execute any
and all instruments in writing for more fully and certainly vesting in and
confirming to such successor trustee all such rights and powers. Any trustee
ceasing to act shall, nevertheless, retain a lien upon all property and funds
held or collected by such trustee as such, except for funds held in trust for
the benefit of Holders of particular Notes, to secure any amounts then due it
pursuant to the provisions of Section 11.07.

No successor trustee shall accept appointment as provided in this Section
11.12 unless, at the time of such acceptance, such successor trustee shall be
qualified under the provisions of Section 11.09 and be eligible under the
provisions of Section 11.10.

 

Upon acceptance of appointment by a successor trustee as provided in this
Section 11.12, the Company (or the former trustee, at the written direction
of the Company) shall give or cause to be given notice of the succession of
such trustee hereunder to the Holders of Notes in accordance with Section
12.08(c). If the Company fails to give such notice within ten (10) days after
acceptance of appointment by the successor trustee, the successor trustee
shall cause such notice to be given at the expense of the Company.

 

Section 11.13 _Succession by Merger, Etc._ Any corporation into which the
Trustee may be merged or exchanged or with which it may be consolidated, or
any corporation resulting from any merger, exchange or consolidation to which
the Trustee shall be a party, or any corporation succeeding to all or
substantially all of the corporate trust business of the Trustee (including
any trust created by this Indenture), shall be the successor to the Trustee
hereunder without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on
the part of any of the parties hereto, provided that in the case of any
corporation succeeding to all or substantially all of the corporate trust
business of the Trustee, such corporation shall be qualified under the
provisions of Section 11.09 and eligible under the provisions of Section
11.10.

 

In case at the time such successor to the Trustee shall succeed to the trusts
created by this Indenture, any of the Notes shall have been authenticated but
not delivered, any such successor to the Trustee may adopt the certificate of
authentication of any predecessor trustee or authenticating agent appointed by
such predecessor trustee, and deliver such Notes so authenticated; and
in case at that time any of the Notes shall not have been authenticated, any

 



79  successor to the Trustee or any authenticating agent appointed by such
successor trustee may authenticate such Notes in the name of the successor
trustee; and in all such cases such certificates shall have the full force
that is provided in the Notes or in this Indenture; provided, however, that
the right to adopt the certificate of authentication of any predecessor
Trustee or authenticate Notes in the name of any predecessor Trustee
shall apply only to its successor or successors by merger, exchange or
consolidation.

Section 11.14 _Preferential Collection of Claims_. If and when the Trustee
shall be or become a creditor of the Company (or any other obligor upon the
Notes), the Trustee shall be subject to the provisions of the Trust Indenture
Act regarding the collection of the claims against the Company (or any such
other obligor).

Section 11.15 _Trustee s Application for Instructions from the Company_.
Any application by the Trustee for written instructions from the Company
(other than with regard to any action proposed to be taken or omitted to be
taken by the Trustee that affects the rights of the Holders of the Notes under
this Indenture) may, at the option of the Trustee, set forth in writing any
action proposed to be taken or omitted by the Trustee under this Indenture and
the date on and/or after which such action shall be taken or such omission
shall be effective. The Trustee shall not be liable for any action taken by,
or omission of, the Trustee in accordance with a proposal included in such
application on or after the date specified in such application (which date
shall not be less than three (3) Business Days after the date any officer of
the Company actually receives such application, unless any such officer shall
have consented in writing to any earlier date) unless prior to taking any such
action (or the effective date in the case of an omission), the Trustee shall
have received written instructions in response to such application specifying
the action to be taken or omitted.

Section 11.16  _Reports by Trustee to Holders_. Within 60 days after each May
15, beginning with the May 15 following the issue date, the Trustee will mail
to each Holder, as provided in Trust Indenture Act Section 313(c), a brief
report, if required by Trust Indenture Act Section 313(a), and file such
reports with each stock exchange upon which its Notes are listed and with the
Commission as required by Trust Indenture Act Section 313(d).

circumstances.

Stock determined in accordance with Article 4 of the Indenture and subject to
adjustment as set forth therein.

As provided in and subject to the provisions of the Indenture, the Company
