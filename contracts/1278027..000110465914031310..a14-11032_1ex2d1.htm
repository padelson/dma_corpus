management and such other information as the Seller Representative shall
reasonably request (during regular business hours, upon reasonable advance
notice, under reasonable circumstances, subject to restrictions under
applicable Law and without undue disruption to the normal business activities
of Buyer or the Company) in order to review the Closing Statement.

 



 

(d) _Notice of Disagreement_. The Closing Statement delivered by Buyer to the
Seller Representative shall be conclusive and binding on all parties unless
the Seller Representative, within forty-five (45) days after receipt of the
Closing Statement, delivers a notice to Buyer stating that the Seller

detail those items or amounts as to which the Seller Representative disagrees
and the basis therefor.

 



 

(e) _Dispute Resolution_. If a notice of disagreement is duly delivered
pursuant to _Section 3.4(d)_, the Seller Representative and Buyer shall,
during the 15 days following such

 



       
 

 



 

delivery, use their commercially reasonable efforts to reach agreement on the
disputed items or amounts in order to determine, as may be required, the
amount of the Actual Adjustment. If during such period, the Seller
Representative and Buyer are unable to reach such agreement, they shall
promptly thereafter cause the Independent Accountant to review this Agreement
and the disputed items or amounts for the purpose of calculating the Closing
Statement and the Actual Adjustment (it being understood that in making such
calculation, the Independent Accountant shall be functioning as an expert and
shall not have any authority to interpret any provision of this _Section 3.4_
or any other provision of this Agreement).

 



 

(f) _Cooperation with Independent Accountant_. Buyer and the Seller
Representative shall cooperate with the Independent Accountant and promptly
provide all documents and information requested by the Independent Accountant.

 



 

(g) _Independent Accountant s Report_. In making such calculations, the
Independent Accountant shall consider only those items or amounts in the
Closing Statement as to which the Seller Representative has disagreed in its
notice of disagreement duly delivered pursuant to _Section 3.4(d)_ and may
not assign a value greater than the greatest positive or negative adjustment
requested by the Buyer or Seller Representative. The Independent Accountant
shall deliver to the Seller Representative and Buyer, as promptly as
practicable (but in any case no later than 30 days from the date of
engagement), a report setting forth such calculations. Such report (and the
determinations made therein) shall be made in accordance with the Agreed
Principles. Absent manifest error, such report shall be final and binding upon
the Seller Representative and Buyer, shall be deemed a final arbitration award
that is binding on Buyer and the Seller Representative, and neither Buyer nor
the Seller Representative shall seek further recourse in courts or other
tribunals, other than to enforce such report, and the Closing Statement shall
be modified to the extent necessary to reflect the determinations made in such
report.

 



 

(h) _Cost of Review_. The cost of the Independent Accountants review and
report shall be allocated between Sellers, on the one hand, and Buyer on the
other hand, based on the inverse of the percentage of the Independent
Accountants determination bears to the total amount of the total items in
dispute as originally submitted to the Independent Accountant. For example,
should the items in dispute total $1,000 and the Independent Accountant awards
$600 in favor of the Sellers position, 60% of the costs of its review would
be borne by Buyer and 40% borne by Sellers.

 



 

(i) _Payment_.

 



 

(i) _Positive Actual Adjustment_. If the Actual Adjustment is a positive
number, Buyer shall pay to the Seller Representative on behalf of the Sellers
and the holders of Options an aggregate amount equal to the Actual Adjustment
by wire transfer of immediately available United States funds to be
distributed to the Sellers and to the Company for further distribution to the
holders of Options in accordance with their Pro Rata Percentage, less any
applicable withholding within three (3) Business Days of the determination of
such Actual Adjustment.

 



      
 

 



 

(ii) _Negative Actual Adjustment_. If the Actual Adjustment is a negative
number the Sellers and the holders of Options (in proportion to their
respective Pro Rata Percentage) shall pay directly to the Company (or, at the
option of Buyer, the Escrow Agent shall pay to the Company, on behalf of the
Sellers and holders of Options (in proportion to their respective Pro Rata
Percentage) and using funds from the Escrow Account), an amount equal to the
absolute value of the Actual Adjustment by wire transfer of immediately
available United States funds within three (3) Business Days of the
determination of such Actual Adjustment.

 



 

(iii) _Payment of Interest_. All payments under this _Section 3.4(i)_ shall
be without interest, except that any amounts not paid when required by this
_Section 3.4(i)_ shall bear interest from the date due pursuant to this
_Section 3.4(i)_ to, and including, the date of payment at the Interest Rate.
Such interest shall be payable at the same time as the payment to which it
relates and shall be calculated daily on the basis of a year of 365 days and
the actual number of days elapsed.

 



 

3.5 _Withholding_. Buyer and the Company shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from (i) that portion of the Estimated Purchase Price allocable to
the Options and 2007 Bonus Plan Payments such amounts as may be required to be
deducted and withheld under the Code, or under any provision of state, local
or foreign Law related to Taxes and (ii) the remainder of the Estimated
Purchase Price such amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld
under the Code, or under any provision of state, local or foreign Law related
to Taxes; _provided_ that with respect to clause (ii), Buyer shall (A) provide
to Seller Representative with ten (10) days written notice of its intention
to make such deduction or withholding, which notice shall include a
description of the legal basis therefor and (B) cooperate with Seller
Representative to the extent reasonably requested in efforts to obtain
reduction or relief from such deduction or withholding. To the extent amounts
are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate Taxing Authority, the
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made.

 



 

3.6 _Payment of Retention Bonus Holdback Amount_. The Retention Holdback
Amount shall be held by the Buyer to satisfy any Retention Bonus Payments, and
any employer payroll Taxes due thereon, that the Company is required to make
following the Closing Date. Within five (5) Business Days after the

Company is required to make, Buyer shall from the Retention Holdback Amount
remit to each recipient eligible under the Retention Bonus Plan either through
the Companys or Buyers payroll system an amount equal to such recipients
post-closing Retention Bonus Payment, and Buyer shall pay to Seller
Representative in cash by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the
bank account designated in writing by the Seller Representative any remaining
Retention Bonus Holdback Amount not paid pursuant to the terms of the
Retention Bonus Plan. The Seller Representative shall disburse any such
amounts paid to the Seller Representative to each Seller in accordance with
such Sellers respective Pro Rata Percentage.

Subsidiaries is bound. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, prior to the Closing, without the prior written consent of the
Company, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned: (i) neither Buyer nor any of its employees, agents,

thereafter, if Buyer or the Company desires to destroy or dispose of such
books and records, shall offer first, in writing and at least 30 days prior to
such destruction or disposition, to instead surrender them to the Seller
Representative. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Buyer and the
Company shall not be required to disclose any information to Sellers or their
representatives if such disclosure would breach any confidentiality
obligations to which Buyer or the Company is bound or waive any privilege

instituted) challenging the transaction contemplated by this Agreement as
violative of any antitrust or competition law, or if any decree, judgment,
injunction or other order is entered, enforced or attempted to be entered or

is required to take any action to contest or resist or any such action or
proceeding or to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any such decree,

only upon, the Closing, the Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate.

 



 

7.6 _Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance_.

 



 

(a) _Organizational Documents_. From and after the Closing Date, the Company
agrees that all rights of the Persons who on or prior to the Closing Date were
directors, officers, employees of the Company or the Subsidiaries, as the case
may be (collectively, the " ** _Indemnitees_** "), to indemnification and
exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to
the Closing Date and advancement of expenses as provided in the respective
certificate of incorporation, limited liability company agreement and
comparable organizational documents (as applicable) of the Company or any of
the Subsidiaries as now in effect, and any indemnification agreement or
arrangement of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries shall survive the
Closing Date and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with
their terms for the benefit of the persons who on or prior to the Closing Date
were entitled to indemnification or exculpation thereunder. For a period of
six (6) years from the Closing Date, such rights shall not be amended, or
otherwise modified in any manner, unless such modification is required by Law.

 



 

(b) _Priority_. The Company and Buyer hereby acknowledge that certain
Indemnitees may have rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and/or
insurance provided by the Sellers or their respective Affiliates (other than
the Company and the Subsidiaries) (collectively, the " ** _Indemnitors_** ").
Buyer hereby agrees: (a) that it is the indemnitor of first resort with
respect to matters relating to the Company ( _i.e._ , its obligations to the
Indemnitees are primary and any obligation of the Indemnitors to advance
expenses or to provide indemnification for the same expenses or liabilities
incurred by the Indemnitees are secondary); (b) that it shall be required to
advance the full amount of expenses incurred by any Indemnitee and shall be
liable for the full amount of all expenses, judgments, penalties, fines and
amounts paid in settlement to the extent required by the certificate of
incorporation, certificate of formation, by-laws, limited partnership
agreement or limited liability company agreement or comparable organizational
documents of the Company and each of the Subsidiaries (or any other agreement
between the Company or any Subsidiaries and any such Indemnitee), without
regard to any rights the Indemnitee may have against the Indemnitors; and (c)
that it irrevocably waives, relinquishes and releases the Indemnitors from any
and all claims against the Indemnitors for contribution, subrogation or any
other recovery of any kind in respect thereof. Buyer and the Indemnitees agree
that the Indemnitors are express third party beneficiaries of the terms of
this _Section 7.7(b)_

 



      
 

 



 

(c) _Directors and Officers Insurance_. The Sellers shall, jointly and
severally, at their sole expense, provide a "run-off" or "tail" policy for a
period of six (6) years from the Closing Date with a reputable and financially
sound carrier of at least the same coverage and amounts and containing terms
and conditions that are no less advantageous than the current policies of
directors and officers liability insurance maintained by the Company
immediately prior to the Closing Date, with respect to claims arising from or
related to facts, events, acts or omissions that occurred at or before the
Closing Date.

 



 

(d) _No Substitution_. The provisions of this _Section 7.6_: (i) are intended
to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnitee, his or
her heirs and his or her representatives; and (ii) are in addition to, and not
in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that
any such person may have by Contract or otherwise.

 



 

(e) _Successor Obligation_. In the event that the Company, any Subsidiary or
any of their respective successors or assigns: (i) consolidates with or merges
into any other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger; or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of the Company or the Subsidiary, as applicable, shall assume all of
the obligations thereof set forth in this _Section 7.6_.

 



 

7.7 _Publicity_. None of the Company, Buyer or the Sellers shall issue any
press release or public announcement concerning this Agreement or the
Transactions without obtaining the prior written approval of the other parties
hereto, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, unless,
in the sole judgment of the Company, Buyer or the Sellers, as applicable,
disclosure is otherwise required by applicable Law or by the applicable rules
of any stock exchange on which the Company, Buyer or the Sellers lists
securities; _provided_ that, to the extent required by applicable Law, the
party intending to make such release shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts consistent with such applicable Law to consult with the other party
with respect to the timing and content thereof; _provided_ , _further_ , that
the Sellers and Buyer are permitted to report and disclose the terms and
status of this Agreement and the Transactions to their and their Affiliates
current, future or prospective limited partners and shall be permitted to
disclose the consummation of this Transactions on their websites and otherwise
in the ordinary course of their business after the Closing Date (including,
with respect to ACAS, financial details regarding the Transactions including
proceeds, gains, investment rates of return and multiples, and financial
performance).

 



 

7.8 _Confidentiality_. From and after the Closing Date, the Sellers shall not
and shall cause their directors, officers, employees and Affiliates not to,
directly or indirectly, disclose, reveal, divulge or communicate to any Person
other than authorized officers, directors and employees of Buyer or its
Affiliates, any Confidential Information (as defined below). The Sellers shall
not have any obligation to keep confidential (or cause its officers, directors
or Affiliates to keep confidential) any Confidential Information if and to the
extent disclosure thereof is specifically required by applicable Law;
provided, however, that in the event disclosure is required by applicable Law,
the Sellers shall, to the extent reasonably possible, provide Buyer with
prompt notice in writing of such requirement and shall disclose only that
portion of such information which Sellers are advised by their counsel is
legally required to be

 



      
 

 



 

disclosed, _provided_ that Sellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to obtain an appropriate protective Order or other reasonable assurance that
confidential treatment will be afforded such information. For purposes of this
_Section 7.8_, " ** _Confidential Information_** " shall mean any
confidential information with respect to the Company, including methods of
operation, customer lists, products, prices, fees, costs, technology,
inventions, trade secrets, know-how, software, marketing methods, plans,
personnel, suppliers, competitors, markets or other specialized information or
proprietary matters. "Confidential Information" does not include, and there
shall be no obligation hereunder with respect to, information that (i) is
generally available to the public on the date of this Agreement or (ii)
becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of a
disclosure not otherwise permissible hereunder.

 



 

7.9 _Restrictive Covenants_.

 



 

(a) _Non-Solicitation of Employees_. Each of the Sellers agrees that for a
period of three (3) years from and after the Closing Date, such Seller shall
not, and such Seller shall cause its subsidiaries not to, without the prior
written consent of Buyer, directly or indirectly, solicit to hire (or cause or
seek to cause to leave the employ of Buyer or any of its subsidiaries),
recruit or employ any of Dom Bastien, Donna Halk or Walter McKenna, or induce,
attempt to induce or encourage or assist others to induce or attempt to induce
any of them to terminate his or her employment with the Company, unless such
Person has been terminated or otherwise ceased to be employed by Buyer or its
subsidiary at least three months prior to the commencement of employment
discussions between such Seller (or it applicable subsidiary) and such Person.

 



 

(b) _Non-Competition_. Each of the Sellers agrees that for a period of three
(3) years from and after the Closing Date, such Seller shall not, and such
Seller shall cause its subsidiaries not to, without the prior written consent
of Buyer, directly or indirectly, own, operate, manage, control, engage in,
participate in, permit its name to be used by, act as a consultant or advisor
to, or render services for (alone or in association with any Person), or
otherwise assist any Person that directly or indirectly engages or proposes to
such Seller to engage in (i) the production and distribution of pure maple
syrup products, and (ii) such pure maple syrup products represent more than 5%
of all products produced and distributed by such Person (a "Competing
Business"). Nothing herein shall prohibit any Seller or of its subsidiaries
from (a) owning or acquiring, directly or indirectly, not more than 2% of the
outstanding capital stock of a publicly-traded corporation engaged in a
Competing Business, so long as such Seller has no active participation in the
business of such Competing Business, or (ii) performing any services for the
Company or any of its Affiliates.

 



 

(c) Buyer and Sellers agree and intend that the Sellers obligations under
_Section 7.9(a)_ and _Section 7.9(b)_ shall be tolled during any period that
Sellers are in breach (but not threatened breach unless the Company is harmed
as a result of such threatened breach) of any of the obligations under any
such Section, so that Buyer is provided the full benefit of the restrictive
periods set forth herein.

 



 

(d) If any Seller breaches, or overtly threatens to commit a breach of, any of
the provisions of this _Section 7.9_, Buyer shall have the following rights
and remedies, each of which rights and remedies shall be independent of the
others and severally enforceable, and each

 



       
 

 



 

of which is in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other rights and remedies
available to Buyer under law or in equity:

 



 

(i) The right and remedy to have such provision specifically enforced by any
court having jurisdiction, it being acknowledged and agreed that any such
breach or overtly threatened breach may cause irreparable injury to Buyer and
that money damages will not provide an adequate remedy to Buyer; and

 



 

(ii) The right and remedy to recover from Sellers all monetary damages
suffered by Buyer as the result of any acts or omissions constituting a breach
of this _Section 7.9_, as well as reasonable attorneys fees and costs
incurred by Buyer in enforcing its rights under this _Section 7.9_.

 



 

(e) Sellers agree that the restrictions set forth in this _Section 7.9_ are
reasonable and necessary to protect the business of the Company and that Buyer
would not have entered into this Agreement without the benefit of the
restrictions set forth in this _Section 7.9_. In the event that any covenant
contained in this _Section 7.9_ should ever be adjudicated to exceed the
time, geographic, product or service or other limitations permitted by
applicable Law in any jurisdictions, then any court is expressly empowered to
reform such covenant, and such covenant shall be deemed reformed, in such
jurisdiction to the maximum time, geographic, product or service or other
limitations permitted by applicable Law. The covenants contained in this
_Section 7.9_ and each provision hereof are severable and distinct covenants
and provisions. The invalidity or unenforceability of any such covenant or
provision as written shall not invalidate or render unenforceable the
remaining covenants or provisions hereof, and any such invalidity or
unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render
unenforceable such covenant or provision in any other jurisdiction. Sellers
agree that any claims any Seller may have against Buyer, whether under this
Agreement or otherwise, will not be a defense to enforcement of the
restrictions set forth in this _Section 7.9_.

 



 

7.10 _Section 280G Approval_. The Company shall, no later than three (3) days
prior to the Closing Date, use commercially reasonable efforts (which shall
not require payment of consideration from the Company to any "disqualified
individual" within the meaning of Code Section 280G(c) and the regulations
thereunder) to (a) secure from each Person who is a disqualified individual
and has a right to any payments and/or benefits or potential right to any
payments and/or benefits under any Company Benefit Plan or otherwise that
could reasonably be deemed to constitute "parachute payments" within the
meaning of Code Section 280G (" ** _Section 280G Payments_**") a waiver,
subject to the approval described in clause (b), of such Persons rights to
the portion or all of such Section 280G Payments that exceed 2.99 times such
Persons "base amount" (as defined in Code Section 280G(b)(3)) (such portion,
the " ** _Waived 280G Benefits_** ") and (b) solicit the approval of the
stockholders of the Company, to the extent and in the manner required under
Code Section 280G(b)(5)(B) and the regulations promulgated thereunder, of any
Waived 280G Benefits. Any of the Waived 280G Benefits which fail to be
approved by the stockholders of the Company as contemplated above shall not be
made or provided. Prior to the Closing Date, if the requisite waivers are
obtained, the Company shall deliver to Buyer evidence that a vote of the
Companys stockholders was solicited in accordance with the foregoing
provisions of this _Section 7.10_ and that either (i) the requisite number of
stockholder votes was obtained with respect to the Waived 280G Benefits (the "
** _280G_**

 



      
 

 



 

 ** _Approval_** "), or (ii) that the 280G Approval was not obtained, and, as
a consequence, the Waived 280G Benefits have not been and shall not be made or
provided. At least three (3) days prior to distributing any materials to the
stockholders of the Company or any other Person in connection with its
obligations under this _Section 7.10_ the Company shall provide copies of

faith and not unreasonably omit any of Buyers requested changes or comments
(and Buyer agrees to provide any such comments promptly after its receipt of
such materials).

 



 

7.11 _Return of Confidential Information_. Promptly after the Closing, the
Sellers (or their financial advisor, as applicable) shall request in writing
the return or destruction of all confidential information of the Company and
the Subsidiaries provided to any Person in connection with such other Persons
interest in a possible acquisition of the Company and its Subsidiaries in the
process leading to this Agreement.

warranties related to Buyer set forth in _Article VI_ shall be true and
correct, except where the failure of any such representation or warranty to be

material adverse effect on the ability of Buyer to consummate the Transactions
(except for the representations and warranties of _Section 6.1_
(Organization), _Section 6.2_ (Authorization), _Section 6.5_ (Financial
Advisors) and _Section 6.6_ (Financial Capability) (the " ** _Buyer

limited to a specific date, in which case, as of such specific date), and the

 **ARTICLE IX**

 



 

 **INDEMNIFICATION**

 



 

9.1 _Indemnification of Buyer_.

 



 

(a) _Indemnifiable Breaches_. Subject to the provisions and limitations set
forth in this _Article IX_, the Sellers hereby agree, severally (and with
respect to Seller Representations (defined below) and Seller Breaches (defined
below) solely with respect to such Seller and no other Seller) and not
jointly, to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Buyer, the Company and their
respective officers, directors, agents and representatives (each hereinafter
referred to individually as a " ** _Buyer Indemnified Person_** " and
collectively as " ** _Buyer Indemnified Persons_** "), from and against, any
and all claims, actions, losses, costs, damages, fines, penalties, Liabilities
and expenses incurred or paid, including reasonable outside attorneys fees,
costs of investigation or settlement, out-of-pocket costs and expenses
incurred in connection with commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate
damages, other professionals and experts fees, and court or arbitration
costs (hereinafter collectively referred to as " ** _Damages_** ") (x) arising
out of or resulting from (i) the breach or inaccuracy of any representation or
warranty of the Company contained in this Agreement or any of the other
Transaction Documents (the " ** _Company Representations_** "), (ii) the
breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty by a Seller contained
in this Agreement or any of the other Transaction Documents (the " ** _Seller
Representations_** "), (iii) the breach of any covenant or other agreement set
forth in this Agreement or any of other Transaction Documents that by its
nature is required to be performed by or prior to Closing by the Company or
the Subsidiaries (the " ** _Company Breaches_** "), or (iv) the breach of any
covenant or other agreement set forth in this Agreement or any of the other
Transaction Documents that is required to be performed by a Seller (the " **
_Seller Breaches_** ") or (y) relating to Pre-Closing Taxes.

 



 

(b) _Basket_. The indemnification provided for in _Sections 9.1(a)(x)(i)_
through _(iv)_ shall not apply and no Seller shall have any obligations or
Liability (whether in contract, tort or otherwise) (i) unless and until the
Damages in respect of any individual claim or series of related claims exceeds
$25,000 (the " ** _Mini-Deductible_** "), and (ii) unless and until the
aggregate

 



      
 

 



 

Damages exceeds a cumulative aggregate amount equal to $1,000,000 (the " **
_Deductible_** "), in which event the Buyer Indemnified Persons shall, subject
to the other limitations herein, be indemnified for only such Damages in
excess of the Deductible; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Deductible shall
not apply to breaches of Fundamental Representations, breaches of the
representations and warranties contained in _Section 4.8_ (Taxes), breaches
of Seller Post-Closing Covenants or fraud; _provided further_ that the Mini-
Deductible shall not apply to fraud.

 



 

(c) _Cap_. The aggregate Liability of the Sellers pursuant to this _Section
9.1_ or that may be based upon, in respect of, arise under, or by reason of,
be connected with, or relate in any manner to this Agreement or the
Transactions (whether in contract, tort or otherwise) shall be limited to an
aggregate amount equal to $7,500,000 (the " ** _Cap_** "); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the aggregate Liability of Sellers for fraud, breaches of
Seller Post-Closing Covenants, breaches of Fundamental Representations, Pre-
Closing Taxes, and breaches of the representations and warranties set forth in
_Section 4.8_ shall not be limited to the Cap and shall instead be limited to
an aggregate amount equal to the Purchase Price. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, no Seller shall be liable to any Buyer Indemnitee for any Damages
incurred by such Buyer Indemnitee pursuant to _Sections 9.1(a)(x)(ii)_ or
(iv) if such Damage was not due to a breach by that Seller (either acting
alone or in concert with other Sellers, including through the Seller
Representative). Buyer Indemnified Persons shall not make any claim for
indemnification under this _Article IX_ in respect of any matter to the
extent the amount claimed for such matter has already been reduced from the
Purchase Price paid by the Buyer pursuant to _Article III_. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, in no event shall the Liability of
any Seller hereunder exceed an aggregate amount equal to such Sellers Pro
Rata Percentage of the Purchase Price.

 



 

(d) _Indemnification Net of Other Recoveries_. The amount to which a Buyer
Indemnified Person may become entitled under this _Article IX_ shall be net
of any Tax Benefit actually realized prior to the end of the third year
following the year in which the Damages were incurred in connection with such
claim or recovery (whether by way of payment, discount, credit, off-set,
counterclaim or otherwise) received from a third party (including any insurer)
with respect to such claim, less any cost associated with receiving such
recovery in respect of a claim. For this purpose, a Tax Benefit will be
treated as "actually realized" only to the extent that a liability for Tax
would have been greater had such Damages not occurred, and by treating any
item of loss or deduction with respect to such Damages as the last item of
loss or deduction available in the applicable Tax year.

 



 

(e) _Recovery Under Insurance or Warranties_. To the extent that insurance,
"pass-through" warranty coverage from a manufacturer or other form of recovery
or reimbursement from a third party is available to any Buyer Indemnified
Person to cover any item for which indemnification may be sought hereunder,
Buyer shall, or shall cause the Buyer Indemnified Person to, on a timely and
expeditious basis, use commercially reasonable efforts to effect recovery
under applicable insurance policies and warranties and otherwise use
commercially reasonable efforts to pursue to conclusion available remedies or
causes of action to recover the amount of its claim as may be available from
such other party; _provided_ the availability of a potential recovery against
such a third party shall not affect Buyers right to make a claim pursuant to
this _Section 9.1_.

 



      
 

 



 

(f) _Access to Records_. The Seller Representative shall have the right
(during regular business hours, upon reasonable advance notice, under
reasonable circumstances, subject to restrictions under applicable Law and
without undue disruption to the normal business activities of Buyer or the
Company) to inspect the assets and properties of Buyer and the Company and to
inspect and make abstracts and reproductions of all books, records, contracts
and correspondence of Buyer and the Company relating to any such claims, and
to access the officers, employees, accountants and other representatives of
the Company. Buyer shall, and shall cause the Company to furnish the Seller
Representative with such information respecting the assets, personnel,
business and financial records of Buyer and the Company relating to any such
claims as the Seller Representative may, from time to time, reasonably request
and at the sole cost and expense of the Seller Representative.

 



 

(g) _Mitigation of Damages_. Each Buyer Indemnified Person shall be
responsible for taking or causing to be taken all commercially reasonable
steps to mitigate its Damages upon and after becoming aware of any event that
could reasonably be expected to give rise to Damages that may be indemnifiable
under this _Article IX_.

 



 

(h) _Determination of Amount of Damages_. For purposes of (i) determining
whether or not a breach of a representation or warranty in any Transaction
Document has occurred or (ii) calculating the amount of Damages incurred out
of or relating to any breach of a representation or warranty in any
Transaction Document, the references to "Material Adverse Effect," "material,"
"in all material respects" or other materiality qualifications (or correlative
terms), including as expressed in accounting concepts, shall be disregarded.

 



 

(i) _Certain Post-Closing Taxes_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, Buyer shall not have any right to indemnification under _Section
9.1(a)(i)_ for any Damages with respect to a breach of the representation
under _Section 4.8(k)_ to the extent such Damages are for Taxes in a taxable
period (or portion thereof) beginning after the Closing Date.

 



 

9.2 _Notice of Indemnification Claim_.

 



 

(a) _Notice Requirements_. As used herein, the term " ** _Indemnification
Claim_** " shall mean a claim for indemnification by Buyer or any other Buyer
Indemnified Person or any Seller Indemnified Person, as the case may be, for
Damages related to or arising out of this Agreement or the Transactions (such
Person making an Indemnification Claim, an " ** _Indemnified Party_** "). A
claim (i) for indemnification for any matter not involving a third-party
claim, or (ii) related to any Legal Proceeding, arbitration, investigation,
inquiry or proceeding instituted, or any claim asserted by any third party in
respect of which payment may be sought under _Sections 9.1_ and _9.5_ , hereof
(regardless of the limitations set forth in _Sections 9.1_ or _9.5_ , whether
orally or in writing, against any Indemnified Party (in each such case, a " **
_Third-Party Claim_** "), may be asserted by written notice (a " ** _Notice of
Claim_** ") to (A) the Seller Representative, in respect of a claim for which
indemnification is sought under _Section 9.1(a)(x)(i)_, _Section
9.1(a)(x)(iii)_ or _Section 9.1(a)(y)_, (B) the applicable Seller, in respect
of a claim for which indemnification is sought under _Section 9.1(a)(x)(ii)_
or _Section 9.1(a)(x)(iv)_, and (C) Buyer, in respect of a claim for which
indemnification is sought under _Section 9.5_, as applicable (such receiving
party, the " ** _Indemnifying Party_** "), promptly after such Indemnified
Party becomes aware of the existence

 



      
 

 



 

of any potential claim by such Indemnified Party for indemnification under
this _Article IX_, but in any event before the Expiration Date.

 



 

(b) _Effect of Delay_. So long as such Notice of Claim is given on or prior to
the Expiration Date, no delay on the part of an Indemnified Party in giving
the Indemnifying Party a Notice of Claim shall limit or reduce the Indemnified
Partys right to indemnity hereunder, nor relieve the Indemnifying Party from
any of its obligations under this _Article IX_, unless (and then only to the
extent that) the Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced thereby.

 



 

9.3 _Defense of Third-Party Claims_.

 



 

(a) _Right to Defend_. Subject to the provisions hereof, the Indemnifying
Party shall be entitled to elect to control the defense of any Third-Party
Claim utilizing legal counsel of its choice, at its expense, so long as (i)
the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party in writing within thirty
(30) days after the Indemnified Party has given notice of the Third-Party
Claim that the Indemnifying Party will indemnify the Indemnified Party from
and against any Damages the Indemnified Party may suffer resulting from,
arising out of, relating to, in the nature of, or caused by the Third-Party
Claim to the full extent required hereunder (subject to the limitations set
forth in _Section 9.1_) and with no reservation of rights, (ii) the Third
Party Claim (A) involves money damages in an amount that would not reasonably
be expected to result in Damages in excess of the portion of the Escrow Amount
that remains in escrow (taking into account any other then pending
Indemnification Claims that may impact the Escrow Amount) on the date that the
Indemnifying Party provides notice to the Indemnified Party of its election to
control the defense of the Third-Party Claim and (B) does not seek an
injunction or other equitable relief against the Company or its Affiliates,
(iii) the Third-Party Claim does not relate to or arise in connection with any
criminal proceeding, action, indictment, allegation or investigation, and (iv)
the Third-Party Claim has not been asserted directly by or on behalf of a
Person that is a material supplier or customer of the Indemnified Party (the "
** _Litigation Conditions_** "). The Indemnifying Party shall (a) forfeit the
right to control and appoint lead counsel for such defense of any Third-Party
Claim if, at any time after assuming the defense thereof, the Litigation
Conditions are no longer satisfied. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to participate in any such defense with
separate counsel at the expense of the Indemnifying Party if: (i) so requested
by the Indemnifying Party to participate; or (ii) in the reasonable opinion of
counsel to the Indemnified Party, an actual conflict exists between the
Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party that would make such separate
representation advisable or there is available one or more legal defenses to
the Indemnified Party which are not available to the Indemnifying Party;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnifying Party shall only be required to
pay for one such counsel for all Indemnified Parties in connection with any
Third-Party Claim (plus one local counsel in each jurisdiction for which such
counsel is necessary in the reasonable opinion of the primary counsel to the
Indemnified Party); and _provided_ , _further_ that an Indemnified Party may
engage more than one such counsel at its own expense.

 



 

(b) _Access to Information_. If the Indemnifying Party has the right to and
does elect to control the defense of any Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying
Party shall: (i) conduct the defense of such Third-Party Claim actively and
diligently and keep the Indemnified Party fully informed of material
developments in the Third-Party Claim at all stages thereof; (ii)

 



      
 

 



 

promptly submit to the Indemnified Party copies of all pleadings, responsive
pleadings, motions and other similar legal documents and papers received or
filed in connection therewith; (iii) permit the Indemnified Party and its
counsel to confer on the conduct of the defense thereof; and (iv) permit the
Indemnified Party and its counsel an opportunity to review all legal papers to
be submitted prior to their submission. Subject to the prior receipt of a
confidentiality agreement reasonably acceptable to Buyer, Buyer shall make
available to the Sellers and their counsel and accountants, without charge,
during regular business hours, upon reasonable advance notice, under
reasonable circumstances, subject to restrictions under applicable Law and
without undue disruption to the normal business activities of Buyer or the
Company, all of its or their books and records relating to the Third-Party
Claim, and each party shall render to the other party such assistance as may
be reasonably required in order to ensure the proper and adequate defense
thereof and shall furnish such records, information and testimony and attend
such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials and appeals as may
be reasonably requested by the other party in connection therewith. Any third
party costs or expenses of the Indemnified Party in providing such cooperation
shall be included as Damages hereunder.

 



 

(c) _Settlement Rights_. If the Indemnifying Party has the right to and does
elect to defend any Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall have the
right to enter into any settlement of such Third-Party Claim without the
consent of the Indemnified Party, provided that the Indemnifying Party must
obtain the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party before consenting to
the entry of any judgment or entering into any settlement of such Third-Party
Claim if the judgment or settlement does not release the Indemnified Party
from all liabilities and obligations in excess of the Deductible with respect
to such Third-Party Claim or the judgment or settlement imposes injunctive or
other equitable relief against the Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Party
shall obtain the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party (which shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) before admitting any liability with
respect to, or entering into any settlement of, any Third-Party Claim, unless
the Indemnified Party waives its rights to indemnification hereunder with
respect to such Third-Party Claim. If any settlement offer solely for money
damages is made by the applicable third party claimant and the Indemnifying
Party notifies the Indemnified Party in writing of the Indemnifying Partys
willingness to accept the settlement offer and, subject to the applicable
limitations of _Sections 9.1(b)_ \- _(e)_ , pay the amount called for by such
offer, and the Indemnified Party declines to accept such offer, the
Indemnified Party may continue to contest such Third-Party Claim, free of any
participation by the Indemnifying Party, and the amount of any ultimate
liability with respect to such Third-Party Claim that the Indemnifying Party
has an obligation to pay hereunder shall be limited to the lesser of: (x) the
amount of the settlement offer that the Indemnified Party declined to accept
plus the Damages of the Indemnified Party relating to such Third-Party Claim
through the date of its rejection of the settlement offer; or (y) the
aggregate Damages of the Indemnified Party with respect to such Third-Party
Claim.

 



 

9.4 _Contents of Notice of Claim_. Each Notice of Claim by an Indemnified
Party given pursuant to _Section 9.2_ shall contain the following information
or statements:

 



 

(a) that the Indemnified Party has incurred or paid or, in good faith,
believes it shall have to incur or pay, Damages in an aggregate stated amount
(where practicable) arising from such Indemnification Claim (which amount may
be the amount of damages claimed by a

 



      
 

 



 

third party in an action brought against any Indemnified Party based on
alleged facts, which if true, would give rise to liability for Damages to such
Indemnified Party under this _Article IX_);

 



 

(b) a brief description, in reasonable detail (to the extent reasonably
available to Indemnified Party), of the facts, circumstances or events giving
rise to the alleged Damages based on Indemnified Partys good faith belief
thereof, including the identity and address of any third-party claimant (to
the extent reasonably available to Indemnified Party); and

 



 

(c) copies of any demand or complaint, the amount of Damages, the date each
such item was incurred or paid, or the basis for such anticipated liability,
and the specific nature of the breach to which such item is related.

 



 

9.5 _Indemnification by Buyer_.

 



 

(a) Subject to the provisions and limitation set forth in this _Article IX_,
Buyer hereby agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Sellers and

resulting from the breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement made by Buyer in the Transaction Documents.

 



 

(b) _Basket_. The indemnification provided for in _Section 9.5(a)_ shall not

Deductible, and (ii) unless and until the aggregate Damages owed to the Seller
Indemnified Persons exceed the Deductible, in which event the Seller
Indemnified Persons shall, subject to the other limitations herein, be
indemnified for only such Damages in excess of the Deductible; provided,
however, that the Deductible shall not apply to breaches of Buyer Fundamental
Representations, Buyer Post-Closing Covenants or fraud.

 



 

(c) _Cap_. The aggregate liability of the Buyer pursuant to this _Section 9.5
_shall be limited to the Cap; _provided_ , _however_ that the aggregate

Post-Closing Covenants and fraud shall not be limited to the Cap and shall
instead be limited to an aggregate amount equal to the Purchase Price.

 



 

(d) _Mitigation of Damages_. Each Seller Indemnified Person shall be
responsible for taking or causing to be taken all commercially reasonable
steps to mitigate its Damages upon and after becoming aware of any event that
could reasonably be expected to give rise to Damages that may be indemnifiable
under this _Article IX_.

 



 

9.6 _Survival of Covenants, Representations and Warranties_. All
representations and warranties of the Company or the Sellers in this Agreement
and the other Transaction Documents, shall remain operative and in full force
and effect only until the fifteen (15) month anniversary of the Closing Date

survive until the applicable statute of limitations (giving effect to any
waiver, mitigation or extension thereof) plus 60 days,

 



       
 

 



 

and (ii) any obligations under _Section 9.1_ shall not terminate with respect
to any Damages as to which the Buyer Indemnified Person to be indemnified
shall have given a valid Notice of Claim (stating in reasonable detail the
basis of the claim for indemnification) to the Seller Representative in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement prior to the Expiration Date. All
representations and warranties related to Buyer contained in this Agreement
and the other Transaction Documents shall remain operative and in full force
and effect, until the Expiration Date; provided, that the Buyer Fundamental
Representations and any claims based on fraud shall survive indefinitely. All
covenants of the parties that by their nature are required to be performed by
or prior to Closing by the Company or the Sellers shall expire and will no
longer be required to be performed as of the Closing Date; provided that Buyer
may make a claim with respect to such covenants pursuant to _Section 9.1(a)_
until the Expiration Date. All covenants that by their nature are required to
be performed after Closing by any party hereto shall survive according to
their respective terms.

 



 

9.7 _Escrow_.

 



 

(a) _Deposit of Escrow Amount_. On the Closing Date, Buyer shall, on behalf of
the Sellers, pay to PNC Bank, National Association, as agent to Buyer and the

the Escrow Agreement.

 



 

(b) _Priority of Payment from Escrow_. Any Damages as a result of any breach
of representations and warranties (other than Fundamental Representations, the

Sellers are obligated to pay to Buyer or to any Buyer Indemnified Person
hereunder shall be paid solely by release of funds to the Company, or if
applicable, any other of the Buyer Indemnified Persons, from the Escrow Amount
by the Escrow Agent. Any other Damages payable by any Seller hereunder shall
first be paid from the Escrow Amount by the Escrow Agent and, thereafter,
directly from the applicable Sellers, other than Damages relating to Pre-
Closing Taxes.

 



 

(c) _Payment from Escrow Amount_. All sums shall be paid within five Business
Days after the date notice of such sums due and owing is given to the Sellers
(with a copy to the Escrow Agent pursuant to the Escrow Agreement) by Buyer or
the Buyer Indemnified Person, as applicable, and shall accordingly reduce the
Escrow Amount.

 



 

(d) _Release of Escrow_. Within three (3) Business Days following the
Expiration Date, Buyer and the Sellers shall direct the Escrow Agent to

amount of all unsatisfied or disputed claims for Damages specified in Notices
of Claim delivered to the Sellers before the Expiration Date and (ii) any
liability for payroll Taxes incurred upon distributions of the Escrow Amount

this _Article IX_ and the terms of the Escrow Agreement. Any Escrow Amount

DOCUMENTS OR UNDER ANY OTHER LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY WHATSOEVER (OTHER THAN
(I) A CLAIM FOR PAYMENT DUE PURSUANT TO _SECTION 3.4(I)_, OR (II) FRAUD),
SHALL BE A CLAIM FOR INDEMNIFICATION IN THE MANNER SET FORTH HEREIN.
NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, NOTHING IN THIS _SECTION 9.8(A)_ SHALL LIMIT
ANY PERSONS RIGHT TO SEEK AND OBTAIN ANY EQUITABLE RELIEF TO WHICH SUCH
PERSON SHALL BE ENTITLED PURSUANT HERETO.

 



 

(b) _Exception for Fraud_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, the Sellers shall be responsible for, and hold the Buyer Indemnified
Persons harmless from and against, on a several, and not joint, basis in
accordance with each such Sellers Pro Rata Percentage ( _provided_ , that in
no event shall the Liability of any Seller hereunder exceed an aggregate
amount equal to such Sellers Pro Rata Percentage of the Purchase Price), any
and all Damages sustained or incurred by any Buyer Indemnified Person relating
to, arising out of or resulting from the fraud of the Company under the
express provisions of the Transaction Documents.

 



 

(c) _Bargained for Provisions_. The provisions of _Article IX_ were
specifically bargained for and reflected in the amounts payable to the Sellers
in connection with the Closing pursuant to _Article II_.

 



 

9.9 _Exclusion of Punitive Damages_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
elsewhere in this Agreement, no party shall, in any event, be liable to any
other Person on account of any indemnity obligation set forth in _Sections
9.1_ or _9.5_ for any punitive damages or any damages that are not reasonably
foreseeable, unless such Damages are paid pursuant to a Third-Party Claim or a
penalty or assessment by a Governmental Body (provided that such limitation
shall not limit the Sellers right to recover Contract damages in connection
with Buyers failure to close the Transaction in violation of this Agreement).

 



 

9.10 _Effect of Investigation_. The representations, warranties, agreements
and covenants of the Indemnifying Party, and the Indemnified Partys right to
indemnification, payment, reimbursement or other remedy with respect thereto,
shall not be affected or deemed waived by reason of any investigation made by
or on behalf of the Indemnified Party (including by any of its
representatives) or by reason of the fact that the Indemnified Party or any of
its representatives knew or should have known at any time, whether before or
after the execution

 



      
 

 



 

and delivery of the Prior Agreement or the Closing Date, that any such
representation, warranty, agreement or covenant is, was or might be inaccurate
or with respect to which there is, was or might be non-compliance.

 



 

9.11 _No Contribution_. After the Closing Date, each Seller waives, and
acknowledges and agrees that such Seller shall not have and shall not exercise
or assert (or attempt or exercise or assert), any right of contribution, right
of indemnity or other right or remedy against the Company. including without
limitation pursuant to any indemnification agreement or arrangement in
accordance with _Section 7.6_ hereof, in connection with any indemnification
obligation to which it may become subject under this _Article IX_, _provided_
, _however_ , that Sellers shall remain entitled to seek recovery under the
"run-off" or "tail" policy to be purchased pursuant to _Section 7.6(c)_
hereof.

 



 

9.12 _Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments_. To the extent permitted by Law,
the Sellers and Buyer agree to treat any indemnity payment made pursuant to
this _Article IX_ as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for federal, state,
local and foreign Tax purposes.

10.1 _Termination of Agreement_. This Agreement may be terminated prior to the
Closing as follows:

 



 

(a) _Termination Date_. If the Closing shall not have occurred by the close of
business on the date which is 180 days after the date of the Prior Agreement
(subject to the last proviso of this _Section 10.1_, the " ** _Termination
Date_** "), this Agreement may be terminated at the election of the Seller
Representative or Buyer on or after the Termination Date; _provided_ , that:

 



 

(i) _No Breach_ : the terminating party is not in breach in any material
respect of any of its obligations hereunder;

 



 

(ii) _Satisfaction of Closing Conditions_ : if all of the conditions set forth
in _Section 8.1_ have been satisfied as of the Termination Date (other than
those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied by actions taken at
the Closing), then Buyer shall not be permitted to terminate the Agreement
pursuant to this _Section 10.1(a)_;

 



 

(iii) _Exercise of Specific Performance_ : if the Seller Representative has
taken steps to exercise its right to seek specific performance pursuant to
_Section 11.13_, Buyer shall have no right to terminate this Agreement

conclusion of such proceeding, inclusive of any appeals thereto; and

 



 

(b) _Mutual Written Consent_. By mutual written consent of the Seller
Representative and Buyer;

 



 

(c) _Material Breach_. By either the Seller Representative or Buyer if there
shall have been a breach by another party of any of its representations,
warranties, covenants or

 



      
 

 



 

obligations contained in this Agreement, which breach would result in the
failure to satisfy one or more of the conditions set forth in _Section
8.1(a)_ (in the case of a breach by the Company or the Sellers), or _Section
8.2(a)_ (in the case of a breach by Buyer), and in any such case such breach
shall be incapable of being cured or, if capable of being cured, shall not
have been cured prior to the Termination Date, _provided_ , that the
terminating party may not be in breach in any material respect of any of its
obligations hereunder; or

competent jurisdiction restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the
consummation of the Transactions; it being agreed that subject to _Section

determination which is not nonappealable (and pursue such appeal with
reasonable diligence); _provided_ , _however_ , that the right to terminate
this Agreement under this _Section 10.1(d)_ shall not be available to a party
if such Order was primarily due to the failure of such party to perform any of
its obligations under this Agreement.

by Buyer or the Seller Representative pursuant to _Section 10.1_ hereof,
written notice thereof shall forthwith be given to the other party or parties,

such termination shall relieve a party hereto for Liability for (i) fraud or
(ii) willful breaches of any of the representations, warranties, covenants or
other agreements contained in this Agreement or any of the other Transaction
Documents, in each case occurring prior to such termination; and _provided_ ,
_further_ , that the obligations of the parties set forth in _Section 7.7_,
_Article IX_, this _Section 10.3_ and _Section 11.2_ hereof and in the
Confidentiality Agreement shall survive any such termination and shall be
enforceable hereunder or thereunder, as the case may be.

nature whatsoever, applicable to, or resulting from, the Transactions shall be
borne by Buyer and Sellers equally.

 



 

(b) _Cooperation_. The Seller Representative, the Company and Buyer shall
reasonably cooperate, and shall cause their respective Affiliates, officers,
employees, agents and

 



      
 

 



 

auditors reasonably to cooperate, in: (i) preparing and filing all Tax Returns
of the Company and the Subsidiaries, including maintaining and making
available to each other all records necessary in connection with Taxes; (ii)
resolving all disputes and audits with respect to all taxable periods relating
to Taxes; and (iii) providing timely notice to each other in writing of any
pending or threatened Tax audits or assessments for all taxable periods for
which the other may have a liability under this Agreement.

 



 

(c) _Tax Filings_.

 



 

(i) Buyer shall not file any amended Tax Returns of the Company and the
Subsidiaries for any Tax Period beginning prior to the Closing Date, unless,
and then only to the extent, required (a) by applicable Law, (b) to obtain a
refund of Taxes as a result of the Companys net operating losses that are
attributable to the Tax Period ending with the Closing Date or that are
attributable to the items listed in the definition of Transaction Tax Benefit
or (c) in connection with the resolution of a Tax Contest in accordance with
_Section 11.1(d)_. The Company will furnish any amended Tax Return that Buyer
is entitled to file pursuant to this _Section 11.1(c)(i)_ to the Seller
Representative for its review and approval (which approval will not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed) at least thirty (30) days prior to the due
date for filing such Tax Returns, _provided_ , _however_ , that the Seller
Representatives review of Tax Returns described in clause (b) of this
_Section 11.1(c)(i)_ shall be limited to changes not related to the net
operating losses described in clause (b) of this _Section 11.1(c)(i)_ and
will consider in good faith all reasonable comments of the Seller
Representative with respect to each such Tax Return.

 



 

(ii) The Sellers shall cause the Company to prepare all Tax Returns of the
Company due on or before the Closing Date. The Seller Representative will
furnish such Tax Returns to the Buyer for its review and approval (which
approval will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) at least thirty (30)
days prior to the due date for filing such Tax Returns and will consider in
good faith all reasonable comments of the Buyer with respect to each such Tax
Return. Such Tax Returns shall be prepared in accordance with existing
procedures and practices and accounting methods of the Company as in effect on
the date of the Prior Agreement, and the Parties will cooperate on the filing
of such Tax Returns.

 



 

(iii) The Company will prepare and timely file other all Tax Returns required
of the Company. For Tax Returns for periods ending on or before the Closing
Date, the Company will furnish such Tax Returns to the Seller Representative
for its review and approval (which approval will not be unreasonably withheld
or delayed) at least thirty (30) days prior to the due date for filing such
Tax Returns and will consider in good faith all reasonable comments of the
Seller Representative with respect to each such Tax Return.

 



 

(iv) The Company will furnish Tax Returns for any Straddle Period to the
Seller Representative for its review and approval (which approval will not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed) at least thirty (30) days prior to the due
date for filing such Tax Returns. The Company shall consider in good faith all
reasonable comments of

 



      
 

 



 

the Seller Representative with respect to each such Tax Return. Any Taxes with
respect to any Straddle Period, shall be allocated (a) to the Sellers for the
period up to and including the close of business on the Closing Date, and (b)
to Buyer for the period beginning after the close of business on the Closing
Date, determined in the following manner:

 



 

(A) in the case of income Taxes or any other Taxes resulting from, or imposed
on, sales, receipts, uses, transfers or assignments of property or other
assets, payments or accruals to other persons (including wages), or any other
similar transaction or transactions, the amount that would be payable for the
portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date if the Company filed
a separate Tax Return with respect to such Taxes solely for the portion of the
Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date; and

 



 

(B) in the case of all other Taxes, an amount equal to the amount of Taxes for
the entire Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is
the number of calendar days in the portion of the period ending on the Closing
Date and the denominator of which is the number of calendar days in the entire
Straddle Period.

 



 

For purposes of clause (A) above, any item determined on an annual or periodic
basis (including amortization and depreciation deductions and the effects of
graduated rates) shall be allocated to the portion of the Straddle Period
ending on the Closing Date based on the relative number of days in such
portion of the Straddle Period as compared to the number of days in the entire
Straddle Period.

 



 

(v) In the event that any dispute arises in connection with the preparation
and filing of Tax Returns pursuant to this _Section 11.1(c)_, Buyer and
Seller Representative shall attempt in good faith to resolve any disagreements
regarding such Tax Returns prior to the due date for filing such Tax Return.
In the event that Buyer and the Seller Representative are unable to resolve
any dispute with respect to such Tax Return at least ten (10) days prior to
the due date for filing such Tax Return, such dispute shall be resolved by the
Independent Accountant. The fees and expenses of the Independent Accountant
shall be borne equally by the Seller Representative, on the one hand, and
Buyer, on the other. If any dispute with respect to a Tax Return is not
resolved prior to the due date of such Tax Return, such Tax Return shall be
filed in the manner which the Party responsible for preparing such Tax Return
deems correct without prejudice to the other Partys rights hereunder.

 



 

(d) _Tax Claims and Tax Contests_. If any Taxing Authority issues to the
Company or any of the Subsidiaries (i) written notice of its intent to audit,
examine or conduct another proceeding with respect to Taxes or Tax Returns of
the Company or any of the Subsidiaries or (ii) a notice of deficiency, a
notice of reassessment, a proposed adjustment, assertion of claim or demand
concerning Taxes or Tax Returns of the Company, in each case, for which the
Sellers may reasonably be expected to be liable under _Section 9.1(a)_
(collectively, a " ** _Tax Claim_** "), the Buyer shall notify the Seller
Representative of receipt of such notice; _provided_ , _however_ , that if
such Tax Claim relates to a Straddle Period, Buyer will only have such
obligation if the Sellers are reasonably expected to be liable for a material
amount of Tax relating to such Straddle Period. The Seller Representative
shall have the right to participate in, at its

 



      
 

 



 

own cost and expense, in-person meetings with a Tax authority and comment on
significant written submissions to a Tax authority other than transmission of
existing Company records related to any audit, litigation, proceeding or
contest of any Tax Claim relating to Taxes and Tax Returns for Tax periods
ending on or before the Closing Date (a " ** _Tax Contest_** ") provided, that
the Buyer shall not settle any Tax Contest without the Seller Representatives
prior written consent (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed).

 



 

11.2 _Expenses_. Except as provided in _Section 11.13_ hereof, upon the
termination of this Agreement for any reason, each party to this Agreement
shall bear its respective fees, costs and expenses incurred in connection with
the preparation, negotiation, execution and performance of this Agreement or
the Transactions (including legal, accounting and other professional fees).

off" or "tail" policy purchased by the Sellers pursuant to _Section 7.6(c)_,

to any financing transactions entered into by Buyer in connection with
Closing.

his sole discretion relating to the subject matter of this Agreement as fully
and completely as such Seller could do if personally present.

 



 

(b) The Seller Representative will not be liable to any Seller for any act
taken or omitted by it as permitted under this Agreement, except if such act
is taken or omitted in bad faith or by willful misconduct. The Seller
Representative will also be fully protected as against each Seller in relying

believes to be genuine (including facsimiles thereof).

 



 

(c) The Sellers agree, severally but not jointly, to indemnify the Seller
Representative for, and to hold the Seller Representative harmless against,
any loss, Liability or expense incurred without willful misconduct or bad

Representative under this Agreement shall survive the Closing and/or

(g) If American Capital Ltd. becomes unable to serve as the Seller
Representative, such other Person or Persons as may be designated by the
Sellers receiving a majority of the proceeds of the Purchase Price received by
all Sellers, shall succeed as the Seller Representative. The Sellers or such
successor shall provide prompt written notice thereof to Buyer. Until such
notice is received by Buyer, the Buyer will be entitled to rely on the actions
of the previous Seller Representative. Any such replacement or successor shall
become the "Seller Representative" for purposes of this Agreement. If for any
reason there is no Seller Representative at any time, all references herein to
the Seller Representative shall be deemed to refer to the Sellers.

 



 

(a) The power of attorney granted by the Sellers in this _Section 11.3_ (i)
is coupled with an interest and is irrevocable; (ii) may be delegated by the
Seller Representative; and (iii) shall survive the death, incapacity,

11.4 _Submission to Jurisdiction; Consent to Service of Process; Waiver of
Jury_.

 



 

(a) _Jurisdiction and Venue_. The parties hereto hereby irrevocably submit to
exclusive jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the Southern

dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any of the
Transactions and each party hereby irrevocably agrees that all claims in
respect of such dispute or any suit, action proceeding related thereto may be
heard and determined in such courts. The parties hereby irrevocably waive, to
the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any objection which they may
now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any such dispute brought in

dispute. Each of the parties hereto agrees that a judgment in any such dispute
may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other
manner provided by law.

 



 

(b) _Service of Process_. Each of the parties hereto hereby consents to

FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY
JURY WITH RESPECT TO ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF,
UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS. EACH OF THE
PARTIES HERETO HEREBY (I) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY
OF THE OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER

changed, and any provision hereof can be waived, only by written instrument
making specific reference to this Agreement signed by the party against whom
enforcement of any such amendment, supplement, modification or waiver is
sought. No action taken pursuant to this Agreement, including any
investigation by or on behalf of any party, shall be deemed to constitute a
waiver by the party taking such action of compliance with any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement contained herein. The waiver by any party
hereto of a breach of any provision of this Agreement shall not operate or be
construed as a further or continuing waiver of such breach or as a waiver of
any other or subsequent breach. No failure on the part of any party to
exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right, power or remedy hereunder
shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of
such right, power or remedy by such party preclude any other or further
exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or remedy.

to this Agreement or the negotiation, execution or performance of this
Agreement or the Transactions (including any claim or cause or action cased
upon, arising out of, or related to any representation or warranty made in or

other than the State of Delaware.

11.9 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced by any law or public policy,
all other terms or provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in
full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the
Transactions is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party.
Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal,
or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good
faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the
parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the
Transactions are consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent
possible. If it is ever held that any restriction hereunder is too broad to
permit enforcement of such restriction to its fullest extent, each party
agrees that a court of competent jurisdiction may enforce such restriction to
the maximum extent permitted by Law, and each party hereby consents and agrees
that such scope may be judicially modified accordingly in any proceeding
brought to enforce such restriction.

 



 

11.10 _Binding Effect; Assignment_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective successors and
permitted assigns. Except as expressly provided herein, this Agreement is for
the sole benefit of the parties and their permitted successors and assigns and
nothing herein expressed or implied shall give or be construed to give any
Person, other than the parties and such permitted successors and assigns, any
legal or equitable rights hereunder; _provided_ , _however_ , that the parties
hereto specifically acknowledge and agree that: (i) the provisions of _Section
7.6_ hereof are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable
by, all entities affected thereby; and (ii) the provisions of _Section 11.12_
hereof are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by,
each current or former director, manager, officer, employee, incorporator,
member, partner, shareholder, Affiliate, agent, attorney or representative of
any of the Sellers or the Company. No assignment of this Agreement or of any
rights or obligations hereunder may be made by any party hereto, directly or
indirectly (by operation of law or otherwise), without the prior written
consent of the other parties hereto and any attempted assignment without the
required consents shall be void, except that (a) Buyer may assign its right to
purchase the Purchased Shares hereunder in whole or in part to Buyers parent
or any of its direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiaries, and (b) Buyer may
assign its rights and obligations under this Agreement in whole or in part
through a collateral assignment to any lender providing financing in
connection with this Agreement and the Transactions, in each case, without the
prior written consent of the Sellers. No assignment of any obligations
hereunder shall relieve the parties hereto of any such obligations.

 



 

11.11 _No Strict Construction_. The language used in this Agreement shall be
deemed to be the language chosen by the parties hereto to express their mutual
intent, and no rule

 



      
 

 



 

of strict construction shall be applied against any Person. The parties hereto
each hereby acknowledge that this Agreement embodies the justifiable
expectations of sophisticated parties derived from arms length negotiations;
all parties to this Agreement specifically acknowledge that no party has any
special relationship with another party that would justify any expectation
beyond that of an ordinary purchaser and an ordinary seller in an arms length
transaction.

 



 

11.12 _Non-Recourse._

 



 

(a) _All Claims Made Against Contracting Parties_. All claims, obligations,
liabilities or causes of action (whether in contract or in tort, in law or in
equity, or granted by statute) that may be based upon, in respect of, arise
under, out or by reason of, be connected with, or relate in any manner to this
Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement
(including any representation or warranty made in, in connection with, or as
an inducement to, this Agreement) may be made only against (and are those
solely of) the entities that are expressly identified as parties to this
Agreement in the Preamble to this Agreement (the " ** _Contracting Parties_**
").

 



 

(b) _No Liability of Non-Party Affiliates_. No Person who is not a Contracting
Party, including without limitation, any current or former director, manager,
officer, employee, incorporator, member, partner, manager, stockholder,
affiliate, agent, attorney or representative of, or any financial advisor or
lender to, any Contracting Party or any current or former director, manager,
officer, employee, incorporator, member, partner, manager, stockholder,
affiliate, agent, attorney or representative of, or any financial advisor or
lender to any of the foregoing (" ** _Non-Party Affiliates_** ") shall have
any liabilities (whether in contract or in tort, in law or in equity, or
granted by statute) for any claims, causes of action, obligations or
liabilities arising under, out of, in connection with or related in any manner
to this Agreement or based on, in respect of or by reason of this Agreement or
its negotiation, execution, performance or breach, including through or by
attempted piercing of the corporate, limited liability company or limited
partnership veil or otherwise.

 



 

(c) _Release of Claims Against Non-Party Affiliates_. To the maximum extent
permitted by Law, each Contracting Party hereby waives and releases all such
liabilities, claims, causes of action and obligations against any such Non-
Party Affiliates.

 



 

(d) _Third Party Beneficiaries_. The Non-Party Affiliates are express third
party beneficiaries of this _Section 11.12_, are entitled to rely upon this
_Section 11.12_ and may specifically enforce the provisions of this _Section
11.12_.

 



 

11.13 _Specific Enforcement_.

 



 

(a) _Entitlement to Specific Performance_. The parties agree that irreparable
damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement
were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached, and that money damages or legal remedies would not be an adequate
remedy for any such damages. Therefore, it is accordingly agreed that prior to
the termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Section 10.1_, the
parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent or
restrain any breach or threatened breach of this Agreement by any other party
and to enforce specifically the

 



      
 

 



 

terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened
breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and obligations of
any other party, in any court of competent jurisdiction, and appropriate
injunctive relief may be applied for and granted in connection therewith. If
any party brings any action to enforce specifically the performance of the
terms and provisions hereof by any other party, the party bringing such action
may extend the Termination Date (notwithstanding the termination provisions of
_Section 10.1(a)_) so long as the party bringing such action is actively
seeking a court order for an injunction or injunctions or to specifically
enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement.

 



 

(b) _Waiver of Defenses and Bond_. Each of the parties hereto hereby waives:
(i) the defense that monetary damages would be an adequate remedy in any
action for specific performance; and (ii) any requirement under any Law to
post a bond or other security as a prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief.

 



 

(c) _Specific Performance Declined_. If a court of competent jurisdiction has
declined to specifically enforce the obligations of a party to consummate the
Closing pursuant to a claim for performance brought against such party
pursuant to this _Section 11.13_, the other party shall not be limited in any
respect in pursuing any other remedy or recourse available to it under
applicable Law.

 



 

11.14 _Conflicts; Privileges_.

 



 

(a) _Acknowledgement of Representation_. It is acknowledged by each of the
parties hereto that the Company and the Sellers have retained Weil, Gotshal and
Manges LLP (" ** _Weil_** ") and Arnold and Porter, LLP (" ** _Arnold_** ", and
together with Weil, the " ** _Firms_** ") to act as their counsel in
connection with the Transactions and that neither of the Firms have acted as
counsel for any other Person in connection with the Transactions and that no
other party to this Agreement or Person has the status of a client of either
Firm for conflict of interest or any other purposes as a result thereof.

 



 

(b) _Affirmation of Representation_. Buyer hereby agrees that, in the event
that a dispute arises between Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including, after
the Closing, the Company or any of the Subsidiaries) and the Sellers, the
Seller Representative or any of their Affiliates or members (including, prior
to the Closing, the Company or any of the Subsidiaries), either or both of the
Firms may represent the Sellers, the Seller Representative or any such
Affiliate or member of any Seller or the Seller Representative in such dispute
even though the interests of the Sellers, the Seller Representative or such
Affiliate or member may be directly adverse to Buyer or any of its Affiliates
(including, after the Closing, the Company or any of the Subsidiaries), and
even though the Firms may have represented the Company or a Subsidiary in a
matter substantially related to such dispute, or may be handling ongoing
matters for Buyer, the Company or a Subsidiary.

 



 

(c) _Waiver of Conflict_. Buyer and the Company hereby waive, on behalf of
themselves and each of their Affiliates: (i) any claim they have or may have
that either Firm has a conflict of interest in connection with or is otherwise
prohibited from engaging in such representation; (ii) agree that, in the event
that a dispute arises after the Closing between Buyer or any of its Affiliates
(including the Company or any Subsidiary) and the Sellers, the Seller

 



      
 

 



 

Representative or any Affiliate or member thereof, either or both Firms may
represent any such party in such dispute even though the interest of any such
party may be directly adverse to Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including the
Company or any Subsidiary) and even though the Firms may have represented the
Company or the Subsidiaries in a matter substantially related to such dispute,
or may be handling ongoing matters for Buyer, the Company or the Subsidiaries.

 



 

(d) _Retention of Privilege_. Buyer, the Company and the Subsidiaries further
agree that, as to all communications among either Firm, the Sellers, the
Seller Representative, the Company and the Subsidiaries that relate to the
Transactions, the attorney-client privilege, the expectation of client
confidence and all other rights to any evidentiary privilege belong to the
Sellers and may be controlled by the Sellers and shall not pass to or be
claimed by Buyer, the Company or the Subsidiaries. For the avoidance of doubt,
as to all communications among either Firm and the Company and the
Subsidiaries that do not relate to the Transactions, the attorney-client
privilege, the expectation of client confidence and all other rights to any
evidentiary privilege belong to the Company and the Subsidiaries and may be
controlled by the Company and the Subsidiaries and shall not pass to or be
claimed by the Sellers or the Seller Representative.

 



 

11.15 _Release_.

 



 

(a) Effective as of the Closing Date, each Seller, for itself and all of its
Affiliates, and the Seller Representative, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law, hereby releases and forever discharges Buyer, the Company,
each Subsidiary, any Person who controls (as such term is defined in Section
15 of the Securities Act) any of the foregoing, and their respective
directors, officers, shareholders, managers, members, principals, employees,
Affiliates, agents, representatives, predecessors, successors and assigns
(individually, a " ** _Buyer Releasee_** " and collectively, " ** _Buyer
Releasees_** ") from any and all Damages that each Seller, any of Sellers
Affiliates and the Seller Representative now has, has ever had or may
hereafter have against the respective Releasees arising at or prior to the
Closing Date whether or not relating to claims pending on, or asserted after,
the Closing Date, including arising out of any Seller having been a holder of
any Common Shares or Class A Shares, including with respect to any liquidation
right or preference any Seller may be entitled to under the Companys Fourth
Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that nothing contained herein shall operate to release any Damages on account
of, arising out of, or relating to any Sellers rights (i) under the
Transaction Documents, (ii) under any written employment or severance
agreement between the Seller and the Company or any Subsidiary, provided such
agreement has been disclosed on _Schedule 11.15_ , (iii) to any amounts owed
to it pursuant to a Company Benefit Plan not being terminated on the Closing
Date, or (iv) with respect to claims for fraud.

 



 

(b) Effective as of the Closing Date, the Company, for itself and all of its
Subsidiaries, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, hereby
releases and forever discharges each Seller and each Non-Party Affiliate
(individually, a " ** _Seller Releasee_** " and collectively, the " ** _Seller
Releasees_** ") from any and all Damages that the Company and its Subsidiaries
now has, has ever had or may hereafter have against the respective Seller
Releasees arising at or prior to the Closing Date whether or not relating to
claims pending on, or asserted after, the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_
, that nothing contained herein shall operate to release

 



      
 

 



 

any Damages on account of, arising out of, or relating to Buyers or the
Companys rights (i) under the Transaction Documents, (ii) under any written
employment or severance agreement between the Seller and the Company or any
