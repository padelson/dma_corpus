for a dollar amount equal to the excess, if any, of the EAR Exercise Price in
respect of each EAR (which for purposes of this  _Section 2.1(b)_ shall
equal the Per Interest Amount) over the Base Price applicable to such EAR (as
defined in the applicable EAR) (such excess, if any, in respect of such EAR,

Applicable EAR Amounts shall be net of any tax withholdings as are required by

rata_ portion of applicable transaction 

 



-13-   expenses and fees due and payable by the Sellers and the EAR holders, as
determined by the Sellers Representative), or (ii) subject to reduction of
the Adjustment Amount Holdback and the Escrow Funds to pay to Buyer any
application portion of the Adjustment Amount as is determined to be payable to
Buyer hereunder, in each case with such _pro rata_ portion determined on a
Fully Diluted Basis. Each EAR holder and the number of EARs held by such
holder are set forth in _Schedule 1.1C_.

(c) Buyer shall pay on behalf and for the account of the Acquired Companies
at Closing all amounts necessary to discharge fully (including, without
limitation, all outstanding principal, accrued but unpaid interest, amounts
payable in settlement, prepayment penalties, and other fees, charges and
expenses of all types) all obligations of the Acquired Companies for or under
(i) the Credit Agreement by and between Bank of America, N.A. and the Company
dated as of January 7, 2011 (the " _Credit Agreement_ "), and (ii) the other
obligations set forth on a written schedule, which shall be delivered to Buyer
by the Sellers Representative at least two (2) Business Days prior to
Closing, (the aggregate of all such amounts described in clauses (i) and (ii)
of this _Section 2.1(c)_, the " _Payoff Amount_ "); and the Sellers covenant
that such written schedule will reflect all indebtedness of the Acquired
Companies for borrowed money at Closing.

 

(d) The parties contemplate and agree that prior to Closing the Acquired
Companies will make one or more cash distributions to members or holders of
Interests such that, at Closing, the Acquired Companies will have no cash or
cash equivalents. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Acquired Companies shall
retain cash in an amount necessary to pay uncleared checks and
electronic payments not yet debited to the Acquired Companies account(s) to
the extent not taken into account in determining working capital.

Sellers Representative), by wire transfer of immediately available funds,
which shall be allocated among Sellers and the EAR holders, _pro rata_ on a

Adjustment Amount Holdback equal to such reduction and shall pay any portion
of the Adjustment Amount Holdback in excess of such reduction to the Sellers

Escrow Agent to pay to Buyer a dollar amount equal to the amount of such
excess.

Acquired Company, copies of documents relating to any Encumbrances relating
to the Owned Real Property.

(b) _Schedule 4.6(b)_ lists all real estate currently leased by any
Acquired Company as a lessee, sub-lessee, or assignee of a holder of a
leasehold interest (the " _Leased Real Property_ " and, together with the
Owned Real Property, the " _Real Property_ "), including the address of the
premises leased and the Acquired Company that leases the same. All Leased
Real Property is leased pursuant to valid written leases listed in _Schedule
4.16(a)_. Such leases contain the entire lease agreement between the landlord
of each of the leased premises and the Acquired Company. No Acquired Company
leases Real Property as a lessor or sub-lessor. Except as set forth on
_Schedule 4.6(b)_ , there have been no notices of default made by any landlord
related to any Leased Real Property and there are no unpaid amounts owed by
any Acquired Company or guarantor pursuant to any lease of the Leased Real

Acquired Company lie wholly within the boundaries of the Real Property in

encroaches upon the Real Property. Each parcel of Real Property abuts on, and
has direct vehicular access to, a public road and said access is sufficient to
permit the Acquired Companies to conduct their businesses on the Real Property
as presently conducted in the Ordinary Course of Business. Certificates
of occupancy are in full force and effect for each location of Real Property,
and the uses thereof being made by the Acquired Companies do not violate any
applicable zoning, subdivision or land use Legal Requirement. No Third Party
has a right to acquire any interest in the Owned Real Property or in the
Acquired Companies interests in the Leased Real Property (other than the
landlord or its mortgagee or lender, pursuant to the terms of the applicable
lease or applicable Legal Requirements).

(d) The Acquired Companies own all tangible personal property reflected as
owned in the Interim Balance Sheet (other than inventory sold since the
Interim Balance Sheet Date in the Ordinary Course of Business), free and clear
of all Encumbrances, other than Permitted Encumbrances and other than as set
forth in _Schedule 4.6(d)_. All the tangible personal property purchased or
otherwise acquired by the Acquired Companies since the Interim Balance Sheet
Date (other than inventory acquired and sold since the Interim Balance Sheet
Date in the Ordinary Course of Business) is owned by the Acquired Companies
free and clear of all Encumbrances, other than Permitted Encumbrances and as
set forth in _Schedule 4.6(d)_. A copy of the fixed asset register of each
Acquired Company has been made available to Buyer.

 

(e) The Acquired Companies have good title to, a valid leasehold interest in
or valid license to use all assets and properties, and shall be in possession
of all assets and properties, material to conduct the businesses of the
Acquired Companies on a stand-alone basis as previously conducted in the

by the Acquired Companies which constitute tangible personal property are in
reasonable condition and repair, ordinary wear and tear excepted. No tangible
personal property or inventories (other than inventory in transit) are located
at any place other than the Real Property.

Balance Sheet represent valid obligations arising from sales made or services
performed in the Ordinary Course of Business by such Acquired Company, all of

eighty (180) days after the Closing Date. The reserve for doubtful
accounts reflected in the Interim Balance Sheet was calculated in accordance
with the Acquired Companies accounting policies and practices applied on a
basis consistent with past practice and GAAP. _Schedule 4.7(a)_ lists and sets
forth the aging of the accounts receivable as of the Interim Balance Sheet
Date, and specifically denotes all accounts receivable which bear interest
(other than by reason of the standard invoice or business terms and
conditions). Each Acquired Company has paid all accounts payable in
accordance with their terms, and no interest is payable with respect to any
portion of such accounts payable. _Schedule 4.7(b)_ lists and sets forth the

Acquired Companies accounting policies and practices applied on a basis
consistent with past practice and GAAP.

Except as set forth in _Schedule 4.9_ , no Acquired Company has any liability
that, in accordance with GAAP, would be required to be reflected on or
disclosed in a balance sheet of the relevant entity, other than liabilities

Section 8.2 _Certain Tax Matters_

(a) _Acknowledgement by Buyer and Sellers_. The Buyer acknowledges that for
federal, state and local income Tax purposes (i) the Company is treated as
though it were a

 



-40-   "partnership" and WPT and Valley are treated as "disregarded entities" and
(ii) under Revenue Ruling 99-6, because all of the Interests in Company will
be acquired by Buyer at the Closing, (A) the deemed "partnership" will
terminate immediately after the purchase, (B) the deemed "partnership" tax
year will end on the Closing Date, (C) the Sellers will be deemed to have
sold interests in a partnership, and (D) the Buyer will be deemed to have
purchased the assets of the of the Acquired Companies.

(b) _Responsibility for Preparing and Filing Tax Returns and Paying Certain
Taxes_. Sellers shall prepare or cause to be prepared and filed all federal,
state and local Tax Returns of Company, WPT and Valley for all tax years
ending on or before the Closing Date. Company and Buyer shall prepare or cause
to be prepared and file or cause to be filed all federal, state and local Tax
Returns for tax years beginning and ending after the Closing Date, if any, as
well as all Tax Returns for tax periods (" _Straddle Periods_ ") which include
a period beginning before and ending after the Closing Date. Buyer
acknowledges that the Company, WPT and Valley are not subject to
federal, state or local income Tax. Sellers shall pay all Taxes of the
Company, WPT and Valley for all taxable periods ending on or before the
Closing Date and for the portion through the end of the Closing Date for any
taxable period that includes (but ends after) the Closing Date (" _Pre-
Closing Tax Period_ "), except to the extent that such Taxes have been
reflected in the Financial Statements, have been accrued on the books of an
Acquired Company or are taken into account in the calculation of the Closing
Date Working Capital. In the case of any Straddle Period, the amount of any
Taxes based on or measured by income, receipts, sales or payroll of an
Acquired Company for the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be determined based on
an interim closing of the books as of the close of business on the Closing
Date, and the amount of other Taxes of the Acquired Companies for a Straddle
Period that relates to the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be deemed to be the
amount of such Tax for the entire taxable period multiplied by a fraction the
numerator of which is the number of days in the taxable period ending on the
Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of days in such
Straddle Period. Sellers share of Straddle Period Taxes shall be paid by
distribution out of the Escrow Funds only.

(c) _Consistent Reporting Positions_. Buyer and Sellers acknowledge that the
transactions contemplated hereby are treated on the Sellers side as a sale of
partnership interests in an entity classified as a partnership and treated on
the Buyers side as an acquisition of assets to which Code Section 1060
applies. For the purposes of allocating income to the period ending on the
Closing Date and for the purposes of determining the amount of capital gain or
of ordinary income under Section 751 of the Code experienced by Sellers on
the sale of the Interests to Buyer and, on the Buyers side, for the purposes
of allocating consideration among the assets, Buyer and Sellers agree as
follows:

 

(i) For the purposes of determining income or loss realized by Sellers on the
sale of Interests with respect to "Section 751 Property" as outlined in
Treasury Regulation §1.751-1, the fair market value of each item of property,
other than Section 197 intangibles, shall be valued as set forth on Schedule
8.2(c)(i);

 

(ii) Consistent with this _Section 8.2(c)_, the Company shall prepare and
delivery to Sellers for Sellers approval, the statement required by Treasury
Regulations §1.751-1(a)(3). The Company shall attach to its Tax Return for the
year ending on the Closing Date IRS

 



-41-   Form 8308 entitled "Report of Sale or Exchange of Certain Partnership
Interests" in the form approved by Sellers;

 

(iii) Sellers distributive share of income, gain, loss and deductions for the
tax year ending on the Closing Date shall be determined on the basis of a
closing of the books as of the Closing Date;

(iv) All EAR Payments (whether paid before, at or after Closing) and all
compensation consisting of regularly scheduled payments of salaries, wages and
other compensation with respect to periods to and including the Closing Date
(but excluding other incentive compensation not yet due, bonuses not yet due,
severance or similar payments) paid or payable to employees of Company, WPT
and Valley shall be deemed accrued and paid immediately before the Closing
Date and shall be deducted on the final return of the Company for the sole
benefit of the Sellers; and

(v) Consistent with the foregoing, Buyer (but not Sellers) shall file IRS Form
8594 and amendment thereto showing that the entire consideration paid for or
in respect of the Interests is allocated to the assets of Company consistent
with the following principals: (A) as set forth in Treasury Regulations
§1.338-6 and §1.1060-1, all Class I assets, Class II assets (if any), Class
III assets, Class IV assets and all Class V assets shall be valued as set
forth on Schedule 8.2(c)(i), (B) all Class VI assets shall be valued at
$500,000, and (C) the balance of the consideration will be allocated to Class
VII assets.

(vi) Neither Buyer nor Sellers shall take Tax Return reporting positions
inconsistent with this _Section 8.2_.

(d) _Transfer Taxes_. Except as otherwise provided herein, all
transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration or other Taxes arising
out of or incurred in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by Buyer.

 

Section 8.3 _Director and Officer Liability_

(a) Buyer and the Company agree that all rights to exculpation or
indemnification arising from, relating to, or otherwise in respect of, acts or
omissions occurring prior to the Closing now existing in favor of the current
or former directors, officers, managers, members or employees (each a "
_Covered Person_ ") of the Company and the Subsidiaries as provided in their
respective Organizational Documents shall survive the Closing and shall
continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms. For a period
of not less than six (6) years from the Closing, Buyer shall cause the Company
to, and the Company shall, maintain in effect the exculpation,
indemnification and advancement of expenses provisions of the Companys and
the Subsidiarys Organizational Documents in effect as of the date of this
Agreement or in any indemnification agreements of the Company or the
Subsidiaries with any of their respective directors, officers, managers,
members or employees in effect as of the date of this Agreement, and shall not
amend, repeal or otherwise modify any such provisions after the Closing in any
manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any individuals
who immediately before the Closing were current or former directors, officers,
managers, members or

 



-42-   employees of the Company or the Subsidiaries; _provided_ that all rights to
exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses in respect of any
proceeding pending or asserted or any claim made within such period shall
continue until the final disposition of such proceeding. Each Covered Person
shall be deemed to be an intended third party beneficiary of this _Section
8.3_.

 

(b) The provisions of this _Section 8.3_ are intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, each Covered Person, his or her heirs and
his or her personal representatives, shall be binding on all successors and
assigns of Buyer and the Company and shall not be amended in a manner that is
adverse to any Person indemnified pursuant to this  _Section 8.3_ (including
their successors, assigns and heirs) without the consent of such indemnified
Person (including the successors, assigns and heirs) affected thereby.

 

(c) The rights of each indemnified Person under this _Section 8.3_ shall be
in addition to any rights such Covered Person may have under the
Organizational Documents of the Company or the Subsidiaries, or under any
applicable indemnification agreements or Legal Requirements.

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything herein to the contrary, in no
event shall Buyer or any Acquired Company have any obligation to indemnify any
current or former directors, officers, managers, members or employees with
respect to claims of the Sellers or the EAR holders arising out of or relating
to this Agreement.

 

Section 8.4 _Non-Solicitation; Non-Competition_

(a) During the Restricted Period, except with the prior written consent of
Buyer, Tinicum shall not, and shall cause any Tinicum Related Person under
Tinicums actual direct control (which, for purposes of this Section 8.4,
shall mean a Related Person of which Tinicum owns a majority of the voting
equity securities or for which Tinicum has the right to appoint a majority of
the board of directors (or other similar governing body)) not to: (i) hire
away any salaried or management employee of any Acquired Company while such
employee is employed by an Acquired Company or for a period of twelve (12)
months thereafter, whether or not such employee would be in breach of
an employment contract in leaving the service of the employing Acquired
Company, provided that the foregoing shall not prohibit or restrict Tinicum or
any such controlled Related Person from conducting general solicitations or
advertisements for or relating to employment; (ii) engage in the Business in
competition with the Acquired Companies.

(b) As used herein, the term "Business" shall mean any part of the business
engaged in by the Acquired Companies on the date hereof consisting of the
design, manufacture or sale of (i) large diameter, thin-walled welded
titanium, nickel, aluminum and stainless steel tubing for any of the
following applications (x) aerospace ducting applications, (y) industrial
applications limited to pump housings, diamond packing, computer chip
manufacturing equipment and life support systems, or (z) other applications
limited to instrumentation housings for oil and gas, solar collectors and
mechanical actuators; or (ii) large diameter, thin-walled welded tubing
products for use in commercial and military aerospace applications limited to

 



-43-   environmental ducting, anti-icing tubing, actuator tubes for flight control
surfaces, thrust reverser links, door locks, bleed air ducting and struts.

 

(c) As used herein, the term "Restricted Period" shall mean the period of five
(5) years immediately following the Closing Date.

(d) For the avoidance of doubt, the prohibition against competition in the
Business contemplated in this  _Section 8.4_ shall not include or extend to
engaging in business(es) that use, employ or incorporate large-diameter thin-
walled welded tubing of any kind or type in the manufacture of systems,
components, assemblies or products for any application.

(e) Tinicum has reviewed the scope and duration of the covenants contained in
this _Section 8.4_ and agrees that they are reasonable and necessary to
protect Buyer. However, the parties agree that if any of the covenants in this
_Section 8.4_ is found to be unenforceable due to restrictions unreasonable
in scope, duration or otherwise, then any arbitration panel or court in an
appropriate forum having jurisdiction may reform this _Section 8.4_ so that
the restrictions in it are reasonable and enforceable. Tinicum acknowledges
and agrees that monetary damages may be insufficient to remedy any breach of
the covenants set forth in this _Section 8.4_ and that Buyer shall be
entitled to seek injunctive relief for any Breach of such covenants without
the necessity of posting a bond or proving actual damages, and Buyer shall be
entitled to all other remedies available at law or in equity to prevent any
Breach of such covenants.

Section 8.5 _Return of Confidential Information; Confidentiality_

After closing, the Sellers and their Representatives will make an appropriate
written request or direction to any Third Person that entered into a
confidentiality agreement in connection with the Contemplated Transactions, to
return to the Company or destroy all confidential information received
thereunder. Each Seller and EAR holder further agrees (for itself and its
Representative and affiliates; provided that with respect to Tinicum such
affiliates will be limited to Tinicum Related Person under Tinicums actual
direct control, as described in Section 8.4) not to disclose or use any
confidential information of the Acquired Companies in any manner. The
restrictions in the preceding sentence shall not apply to any
information that is or becomes generally available to the public other than
as a result of disclosure by any Seller or EAR holder (or their respective
Representatives or affiliates) in breach of this provision, or which is
disclosed to a Seller or EAR holder (or their respective Representatives or
affiliates) by a Third Party not subject to a confidentiality obligation with
respect to such information. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Sellers and
EAR holders may disclose and discuss confidential information as required to
be disclosed by law, court order, or similar compulsion; provided, however,
that such disclosure shall be limited to the extent so required or compelled;
and provided, further, that if any of the Sellers or EAR holders becomes
legally compelled to disclose all or any portion of the confidential
information, such Seller or EAR holders shall provide Buyer with prompt notice
thereof, so that Buyer may seek a protective order or other appropriate
remedy. The Sellers acknowledge and agree that monetary damages may be
insufficient to remedy any breach of the covenants set forth in this _Section
8.5_ and that Buyer shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief for any Breach
of such covenants without the necessity of posting a bond or proving actual
damages, and Buyer shall be entitled to all other remedies available at law or
in equity to prevent any Breach of such covenants.

(c) For the avoidance of doubt, other than with respect to actual fraud, it
is the intent of the parties that any claims between Buyer, the Sellers and
the EAR holders arising under or relating to this Agreement, the Escrow
Agreement or the Contemplated Transactions shall be brought directly against
each other in such capacities and in accordance with the terms, conditions and
limitations of this Agreement (including applicable limitations on the amount

to indemnification pursuant to this _Section 12.1_ (the " _Fundamental
Losses_ "). With respect to any Fundamental Losses, Buyer shall have the
option to (a) immediately pursue payment of such Fundamental Losses from
the Escrow Funds, or (b) delay payment of Fundamental Losses from the Escrow
Funds until the release date of the Escrow

 



-51-   Funds, in which case payment of any indemnified Losses of Buyer under
Section 12.1(a)(i) and which are not Fundamental Losses shall be given
priority of payment from the Escrow Funds. 

Section 12.2 _Indemnification by Buyer_

(a) From and after the Closing, Buyer agrees to indemnify and hold harmless
each Seller Group Member from and against any and all Losses incurred by such
Seller Group Member in connection with or arising from:

(i) any Breach of any warranty or the inaccuracy of any representation of
Buyer contained in _Article 5_ ;

any Seller Group Member under _Section 12.2(a)(i)_ thereafter), except that
the indemnification by Buyer shall continue as to any Losses of which any
Seller Group Member has validly given a Claim Notice to Buyer in accordance
with the requirements of _Section 12.3_ on or prior to the date such
indemnification would otherwise terminate in accordance with this _Section
12.2(b)_, as to which the obligation of Buyer shall continue solely with
respect to the specific matters and Losses in such Claim Notice until the
liability of Buyer shall have been determined pursuant to this _Article 12_ ,
and such liability shall have been satisfied in accordance with, and subject
to the limitations of, this _Article 12_.

Section 12.3 _Notice of Claims_

 

Any Person seeking indemnification hereunder (the " _Indemnified Person_ ")
shall give promptly to the party obligated to provide indemnification (the "
_Indemnitor_ ") to such Indemnified Person a notice (a " _Claim Notice_ ")
describing in reasonable detail the facts giving rise to the claim for
indemnification hereunder and shall include in such Claim Notice (if then
known) the amount or the method of computation of the amount of such claim,
and a specific reference to the provision(s) of this Agreement or any other
agreement, document or instrument executed pursuant hereto upon which such
claim is based. It is agreed and understood that, in accordance with _Section
13.5_, Sellers Representative shall (i) receive all Claim Notices that seek
indemnification hereunder from Sellers in accordance with  _Section 12.1_
and (ii) provide all Claim Notices that seek indemnification hereunder from
Buyer, and thereafter Sellers Representative shall have full authority to
prosecute, defend, settle, compromise or take any other action for or on
behalf of Sellers with respect to any such claim and Claim Notice.

Section 12.4 _Resolution of Indemnifiable Claims_

After the giving of any Claim Notice pursuant to _Section 12.3_, the amount
of indemnification to which an Indemnified Person shall be entitled under
this _Article 12_ shall be

 



-52-   determined: (i) by the written agreement between the Indemnified Person and
the Indemnitor; (ii) by a final judgment or decree of a court of competent
jurisdiction; or (iii) by any other means to which the Indemnified Person and
the Indemnitor shall agree. The judgment or decree of a court shall be deemed
final when the time for appeal, if any, shall have expired and no appeal shall
have been taken or when all appeals taken shall have been finally determined.
The Indemnified Person shall have the burden of proof in establishing the
amount of Losses suffered by it.

Section 12.5 _Third Party Claims_

(a) Any Person seeking indemnification provided for under this Agreement in
respect of, arising out of or involving a claim or demand made by any Third
Party against the Indemnified Person shall notify the Indemnitor in writing,
and in reasonable detail, of the Third Party claim within ten (10) days after
receipt by such Indemnified Person of written notice of the Third Party claim.
Thereafter, the Indemnified Person shall deliver to the Indemnitor, within
five (5) days after the Indemnified Persons receipt thereof, copies of all
notices and documents (including court papers) received by the Indemnitor
relating to the Third Party claim. Any notice of a claim arising by reason of
any of the representations, warranties, agreements or covenants contained in
this Agreement shall refer to the provision of this Agreement upon which such
claim is based and describe in reasonable detail the facts giving rise to an
alleged basis for the claim and the amount of the liability asserted against
the Indemnitor by reason of the claim. The failure to give notice as provided
in this _Section 12.5_ shall not relieve the Indemnitor of its obligations
hereunder except to the extent the Indemnitor shall have been prejudiced by
such failure.

 

(b) Subject to _Section 12.5(c)_, the Indemnified Person shall have the right
to conduct and control, through counsel of its choosing, the defense,
compromise or settlement of any Third Party claim against such Indemnified
Person as to which indemnification will be sought by any Indemnified Person
from any Indemnitor hereunder, and in any such case the Indemnitor
shall reasonably cooperate in connection therewith; provided that: (i) the
Indemnitor may participate, through counsel chosen by it and at its own
expense, in the defense of any such Third Party claim as to which the
Indemnified Person has so elected to conduct and control the defense thereof;
and (ii) the Indemnified Person shall not, without the written consent of the
Indemnitor (which written consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), pay,
compromise or settle any such Third Party claim. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Indemnified Person shall have the right to pay, settle or
compromise any such Third Party claim without such consent, provided that in
such event the Indemnified Person shall waive any right to indemnity therefor
hereunder unless such consent is unreasonably withheld.

(c) If any Third Party claim against any Indemnified Person is solely for
money damages, then the Indemnitor shall have the right to conduct and
control, through counsel of its choosing, the defense, compromise or
settlement of any such Third Party claim against such Indemnified Person as to
which indemnification will be sought by any Indemnified Person from any
Indemnitor hereunder if the Indemnitor has acknowledged and agreed in writing
that, if the same is adversely determined, the Indemnitor has an obligation to
provide indemnification to the Indemnified Person in respect thereof, and in
any such case the Indemnified Person shall reasonably cooperate in connection
therewith; provided that the Indemnified Person may participate, through
counsel chosen by it and at its own expense, in the defense of any such Third

 



-53-   Party claim as to which the Indemnitor has so elected to conduct and control
the defense thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnified Person
shall have the right to pay, settle or compromise any such Third Party claim,
provided that in such event the Indemnified Person shall waive any right to
indemnity therefor hereunder unless the Indemnified Person shall have sought
the consent of the Indemnitor to such payment, settlement or compromise and
such consent was unreasonably withheld, in which event no claim for indemnity
therefor hereunder shall be waived.

Section 12.6 _Determination of Indemnification Amounts_

(a) The existence of any Breach of any representation or warranty of the
Sellers hereunder and the amount of any and all Losses under this _Article 12_
associated therewith shall be determined without regard to any materiality,
Material Adverse Effect or other similar qualifications (except to the extent
such qualifier is intended for the benefit of Buyer). For the avoidance of
doubt, the representations and warranties set forth in _Section 4.11_ are for
the benefit of Buyer and shall not be limited by this provision.

(b) The amount of any and all Losses under this _Article 12_ shall be
determined net of (i) any Tax benefits reasonably expected to be realized by
any Person seeking indemnification hereunder arising from the deductibility of
any such Losses, and (ii) any amounts recovered or recoverable by the
Indemnified Person under insurance policies, indemnities or other
reimbursement arrangements with respect to such Losses, less reasonable costs
of collection. Each party hereby waives, to the extent permitted under its
applicable insurance policies, any subrogation rights that its insurer may
have with respect to any indemnifiable Losses. Buyer shall have no right to
assert any claims against the Escrow Funds with respect to any Losses that
would have been covered by insurance had Buyer maintained (or caused
the Company to maintain) for the benefit of the Company the same insurance
coverage following the Closing that was in effect for the Company immediately
prior to the Closing.

(c) Any indemnification payment under this Agreement shall be treated as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes.

(d) In any case where an Indemnified Person recovers from Third Parties any
amount in respect of a matter with respect to which an Indemnitor has
indemnified it pursuant to this _Article 12_ , such Indemnified Person shall
promptly pay over to the Indemnitor the amount so recovered (after deducting
therefrom the full amount of the expenses incurred by it in procuring such
recovery), but not in excess of the sum of (i) any amount previously so paid
by the Indemnitor to or on behalf of the Indemnified Person in respect of such
matter, and (ii) any amount expended by the Indemnitor in pursuing or
defending any claim arising out of such matter.

 

(e) If one or more Sellers (or Sellers Representative on behalf of all
Sellers) are conducting any defense against a Third Party claim for which a
Buyer Group Member has sought indemnification pursuant to _Section 12.1_,
reasonable expenses incurred by such Seller or Sellers in connection
therewith, including reasonable legal costs and expenses, shall
constitute Losses for purposes of determining the maximum aggregate amount to
be paid by such Seller or Sellers pursuant to _Section 12.1_.

 



-54-  (f) Each of the parties agrees to take all reasonable steps to mitigate their
respective Losses upon and after becoming aware of any event or condition
which could reasonably be expected to give rise to any Losses that are
indemnifiable hereunder.

(g) Buyer shall have no right to indemnification under _Section 12.1_ with
respect to any Loss or alleged Loss to the extent such Loss or the facts or
matters giving rise to such Loss was or were taken into account or reflected
in the Closing Date Working Capital or in any other adjustment to the Purchase
Price.

 

(h) IN NO EVENT SHALL ANY PARTY BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY OR
PUNITIVE DAMAGES ARISING UNDER ANY LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY, ARISING UNDER
OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, ALL OF WHICH ARE HEREBY EXCLUDED BY
AGREEMENT OF THE PARTIES REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR NOT ANY PARTY TO THIS
AGREEMENT HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, THAT ANY INDEMNIFIED PARTY HEREUNDER SHALL BE ENTITLED TO RECOVER
ANY SUCH SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES TO THE EXTENT AWARDED IN
CONNECTION WITH ANY THIRD PARTY INDEMNIFIED CLAIM HEREUNDER.

 

(i) To the extent that any fact, event or circumstance results in or
constitutes a Breach of a representation or warranty of the Sellers or the
Company hereunder which is subject to indemnification by the Sellers under
Section 12.1(a)(i), and such fact, event or circumstance also results in a
Breach of a covenant of the Sellers or the Company hereunder which is subject
to indemnification by the Sellers under either or both of Section 12.1(a)(ii)
and/or Section 12.1(a)(iii), Buyer shall be required to pursue any claim for
indemnification hereunder as a Breach of a representation or warranty
under Section 12.1(a)(i) hereunder.

Section 12.7 _Exclusive Remedy_

 

The parties acknowledge and agree, for themselves and for and on behalf of all
other Buyer Group Members and Seller Group Members, respectively, that, from
and after the Closing, its (and their) sole and exclusive remedy against the
other party with respect to any and all rights, claims and causes of action
that may be based upon, arise out of or relate (directly or indirectly) to
the subject matter of this Agreement, any closing document, the negotiation,
execution or performance of this Agreement or any closing document or the
transactions contemplated thereby shall be limited to the indemnification
provisions set forth in this _Article 12_ , except with respect to actual
fraud and except for injunctive relief or other equitable remedies available
to Buyer with respect to the restrictive covenants of the Sellers hereunder.
Except as otherwise provided herein with respect to (i) actual fraud, (ii)
Fundamental Losses, (iii) Losses indemnified under Section 12.1(a)(ii), (iv)
Losses indemnified under Section 12.1(a)(iii) and (v) Losses indemnified
under Section 12.1(a)(iv), the Escrow Funds shall be the sole source of
monetary recovery for any claim or Loss by Buyer Group Members under this
_Article 12_ or otherwise. Except with respect to its (or their) rights under
this _Article 12_ , except with respect to actual fraud and except for
injunctive relief or other equitable remedies available to Buyer with respect
to the restrictive covenants of the Sellers hereunder, Buyer, for itself and
for and on behalf of all other Buyer Group Members, hereby waives, from and
after the Closing, to the

 



-55-   fullest extent permitted under any applicable law, any and all rights,
claims and causes of action that may be based upon, arise out of or relate
(directly or indirectly) to the subject matter of this Agreement, the
Contemplated Transactions, any Seller Closing Document, the negotiation,
execution or performance of this Agreement or any Seller Closing Document or
the transactions contemplated thereby, including those arising under or
based upon any Legal Requirement. Without limiting the foregoing, the parties
hereto hereby irrevocably waive any right of rescission they may otherwise
have or to which they may become entitled.

executing and delivering all agreements, certificates, releases, receipts,
instructions, and other instruments contemplated by or deemed advisable to
effectuate the provisions of this Agreement.

 

This appointment and grant of power and authority is coupled with an interest
and is in consideration of the mutual covenants made in this Agreement and is
irrevocable and shall not be terminated by any act of any Seller or by
operation of law, whether by the death or incapacity of any Seller or by the

relieved of any liability imposed by law for gross negligence or willful
misconduct. Sellers Representative shall not be liable to any Seller for any
apportionment or distribution of payments made by it in good faith, and if

Representative shall not be required to make any inquiry concerning either the
performance or observance of any of the terms, provisions or conditions of

indemnify and hold Sellers Representative harmless from and against any loss,
liability or

 



-58-   expense arising in connection with any act or omission as Sellers
Representative, except for any liability imposed by law for gross negligence
or willful misconduct.

unconditionally assume that any action taken or omitted, or any document
executed by, William M. Shockley purporting to act as Sellers Representative

with any of the Contemplated Transactions has been unconditionally authorized
by Sellers to be taken, omitted to be taken, or executed on their behalf so
that they will be legally bound thereby, and each Seller agrees not to
institute any claim, lawsuit, arbitration or other proceeding against Buyer
alleging that William M. Shockley did not have the authority to act as
Sellers Representative on behalf of Sellers in connection with any such
action, omission or execution. No modification or revocation of the power of
attorney granted by Sellers herein to William M. Shockley to serve as
Sellers Representative shall be effective as against Buyer until Buyer has

matter relating to the Company or the Subsidiaries on or prior to the Closing
Date. Such access shall be afforded by Buyer upon receipt of
reasonable advance notice and during normal business hours. Each Seller shall
be solely responsible for any costs or expenses incurred by it pursuant to

reasonable opportunity, at its expense, to segregate and remove such books and
records.

this Agreement without the prior consent of the other parties, except that
Buyer, with Sellers prior approval, such approval not to be unreasonably
withheld, may assign any of its rights (subject to all obligations) under this
Agreement to any Subsidiary of Buyer. Any such permitted assignment shall not
relieve Buyer of any of its obligations or liabilities hereunder. Any
purported assignment of rights or delegation of obligations in violation of
this _Section 13.10_ will be void. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement

particular section in this Agreement shall be deemed to have been disclosed

demand as provided in this Agreement or the documents referred to in this
Agreement.

Section 13.19 _Disclaimer of Warranties_

 

(a) Buyer acknowledges that it has conducted to its satisfaction an
independent investigation and verification of the financial condition,
results of operations, assets, liabilities, properties and projected
operations of the Acquired Companies, taken as a whole, and, in making its
determination to proceed with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
Buyer has relied on the results of its own independent investigation and
verification and the representations and warranties of Sellers and the Company
expressly and specifically set forth in _Articles 3_ and _4_ , subject to and
as qualified by the Disclosure Schedules and the disclosures and matters set
forth therein; provided, however, that neither the representations and
warranties of Sellers and the Company expressly set forth in this Agreement
(subject to the matters and disclosures set forth in the Disclosure
Schedules) nor the availability of any of the rights and remedies of the Buyer
Member Group under _Article 12_ hereof with respect to any Breach of such
representations or warranties (subject to the matters and disclosures set
forth in the Disclosure Schedules) shall be affected by any investigation, or
any Knowledge of any Breach of such representations or warranties acquired as
a result of such investigation, on the part of the Buyer or
its Representatives.

(b) EXCEPT AS TO THOSE MATTERS EXPRESSLY COVERED BY THE REPRESENTATIONS AND
WARRANTIES OF SELLERS AND THE COMPANY IN THIS AGREEMENT, SELLERS ARE SELLING
THE INTERESTS (AND THE BUSINESS AND ASSETS OF THE COMPANY REPRESENTED THEREBY)
ON AN "AS IS, WHERE IS" BASIS AND SELLERS AND THE COMPANY DISCLAIM ALL OTHER
WARRANTIES, REPRESENTATIONS AND GUARANTEES WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED.
SELLERS AND THE COMPANY MAKE NO REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY AS TO
MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NO IMPLIED
WARRANTIES WHATSOEVER.

 

(c) Without limiting or otherwise adversely effecting the other terms,
conditions, provisions, representations, warranties, covenants or remedies of
the parties set forth

 



-62-   in this Agreement, Buyer acknowledges that neither Sellers, the Company nor
any of their Representatives or Related Persons or any other Person has made
any representations or warranties to Buyer, whether oral or written, express
or implied (i) regarding the probable success or profitability of the Acquired
Companies or their business or any projections, forecasts or forward-looking
information provided to Buyer, and that there is no assurance that any
projected or forecasted results will be achieved, or (ii) as to the accuracy
or completeness of any memoranda, charts, summaries or other information
provided (including any electronic or "virtual" data room) or heretofore made
available by Sellers, the Company or their Representatives or affiliates to
Buyer or its Representatives, or any other information which is not included
in this Agreement or the Disclosure Schedules, and, in each case, none
of Sellers, the Company or any of their Representatives or affiliates or any
other Person will have or be subject to any liability to Buyer, any affiliate
of Buyer or any other Person resulting from the distribution of any such
information to, or use of any such information by, Buyer, any affiliate of
Buyer or any of their agents, consultants, accountants, counsel or other
Representatives.

(d) Notwithstanding anything (including _Section 12.1_) herein to the
contrary, with respect to the Excluded Environmental Matters: (i) neither the
Sellers nor the Company make any representation or warranty, (ii) neither the
Sellers nor the Company undertake any covenant or other obligation (including
any indemnification obligation), (iii) Buyer shall have no indemnification or
other right, and (iv) Buyer waives any and all rights and remedies (whether
pursuant to this Agreement, at law or in equity). Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the Excluded Environmental Matters shall be
excepted and excluded from (1) all representations and warranties of the
Sellers under Sections _4.9_ , _4.13_ , _4.14_ , _4.18_ or _4.26_ and (2) the
indemnification provisions of _Article 12_.

Section 13.20 _Certain Matters Regarding the Representation of the Company_

 

(a) Montgomery, McCracken, Walker and Rhoads, LLP (" _Montgomery_ ") has acted
as counsel for the Company in connection with this Agreement, the Buyer
Closing Documents and the Seller Closing Documents and the transactions
contemplated thereby (the " _Transaction Engagement_ ") and in that connection
not as counsel for any other Person, including the Buyer or its Related
Persons. Only the Company shall be considered a client of Montgomery in the
Transaction Engagement. The parties hereto acknowledge the community of
interest between the Company and the Sellers in light of the fact that the
Sellers hold all of the equity of the Company. Accordingly, notwithstanding
that the Company is or was a client in the Transaction Engagement, upon and
after the Closing, all communications between the Sellers, Sellers
Representative or any Acquired Company and Montgomery in the course of the
Transaction Engagement shall be deemed to be attorney-client confidences that
belong solely to the Sellers and the Sellers Representative and not any
Acquired Company. The Buyer shall not have access to any such communications,
or to the files of Montgomery relating to the Transaction Engagement, whether
or not the Closing shall have occurred. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, notwithstanding that the Acquired Companies were a client, in the
Transaction Engagement or otherwise, upon and after the Closing, (i) the
Sellers and Sellers Representative shall be the sole holders of the attorney-
client privilege with respect to the Transaction Engagement, and none of the
Acquired Companies, Buyer or any of their respective Related Persons shall be
a holder thereof, (ii) to the extent that files of Montgomery in respect of
the Transaction Engagement constitute property of the client, only the
Sellers or Sellers

 



-63-   Representative shall hold such property rights, and (iii) Montgomery shall
have no duty whatsoever to reveal or disclose any such attorney-client
communications or files to the Acquired Companies, Buyer or any of their
respective Related Persons by reason of any attorney-client relationship
between Montgomery and the Acquired Companies or otherwise.

(b) If the Sellers or Sellers Representative so desire, and without the need
for any consent or waiver by the Acquired Companies or Buyer, Montgomery shall
be permitted to represent the Sellers and Sellers Representative after the
Closing in connection with any matter, including anything related to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Buyer Closing Documents and
the Seller Closing Documents or any disagreement or dispute relating thereto.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing sentence, after the Closing,
Montgomery shall be permitted to represent the Sellers and Sellers
Representative, any of their Related Persons or Representatives, or any one
or more of them, in connection with any negotiation, transaction or dispute
("dispute" includes litigation, arbitration or other adversarial proceedings)
with Buyer, the Acquired Companies or any of their Related Persons or
Representatives under or relating to this Agreement, the Buyer Closing
Documents and the Seller Closing Documents, any transaction contemplated by
this Agreement, and any related matter, such as claims for indemnification and
disputes involving other agreements entered into in connection with this
Agreement, the Buyer Closing Documents or the Seller Closing Documents.

(c) Upon and after the Closing, the Acquired Companies shall cease to have
any attorney-client relationship with Montgomery, unless Montgomery is
specifically engaged in writing by an Acquired Company to represent it after
the Closing and either such engagement involves no conflict of interest with
respect to the Sellers or Sellers Representative or the Sellers or Sellers
Representative, as applicable, consent in writing at the time to such
engagement. Any such representation by Montgomery after the Closing shall not
affect the provisions of this _Section 13.20_. For example, and not by way of
limitation, even if Montgomery is representing the Acquired Companies after
the Closing, Montgomery shall be permitted simultaneously to represent the
Sellers and Sellers Representative in any matter, including any disagreement
or dispute relating hereto.

(d) The Sellers, Sellers Representative, the Acquired Companies and Buyer
consent to the foregoing arrangements and waive any actual or potential
conflict of interest that may be involved in connection with any
representation by Montgomery permitted hereunder.

Section 13.21 _Notices_

 

All notices and other communications required or permitted by this Agreement

  Exhibit 2.3(a)(v)

FORM OF ESCROW AGREEMENT

This ESCROW AGREEMENT, dated as of the [l] day of January 2012 (this "
_Agreement_ "), is made and entered into by and among (a) [l], a [l]
corporation (" _Buyer_ "); (b) Sellers Representative (as defined in the
Purchase Agreement referred to below) on behalf of the Sellers (as defined in
the Purchase Agreement); and (c) [l], as escrow agent (" _Escrow Agent_ ").

 

WITNESSETH:

WHEREAS, on December [l], 2011, Buyer, the Sellers and [l], a [l] company,
entered into a purchase agreement (the " _Purchase Agreement_ "); and 

WHEREAS, Section 2.1(a)(iii) of the Purchase Agreement provides for the
deposit with Escrow Agent of immediately available funds in the amount of
$[8,000,000] (the " _Escrow Funds_ "), which sum shall be available to provide
for the reduction of the Purchase Price on the terms and conditions set forth
in the Purchase Agreement.

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual covenants and
agreements contained herein and other good and valuable consideration, the
receipt and sufficiency of which are acknowledged, Buyer, Sellers
Representative and Escrow Agent hereby agree as follows:

1\. _Capitalized Terms_. Capitalized terms used in this Agreement and not
defined herein shall have the respective meanings ascribed to such terms in
the Purchase Agreement.

 

2\. _Appointment of Escrow Agent_. Buyer and Sellers Representative hereby
irrevocably appoint Escrow Agent to receive, hold, administer, safeguard and
disburse the Escrow Funds in accordance with this Agreement, and Escrow Agent
hereby accepts such appointment, all subject to and upon the terms and
conditions set forth herein.

 

3\. _Establishment of Escrow Funds_. On the Closing Date, Buyer shall transfer
and deliver to Escrow Agent a sum equal to $8,000,000 in immediately
available funds. Earnings on the Escrow Funds shall constitute and become part
of the Escrow Funds and be disbursed in accordance herewith. Escrow Agent
hereby agrees to receive, hold, administer, safeguard and disburse the
Escrow Funds pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

4\. _Investment of Escrow Funds_. In the absence of joint written
instructions from Buyer and Sellers Representative to the contrary, Escrow
Agent shall invest the Escrow Funds in Goldman Sachs Financial Square Funds
Treasury Instruments Fund, an institutional money market fund that
invests exclusively in United States treasury securities. Escrow Agent may
enter into a subservicing agreement with Goldman Sachs or an institutional
money market fund provider whereby it is entitled to receive sub-accounting
fees. The parties hereto (i) acknowledge Escrow Agents disclosure of the
services it is providing in connection with this share class; (ii) consent to
Escrow Agents receipt of fees from Goldman Sachs for performing such
services; and (iii) acknowledge that Escrow Agent has provided a Goldman
Sachs Financial Square Funds Treasury Instruments Fund prospectus that
discloses, among other things, the  various expenses of the share class including the fees to be received from
Goldman Sachs by Escrow Agent. Any income and earnings received by Escrow
Agent from investments of the Escrow Funds pursuant to this Section 4 shall
be added to and become a part of the Escrow Funds and shall be administered
and distributed by Escrow Agent pursuant to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement applicable to the Escrow Funds. Escrow Agent may earn compensation
in the form of short-term interest ("float") on items like uncashed
distribution checks (from the date issued until the date cashed). Escrow Agent
may also earn "float" on deposits awaiting investment direction or received
too late to be invested overnight in previously directed investments.

5\. _Claims_. From time to time on or before [INSERT DATE THAT IS 18 MONTHS
SUBSEQUENT TO CLOSING] (the " _Escrow Release Date_ "), at the same time that
any Buyer Group Member submits a Claim Notice pursuant to Section 12.3 of the
Purchase Agreement, such Buyer Group Member shall also submit a copy of such
Claim Notice to Escrow Agent. Upon receipt of such Claim Notice, Escrow Agent
shall immediately reserve the full amount of the claim identified on the Claim
Notice and shall make payment with respect thereto only in accordance with
(i) the written agreement of Buyer and Sellers Representative or (ii) a final
judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction delivered to the
Escrow Agent. Except as otherwise provided herein, Escrow Agent shall act on
such written agreement or court order without further question, and shall make
payment on the first Business Day, as defined below, following receipt of such
written agreement or court order. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Business
Day_ " shall be defined as a day other than (i) a Saturday or Sunday, (ii) a
day on which a trust company or banking institution located in the State of
Delaware is authorized or required by law to be closed, or (iii) a day on
which the office of Escrow Agent is closed for business. Escrow Agent shall
not inquire into or consider whether the parties have complied with the
requirements of the Purchase Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary, in no event shall Escrow Agent be required to pay an amount that
exceeds the balance of the Escrow Funds.

6\. _Release of Escrow Funds_.

(a) On the first Business Day following the Escrow Release Date, Escrow Agent
shall pay to an account designated in writing by Sellers Representative the
excess, if any, of the then balance in the Escrow Funds over the aggregate
dollar amount of all claims for which Claims Notices have been properly
provided to Escrow Agent but which have not yet been resolved in accordance
with Section 5 of this Agreement.

(b) If an amount of the Escrow Funds is retained by Escrow Agent after the
Escrow Release Date, said amount shall be held subject to the terms of this
Agreement until Escrow Agent receives the written agreement of Buyer and
Sellers Representative as to the disposition of such amount, or a
final judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction directing the
disposition of such amount, in each case as contemplated by Section 5 of this
Agreement.

7\. _Duties of Escrow Agent_. In administering and disbursing the Escrow Funds
pursuant to this Agreement, Escrow Agent agrees that it will comply with the
following duties and obligations: 

 



-2-  (a) Escrow Agent shall make payment from the Escrow Funds only as specified in
this Agreement.

(b) Escrow Agent shall forward to Buyer and Sellers Representative at least
quarterly a report of the payments made, the payees thereof and the then
balance in the Escrow Funds.

8\. _Escrow Agent._

 

(a) Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely upon any signature, paper or other
document believed by it to be genuine, without actual notice of changed
conditions or status of any person, firm or corporation executing the same.

(b) When all funds held by Escrow Agent hereunder, or pursuant hereto, have
been released, delivered or otherwise disposed of as provided herein, this
Agreement shall thereupon terminate and Escrow Agent shall thereby be released
and discharged from all further liability hereunder.

(c) Buyer and Sellers Representative do hereby acknowledge that Escrow Agent
is a disinterested stakeholder and has no personal interest in this
transaction. As a part of the consideration for Escrow Agents agreeing to act
as Escrow Agent hereunder, Buyer and Sellers Representative do hereby agree
that Escrow Agent shall not be required to bring, to defend or to otherwise
enter into any litigation or legal proceedings of any type arising out of or
which may in any way be connected with or affected by this Agreement or the
performance of it. However, Escrow Agent may, in its sole discretion, bring,
defend or otherwise participate in any such litigation or legal proceedings,
and in such event, all of its costs, expenses, liabilities and reasonable
attorneys fees shall be borne by and properly paid one-half by Buyer
and one-half by Sellers Representative (out of the Escrow Funds), upon
demand. The Escrow Agent undertakes to perform only such duties as are
expressly set forth herein and no duties shall be implied. The Escrow Agent
shall have no liability under and no duty to inquire as to the provisions of
any agreement other than this Escrow Agreement. The Escrow Agent shall have no
duty to solicit any payments which may be due it or the Escrow Fund. The
Escrow Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted by it in
good faith except to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction
determines that the Escrow Agents gross negligence or willful misconduct was
the cause of any loss to the Purchaser or Seller. The Escrow Agent may
execute any of its powers and perform any of its duties hereunder directly or
through agents or attorneys (and shall be liable only for the careful
selection of any such agent or attorney) and may consult with counsel,
accountants and other skilled persons to be selected and retained by it. The
Escrow Agent shall not be liable for anything done, suffered or omitted in
good faith by it in accordance with the advice or opinion of any such counsel,
accountants or other skilled persons. Anything in this Escrow Agreement to
the contrary notwithstanding, in no event shall the Escrow Agent be liable for
special, indirect or consequential loss or damage of any kind whatsoever
(including but not limited to lost profits), even if the Escrow Agent has
been advised of the likelihood of such loss or damage and regardless of the
form of action.

(d) In addition to all other rights and remedies which Escrow Agent might
have hereunder, at any time when Escrow Agent is not reasonably sure of its
rights or duties

 



-3-   hereunder, or when there is a dispute or disagreement among or between any
persons or parties whomsoever respecting any rights in or to the funds held
hereunder or in any way affecting Escrow Agents rights or duties hereunder,
then Escrow Agent shall be entitled to file an interpleader proceeding, to pay
said funds into any court of competent jurisdiction, to bring actions for
declaratory judgments or for any other quasi-judicial relief or resolution of
the disagreement, or it may decline performance of any duties hereunder and
may call upon any interested party to seek judicial resolution.

(e) Unless Escrow Agent shall have discharged any of its duties hereunder in a
grossly negligent manner or is guilty of bad faith or willful misconduct with
regard to its duties hereunder, Buyer and Sellers Representative agree that
Escrow Agent shall be indemnified and held harmless from any and all claims,
liabilities, losses, actions, suits or proceedings at law or in equity or any
other expense, fees or charges of any character or nature, which it may incur
or with which it may be threatened by reason of its acting as Escrow Agent
under this Agreement; and in connection therewith, that Escrow Agent shall be
indemnified against any and all expenses, including reasonable attorneys
fees and expenses and the cost of defending any action, suit or proceeding or
resisting any claim. The cost of any indemnification under this Section will
be paid one-half by Buyer and one-half by Sellers Representative (to
the extent such funds are available, out of the Escrow Funds).

(f) Escrow Agent shall be entitled to compensation (as payment in full) for
the services to be rendered by Escrow Agent hereunder in the amounts set forth
on Schedule I hereto, and for reimbursement for all reasonable expenses,
disbursements and advances incurred or made by Escrow Agent in performance of
its duties hereunder (including reasonable fees, expenses and disbursements
of its counsel). All compensation and reimbursements under this sub-Section
will be paid one-half by Buyer and one-half by Sellers Representative (the
Sellers Representatives half to be withdrawn from the Escrow Funds without
any further direction of the parties).

(g) Escrow Agent shall have the right to resign at any time by giving written
notice of such resignation to Buyer and Sellers Representative, and Buyer and
Sellers Representative shall have the right to terminate the services of
Escrow Agent hereunder at any time by giving written notice (with such
written notice being signed by both Buyer and Sellers Representative) of such
termination to Escrow Agent, in each case specifying the effective date of
such resignation or termination. Within 30 days after receiving or delivering
the aforesaid notice, as the case may be, Buyer and Sellerss Representative
agree to appoint a successor Escrow Agent to which Escrow Agent shall
distribute the property then held hereunder, pursuant to a written direction
from such successor escrow agent, less the amount of any fees owing to Escrow
Agent hereunder as of such date. If a successor escrow agent has not been
appointed and has not accepted such appointment by the end of such 30-day
period, Escrow Agent may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for the
appointment of a successor escrow agent, and the costs, expenses and
reasonable attorneys fees which are incurred in connection with any such
proceeding shall be paid one-half by Sellers Representative (out of the
Escrow Funds) and one-half by Buyer. Except as otherwise agreed to in writing
by the Parties, the Escrow Funds shall not be released from the Escrow Account
unless and until a successor Escrow Agent has been appointed in accordance
with this _Section 8(g). _

 



-4-  9\. _Ownership for Tax Purposes_. Buyer and Sellers Representative agree
that, for purposes of federal, state and other taxes based on income, the
Sellers will be treated as the owner of the Escrow Funds, and the Sellers will
report all income, if any, that is earned on, or derived from, the Escrow
Funds as their income in the taxable year or years in which such income is
properly includible and pay any taxes attributable thereto. The Escrow Agent
shall report, to the extent required by law, to the IRS or any other taxing
authority, as applicable, any such income earned on the Escrow Funds on IRS
form 1099 or 1042S (or other appropriate form) as income earned from the
Escrow Fund by the Sellers, in accordance with their pro-rata ownership
percentages provided to the Escrow Agent by Sellers Representative along
with the names, addresses and tax identification numbers of such Sellers,
whether or not said income has been distributed during the year. Any other tax
returns required to be filed will be prepared and filed by the Sellers with
the IRS and any other taxing authority as required by law including but not
limited to any applicable reporting or withholding pursuant to the Foreign
Investment in Real Property Tax Act ("FIRPTA"). The parties hereto acknowledge
and agree that the Escrow Agent shall have no responsibility for the
preparation and/or filing of any tax return or any applicable FIRPTA reporting
with respect to the Escrow Fund. The Escrow Agent shall withhold any taxes to
the extent required by law, including but not limited to required withholding
in the absence of proper tax documentation, and shall remit such taxes to the
appropriate authorities as it determines may be required by any law or
regulation in effect at the time of the distribution. 

10\. _Notices_. Any notice, demand or other communication required, permitted
or desired to be given hereunder shall be given in accordance with Section
13.21 of the Purchase Agreement; provided, however, that notices to Escrow
Agent shall be addressed as follows:



 





 





 



11.  _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, each of which will be deemed to be an original, but all of which
will constitute one and the same instrument. The exchange of copies of this
Agreement and of signature pages by facsimile transmission shall constitute
effective execution and delivery of this Agreement as to the parties and may
be used in lieu of the original Agreement for all purposes. Signatures of the
parties transmitted by facsimile shall be deemed to be their original
signatures for all purposes.

12\. _Headings_. The section headings in this Agreement are inserted for
convenience only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation
of this Agreement.

13.  _Severability_. Any provision of this Agreement which may be determined
by competent authority to be prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction
shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such
prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions
hereof, and any such prohibition or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall
not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other
jurisdiction. It is expressly understood, however, that the parties intend
each and every provision of this Agreement to be valid and enforceable and
hereby knowingly waive all rights to object to any provision of this
Agreement.

 



-5-  14\. _Assignment_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the
benefit of the parties and their respective permitted successors and assigns.
This Agreement and the rights and obligations hereunder may not be assigned by
Buyer, the Sellers, Sellers Representative or Escrow Agent without the
express, prior written consent of all other parties; provided, however, that
any corporation to which substantially all of the corporate trust business of
Escrow Agent may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated,
or any corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to
which Escrow Agent shall be a party, or any corporation to which substantially
all of the corporate trust business of Escrow Agent may be transferred shall
be Escrow Agent under this Agreement without further act so long as such
entity assumes all of the obligations of Escrow Agent hereunder.

15\. _Waiver_. The rights and remedies of the parties to this Agreement are
cumulative and not alternative. Neither the failure nor any delay by any party
in exercising any right, power or privilege under this Agreement or the
documents referred to in this Agreement will operate as a waiver of such
right, power or privilege, and no single or partial exercise of any such
right, power or privilege will preclude any other or further exercise of such
right, power or privilege or the exercise of any other right, power or
privilege. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, (a) no waiver
that may be given by a party will be applicable except in the specific
instance for which it is given; and (b) no notice to or demand on one party
will be deemed to be a waiver of any obligation of such party or of the right
of the party giving such notice or demand to take further action without
notice or demand as provided in this Agreement or the documents referred to in
this Agreement.

 

16\. _Exclusive Agreement and Modification_. This Agreement supersedes all
prior agreements among the parties with respect to the subject matter of this
Agreement and constitutes (along with the documents referred to in this
Agreement) a complete and exclusive statement of the terms of the agreement
between the parties with respect to its subject matter. This Agreement may
not be amended except by a written agreement executed by Buyer, Sellers
Representative and Escrow Agent.

17\. _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the
State of Delaware, without regard to conflicts of law principles.
