(other than a claim that resulted in coverage of less than $200,000) made by a Group Company since the Incorporation Date through

limits have not been exhausted or, except as set forth in <U>Schedule&nbsp;3.14</U> of the Company Disclosure Letter, reduced excess

would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Except as disclosed in <U>Schedule&nbsp;3.11</U> of the Company

hereby. The Parties shall make, or cause to be made, as promptly as practicable, all filings necessary to obtain all Regulatory
Approvals other than the HSR Clearance. The Parties shall use their reasonable best efforts to: (a)&nbsp;respond to any requests
for additional information made by any Governmental Entity; (b)&nbsp;provide the other Party with a reasonable opportunity to review
and comment on any filing, submission, response to an information request or other (oral or written) communication to be submitted
or made to any Governmental Entity and such receiving Party shall consider any such received comments in good faith; (c)&nbsp;advise
the other Party (and, where applicable, provide a copy) of any written or oral communications that it receives from any Governmental
Entity in respect of such filings (including in respect of any supplementary filings or submissions) and otherwise in connection

any meetings with any Governmental Entity (subject to any opposition by a Governmental Entity to a particular party&rsquo;s participation
in such meeting) and participate in, or review, any material communication before it is made to any Governmental Entity. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, each Party has the right to redact or otherwise exclude a Party from receiving any confidential competitively sensitive
information otherwise required to be shared under this&nbsp;<U>Section&nbsp;7.02</U>,&nbsp;<U>provided</U>&nbsp;that such other

to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any Antitrust Law or competition or trade regulation Law that may be asserted
by any Governmental Entity or any other party so as to enable the Parties to close the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
as promptly as possible, including proposing, negotiating, committing to and effecting, by consent decree, order, hold separate
orders, or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or disposition of any of its assets, properties or businesses or of the assets, properties
or businesses to be acquired by it pursuant to this Agreement as are required to be divested, or otherwise offering to take or
offering to commit to take any action which it is capable of taking and if the offer is accepted, taking or committing to take
such action that limits its freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to retain, any of the businesses, services or assets
of Parent, the Surviving Company or their respective Subsidiaries, in each case, in order to avoid the entry of, or to effect the
dissolution of, any injunction, temporary restraining order or other Order in any suit or proceeding, which would otherwise have
the effect of materially delaying or preventing the consummation of the Merger contemplated by this Agreement. In addition, Parent
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to defend through litigation on the merits any claim asserted in court by any party
in order to avoid entry of, or to have vacated or terminated, any Order (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) that would
prevent the Closing. Any filing fee required in connection with seeking the Regulatory Approvals shall be paid one hundred percent

right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies in the Parent Trust or distributions therefrom, or make any claim

the waivers under this <U>Section&nbsp;7.07</U> will continue to apply at and after the Closing or termination of this Agreement

acknowledges that such irrevocable waiver is material to this Agreement and specifically relied upon by Parent to induce it to
enter into this Agreement. This <U>Section&nbsp;7.07</U> shall not limit the Company&rsquo;s right to seek specific performance
against Parent pursuant to <U>Section&nbsp;14.19</U>, including the right to seek specific performance against Parent to require

such counsel for all Indemnified Parties in connection with any Third Party Claim. All the Indemnified Parties shall cooperate

Indemnifying Party&rsquo;s request) the provision to the Indemnifying Party of records and information that are reasonably relevant
to such Third Party Claim, and making employees available (without charge) at such times and places as may be reasonably necessary
to defend against such Third Party Claim for the purpose of providing additional information, explanation or testimony in connection
with such Third Party Claim. If the Indemnifying Party elects not to control, defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal
with any Third Party Claim that relates to any Losses indemnified against hereunder, the Indemnified Party shall defend against,
negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with such Third Party Claim.</P>

Representative (as determined in a final and non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction) and arising out of or
in connection with the acceptance, performance or administration of the Stockholder Representative&rsquo;s duties under this Agreement.
Any expenses or taxable income incurred by the Stockholder Representative in connection with the performance of his or its duties
under this Agreement will not be the personal obligation of the Stockholder Representative but will be payable by and attributable

Agreement, the Stockholder Representative will be entitled and is hereby granted the right to set off and deduct any unpaid or
non-reimbursed expenses and unsatisfied Liabilities incurred by the Stockholder Representative in connection with the performance
of his or its duties hereunder from amounts actually delivered to the Stockholder Representative pursuant to this Agreement. The
Stockholder Representative may also from time to time submit invoices to the Company Stockholders (or to the Company (on behalf
of the Company Stockholders)) covering such expenses and Liabilities, which will be paid by the Company Stockholders (or the Company
(on behalf of the Company Stockholders)) promptly following the receipt thereof on a <I>pro rata</I> basis based on their respective
Pro Rata Share. Upon the request of any Company Stockholder, the Stockholder Representative will provide such Company Stockholder
with an accounting of all expenses and Liabilities paid by the Stockholder Representative in his or its capacity as such.</P>
