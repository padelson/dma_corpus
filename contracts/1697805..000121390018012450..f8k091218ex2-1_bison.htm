amended (the " _DGCL_ "), and Section 184 of the BVI Companies Act, and shall
no longer be considered a company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands
(the " _Domestication_ ");

  



  

WHEREAS, in furtherance of the acquisition of the issued and outstanding

---|---|--- 

 



    



  

WHEREAS, the Parties desire for U.S. federal income tax purposes that the
Merger qualify for the Intended Tax Treatment, that this Agreement
constitute a "plan of reorganization" for purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of
the Code and that Parent, the Company and Merger Sub will each be a "party to
the reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(b) of the Code.

  



  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants contained herein and
other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which
are hereby acknowledged, the Parties hereby agree as follows:

  



  

Article I 
 THE MERGER

  



  

1.01 _The Merger_

  



  

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, at the Effective Time, Merger
Sub will merge with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ ") in accordance
with the DGCL, whereupon the separate existence of Merger Sub will cease, and
the Company will be the surviving company (the " _Surviving Company_ ").

  



  

(b) At the Closing, the Company and Merger Sub will cause a certificate of
merger substantially in the form of _Exhibit A_ attached hereto (the "
_Certificate of Merger_ ") to be executed, acknowledged and filed with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and will make all other filings
or recordings required by the DGCL in connection with the Merger. The Merger
will become effective at such time on the Closing Date as the Certificate of
Merger is duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or
at such other time as specified in the Certificate of Merger (the " _Effective
Time_ ").

  



  

(c) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Company will succeed to
all the assets, rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises and be
subject to all of the Liabilities, restrictions, disabilities and duties of
the Company and Merger Sub, all as provided under the DGCL.

  



  

1.02 _Effect on Capital Stock_ Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
of this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger:

  



  

(a) The share transfer books of the Company will be closed, and thereafter
there will be no further registration of transfers of Company Stock
theretofore outstanding on the records of the Company. From and after the
Effective Time, the holders of the shares of Company Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will cease to have any
rights with respect thereto except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or
by Law.

  



  

(b) Each share of Company Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time (which excludes, in each case, Excluded Shares and
Dissenting Shares, if any) will be automatically converted into the right to
receive (i) the Per Share Closing Merger Consideration and (ii) the Per Share
Earnout Merger Consideration.

  



  

(c) Each share of Company Stock, if any, held immediately prior to the
Effective Time by the Company or Parent (collectively, the " _Excluded Shares_
") will be automatically canceled and no payment will be made with respect
thereto.

  



  

(d) Each share of common stock of Merger Sub that is issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time will be automatically converted
into and become one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of
common stock of the Surviving Company.

  



   

 | 2| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(e) Each outstanding Company Option (whether vested or unvested) shall be
assumed by Parent and automatically converted into an option to purchase
Parent Ordinary Shares (each, an " _Assumed Option_ "). Each Assumed Option
will be subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Company Stock
Incentive Plan, which shall be adopted by the Company prior to the Closing and
shall be assumed by Parent at the Effective Time (except any references
therein to Company or Company Common Stock will instead mean Parent
and Parent Ordinary Shares, respectively) and shall (i) constitute the right
to acquire a number of Parent Ordinary Shares equal to (as rounded down to
the nearest whole number) the product of (A) the Per Share Closing Merger
Consideration, multiplied by (B) the number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to the unexercised portion of such Company Option, (ii) be subject to
the same vesting schedule as the applicable Company Option, and (iii) have an
exercise price per share equal to (as rounded up to the nearest whole cent)
the quotient of (A) the exercise price per share of such Company Option prior
to its assumption, divided by (B) the Per Share Closing Merger Consideration.
The adjustments described herein shall, to the extent necessary to preserve
tax-qualified attributes (in the case of incentive stock options) and
exemption from Section 409A (for all options), be effected in a manner that
is consistent with Sections 409A and 424(a) of the Code. Prior to the
Effective Time, Parent and the Company shall adopt such resolutions as are
necessary to effect the treatment of the Company Options contemplated by
this  _Section 1.02(e)_. At the Effective Time, the Parent shall assume all
obligations of the Company under the Company Stock Incentive Plan, each
outstanding Company Option, and the agreements evidencing the grants thereof
and shall administer and honor all such awards in accordance with the terms
and conditions of such awards and the Company Stock Incentive Plan (subject to
the adjustments required by reason of this Agreement or such other
adjustments or amendments made by Parent in accordance with such terms and
conditions). Following the Closing, Parent shall notify each holder of
Company Options of the conversion of Company Options into Assumed
Options. Parent shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for
issuance a sufficient number of Parent Ordinary Shares for delivery upon
exercise of the Assumed Options to be issued for the Company Options in
accordance with this _Section 1.02(e)_.

  



  

1.03 _Organizational Documents_

  



  

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further
action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holders of
any shares of capital stock of any of the foregoing, the certificate of
incorporation of the Surviving Company will be amended and restated in its
entirety in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit B_ until thereafter amended,
subject to _Section 9.01_, in accordance with the provisions thereof and the
DGCL. At the Effective Time, the bylaws of the Surviving Company will be
amended and restated to be in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit C_ until
thereafter amended, subject to _Section 9.01_, in accordance with the
provisions thereof, the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Company
and the DGCL. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such amendment to the
certificate of incorporation or the bylaws of the Surviving Company will
diminish the exculpation, indemnification or expense advancement or
reimbursement provisions in respect of directors or officers of the Company or
any other Group Company that held office as of the date hereof in respect of
acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time.

  



  

(b) Subject to receipt of the Parent Shareholder Approval on the Parent
Proposals, on or prior to the date that is one Business Day prior to the
Closing Date, without any further action on the part of the Company, Parent
shall cause the Domestication to become effective, including by (i) filing
with the Delaware Secretary of State a Certificate of Domestication with
respect to the Domestication, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to
Parent and the Company, together with the Domesticated Parent Charter, in each
case in accordance with the provisions thereof and the DGCL, (ii) completing
and making and procuring all those filings required to be made with
the Registrar of Corporate Affairs in the British Virgin Islands under
Sections 184 (3) and (4) of the BVI Business Companies Act, 2004, and (iii)
obtaining a certificate of discontinuance from such Registrar of Corporate
Affairs in the British Virgin Islands. At the Effective Time, the bylaws of
Parent will be in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit N_ until thereafter
amended, subject to _Section 9.01_, in accordance with the provisions
thereof, the certificate of incorporation of Parent and the DGCL. Immediately
following the Closing, subject to receipt of the Parent Shareholder Approval
on the Parent Proposals, Domesticated Parent will file an amended and
restated certificate of incorporation of Domesticated Parent substantially in
the form of _Exhibit O_ and Domesticated Parent will adopt amended and
restated bylaws of Domesticated Parent substantially in the form of
_Exhibit P_ to take effect immediately following the Closing. Parent will use
commercially reasonable efforts, in accordance with applicable Law, to cause
Domesticated Parent to retain the benefits of the actions and filings of Pre-
Domestication Parent under the Federal Securities Laws.

appointed or otherwise designated in accordance with applicable Law, the
persons set forth on _Schedule 1.04(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter will
be the directors of the Surviving Company, and the officers of the Company at
the Effective Time will be the officers of the Surviving Company, each such
initial director and initial officer of the Surviving Company to hold office

Surviving Company as in effect from and after the Effective Time, and the
Surviving Company and Parent shall take any necessary actions (whether prior

effectuate or carry out the purpose of this _Section 1.04(a)_.

  



  

(b) At or prior to the Closing, Parent shall cause its board of directors,

upon the Effective Time: (i) elect to the board of directors of Parent the

following the election of the new directors, and all of the persons serving as
officers of Parent immediately prior to the Closing who are not set forth on
_Schedule 1.04(b)_ of the Parent Disclosure Letter shall resign

Governing Documents, that is reasonably necessary to effect any such election
or appointment of the designees of the Company to Parent's board of
directors, including mailing to Parent's shareholders an information statement
containing the information required by Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and
Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder at least 10 days prior to the Effective
Time. The Company shall supply Parent all information with respect to it and

14(f) and Rule 14f-1.

Company CEO, solely in such capacity and not in his personal capacity (the "
_Closing Certificate_ "), setting forth (a) a preliminary consolidated
balance sheet of the Group Companies as of the Reference Time, and (b) the
Company's good faith estimate of (i) Cash as of the Reference Time

Reference Time, including the Payoff Amount (the " _Closing Indebtedness_ "),
(iii) Company Transaction Expenses, and (iv) Working Capital as of the

delivered by the Company CEO will confirm in writing that it has been
prepared in good faith using the latest available financial information and
will include materials showing in reasonable detail the Company's support and
computations for the amounts included in the Closing Certificate and will
also include, consistent with the foregoing calculations, the Company's
determination of (1) the Closing Aggregate Merger Consideration and (2) the
Per Share Closing Merger Consideration (the " _Estimated Per Share Closing
Merger Consideration_ "). Parent shall be entitled to review and make
reasonable comments on the matters and amounts set forth in the Closing
Certificate so delivered by the Company CEO pursuant to this _Section
1.05(a)_. The Company will cooperate with Parent in the review of the Closing
Certificate, including providing Parent and its Representatives with
reasonable access to the relevant books, records and finance employees of the
Company. The Company will consider in good faith Parent's reasonable comments
to the Closing Certificate; _provided_ , that the Company shall make the
final determination of the amounts set forth in the Closing Certificate to
the extent there is any dispute in respect thereof.

(b) Within 45 days after the Closing Date, James Jiayuan Tong, as
representative of and on behalf of Parent (or, if Mr. Tong is unwilling or
unable to act pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, another representative
to be chosen by Parent upon written notice thereof to the
Stockholder Representative) (the " _Parent Representative_ "), shall prepare
or cause to be prepared, at Parent's expense, and deliver to the Stockholder
Representative, together with related supporting calculations and work papers
and back-up materials relating thereto (in the case of work papers and back-
up materials, as reasonably requested by the Stockholder's Representative), a
written statement setting forth in reasonable detail Parent's calculation of
the Closing Aggregate Merger Consideration and the Per Share Closing Merger
Consideration, together with (i) a consolidated balance sheet of the Group
Companies as of the Reference Time, prepared in accordance with the
Accounting Principles consistent with the preparation of the Latest Balance
Sheet, and (ii) Parent's calculations of (A) Closing Cash, (B) Closing
Indebtedness, (C) Company Transaction Expenses outstanding as of the
Reference Time, and (D) Closing Working Capital (such statement, together with
the balance sheet referred to in clause (i) above and the calculations in
clause (ii) above, being herein called the " _Final Closing Certificate_ ").
In the event the Parent Representative fails to timely deliver the Final
Closing Certificate pursuant to and in accordance with the terms hereof, the
Closing Certificate and all amounts reflected therein, including the Estimated
Per Share Closing Merger Consideration, shall be deemed final and binding on
the Parties.

  



  

(c) During the 30 day period immediately following the Stockholder
Representative's receipt of the Final Closing Certificate, the Stockholder
Representative and his representatives (including his financial advisors,
accountants and consultants) will be permitted to review, during
normal business hours and upon reasonable notice, Parent's books and records
and the working papers related to the preparation of the Final Closing
Certificate. The Final Closing Certificate (including the determinations
included therein) will become final, binding and conclusive upon Parent, the
Surviving Company and the Stockholder Representative (i) on the 30th day
following the Stockholder Representative's receipt thereof, unless the
Stockholder Representative delivers to Parent Representative prior to such
30th day written notice of the Stockholder Representative's disagreement (a "
_Dispute Notice_ ") with any amount or determination set forth in the Final
Closing Certificate or (ii) on such earlier date as the Stockholder
Representative notifies the Parent Representative in writing that it does not
dispute the Final Closing Certificate. Any Dispute Notice will specify in
reasonable detail the nature and dollar amount of any disagreement so asserted
(collectively, the " _Disputed Items_ "). If the Stockholder Representative
timely delivers a Dispute Notice to the Parent Representative, then the
determination of the Closing Aggregate Merger Consideration, Per Share
Closing Merger Consideration, Closing Cash, Closing Working Capital,
Closing Indebtedness, and Company Transaction Expenses will become final,
binding and conclusive upon Parent, the Surviving Company and the Stockholder
Representative on the first to occur of (x) the date on which the Parent
Representative and the Stockholder Representative resolve in writing all
differences they have with respect to the Disputed Items and (y) the date on
which all of the Disputed Items that are not resolved by the Parent
Representative and the Stockholder Representative in writing are finally
resolved in writing by the Accounting Firm in accordance with _Section
1.05(d)_. The Stockholder Representative shall be deemed to have agreed with
any amounts and items contained in the Final Closing Certificate to the extent
such amounts and items are not raised in the Dispute Notice.

  



   

 | 5| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(d) During the 15 days following delivery of a Dispute Notice, the Parent
Representative and the Stockholder Representative will seek in good faith
to resolve in writing any differences that they have with respect to all of
the Disputed Items. Unless otherwise agreed by the Parent Representative and
the Stockholder Representative, any such discussions related thereto shall be
governed by Rule 408 of the Federal Rules of Evidence and any applicable
similar state rule. If the Parent Representative and the Stockholder
Representative do not reach agreement on all of the Disputed Items during
such 15-day period (or such longer period as they shall mutually agree),
then at the end of such 15-day (or such longer period as they shall mutually
agree) period the Parent Representative and the Stockholder Representative
will submit all unresolved Disputed Items (collectively, the " _Unresolved
Items_ ") to BDO USA, LLP or, if such firm is unable to serve in such
capacity, to such other nationally recognized independent public accountant
(or, if none is available, a nationally recognized consulting or valuation
firm) that is not providing (and during the preceding two year period has not
provided) services to the Company or Parent or any of their Affiliates and
that is mutually agreeable to the Stockholder Representative and the Parent
Representative (or, if the Stockholder Representative and the Parent
Representative are unable to agree on the choice of such accounting,
consulting or valuation firm as applicable, then such firm will be selected
by lot, after the Stockholder Representative and the Parent Representative
each submits two proposed firms and then excludes one firm designated by the
other party) (the firm actually retained pursuant to this sentence, the "
_Accounting Firm_ ") for resolution. The Parent Representative and the
Stockholder Representative shall instruct the Accounting Firm (i) not to
assign a value to any item in dispute greater than the greatest value or
lower than the lowest value assigned by the Parent Representative or the
Stockholder Representative, and (ii) to make a final determination (the "
_Final Determination_ ") not later than 30 calendar days following submission
of the Unresolved Items to the Accounting Firm. The Accounting Firm shall set
forth the Final Determination in a written opinion. The Accounting Firm shall
make the Final Determination based solely on presentations by the Parent
Representative and the Stockholder Representative and not on the basis of
independent review. The Final Determination will be final, binding and
conclusive on Parent, the Parent Representative, the Surviving Company and the
Stockholder Representative with respect to the Unresolved Items effective as
of the date the Accounting Firm's written determination is received by the
Parent Representative and the Stockholder Representative. The Accounting
Firm's determination shall not be subject to review or appeal, absent a
showing of fraud or manifest error. The costs, fees and disbursements of the
Accounting Firm shall be paid by the Surviving Company. The final judgment of
the Accounting Firm may be entered into any court having jurisdiction
over the issues addressed in the arbitration.

  



  

(e) Upon the determination, in accordance with _Section 1.05(b)_ , _Section
1.05(c)_ and _Section 1.05(d)_ above, of the Final Closing Certificate and
any Final Determination made, the Per Share Closing Merger Consideration shall
be recalculated using the amounts so determined pursuant to _Section 1.05(c)_
and _Section 1.05(d)_ above in lieu of the amounts used in the Closing
Certificate. If the final Per Share Closing Merger Consideration is greater
than the Estimated Per Share Closing Merger Consideration, then Parent shall
promptly issue to each Company Stockholder a number of Parent Ordinary Shares
(rounded down to the nearest whole share) equal to the excess of (i) the
number of Parent Ordinary Shares issuable to such Company Stockholder based on
the final Per Share Closing Merger Consideration over (ii) the number of
Parent Ordinary Shares issued to such Company Stockholder based on the
Estimated Per Share Closing Merger Consideration. If the final Per Share
Closing Merger Consideration is less than the Estimated Per Share
Closing Merger Consideration, then Parent and the Stockholder Representative
shall promptly deliver a joint written instruction to the Escrow Agent to
release to Parent from the Escrow Account the lesser of (x) the excess of (i)
the total number of Parent Ordinary Shares issued to the Company Stockholders
based on the Estimated Per Share Closing Merger Consideration over (ii) the
total number of Parent Ordinary Shares issuable to the Company based on the
final Per Share Closing Merger Consideration (such excess, the "
_Return Amount_ "), and (y) the total number of Escrow Shares, it being
understood and agreed that Parent's sole recourse with respect to the Return
Amount shall be the Escrow Shares.

1.06 _Dissenting Shares_ If applicable, and to the extent available under
Section 262 of the DGCL, any share of capital stock of the Company that is
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that is
held by a Company Stockholder who did not consent to or vote (by a valid
and enforceable proxy or otherwise) in favor of the approval of this
Agreement, or execute an enforceable waiver of appraisal rights to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, which Company Stockholder complies with all of
the provisions of the DGCL relevant to the exercise and perfection of
appraisal rights (such share being a " _Dissenting Share_ ," and such Company
Stockholder being a " _Dissenting Stockholder_ "), will not be converted into
the right to receive the consideration to which the Dissenting Stockholder
would be entitled pursuant to _Section 1.02_, but rather will be converted
into the right to receive such consideration as may be determined to be due
with respect to such Dissenting Share pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL. If
any Dissenting Stockholder fails to perfect such Company Stockholder's
dissenters' rights under the DGCL or effectively withdraws or otherwise loses
such rights with respect to any Dissenting Shares, such Dissenting Shares
will thereupon automatically be converted into the right to receive the
consideration referred to in _Section 1.02_, subject to the payment
procedures set forth in _Section 1.07_ and _Section 1.08_ and will no longer
be Dissenting Shares for purposes of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if the Merger is rescinded or
abandoned, then the right of a Company Stockholder to be paid the fair value
of such holder's Dissenting Shares pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL will
cease. At the Effective Time, any Dissenting Stockholder shall cease to have
any rights with respect to any Dissenting Shares, except the rights provided
in Section 262 of the DGCL. The Company will not voluntarily make any payment
with respect to any demand for appraisal with respect to any Dissenting Shares
without the prior written consent of Parent (which consent may or may not be
given in the sole and absolute discretion of Parent).

  



  

1.07 _Withholding_ Notwithstanding any provision contained herein to the
contrary, each of Parent and the Exchange Agent will be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any holder of Company
Stock pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it is required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment under any provision of
Code, or under any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law; _provided_
that no withholding will be made if Parent or the Exchange Agent, as
applicable, receives a properly completed Internal Revenue Service Form W-8
or W-9 from the applicable recipient. Any amount properly deducted or
withheld pursuant to this _Section 1.07_ will be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to such Person in respect of such
deduction and withholding. At least five (5) Business Days prior to the
Closing, Parent or the Exchange agent, as applicable, will (a) notify the
Stockholder Representative and the Company Stockholders of any anticipated
withholding, (b) consult with the Stockholder Representative in good faith to
determine whether such deduction and withholding is required and (c)
cooperate with the Stockholder Representative and the Company Stockholders to
minimize the amount of any applicable withholding. Each of Parent and the
Exchange Agent will pay, or will cause to be paid, all amounts so deducted or
withheld to the appropriate taxing authority within the period required under
applicable Law.

  



  

1.08 _Payment Methodology_

  



  

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Exchange Agent will enter
into an exchange agent agreement substantially in the form of _Exhibit
D_ attached hereto (the " _Exchange Agent Agreement_ "), and at or prior to
the Effective Time, Parent shall make available to the Exchange Agent the
Merger Consideration Shares to be paid in respect of the Company Stock
pursuant to _Section 1.08(b)_.

  



   

 | 7| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) After the Closing, promptly following delivery by a Company Stockholder
(other than any Person who was a record holder of Excluded Shares or
Dissenting Shares immediately prior to the Effective Time, solely with
respect to such Excluded Shares or Dissenting Shares) to the Exchange Agent
of a duly completed and executed letter of transmittal and certificates
representing shares of Company Stock, along with a properly completed
Internal Revenue Service Form W-9 (or if applicable, the appropriate Internal
Revenue Service Form W-8 or Form W-8BEN), substantially in the form of
_Exhibit E_ attached hereto (a " _Letter of Transmittal_ "), subject to the
satisfaction of any other conditions to be met as set forth in the Letter of
Transmittal, Parent will promptly issue to such Company Stockholder (and
Parent will direct the Exchange Agent to take all necessary action to record
and effect the same) the number of Parent Ordinary Shares equal to the
Estimated Per Share Closing Merger Consideration multiplied by the number
of shares of Company Stock held of record by such Company Stockholder (less
such Company Stockholder's Pro Rata Share of the Escrow Shares) immediately
prior to the Effective Time. Any portion of the Closing Parent Share
Consideration remaining unclaimed by the Company Stockholders three (3) years
after the Closing Date (or if earlier, immediately prior to such time when the
amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental
Entity) will become, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the property
of the Surviving Company free and clear of any claims or interest of any
Person previously entitled thereto.

  



  

(c) With respect to the Earnout Parent Share Consideration, promptly
following the determination that the Earnout Parent Share Consideration is
payable pursuant to _Annex I_ hereto, Parent will (i) cause to be
transferred to the Exchange Agent from the Earnout Escrow Account pursuant to
_Section 1.10(c)_ the Earnout Parent Share Consideration (less the Earnout
Escrow Shares) and (ii) cause the Exchange Agent to disburse to each Company
Stockholder (other than any Person who was a record holder of Excluded Shares
or Dissenting Shares immediately prior to the Effective Time) that has
delivered a duly executed and completed Letter of Transmittal, the number
of Parent Ordinary Shares equal to the Per Share Earnout Merger Consideration
(less each such Company Stockholder's Pro Rata Share of the Earnout Escrow
Shares) multiplied by the number of shares of Company Stock held of record by
such Company Stockholder immediately prior to the Effective Time (and Parent
and the Stockholder Representative will deliver such instructions to the
Escrow Agent and the Exchange Agent as are necessary to effect the same, and
will direct the Exchange Agent to take all necessary action to record and
effect the same). Any portion of the Earnout Parent Share Consideration (to
the extent payable pursuant to this Agreement and _Annex I_ hereto)
remaining unclaimed by the Company Stockholders three (3) years after the date
after the applicable Parent Ordinary Shares are required to be released from
the Earnout Escrow Account pursuant to _Annex I_ hereto (or if earlier,
immediately prior to such time when the amounts would otherwise escheat to or
become property of any Governmental Entity) will become, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, the property of Parent free and clear of any
claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

  



  

(d) Subject to _Section 1.10(a)_ , any Merger Consideration Share that is to
be issued to a Company Stockholder under this Agreement will be issued
directly to such Company Stockholder of record in accordance with the
instructions specified by such holder in its Letter of Transmittal. In no
event shall any fractional shares of Merger Consideration Shares be issued
under this Agreement (with any fractional share that would otherwise be
issued rounded to the nearest whole share; _provided_ , _however_ , that in
the event such rounding to the nearest whole share would result in the
aggregate number of Parent Ordinary Shares being issued to the Company
Stockholders under this Agreement being greater or less than the aggregate
number of Parent Ordinary Shares equal to the Merger Consideration Shares,
then one or more fractional shares that may otherwise be issued to one or more
Company Stockholders may be rounded as necessary using such alternative
rounding methodology as mutually agreed upon between the Stockholder
Representative and Parent to result in the aggregate number of Parent
Ordinary Shares being issued to the Company Stockholders under this Agreement
being equal to the Merger Consideration Shares). If any portion of the Merger
Consideration Shares is to be issued to a Person other than the Person in
whose name the relevant Company Stock were registered immediately prior to the
Effective Time, it shall be a condition to such delivery that (i) the
transfer of such Company Stock shall have been permitted in accordance with
the terms of the Company Governing Documents, as in effect immediately prior
to the Effective Time, (ii) such Company Stock certificate shall be properly
endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer and, (iii) the
recipient of such portion of the Merger Consideration Shares, or the Person
in whose name such portion of the Merger Consideration Shares are issued,
shall have already executed and delivered counterparts to the Lock-Up
Agreement in substantially the form attached hereto as _Exhibit F_ (the "
_Lock-Up Agreement_ "), Registration Rights Agreement in substantially the
formed attached hereto as _Exhibit G_ (the " _Registration Rights Agreement_
"), and such other documents as are reasonably deemed necessary by the
Surviving Company or Parent and (iv) the Person requesting such delivery
shall pay to the Parent any transfer or other Taxes required as a result of
such delivery to a Person other than the registered holder of such Company
Stock Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of the Surviving Company
and Parent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

  



   

 | 8| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(e) None of Parent, the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Company nor their
Affiliates will be liable to any Company Stockholder for any Merger
Consideration Shares paid to any public official pursuant to applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws.

  



  

1.09 _Accredited or Sophisticated Investors or Regulation S Investors_
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Parent shall not
be obligated to issue Parent Ordinary Shares to any Company Stockholder that
is not (a) a Confirmed Accredited Investor or (b) a Regulation S Investor.

  



  

1.10 _Escrow and Earnout Parent Share Consideration_

  



  

(a) At or prior to the Closing, Parent, the Stockholder Representative and an
escrow agent mutually acceptable to Parent and the Company, acting
reasonably (the " _Escrow Agent_ "), shall enter into an Escrow Agreement,
effective as of the Effective Time, substantially in the form attached hereto
as _Exhibit H_ (the " _Escrow Agreement_ "), pursuant to which Parent
shall deposit with the Escrow Agent at the Closing three percent (3%) of the
Closing Parent Share Consideration that would otherwise be issued to the
Company Stockholders in the Merger (together with any Earnout Escrow Shares
and any equity securities into which such Closing Parent Share Consideration
or Earnout Escrow Shares are exchanged or converted (including pursuant to the
Domestication), the " _Escrow Shares_ ") to be held by the Escrow Agent in a
segregated escrow account (the " _Escrow Account_ ") and disbursed therefrom
in accordance with the terms the Escrow Agreement. The Escrow Shares to be
deposited in the Escrow Account shall be issued in the name of the Company
Stockholders who would otherwise have received those shares in the Merger (in
restricted book entry form). The Escrow Shares will appear as issued and
outstanding on Parent's balance sheet and will be legally outstanding under
the DGCL. Any dividends, distributions or other income paid on or otherwise
accruing to any Escrow Shares shall be distributed by the Escrow Agent to the
Stockholder Representative for payment to the Company Stockholders on a
current basis. While the Escrow Shares are held in the Escrow Account, each
Company Stockholder shall be entitled to vote all Escrow Shares that have been
issued in such Company Stockholder's name. Any Escrow Shares that are
disbursed from the Escrow Account to any Person in accordance with this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement shall be transferred by the Escrow Agent to
such Person from the Escrow Account. The Escrow Shares shall serve as
security for, and the exclusive source of payment of, Parent's indemnity
rights pursuant to  _Article X_ and any excess of the Estimated Per Share
Closing Merger Consideration over the final Per Share Closing
Merger Consideration as provided in _Section 1.05_. Unless otherwise required
by Law, all distributions made from the Escrow Account shall be treated by
the Parties as an adjustment to the Closing Parent Share Consideration
received by the Company Stockholders pursuant to _Article I_ hereof. For U.S.
federal, state and local income tax purposes and foreign tax purposes, the
Parties shall treat the Escrow Shares, and all dividends, earnings or income,
if any, earned with respect to the Escrow Shares while held by the Escrow
Agent, as owned by the Company Stockholders until such time as it is released.

  



   

 | 9| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) No claim for indemnification may be made against the Escrow Shares after
the date which is eighteen (18) months after the Closing Date (the "
_Expiration Date_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that if prior to the
Expiration Date, Parent notifies the Escrow Agent and the Stockholder
Representative in writing that all or a portion of the Escrow Shares are
subject to indemnification claims made in accordance with _Article X_ hereof
on or prior to the Expiration Date that remain unresolved at the time of the
Expiration Date (" _Pending Claims_ "), the portion of the Escrow Shares
subject to such Pending Claims (as determined based on the amount of the
indemnification claim included in the Claim Notice provided by Parent under
_Article X_ and the Parent Share Price as of the Expiration Date) shall
remain in the Escrow Account until such time as such Pending Claim shall have
been finally resolved pursuant to the provisions of _Article X_. On the first
Business Day following the Expiration Date, any Escrow Shares remaining in
the Escrow Account that are not subject to Pending Claims, if any, and not
subject to resolved but unpaid claims in favor of an Indemnified Party, shall
be transferred by the Escrow Agent to the Company Stockholders that have
previously delivered the Letters of Transmittal to Parent in accordance with
_Section 1.08_, with each such Company Stockholder receiving its Pro Rata
Share of such Escrow Shares in accordance with the Escrow Agreement. If at any
time after the Expiration Date the value of the Escrow Shares then held by
the Escrow Agent (based on the Parent Share Price as of the Expiration Date)
exceeds the sum of any amounts subject to the Pending Claims or resolved but
unpaid claims in favor of an Indemnified Party, Parent and the Stockholder's
Representative shall promptly execute and deliver a certificate requesting the
Escrow Agent to deliver such excess amount to the Company Stockholders as
provided in the previous sentence.

  



  

(c) At the Closing, Parent shall deposit with the Escrow Agent the Earnout
Parent Share Consideration to be held by the Escrow Agent in a segregated
escrow account (the " _Earnout Escrow Account_ ") and disbursed therefrom in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement. The
Earnout Parent Share Consideration to be deposited in the Earnout Escrow
Account shall be issued, on the basis of the Per Share Earnout Merger
Consideration allocable to each Company Stockholder pursuant to _Section
1.08(c)_ , in the name of the Company Stockholders who would receive the
Earnout Parent Share Consideration pursuant to _Section 1.08(c)_  (in
restricted book entry form). The Earnout Parent Share Consideration will
appear as issued and outstanding on Parent's balance sheet and will be
legally outstanding under the DGCL. Any dividends, distributions or other
income paid on or otherwise accruing to the Earnout Parent Share
Consideration shall be distributed by the Escrow Agent to the Stockholder
Representative for payment to the Company Stockholders on a current basis.
While the Earnout Escrow Shares are held in the Earnout Escrow Account, each
Company Stockholder shall be entitled to vote all Earnout Escrow Shares that
have been issued in such Company Stockholder's name. Promptly following the
determination that the Earnout Parent Share Consideration is payable pursuant
to _Annex I_ hereto, the Earnout Parent Share Consideration shall be
transferred by the Escrow Agent from the Earnout Escrow Account to
the Exchange Agent, for further distribution to the Company Stockholders in
accordance with _Section 1.08(c)_ and the Exchange Agent Agreement;
_provided_ , that three percent (3%) of the Earnout Parent Share Consideration
shall be deposited by the Escrow Agent in the Escrow Account (the " _Earnout
Escrow Shares_ ") as additional Escrow Shares to be held by the Escrow Agent
in accordance with _Section 1.10(a)_ and the Escrow Agreement (and Parent and
the Stockholder Representative will deliver such instructions to the Escrow
Agent and the Exchange Agent as are necessary to effect the same). If the
Earnout Parent Share Consideration does not become payable within the time
period provided therefor in _Annex I_ hereto, Parent and the
Stockholder Representative will jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to transfer
the Earnout Parent Share Consideration from the Earnout Escrow Account to
Parent and Parent shall cancel all shares constituting the Earnout Parent
Share Consideration. For U.S. federal, state and local income tax purposes
and foreign tax purposes, the Parties shall treat the Earnout Parent Share
Consideration, and all dividends earnings or income, if any, earned with
respect to the Earnout Parent Share Consideration while held by the Escrow
Agent, as owned by the Company Stockholders until such time as it is
released.

Stock as of the date hereof, the Company will provide Parent with a duly

---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(c) As soon as practicable after the Proxy Statement is "cleared" by the SEC,
Parent shall cause the Proxy Statement to be disseminated to holders of
Parent Ordinary Shares. Concurrently with such dissemination, Parent shall
commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) the Offer
by disseminating the other Offer Documents to the holders of Parent Ordinary

Law, and any applicable rules and regulations of the SEC. In accordance
with the Parent Governing Documents, the proceeds held in the Parent Trust

(d) Parent shall not terminate or withdraw the Offer other than in connection
with the valid termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Article XI_.
Parent shall extend the Offer for any minimum period required by any rule,
regulation, interpretation or position of the SEC, Nasdaq or the respective

the Offer in accordance with this Agreement, Parent shall, promptly after the
Closing, pay such redeeming Parent Securityholder, on a pro rata basis, cash
equal to the applicable Per-Share Redemption Price.

federal securities laws and the rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated
thereunder or otherwise (the " _Federal Securities Laws_ "), the DGCL and the
NASDAQ rules. The Company shall promptly provide to Parent such information
concerning the Company, any Group Company and the Company Stockholders as is
either required by the Federal Securities Laws or reasonably requested by
Parent for inclusion in the Offer Documents, including, if applicable, the
Required Information. Parent shall provide copies of the proposed forms of
the Offer Documents (including any amendments or supplements thereto) to the
Company and its Representatives as soon as practicable such that the Company
and its Representatives are afforded a reasonable amount of time prior to the
dissemination or filing thereof to review such material and comment thereon,
and Parent shall reasonably consider in good faith any comments of such
Persons. Parent and the Company shall respond promptly to any comments of the
SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer Documents and promptly correct any
information provided by it for use in the Offer Documents if and to the extent
that such information shall have become false or misleading in any material
respect or as otherwise required by the Federal Securities Laws. Parent
shall amend or supplement, as promptly as practicable, the Offer Documents
and cause the Offer Documents, as so amended or supplemented, to be filed
with the SEC and to be disseminated to the holders of Parent Ordinary Shares,
in each case as and to the extent required by the Federal Securities Laws and
subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the applicable
Parent Governing Documents. Parent shall provide the Company with copies of
any written comments, and shall inform the Company of any material oral
comments, that Parent or any of its Representatives receive from the SEC or
its staff with respect to the Offer Documents promptly after the receipt of
such comments and shall give the Company and its Representatives a reasonable
opportunity prior to responding thereto to review and comment on any proposed
written or material oral responses to such comments. Parent shall reasonably
consider in good faith any such comments of such Persons. Parent shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to "clear" comments from the SEC and its
staff with respect to the Offer Documents and to permit the Company to
participate with Parent or its Representatives in any discussions or meetings
with the SEC and its staff regarding the Offer Documents. The Company shall,
and shall cause each of the Group Companies to, make their respective
directors, officers and employees and use commercially reasonable efforts to
make their accountants, in each case upon reasonable advance notice,
reasonably available to Parent and its Representatives in connection with the
drafting of the public filings with respect to the Merger (including the Offer
Documents) and responding in a timely manner to comments thereon from the SEC
or its staff.

(f) If at any time prior to the Effective Time, any information relating to
Parent, or the Company, or any of their respective Subsidiaries,
Affiliates, officers or directors, should be discovered by the Company or
Parent, as applicable, that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement
to the Offer Documents, so that such documents would not include any
misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading, the Party which discovers such information shall
promptly notify each other Party hereto and an appropriate amendment or
supplement describing such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC
and, to the extent required by law, disseminated to the Parent shareholders.

  



  

(g) Notwithstanding anything else to the contrary in this Agreement or any
Transaction Document, Parent may make any public filing with respect to the
Merger to the extent required by applicable Law.

  



  

7.02 _Regulatory Filings_. Within twenty (20) Business Days after the date
hereof, the Parties shall make, or cause to be made, the filing required (if
any) of each of them or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates
under the HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby. The
Parties shall make, or cause to be made, as promptly as practicable, all
filings necessary to obtain all Regulatory Approvals other than the HSR
Clearance. The Parties shall use their reasonable best efforts to: (a) respond
to any requests for additional information made by any Governmental Entity;
(b) provide the other Party with a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment on any filing, submission, response to an information request or other
(oral or written) communication to be submitted or made to any Governmental
Entity and such receiving Party shall consider any such received comments in
good faith; (c) advise the other Party (and, where applicable, provide a
copy) of any written or oral communications that it receives from any
Governmental Entity in respect of such filings (including in respect of any
supplementary filings or submissions) and otherwise in connection with
satisfying the Regulatory Approvals; and (d) provide the other Party with a
reasonable opportunity to participate in any meetings with any Governmental
Entity (subject to any opposition by a Governmental Entity to a particular
party's participation in such meeting) and participate in, or review, any
material communication before it is made to any Governmental Entity.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Party has the right to redact or
otherwise exclude a Party from receiving any confidential competitively
sensitive information otherwise required to be shared under this _Section
7.02_, _provided_ that such other Party's external counsel shall be
entitled to receive such confidential competitively sensitive information on
an external counsel only basis. The Parties shall: (i) not agree to an
extension of any waiting period or review being undertaken by a Governmental
Entity without the other Party's prior written consent; (ii) cause any
applicable waiting periods to terminate or expire at the earliest possible
date; and (iii) resist vigorously, at their respective cost and expense, any
Order challenging the completion of the Merger or any temporary or permanent
injunction which could delay or prevent the Closing, all to the end of
expediting consummation of the Merger contemplated herein. Without limiting
the generality of Parent's undertaking pursuant to this _Section 7.02_,
Parent agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to take any and all steps
necessary to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any Antitrust
Law or competition or trade regulation Law that may be asserted by any
Governmental Entity or any other party so as to enable the Parties to close
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as possible,
including proposing, negotiating, committing to and effecting, by consent
decree, order, hold separate orders, or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or
disposition of any of its assets, properties or businesses or of the assets,
properties or businesses to be acquired by it pursuant to this Agreement as
are required to be divested, or otherwise offering to take or offering to
commit to take any action which it is capable of taking and if the offer is
accepted, taking or committing to take such action that limits its freedom of
action with respect to, or its ability to retain, any of the businesses,
services or assets of Parent, the Surviving Company or their respective
Subsidiaries, in each case, in order to avoid the entry of, or to effect
the dissolution of, any injunction, temporary restraining order or other
Order in any suit or proceeding, which would otherwise have the effect of
materially delaying or preventing the consummation of the Merger contemplated
by this Agreement. In addition, Parent shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to defend through litigation on the merits any claim asserted in court
by any party in order to avoid entry of, or to have vacated or terminated,
any Order (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) that would prevent
the Closing. Any filing fee required in connection with seeking the Regulatory
Approvals shall be paid one hundred percent (100%) by the Company as a
Company Transaction Expense. This _Section 7.02_ shall not apply with respect
to Tax matters.

promptly as practicable, in accordance with applicable Law and the Parent
Governing Documents, after the Proxy Statement is "cleared" by the SEC.

Agreement). For the avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, the waivers under this _Section 7.07_ will
continue to apply at and after the Closing or termination of this
Agreement (as applicable) to distributions made to redeeming Public
Shareholders and for transaction expenses paid. The Company agrees
and acknowledges that such irrevocable waiver is material to this Agreement
and specifically relied upon by Parent to induce it to enter into this
Agreement. This _Section 7.07_ shall not limit the Company's right to seek
specific performance against Parent pursuant to _Section 14.19_, including
the right to seek specific performance against Parent to require Parent to
take such actions contemplated by this Agreement subject to the satisfaction
of Parent's conditions to the Closing in _Section 8.01_, and to comply with
the terms of the Parent Trust Agreement, including distribution of funds from
the Parent Trust upon the Closing in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement.

shareholders related to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Parent will, and will cause its Subsidiaries to, cease and cause to be
terminated any existing discussions, communications or negotiations with any

Article IX 
 INDEMNIFICATION OF OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY

  



  

9.01 _Indemnification of Officers and Directors of the Company_. If the
Closing occurs, Parent shall cause all rights to indemnification and
advancement of expenses and all limitations on liability existing in favor of
any employee, officer or director of any of the Group Companies
(collectively, the " _Company Indemnitees_ "), as provided in the
Organizational Documents of the applicable Group Company, to survive the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and continue in full
force and effect and be honored by the Surviving Company and Parent after the
Closing. After the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Company shall
maintain in effect the exculpation, indemnification and advancement of
expenses provisions of (i) the Surviving Company's certificate of
incorporation as in effect immediately after the Effective Time (the form of
which is attached hereto as Exhibit B), (ii) the Surviving Company's by-laws
as in effect immediately after the Effective Time (the form of which is
attached hereto as Exhibit C), (iii) any certificate of incorporation, by-laws
or similar organizational documents of each other Group Company as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time and (iv) any indemnification
agreements of any Group Company with any of their respective directors,
officers or employees as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time, and in each case of clauses (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) shall not amend,
repeal or otherwise modify any such provisions in any manner that would
adversely affect the rights thereunder of any individuals who at the Effective
Time were current or former directors, officers or employees of any Group
Company. The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Company under this
_Section 9.01_  shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to
adversely affect any Company Indemnitee to whom this _Section 9.01_  applies
without the consent of such affected Company Indemnitee (it being expressly
agreed that the Company Indemnitees to whom this _Section 9.01_ applies shall
be intended third party beneficiaries of this _Section 9.01_ ). If the Closing
occurs, Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to pay all expenses to any
Company Indemnitee incurred in successfully enforcing the indemnity or other
obligations provided for in this _Section 9.01_.

  



  

   

 | 49| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

9.02 _Indemnification by Successors and Assigns_. In the event Parent, the
Surviving Company or any of their respective successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets
or stock or other equity interests to any Person, then and in each such case,
Parent shall ensure that proper provision shall be made so that the
successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Company, as the case may be
(or their respective successors and assigns), shall assume the obligations
set forth in this _Article IX_.

  



  

9.03 _Tail Policy_. The Company shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to,
obtain at its or their expense a "tail" directors' and officers' liability
insurance policy, effective for a period of at least six (6) years from the
Closing Date, for the benefit of the Group Companies or any of their officers
and directors, as the case may be, with respect to claims arising from facts
or events that occurred on or before the Closing Date. Fifty percent of the
cost of the insurance policy shall be treated as a Company
Transaction Expense and fifty percent of the cost of the insurance policy
shall be treated as a Parent Transaction Expense. Parent shall cause such
"tail" policy to be maintained in full force and effect, for its full term,
and cause the Surviving Company to honor all obligations thereunder.

  



  

Article X 
 INDEMNIFICATION BY COMPANY STOCKHOLDERS

  



  

10.01 _Indemnification by Company Stockholders_.

  



  

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this _Article X_ , if the Closing
occurs, the Company Stockholders (collectively, the " _Indemnifying Parties_
") will severally, but not jointly or jointly and severally, indemnify, defend
and hold harmless Parent, its Affiliates and their respective officers,
directors, managers, employees, successors and permitted assigns (each, with
respect to any claim made pursuant to this Agreement, the " _Indemnified
Party_ ") from and against any and all Losses paid, suffered or incurred by,
or imposed upon an Indemnified Party to the extent arising in whole or in part
out of or resulting directly or indirectly from (whether or not involving a
Third Party Claim): (i) the breach of any representation or warranty made by
the Company set forth in _Article III_ ; or (ii) the breach of any covenant
or agreement on the part of the Company set forth in this Agreement to be
performed prior to or at the Closing.

  



  

(b) Any indemnification claims by an Indemnified Party pursuant to _Section
10.01(a)_ shall be paid with the Escrow Shares then remaining in the
Escrow Account. With respect to any such indemnification payment, the value
of each Escrow Share for purposes of determining the indemnification payment
shall be the Parent Share Price on the date that the indemnification claim is
finally determined in accordance with this  _Article X_. For successful
indemnification claims by an Indemnified Party, within five (5) Business Days
after the indemnification claim is finally determined in accordance with this
_Article X_ , the Escrow Agent shall disburse and transfer a number of Escrow
Shares, valued at the Parent Share Price, equal to the amount of such
indemnification claim (as determined in accordance with this _Article X_ )
from the Escrow Account to Parent (and Parent and the Stockholder
Representative will provide or cause to be provided to the Escrow Agent any
written instructions or other information or documents required by the Escrow
Agent to do so).

  



  

   

 | 50| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

10.02 _Limitations and General Indemnification Provisions_.

  



  

(a) Except in the case of Fraud by a Group Company, the maximum aggregate
amount of indemnification payments which the Indemnifying Parties will be
obligated to pay in the aggregate under _Section 10.01_ shall not exceed the
Escrow Shares in the Escrow Account (valued at the applicable Parent Share
Price).

  



  

(b) Except in the case of Fraud by a Group Company, the sole and exclusive
recourse for any amount finally determined to be owed in respect of any
indemnity obligations pursuant to this _Article X_ shall be made only by
disbursement of Escrow Shares out of the Escrow Account, no other assets
shall in any respect be used to satisfy such indemnity obligations, and once
the Escrow Account shall be depleted or released, such indemnity obligations
shall terminate.

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the Company Stockholders shall
not have any indemnification obligations for Losses under _Section 10.01(a)_
 unless the aggregate amount of all such Losses for which such Indemnifying
Party would, but for this _Section 10.02(c)_ , be liable thereunder exceeds
on an aggregate basis $500,000, and then only to the extent of such excess.

  



  

(d) For purposes of calculating the amount of any Loss arising from a breach
of any representation or warranty subject to indemnification under _Section
10.01(a)_  (but not for purposes of determining whether any such breach has
occurred), all "material", "materially", "in all material respects",
"Material Adverse Effect", and other like qualifications shall be disregarded.

  



  

(e) In the event Parent proceeds with the Closing notwithstanding actual
knowledge by Parent or any Affiliate of Parent at or prior to the Closing
(as evidenced in a writing, either from the Company to Parent or from Parent
to the Company) of any breach by the Company of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement in _Article III_ or in any certificate delivered by the
Company pursuant hereto, no Indemnified Party shall have any claim or
recourse against the Company Stockholders or the Escrow Account with respect
to such breach, under this _Article X_ or otherwise.

  



  

(f) The amount of any Losses suffered or incurred by any Indemnified Party
shall be reduced by the amount of any insurance proceeds or other third
party sources of indemnity or recovery paid to the Indemnified Party or any
Affiliate thereof as a reimbursement with respect to such Losses, net of the
costs of collection and the increases in insurance premiums resulting from
such Loss or insurance payment.

  



  

(g) Each Indemnified Party agrees that in the event of any breach giving rise
to an indemnification obligation under this _Article X_ , such
Indemnified Party shall take and shall cause its Affiliates to take, or
cooperate with the Indemnifying Parties if so requested by the
Indemnifying Party, in order to take, commercially reasonable steps to
mitigate any of its Losses upon becoming aware of any event or
condition which could reasonably be expected to result in any Losses which
are indemnifiable hereunder.

  



  

(h) The amount of any Losses for which indemnification is provided under this
_Article X_ shall be reduced to take account of any Tax Benefit realizable by
the indemnified party arising from the incurrence or payment of any such Loss
(whether arising in the year of such Loss or in a subsequent year). For
purposes of this _Section 10.02(h)_, a " _Tax Benefit_ " means an amount by
which the Tax liability of the Indemnified Party (or the consolidated,
combined, unitary or similar Tax group including the Indemnified Party) or,
if the Indemnified Party is a pass-through entity for Tax purposes, the
members of the Indemnified Party, is reduced or is reasonably expected to be
reduced (including by deduction, reduction of income by virtue of increased
Tax basis or otherwise, entitlement to refund, credit or otherwise) plus any
related interest received from the relevant Governmental Entity.

  



  

   

 | 51| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the Indemnified Parties shall
be deemed not to have suffered any Losses (whether in contract, tort or
otherwise) to the extent that such Losses (i) are accrued, provided or
reserved for, or otherwise reflected or taken into account in, the Company
Financial Statements, (ii) arise from any item or matter that is included or
otherwise taken into account in, or was raised or could have been raised as
part of the settlement of, Closing Working Capital or the other items of the
Closing Certificate and Final Closing Certificate or (iii) arise out of
changes after the Closing Date in accounting principles or applicable Laws,
rules or regulations or interpretations thereof.

  



  

10.03 _Indemnification Procedures_.

  



  

(a) Parent shall have the sole right to act on behalf of any the Indemnified
Parties with respect to any indemnification claims made pursuant to this 
_Article X_ , including bringing and settling any indemnification claims
hereunder and receiving any notices on behalf of an Indemnified Party. The
Stockholder Representative shall have the sole right to act on behalf of the
any of the Indemnifying Parties with respect to any indemnification claims
made pursuant to this _Article X_ , including defending and settling any
indemnification claims hereunder and receiving any notices on behalf of the
Indemnifying Parties, _provided_ , _however_ , that, following the Closing,
Parent shall have the right to defend and settle Third Party Claims to the
extent provided in _Section 10.03(c)_ below.

  



  

(b) Subject to _Section 10.03(c)_ below, in order to make a claim for
indemnification hereunder, the Indemnified Party must provide written notice
(a " _Claim Notice_ ") of such claim to the Stockholder Representative on
behalf of the Indemnifying Parties and to the Escrow Agent, which Claim
Notice shall include (i) a reasonable description of the facts and
circumstances which relate to the subject matter of such indemnification
claim to the extent then known and (ii) the amount of Losses suffered by
the Indemnified Party in connection with the claim to the extent known or
reasonably estimable (provided, that the Indemnified Party may thereafter in
good faith adjust the amount of Losses with respect to the claim by providing
a revised Claim Notice to the indemnifying party and the Escrow Agent);
_provided_ , that the copy of any Claim Notice provided to the Escrow Agent
shall be redacted for any confidential or proprietary information of the
Indemnifying Party or the Indemnified Party described in clause (i).

  



  

(c) Parent will promptly (but in any event within five (5) Business Days
following Parent's receipt of notice of the claim) notify the
Stockholder Representative in writing in the event that it becomes aware of
any claim of a third party (including any Governmental Entity) (a " _Third
Party Claim_ ") that might reasonably result in a claim for indemnification
under this _Article X_ ;  _provided_ , that the failure to give such notice
will not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its indemnification
obligations except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is prejudiced by
such failure. Upon receipt of notice of such Third Party Claim or upon
otherwise becoming aware of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party may
provide a Claim Notice in accordance with _Section 10.03(b)_ above.

  



  

(i) The Indemnifying Party shall have the right at its sole option (x) to
participate in the defense of a Third Party Claim and (y) control,
defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with such Third Party
Claim and be represented by counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party, which
counsel is not reasonably objected to by the Indemnified Party ( _provided_ ,
that in the case of clause (y), where the Company Stockholders are the
Indemnifying Party, the money damages reasonably expected to be payable to the
applicable third party in respect of such Third Party Claim, as reasonably
determined by the Stockholder Representative in good faith as of the time
such Third Party Claim is made, are not greater than 200% of the value of the
Escrow Shares (valued at the applicable Parent Share Price) in the Escrow
Account at the time such Third Party Claim is made). If the Indemnifying Party
shall assume the defense of any Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party
shall not be liable for the legal expenses subsequently incurred by the
Indemnified Party in connection with the defense thereof, but the Indemnified
Party may participate, at the Indemnified Party's own expense, in the defense
of such Third Party Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that such Indemnified
Party shall be entitled to participate in any such defense with separate
counsel at the expense of the Indemnifying Party if (A) so requested by the
Indemnifying Party to participate or (B) in the reasonable written opinion of
counsel to the Indemnified Party, a conflict exists on a material issue
between the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party that would make such
separate representation advisable;  _provided_ , _further_ , _however_ , that
the Indemnifying Party shall not be required to pay for more than one
(1) such counsel for all Indemnified Parties in connection with any Third
Party Claim. All the Indemnified Parties shall cooperate in the defense,
negotiation and settlement of any Third Party Claim. Such cooperation shall
include the retention and (upon the Indemnifying Party's request) the
provision to the Indemnifying Party of records and information that are
reasonably relevant to such Third Party Claim, and making employees available
(without charge) at such times and places as may be reasonably necessary to
defend against such Third Party Claim for the purpose of providing additional
information, explanation or testimony in connection with such Third Party
Claim. If the Indemnifying Party elects not to control, defend against,
negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with any Third Party Claim that relates
to any Losses indemnified against hereunder, the Indemnified Party shall
defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with such Third Party
Claim.

---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(ii) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 10.03_ to the contrary, the
Indemnified Party shall not, without the prior written consent of the
Indemnifying Party which shall not be unreasonably withheld, (A) admit any
liability with respect to, or settle or compromise any, Third Party Claim or
(B) permit a default or consent to entry of any judgment. The Indemnifying
Party may (1) settle or compromise any Third Party Claim or (2) permit a
default or consent to entry of any judgment (x) without the consent of the
Indemnified Party if such settlement or resolution is solely for money damages
(which, in the case the Company Stockholders are the Indemnifying Parties,
are fully compensated from the Escrow Account) and the Indemnified Party is
not required to admit guilt or liability relating to such matter and (y) with
the consent of the Indemnified Party in all other cases, such consent not to
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Notwithstanding anything in
this _Section 10.03_ to the contrary, if a settlement offer solely for money
damages is made by the applicable third-party claimant, and the
Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party in writing of the
Indemnifying Party's willingness to accept the settlement offer and, subject
to the applicable limitations of _Section 10.02_ , pay the amount called for
by such offer, and the Indemnified Party declines to accept such offer, the
Indemnified Party may continue to contest such Third Party Claim, free of any
participation by the Indemnifying Party, and the amount of any ultimate
liability with respect to such Third Party Claim that the Indemnifying Party
has an obligation to pay hereunder, subject to the applicable limitations of
_Section 10.02_ , shall be limited to the lesser of (A) the amount of the
settlement offer that the Indemnified Party declined to accept plus the
indemnifiable Losses of the Indemnified Party relating to such Third Party
Claim through the date of its rejection of the settlement offer or (B) the
aggregate indemnifiable Losses of the Indemnified Party with respect to such
Third Party Claim.

  



  

10.04 _Exclusive Remedy_. Following the Closing, except in case of Fraud by
any Indemnifying Party, the sole and exclusive remedy for any and all
claims by the Indemnified Parties arising under, out of or related to this
Agreement shall be the rights of post-closing merger consideration adjustment
set forth in _Section 1.05_ , indemnification set forth in this _Article X_
(including the Escrow Account) and specific performance set forth in _Section

Company in its sole and absolute discretion, on behalf of the Company

referred to in this Agreement will be construed to give any Person other than
the Parties to this Agreement any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim
under or with respect to this Agreement or any provision of this Agreement.

  



  

14.13 _WAIVER OF TRIAL BY JURY_. EACH OF THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT HEREBY
WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OF
ANY CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION OR CAUSE OF ACTION (A) ARISING UNDER THIS AGREEMENT
OR (B) IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH OR RELATED OR INCIDENTAL TO THE DEALINGS OF
THE PARTIES HERETO IN RESPECT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE

14.14 _Parent Deliveries_. The Parent agrees and acknowledges that all
documents or other items delivered or made available to Parent or Parent's
Representatives will be deemed to be delivered or made available, as the case
may be, to Parent for all purposes hereunder.

  



  

14.15 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed simultaneously in two or
more counterparts, each of which will be deemed an original, but all of which
will constitute one agreement. Execution and delivery of this Agreement by
exchange of electronically transmitted counterparts bearing the signature of
a Party will be equally as effective as delivery of a manually executed
counterpart of such Party.

  



  

14.16 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware without regard to
principles of conflicts of law that would result in the application of the
substantive law of another jurisdiction.

  



  

14.17 _Submission to Jurisdiction; Consent to Service of Process_.

  



  

(a) Except as specifically provided in _Section 1.05(d)_ (which shall govern
any dispute thereunder), each Party hereby irrevocably submits to
the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware
(or, if the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware declines to accept
jurisdiction over a particular matter, any federal court within the State of
Delaware, or, if no federal court in the State of Delaware accepts
jurisdiction, any state court within the State of Delaware) over all Related
Claims, and each Party hereby irrevocably agrees that all Related Claims may
be heard and determined in such courts. Each Party hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any
objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any
such Related Claim brought in any such court or any defense of inconvenient
forum for the maintenance of such dispute. Each Party agrees that a judgment
in any such dispute may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the
judgment or in any other manner provided by Law.

  



  

(b) Each Party hereby consents to process being served by any other Party in
any Related Claim by the delivery of a copy thereof in accordance with
the provisions of _Section 14.05_ (other than by email) along with a
notification that service of process is being served in conformance with this
_Section 14.17(b)_. Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of any
Party to serve process in any other manner permitted by Law.

  



  

14.18 _Remedies Cumulative_. Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all
remedies herein expressly conferred upon a Party will be deemed cumulative
with, and not exclusive of, any other remedy conferred hereby, or by Law or
equity upon such Party, and the exercise by a Party of any one remedy will
not preclude the exercise of any other remedy.

  



  

14.19 _Specific Performance_.

  



  

(a) Each Party agrees that irreparable damage would occur and that the
Parties would not have any adequate remedy at law in the event that any of
the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached. Accordingly, in addition to any
other remedies available under this Agreement, the Parties agree that, prior
to the termination of this Agreement, each Party will be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions, specific performance and other equitable relief to
prevent the other Party's breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement (including
the Company's or Parent's obligation to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement if required to do so hereunder). Each Party
agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific
performance and other equitable relief when expressly available pursuant to
the terms of this Agreement, and hereby waives (i) any defenses in any Legal
Proceeding for an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief,
including the defense that the other Parties have an adequate remedy at law
or an award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any
reason at law or equity and (ii) any requirement under Law to post a bond,
undertaking or other security as a prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief.

(b) In no event will the exercise of the Company's right to specific
performance or other equitable relief pursuant to this _Section
14.19_ reduce, restrict or otherwise limit the Company's right to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to _Sections 11.01_ and _11.02_.

  



  

(c) To the extent any Party brings any Legal Proceeding to enforce
specifically the performance of the terms and provisions of this Agreement
prior to the Closing, the Outside Date will automatically be extended to (i)
the 20th (twentieth) Business Day after such Legal Proceeding is no longer
pending or (ii) such other date established by the court presiding over such
Legal Proceeding.

  



  

14.20 _Legal Representation by Sidley_. Each Party acknowledges and agrees,
on its own behalf and on behalf of its directors, members, partners,
officers, employees and Affiliates, that at and prior to the Closing, Sidley
Austin LLP (" _Sidley_ ") may act as counsel for the Company, the Company
Stockholders, the Stockholder Representative and their respective Affiliates
(collectively, the " _Seller Group_ ") in connection with the negotiation,
preparation, execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby, and agrees that subsequent to the
Closing, any member of the Seller Group, and any director, member, partner,
officer, employee or Affiliate of the Seller Group, shall have the right to
retain Sidley to represent its respective interests, including in any dispute
relating in any manner to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated herein or hereby. Parent irrevocably waives, consents to and
covenants not to assert (and agrees following Closing to cause the Surviving
Company and its other Affiliates to waive, and not to assert) any objection,
based on conflict of interest or otherwise, to any representation of any
member of the Seller Group by Sidley, including in connection with any such
dispute. Each of the Parties further agrees to take the steps necessary to
ensure any privilege attaching as a result of Sidley's service as counsel
to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with this Agreement
and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will survive the
Closing and will remain in effect, provided that such privilege from and after
the Closing will belong solely to the Company Stockholders (and not to the
Surviving Company or its Subsidiaries) and will be controlled solely by
the Stockholder Representative on behalf of the Company Stockholders. As to
any privileged attorney-client communications between Sidley and the Company
or Sidley and any of the Company's Affiliates prior to the Closing Date
(collectively, the " _Privileged Communications_ "), Parent, the Surviving
Company, and each of its Subsidiaries together with any of their respective
Affiliates, Subsidiaries, successors or assigns, agree that no such party may
have access to, use or rely on any of the Privileged Communications in
connection with any action against or involving any of the Parties after the
Closing. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 14.20_ ,
in the event that, after the Closing, any dispute arises between Parent, the
Surviving Company, or its Subsidiaries, or any of their respective
Affiliates, Subsidiaries, successors or assigns, on the one hand, and a third
party, on the other hand, the Surviving Company may assert the attorney-
client privilege to prevent disclosure of any Privileged Communications to
such third party; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Surviving Company may not
waive such privilege without the prior written consent of the Stockholder
Representative.

14.21 _Legal Representation by HTFL_. Each Party acknowledges and agrees, on
its own behalf and on behalf of its directors, members, partners, officers,
employees and Affiliates, that at and prior to the Closing, Hunter Taubman
Fischer and Li LLC (" _HTFL_ ") may act as counsel for Parent, Sponsor, Merger
Sub, the Parent Representative and their respective Affiliates (collectively,
the " _Buyer Group_ ") in connection with the negotiation, preparation,
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, and agrees that subsequent to the Closing,
any member of the Buyer Group, and any director, member, partner, officer,
employee or Affiliate of the Buyer Group, shall have the right to retain HTFL
to represent its respective interests, including in any dispute relating in
any manner to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated herein or
hereby. Parent irrevocably waives, consents to and covenants not to assert
(and agrees following Closing to cause the Surviving Company and its other
Affiliates to waive, and not to assert) any objection, based on conflict of
interest or otherwise, to any representation of any member of the Buyer Group
by HTFL, including in connection with any such dispute.

  



  

14.22 _No Recourse_. Except in the case of Fraud, all actions, claims,
obligations, liabilities or causes of actions (whether in contract or in
tort, in law or in equity, or granted by statute whether by or through
attempted piercing of the corporate, limited partnership or limited liability
company veil) that may be based upon, in respect of, arise under, out or by
reason of, be connected with, or relate in any manner to: (a) this Agreement,
(b) the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement (including any
representation or warranty made in, in connection with, or as an inducement
to, this Agreement), (c) any breach of this Agreement and (d) any failure of
the Merger to be consummated, may be made only against (and, without prejudice
to the rights of any express third party beneficiary to whom rights under
this Agreement inure pursuant to _Section 14.12_), are those solely of the
Persons that are expressly identified as parties to this Agreement and not
against any Released Party. Except in the case of Fraud, no other Person,
including any director, officer, employee, incorporator, member, partner,
manager, stockholder, optionholder, Affiliate, agent, attorney or
representative of, or any financial advisor or lender to, any party to this
Agreement, or any director, officer, employee, incorporator, member, partner,
manager, stockholder, Affiliate, agent, attorney or Representative of, or any
financial advisor or lender (each of the foregoing, a " _Released Party_ ")
to any of the foregoing shall have any liabilities (whether in contract or in
tort, in law or in equity, or granted by statute whether by or through
attempted piercing of the corporate, limited partnership or limited liability
company veil) for any claims, causes of action, obligations or liabilities
arising under, out of, in connection with or related in any manner to the
items in the immediately preceding clauses (a) through (d) and each Party, on

Earnout Merger Consideration

  



  

This _Annex I_ sets forth the criteria for the release from the Earnout

Annex I to the Company Disclosure Letter on or prior to six months after

an individual, to such Company Stockholder's immediate family members, for
estate planning purposes, or upon his or her death, pursuant to his or her
will, trust or similar instrument or pursuant to the laws of descent and
distribution; provided, in each case, that Parent is provided with written
notice prior to any such assignment or transfer. Any assignment or transfer
in violation of this paragraph shall be null and void and need not be
recognized by Parent.
