ARTICLE II 
 THE MERGER   

 2.01. The Merger. Upon and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Acquisition shall merge with and into the Company (the "Merger") at the Effective Time. From and after the Effective Time, the separate corporate existence of Acquisition shall cease, and the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation in the Merger (the "Surviving Corporation"). The Merger shall have the effects set forth in the DGCL.  

 2.02. Closing of the Merger. Subject to Section 3.06 (which governs the timing with respect to the condition set forth in Section 10.02(j)), the closing of the Merger (the "Closing") will take place at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Standard Time on the third business day after satisfaction (or waiver) of the conditions set forth in Article X (the "Closing Date"), at the offices of Gibson, Dunn and Crutcher LLP, 1050 Connecticut Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20036, unless another time, date or place is agreed to by the parties hereto.  

 2.03. Actions at the Closing. At the Closing: (i) the Company shall deliver to Parent and Acquisition the various certificates, instruments and documents referred to in Section 10.02; (ii) Parent and Acquisition shall deliver to the Company the various certificates, instruments and documents referred to in Section 10.03; (iii) the Company shall file the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware; (iv) Parent, the Representative, and the Escrowed Stockholders shall execute and deliver the Escrow Agreement or otherwise become bound thereby to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent; and (vi) Parent shall deposit an amount equal to the Escrow Amount with the Escrow Agent in accordance with Section 3.05(d).  

 2.04. Additional Action. The Surviving Corporation may, at any time after the Effective Time, take any action, including executing and delivering any document, in the name and on behalf of either the Company or Acquisition, in order to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.  

 2.05. Effects of the Merger. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all the properties, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Acquisition shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Acquisition shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.  

 2.06. Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws. The certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be in the form attached to the Certificate of Merger until amended in accordance with Applicable Law. The by-laws of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated at the Effective Time to read the same as the by-laws of Acquisition until amended in accordance with Applicable Law.  

 2.07. Directors. The directors of Acquisition at the Effective Time shall be the initial directors of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving Corporation until such directors successor is duly elected or appointed and qualified.   ##### 

 

 2.08. Officers. The officers of Acquisition at the Effective Time shall be the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving Corporation until such officers successor is duly elected or appointed and qualified.  

ARTICLE III 
 CONSIDERATION; PAYMENT; EFFECT ON SHARES IN THE MERGER   

 3.01. Maximum Merger Consideration. The maximum aggregate merger consideration to be paid by Parent and Acquisition pursuant to this Agreement is U.S. $209 million less the Seller Expenses (the "Maximum Merger Consideration"), subject to adjustment as set forth in this Article III. In addition, at the Effective Time, Parent shall satisfy the Companys interest-bearing borrowings and debt obligations (other than the Companys outstanding letters of credit) pursuant to payoff letters delivered to Parent by the Company at least two days prior to the Closing Date.  

 3.02. Conversion of Shares. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of any Stockholder or other Person:  

 (a) Each share (a "Share") of common stock of the Company ("Common Stock") issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time, but excluding Dissenting Shares and shares described in Section 3.02(b), shall be canceled and converted into the right to receive cash in an amount (the "Per Share Amount") equal to (i) the Maximum Merger Consideration plus an amount equal to the amount the Company would receive if all of the Options were exercised in full at the exercise price set forth therein, divided by (ii) the total number of Shares, including Shares issuable upon the exercise of Options, with the result of such calculation subject to adjustment and payable as provided in this Article III.  

 (b) Each Share, if any, held in the Companys treasury immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be canceled, retired and cease to exist at the Effective Time, and no consideration will be delivered in exchange therefor.  

 (c) At the Effective Time, each outstanding share of common stock of Acquisition shall be converted into one (1) fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation and shall constitute the only shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation outstanding immediately after the Effective Time.  

 (d) The merger consideration payable upon the Closing with respect to each Share, excluding Dissenting Shares and any Shares with respect to which dissenters rights have not terminated, shall be the Per Share Amount;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the initial merger consideration payable to the stockholders listed on Schedule 3.02(d) (the "Escrowed Stockholders") shall be the Per Share Amount less the Per Share Escrow Amount. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Per Share Escrow Amount" means the quotient determined by dividing the Escrow Amount by the number of Shares held by the Escrowed Stockholders as of the Effective Time.  

 3.03. Dissenters Rights. Shares that have not been voted for approval of this Agreement and the Merger (or which have not consented to each of them) and with respect to   ##### 

   

which a demand for payment and appraisal have been properly made
in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL ("Dissenting Shares") will not
be converted into the right to receive the Per Share Amount (if and as
adjusted pursuant to this Article III) otherwise payable with respect to such
Shares at or after the Effective Time, but instead will be converted into the
right to receive such consideration as may be determined to be due with
respect to such Dissenting Shares pursuant to the laws of the State of
Delaware. If a holder of Dissenting Shares (a "Dissenting Stockholder")
withdraws his or her demand for such payment and appraisal or becomes
ineligible for such payment and appraisal, then, as of the Effective Time or
the occurrence of such event of withdrawal or ineligibility, whichever last
occurs, such holders Dissenting Shares will cease to be Dissenting Shares
and will be converted into the right to receive, and will be exchangeable
for, the Per Share Amount (if and as so adjusted) in accordance with this
Agreement. The Company will give Parent and Acquisition prompt notice of any
demand received by the Company from a holder of Dissenting Shares for
appraisal of Shares, and Parent shall have the right to participate in all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demand. The Company agrees
that, except with the prior written consent of Parent, or as required under
the DGCL, it will not voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle
or offer or agree to settle, any such demand for appraisal. Each Dissenting
Stockholder who, pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL, becomes entitled to
payment of the value of the Dissenting Shares will receive payment therefor
but only after the value therefor has been agreed upon or finally determined
pursuant to such provisions. Any portion of the Per Share Amount (if and as
so adjusted) that would otherwise have been payable with respect to
Dissenting Shares if such Shares were not Dissenting Shares will be retained
by Parent.  

 3.04. Options.  

 (a) Prior to the Effective Time, the board of directors of the Company (or, with respect to the Options, the applicable committee thereof with the authority to administer the Company Option Plan) shall take all action necessary to cause (i) all Options that have not been exercised prior to the Effective Time to be cancelled or terminated immediately after the Effective Time and replaced with the right to receive the applicable Option Amount in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Company Option Plan; and (ii) all warrants or other convertible securities to purchase shares of Companys capital stock that have not been exercised prior to the Effective Time to be cancelled or terminated as of the Effective Time.  

 (b) Immediately after the Effective Time, each Option outstanding at the date of this Agreement that has not been exercised prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and the holder thereof shall have the right to be paid in cash in an amount (if positive) (the "Option Amount") equal to (i) the difference obtained by subtracting the exercise price of such Option from the Per Share Amount, multiplied by (ii) the number of shares of Common Stock purchasable upon exercise of the Option in question.  

 (c) The merger consideration payable upon the Closing with respect to each Option shall be the applicable Option Amount.   ##### 

 

 3.05. Payment for Shares and Options; Escrow Consideration.  

 (a) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall deliver to Parent wire instructions or other delivery instructions for use in connection with the payment of the merger consideration to the Stockholders and Optionholders hereunder. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, upon surrender to Parent of such certificates or agreements (or affidavit of loss or destruction in lieu thereof, including any suitable bond or indemnity that may be required by Parent in its sole discretion), duly executed and completed to Parents satisfaction, Parent shall make payment to the persons entitled thereto by check or wire transfer, as set forth in the delivery instructions delivered by the Company, in the amount equal to the price to which such Person is entitled pursuant to Section 3.02(d) or Section 3.04(c), as the case may be, less any required tax withholdings and less any amounts due from such Person to the Company. No interest will be paid or will accrue on the amount payable upon the surrender of any such certificate or agreements. If payment is to be made to a Person other than the registered holder of the certificate or agreement surrendered, it shall be a condition of such payment that the certificate or agreement so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered holder of the certificate or agreement surrendered or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation or Parent that such tax has been paid or is not applicable.  

 (b) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of shares of capital stock of the Company that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.  

 (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Parent nor any party hereto shall be liable to any holder of certificates or agreements formerly representing securities of the Company for any amount paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. The Surviving Corporation shall pay all charges and expenses, including those of Parent, in connection with the exchange of cash for securities of the Company.  

 (d) At the Closing, Parent shall deposit an amount equal to U.S. $15 million (the "Escrow Amount") with an Affiliate of Deutsche Bank or another third person mutually satisfactory to Parent and the Representative, as escrow agent (the "Escrow Agent"). The Escrow Amount, together with any interest, dividends or other income earned thereon, net of any transaction costs associated with the investment thereof (collectively, the "Escrow Fund") shall be applied for the payment of any indemnification obligations pursuant to this Agreement and an escrow agreement in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit 3.05 (the "Escrow Agreement").  

 3.06. Closing Net Debt.  

 (a) Three days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to Parent:  

      |   
---|--- 
     | (i) payoff letters from each of the Companys
lenders and material creditors (other than with respect to the Companys
outstanding letters of credit), along with written releases of any and all
Liens on the assets of the Company that will become  ##### 

   

      |   
---|--- 
     | effective upon the payment of such amounts to such lenders
and material creditors and, where applicable, executed termination
statements with respect to any security interest filed by such lenders and
material creditors pursuant to the Uniform Commercial Code; and  
      
     | (ii) a certificate setting forth (A) the Companys
best estimate of Closing Net Debt (calculated as though the date the
certificate is delivered is the Closing Date), along with such documentation
as Parent may reasonably request to show the basis upon which the Company
estimated Closing Net Debt, as well as such documentation as Parent may
reasonably request to evidence that the Company has paid all its obligations
in the ordinary course, consistent with past practices, including
without limitation the payment of any estimated tax payments that have become
due and payable on or prior to the date such certificate is delivered
to Parent, and (B) an itemized list of Seller Expenses, which list
shall include final payoff amounts as of the Effective Time. The
certificate delivered by the Company pursuant to this Section 3.06(a)(ii)
shall be prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles.  
   

 (b) On the proposed Closing Date, the Company shall deliver a bring-down certificate in the same form as the certificate delivered pursuant to Section 3.06(a)(ii), setting forth the Companys calculation of Closing Net Debt, along with such documentation as Parent may reasonably request concerning the matters set forth in Section 3.06(a)(ii). If Parent disagrees with the Companys determination of Closing Net Debt, the parties shall retain Ernst and Young, LLP, or such other nationally recognized accounting firm as is mutually agreeable to Parent and the Company (the "Accounting Referee"), to promptly review this Agreement and the disputed items or amounts for the purpose of calculating Closing Net Debt, for a period not to exceed two business days. At the end of such period, the Accounting Referee shall deliver to Parent and the Company a report setting forth each such calculation. Such report and the Accounting Referees determination of Closing Net Debt shall be final and binding upon Parent and the Company. In no event shall Closing Net Debt as determined by the Accounting Referee be lower than Closing Net Debt as calculated by the Company or higher than Closing Net Debt as calculated by Parent. Subject to the satisfaction of the closing conditions set forth in Article X, the Closing shall occur on the day that the Accounting Referees determination is delivered; _provided_ , _however_ , that for accounting purposes, the transfer of the business operated by the Company and the Subsidiaries shall be deemed to have occurred at the opening of business on the date following the date used to calculate Closing Net Debt, and Parent shall be entitled to all the benefits of ownership, and responsible for all the liabilities, with respect to such business from such date.  

 (c) Parent and the Company agree that they will, and agree to cause their respective independent accountants to, cooperate and assist in the calculation of Closing Net Debt and in the conduct of the audits and reviews referred to in this Section 3.06, including, without limitation, making available to the extent reasonably required books, records, work papers (subject to appropriate indemnifications) and personnel.

a covenant or agreement which was cured prior to the Effective Time and
for which the Indemnified Parties suffer no Damages; or  
   

      |   
---|--- 
     | (iii) any Environmental Liabilities.  
   

 (b) Floor. Except as set forth in this Section 11.02, the indemnification obligations under Section 11.02(a) (including indemnification for those matters addressed in Exhibits I and II) shall not apply unless the aggregate amount of Damages arising from all claims under such section exceeds U.S. $1 million (the "Deductible"), and then for the amount of such Damages in excess of the Deductible, subject to Section 11.02(c). The provisions of this subsection (b) shall not apply to any claims for Damages incurred by Parent on or after the Closing Date with respect to any Seller Expenses (other than those identified by Seller pursuant to Section 3.06(a) which are satisfied at Closing), which shall be indemnified in full without regard to the Deductible.  

 (c) Escrow Fund as Sole Remedy. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, the Escrow Fund shall be the sole and exclusive source of satisfaction of, and sole and exclusive remedy for, any claim for Damages arising out of this Agreement (including Exhibit I and Exhibit II hereto) or the transactions contemplated hereunder by any party, except as otherwise set forth in this Section 11.02; _provided_ , _however_ , that this subsection (c) shall not be deemed a waiver by Parent or the Surviving Corporation of any right to specific performance or injunctive relief;  _provided_ , _further_ , _however_ , that this subsection (c)  ##### 

   

shall not apply to claims arising out of a breach of the representations and
warranties contained in the second sentence of Section 4.03(a) as it relates
to the beneficial or record ownership of Common Stock by each of the Escrowed
Stockholders, and each Escrowed Stockholder shall have several liability for
any such claim.  

 (d) Acts of Fraud. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the limitations set forth in subsections (b) and (c) above shall not be applicable with respect to any claims for Damages against any party resulting from such partys own fraud or willful misrepresentation, and any such claim shall survive for the period of the statute of limitations applicable thereto.  

 (e) Insurance; Governmental Cost Reimbursements. Parent agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts (and to cause the Surviving Corporation to use commercially reasonable efforts) to seek appropriate insurance coverage and governmental reimbursement for Damages related to any Environmental Liability. In the event that Parent has filed a claim for indemnification relating to any Environmental Liability under this Article XI, Parent shall not be entitled to receive an indemnification payment in respect of such claim until the earlier of the following: (i) Parent receives notice from the applicable insurance carrier or Governmental Entity as to the disposition of its request for insurance coverage or governmental reimbursement, as the case may be; and (ii) 90 days from the submission of the request for such insurance coverage or governmental reimbursement. To the extent that Parent or the Surviving Corporation receives any amounts from the applicable insurance company or Governmental Entity, as the case may be, with respect to such Environmental Liability, any payment due from the Escrowed Stockholders pursuant to this Article XI with respect thereto shall be net of any insurance proceeds or governmental cost reimbursements actually realized by the Indemnified Parties in respect of such claim. In addition, to the extent Parent has received indemnification payments from or on behalf of the Escrowed Stockholders in accordance with this Article XI and later receives reimbursement for such Damages from any Governmental Entity, Parent shall deliver an amount equal to the amount reimbursed to either the Escrowed Stockholders pro rata in accordance with the amounts contributed to the Escrow Fund by each such Escrowed Stockholder (but only if the Escrow Agreement has terminated or expired in accordance with its terms) or the Escrow Agent, in which case such amount shall be deemed to again be part of the Escrow Fund, and shall be distributed and applied in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement.  

 (f) SWM Acquisition Agreements. Parent agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts (and to cause the Surviving Corporation and the Subsidiaries to use commercially reasonable efforts) to seek indemnification pursuant to the SWM Acquisition Agreements for all claims for which indemnification is available, including without limitation the San Diego Indemnification Claim. To the extent that Parent or the Surviving Corporation receives any amounts as a result of its claim for indemnification under the SWM Acquisition Agreements, any payment due from the Escrowed Stockholders pursuant to this Article XI with respect thereto shall be net of any payments actually realized by the Indemnified Parties pursuant to the SWM Acquisition Agreements in respect of such claim. In addition, to the extent Parent has received indemnification payments from or on behalf of the Escrowed Stockholders in accordance with this Article XI and later receives indemnification for such Damages pursuant to the SWM Acquisition Agreements, Parent shall deliver an amount equal to the amount reimbursed to either  ##### 

   

the Escrowed Stockholders pro rata in accordance with the amounts contributed
to the Escrow Fund by each such Escrowed Stockholder (but only if the Escrow
Agreement has terminated or expired in accordance with its terms) or the
Escrow Agent, in which case such amount shall be deemed to again be part
of the Escrow Fund, and shall be distributed and applied in accordance with
the terms of the Escrow Agreement.  

 (g) Environmental Liabilities. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the indemnification obligations to any Indemnified Party under this Article XI shall not apply to any Damages:  

      |   
---|--- 
     | (i) arising from any condition that was not an
Environmental Liability as of the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the immediately preceding clause shall not bar or otherwise limit such
Indemnified Partys right to indemnification with respect to Damages incurred
by such Indemnified Party in connection with the Remediation of the
migration after the Closing Date of Hazardous Substances initially Released
prior to the Closing Date; or  
   

      |   
---|--- 
     | (ii) attributable to the failure of such Indemnified Party
to make commercially reasonable efforts to conduct Remediation in a cost-
effective manner.  
   

 11.03. Procedures for Third Party Claims.  

 (a) The parties seeking indemnification under Sections 11.02 (the "Indemnified Parties") agree to give prompt notice to the parties from whom indemnity is sought (the "Indemnifying Parties") of the assertion of any claim, or the commencement of any suit, action or proceeding in respect of which indemnity may be sought under Section 11.02 (the "Third Party Claims");  _provided_ , _however_ , that notice to the Indemnifying Parties shall be provided to the Representative by the Indemnified Parties. The failure by any Indemnified Party so to notify the Representative in accordance with this Section 11.03(a) shall not relieve any Indemnifying Party from any liability which it may have to such Indemnified Party with respect to any claim made pursuant to this Section 11.03, except to the extent such failure shall actually prejudice an Indemnifying Party.  

 (b) Upon receipt of notice from the Indemnified Parties pursuant to Section 11.03(a), the Representative shall have ten days to notify such Indemnified Parties as to whether it elects to assume the defense and control of such Third Party Claims, which defense and control shall be subject at all times to the provisions of Section 11.03(c). In the event that the Representative elects to defend a Third Party Claim, the Representative shall allow the Indemnified Parties a reasonable opportunity to participate in the defense of such Third Party Claims with their own counsel and at their own expense (except as provided in Section 11.03(d)). The Representative shall select counsel, contractors and consultants of recognized standing and competence after consultation with the Indemnified Parties; shall take all steps necessary in the defense or settlement of such Third Party Claims; and shall at all times diligently and promptly pursue the resolution of such Third Party Claims.  

 (c) In the event that the Representative elects to defend a Third Party Claim, the Representative shall be authorized to consent to a settlement of, or the entry of any judgment  ##### 

   

arising from, any Third Party Claim, without the consent of any Indemnified
Party; but only if the Indemnifying Parties or the Representative shall (1)
pay or cause to be paid all amounts arising out of such settlement
or judgment concurrently with the effectiveness of such settlement; (2)
not encumber any of the assets of any Indemnified Party or agree to any
restriction or condition that would apply to or adversely affect any
Indemnified Party or to the conduct of any Indemnified Partys business; and
(3) obtain, as a condition of any settlement or other resolution, a complete
release of any Indemnified Party potentially affected by such Third Party
Claim.  

 (d) Subject to Section 11.02(c), the Indemnifying Parties shall also be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel (which fees and expenses shall be satisfied out of the Escrow Fund) incurred by each Indemnified Party in defending any Third Party Claim if (i) such Third Party Claim, if successful, is likely to result in a judgment, decree or order of injunction or other equitable relief or relief for other than money Damages against such Indemnified Party; or (ii) the Indemnified Party reasonably concludes that the Indemnifying Parties and such Indemnified Party have conflicting interests or different defenses available with respect to such Third Party Claim; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the Indemnifying Parties shall not be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one such additional counsel pursuant to this Section 11.03(d)(ii).  

 (e) In the event that the Representative fails to elect to assume the defense and control of any Third Party Claim (whether explicitly or by failing to notify the Indemnified Parties within the time period set forth in Section 11.03(b)), the Indemnified Parties shall have the full right to defend against any such claim and shall be entitled to settle or agree to pay in full such claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, under no circumstances shall a Third Party Claim be settled or compromised by any Indemnified Party without the prior written consent of the Representative, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.  

 (f) In all events and circumstances, the Representative and the Indemnified Parties shall, and shall cause each of their Affiliates and representatives to, cooperate fully in the defense of any Third Party Claim subject to this Article XI.  

 11.04. Procedures for Direct Claims. In the event any Indemnified Party should have a claim for indemnity against any Indemnifying Party that does not involve a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall deliver notice of such claim with reasonable promptness to the Representative. The failure by any Indemnified Party so to notify the Representative shall not relieve the Indemnifying Parties from any liability that they may have to such Indemnified Party with respect to any claim made pursuant to this Section 11.04, it being understood that notices for claims in respect of a breach of a representation or warranty must be delivered prior to the expiration of the survival period for such representation or warranty under Section 11.01, except to the extent such failure shall actually prejudice an Indemnifying Party. If the Representative does not notify the Indemnified Party within thirty calendar days following its receipt of such notice that the Representative disputes the Indemnifying Parties liability to the Indemnified Party under this Article, or the amount thereof, the claim specified by the Indemnified Party in such notice shall be conclusively deemed a liability of the Indemnifying Party under this Article XI, and the Representative shall pay or cause to be paid the amount of such liability (which shall not exceed the total amount of Damages incurred by the Indemnified Party) to the Indemnified Party on behalf of the Indemnifying Parties (by authorizing a release of funds from the Escrow Fund or otherwise) on demand or, in the case of any notice in which the amount of  ##### 

   

the claim (or any portion of the claim) is estimated, on such later date when
the amount of such claim (or such portion of such claim) becomes
finally determined. If the Representative has timely disputed the liability
of the Indemnifying Parties with respect to such claim as provided above, or
the amount thereof, the Representative and the Indemnified Party shall
resolve such dispute in accordance with Section 13.08.  

 11.05. Release of Escrow Fund. Subject to the following requirements, the Escrow Fund shall be in existence immediately following the Closing and shall terminate on the third anniversary of the Closing Date (the "Escrow Period");  _provided_ , _however_ , that on the date which is eighteen months after the Closing Date (the "First Payout Date"), the Escrow Agent shall deliver to the Escrowed Stockholders in proportion to their contributions to the Escrow Fund an amount equal to the lesser of (a) $10 million plus two-thirds of the interest, dividends or other income earned on the Escrow Amount, less the pro rata portion of any transaction costs associated therewith; and (b) the difference between the amount remaining in the Escrow Fund and the amount necessary to satisfy any unsatisfied claims specified in any Officers Certificate (as defined in the Escrow Agreement) delivered to the Escrow Agent prior to the First Payout Date with respect to facts and circumstances existing prior to the First Payout Date; and _provided_ , _further_ , that the Escrow Period shall not terminate with respect to any amount which, in the reasonable judgment of Parent, subject to the reasonable objection of the Representative and the subsequent resolution of the matter as provided in Section 6 of the Escrow Agreement, is necessary to satisfy any unsatisfied claims specified in any Officers Certificate (as defined in the Escrow Agreement) delivered to the Escrow Agent prior to the termination of such Escrow Period with respect to facts and circumstances existing prior to the termination of such Escrow Period  . Upon the termination of the Escrow Period, the remaining portion of the Escrow Fund not required to satisfy any unsatisfied claims (identified as described above) shall be disbursed to the Escrowed Stockholders ratably in proportion to their respective contributions to the Escrow Fund. As soon as any unsatisfied claim has been resolved and any obligations with respect thereto have been satisfied, the Escrow Agent shall deliver to the Escrowed Stockholders in proportion to their contributions to the Escrow Fund all portions of the Escrow Fund not required to satisfy any remaining unsatisfied claim.

with Section 3.06; _provided_ , _further_ , _however_ , that neither Parent
nor the Company may terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section

reason of the failure of such party or any of its Affiliates to perform in
all material respects any of its or their respective covenants or agreements
contained in this Agreement.  

 (c) by Parent, if a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of the Company set forth in this Agreement shall have occurred which would cause any of the conditions set forth in Sections 10.01 or 10.02 not to be satisfied, and such breach is incapable of being cured or, if capable of being cured, shall not have been cured within thirty business days following receipt by the Company of notice of such breach from Parent;  

 (d) by the Company, if a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of Parent set forth in this Agreement shall have occurred which would cause any of the conditions set forth in Sections 10.01 or 10.03 not to be satisfied, and such breach is incapable of being cured or, if capable of being cured, shall not have been cured within thirty business days following receipt by Parent of notice of such breach from the Company or the Representative;

 (f) by Parent within ten business days of the complete disclosure by the Company of any Addition or Additions that, taken individually or in the aggregate, would impact the Companys ability to satisfy any of the conditions set forth in Section 10.02 in any material respect unless such Addition or Additions relates to a breach of representations, warranties, covenants or agreements that is able to be cured, in which case Parent may only terminate this Agreement if such breach has not been cured before the earlier to occur of the End Date and thirty days after such disclosure.  

 12.02. Effect of Termination. If this Agreement is terminated as permitted by Section 12.01, such termination shall be without liability of any party (or any Affiliate or representative of such party) to any other party, except that if such termination shall result from the (i) failure of any party to this Agreement to perform a covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement, (ii) breach by any party to this Agreement of any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement made as of the date of this Agreement or (iii) willful or grossly negligent acts or omissions resulting in a breach by any party to this Agreement of any representation or warranty (other than a breach of any representation or warranty specified in clause (ii) contained in this Section), such party shall be fully liable for any and all Damages incurred or suffered by any other party as a result of such failure or breach. The provisions of Sections 7.02(b), 12.02 and 13.03, along with the Confidentiality Agreement, shall survive any termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 12.01.   #####

 I.03. Tax Procedures and Tax Indemnification.  

 (a) The Parent shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, and shall file, or cause to be filed, all Tax Returns of the Surviving Corporation and the Subsidiaries required to be filed after the Closing Date. With respect to any Tax Return of the Company or the Subsidiaries for any period ending on or before the Closing Date, or beginning before the Closing Date and ending after the Closing Date, that is required to be filed after the Closing Date, the Parent shall cause to be included in such Tax Return all items of income, gain, loss, deduction, credit or other  ##### 

   

items required to be included therein and at least thirty (30) days prior to
the due date (including extensions) of such Tax Return shall furnish a
copy of such Tax Return to the Representative. The Parent shall permit
the Representative to review and comment on each such Tax Return and shall
make such revisions to such Tax Return as reasonably requested by the
Representative in order to make such Tax Return consistent with the practice
followed in prior years by the Company or the Subsidiaries with respect to
similar Tax Returns, provided that Parent shall have no obligation to make
any such revision which Parent believes in good faith violates or is contrary
to any Applicable Law. The Parent shall be responsible for the timely payment
of all Taxes due with respect to the period covered by such Tax Return.  

 (b) The Escrowed Stockholders shall be jointly and severally liable for and shall indemnify and hold harmless Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Subsidiaries with respect to all Taxes imposed and all related costs and expenses, including litigation costs and reasonable attorneys and accountants fees and disbursements, incurred (all herein referred to as "Tax Losses") as a result of any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of the Company under this Agreement, provided that the Escrowed Stockholders shall not be required to indemnify or pay Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Subsidiaries for any Tax Loss to the extent such Tax Loss is attributable to a Tax Return position taken by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Subsidiaries if (A)(i) Representative requested such position be revised pursuant to Section I.03(a); (ii) such position was not consistent with the practice followed in prior years by the Company or the Subsidiaries, as applicable, with respect to similar Tax Returns; (iii) there is substantial authority (within the meaning of Treasury Regulation section 1.6662-4(d)) for such position; and (iv) the Service has not successfully challenged such position for any prior period of the Company or the Subsidiaries, as applicable, or (B) in the case of any position not addressed by the practice followed in prior years with respect to similar Tax Returns, such position is contrary to Applicable Law. For purposes of determining the amount of Tax Losses for which the Escrowed Shareholders are responsible pursuant to this Section 1.03(b) with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period, any Tax benefit or deduction (including any net operating loss, carry-forward or carry-back) that inures to the benefit of the Company as a result of (x) the exercise of any Option after the date of this Agreement, or (y) any payment in respect of the cancellation of any Option in accordance with Section 3.04, shall be disregarded and the amount of Tax Losses with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be calculated as though such Tax benefit or deduction were not available to the Company.  

 (c) Except as otherwise provided in Section I.03(b), after the Closing Date, Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Subsidiaries shall be solely responsible for all Taxes of the Parent, the Company, Surviving Corporation and the Subsidiaries and any costs or expenses with respect to such Taxes indemnified hereunder, and Parent shall indemnify, defend and hold the Escrowed Stockholders harmless from any and all such Taxes.  

 (d) Parent and the Company agree that if the Company is permitted under Applicable Law to treat the Closing Date as the last day of a taxable period, it will do so.  

 (e) Parent and the Company agree that Parents obligation to pay any Option Amounts required by Section 3.04(b) of this Agreement (the "Option Obligation") is properly allocable to the Post-Closing Tax Period for purposes of Treasury Regulation section 1.1502-76(b)(ii)(B) and any deduction or other tax impact to the Company in respect of the Option  ##### 

   

Obligation shall be reflected in the consolidated return of the Parent
and not in any Pre-Closing Tax Period Return of the Company and its
Subsidiaries. Parent and the Company further agree to report and file all Tax
Returns consistent with the preceding sentence and shall take no position or
action contrary thereto unless required to do so by Applicable Laws pursuant
to a final determination. For the avoidance of any doubt, the Escrowed
Stockholders shall not be obligated to indemnify to any extent Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or the Subsidiaries for any failure to obtain any
deduction or other Tax benefit associated with the Options unless such
failure results from the breach of a Company representation.  

 (f) The Representative, the Escrowed Shareholders, Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Subsidiaries and their respective Affiliates shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other party, in connection with the preparation, review and filing of Tax Returns pursuant to the Section I.03 and any audit, litigation or other proceeding (each a "Proceeding") with respect to Taxes covered by this Section I.03. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the other partys request) the provision of records and information which are reasonably relevant to any such preparation, filing or review of such Tax Returns or Proceedings and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder. The Representative, the Escrowed Shareholders, Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Subsidiaries and their respective Affiliates shall retain all books and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Company and its Subsidiaries relating to any taxable period beginning before the Closing Date until the expiration of the statute of limitations (and, to the extent notified by a party, any extensions thereof) of the respective taxable periods.  

      |   
---|--- 
     | (g) (i) If Parent files a Tax Return pursuant to Section
I.03(a) and the Pre-Closing Tax Liabilities based on such Tax Return result
in the breach of Section I.02(b) of this Agreement then (subject to
the limitations on indemnification set forth in Section I.03(b) or
otherwise provided in this Agreement) the Escrowed Stockholders shall
indemnify Parent for and pay the amount of the associated Tax Loss to Parent
within thirty (30) days.  
   

      |   
---|--- 
     | (ii) If a claim (an "Indemnified Tax Claim") shall be
made by any Taxing Authority that, if successful, would result in the
indemnification of a party or parties (the "Tax Indemnified Party") under
this Agreement, the Tax Indemnified Party shall promptly notify the party or
parties (the "Tax Indemnifying Party") obligated under this Agreement to
indemnify the Tax Indemnified Party in writing of such fact; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the failure to so notify the Tax Indemnifying Party shall
not relieve it from any Liability which it may have to the Tax Indemnified
Party to the extent that the Tax Indemnifying Party is not prejudiced by such
failure;  
   

      |   
---|--- 
     | (iii) The Tax Indemnifying Party shall have the right,
at its sole expense, to control the defense, prosecution, settlement or
compromise of the Indemnified Tax Claim, and the Tax Indemnified Party shall
take such action in connection with contesting such claim as the Tax
Indemnifying Party shall reasonably request in writing from time to time,
including the selection of counsel and experts and the execution of powers
of attorney; provided that (A) within 30 days after the notice required
by paragraph (i) of this subsection has been delivered (or such earlier
date that any payment  ##### 

    

      |   
---|--- 
     | of Taxes is due by the Tax Indemnified Party but in no event
sooner than 15 days after the Tax Indemnifying Partys receipt of such
notice), the Tax Indemnifying Party requests that such claim be contested,
(B) the Tax Indemnifying Party shall have agreed to pay to the Tax
Indemnified Party all costs and expenses that the Tax Indemnified Party
incurs in connection with contesting such claim (including reasonable
attorneys, accountants and experts fees and disbursements), and (C) if the
Tax Indemnified Party is requested by the Tax Indemnifying Party to pay
any Tax claimed and sue for a refund, or if the Indemnified Tax Claim
is otherwise paid, the Tax Indemnifying Party shall have advanced to the
Tax Indemnified Party, on an interest-free basis, the amount of such
claim. The Tax Indemnified Party shall not make any payment of such
Indemnified Tax Claim for at least 30 days (or such shorter period as may be
required by Applicable Law) after the giving of the notice required by
paragraph (i) of this subsection, shall give to the Tax Indemnifying Party
any information reasonably requested relating to such claim, and
otherwise shall cooperate with the Tax Indemnifying Party in good faith in
order to contest effectively any such claim. The Representative shall
consult with Parent with respect to the resolution of any issue that
can reasonably be expected to have an adverse affect on the
Surviving Corporation or any of the Subsidiaries for any period ending after
the Closing Date, and will not settle any such issue, or file any amended
Tax Return relating to any such issue without the consent of Parent,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.  
   

      |   
---|--- 
     | (iv) Subject to the provisions of the preceding paragraph,
the Tax Indemnified Party shall enter into a settlement of such contest with
the applicable Taxing Authority or prosecute such contest to a
determination in a court or other tribunal of initial or appellate
jurisdiction, all as the Tax Indemnifying Party may reasonably request;  
   

      |   
---|--- 
     | (v) Promptly after the extent of the Liability of the
Tax Indemnified Party with respect to a claim shall be established by
the final judgment or decree of a court or a final and binding
settlement with a governmental authority having jurisdiction thereof, the
Tax Indemnifying Party shall pay to the Tax Indemnified Party the amount
of any Tax Losses to which the Tax Indemnified Party may become entitled
by reason of the provisions of this Section 1.03.  
   

      |   
---|--- 
     | (vi) If, after receipt by the Tax Indemnified Party of an
amount advanced by the Tax Indemnifying Party pursuant to paragraph (ii)(C)
of this subsection, the extent of the Liability of the Tax Indemnified
Party with respect to the Indemnified Tax Claim shall be established by
the final judgment or decree of a court or other tribunal or a final
and binding settlement with a governmental authority having
jurisdiction thereof, the Tax Indemnified Party shall promptly repay to the
Tax Indemnifying Party the amount advanced to the extent of any
refund received by the Tax Indemnified Party with respect to such claim
together with any interest received thereon from the applicable Taxing
Authority, net of any Tax Losses suffered by the Tax Indemnified Party with
respect to such claim.  
   

      |   
---|--- 
     | (vii) For purposes of the notice and contest control
provisions of paragraphs (i), (ii) and (iii) of this subsection, the
Representative shall act on behalf of the Escrowed Stockholders in accordance
with this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement. All amounts  ##### 

    

      |   
---|--- 
     | to be paid by the Escrowed Stockholders pursuant to paragraphs
(ii) and (iv) of this subsection, and all amounts that the
Escrowed Stockholders are entitled to receive pursuant to paragraph (v) of
this subsection, shall be paid or received in accordance with this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement.  
   

 (h) In the event of a conflict between the provisions of this Exhibit I and any other provisions of this Agreement, the provisions of this Exhibit I shall control; _provided_ , _however_ , that in all events the liability and indemnification obligations of the Escrowed Shareholders under this Exhibit I shall be subject to the limitations set forth in Article XI.   #####

 II.02. Employee Benefits Representations. The Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent that:  

 (a) Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has performed its obligations under each Employee Retirement Plan and Employee Benefit Plan, and each Employee Retirement Plan and Employee Benefit Plan and each trust or other funding medium, if any, established in connection therewith has at all times been established, maintained and operated in compliance with its terms and the requirements prescribed by Applicable Law, including ERISA and the Code, except for such failures to perform and such failures to operate in compliance with the terms thereof and Applicable Law that could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.  

 (b) Except as set forth on Schedule II.02(b), the Company and the Subsidiaries have complied with the minimum funding requirements of ERISA and Section 412 of the Code with respect to each Employee Retirement Plan and, except for any failure that could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, all contributions required to be made under the terms of any Employee Retirement Plan or Employee Benefit Plan as of the date hereof have been timely made.   ##### 

 

 (c) The Company has furnished to the Parent a copy of all Employee Retirement Plans and Employee Benefit Plans, a true and complete list of which is set forth on Schedule II.02(c).

or benefits in the ordinary course). There are no individuals who
are classified as consultants or independent contractors of the Company

determination letter has been revoked nor has any event occurred since the

threatened actions, claims, or proceedings against or relating to any
Employee Retirement Plan or Employee Benefit Plan (other than routine
benefit claims for benefits thereunder).  
   

      |   
---|--- 
     | (vi) No "prohibited transaction" (as such term is used in
Section 4975 of the Code and/or Section 406 of ERISA and other than a
transaction that is exempt  ##### 

    

      |   
---|---

that could result in liability to the Company or a Subsidiary.  
   

      |   
---|--- 
     | (vii) With respect to each Employee Retirement Plan
currently or formerly maintained by the Company, a Subsidiary or an ERISA
Affiliate, none of the foregoing has incurred, nor do any of the
foregoing reasonably expect to incur, any liability to the Employee

connection with any Employee Retirement Plan, including, without limitation,
any liability under Section 4069 of ERISA or any penalty imposed

withdrawn from any Employee Retirement Plan in a manner which could subject
it to liability under Section 4062, 4063 or 4064 of ERISA, or knows of
any facts or circumstances that might give rise to any liability of
the Company, a Subsidiary or an ERISA Affiliate to the Employee
Retirement Plan or to the PBGC under Title IV of ERISA that could reasonably
be anticipated to result in any claims being made against the Company,
a Subsidiary or an ERISA Affiliate by the PBGC subsequent to the
Closing Date.  
   

      |   
---|--- 
     | (viii) Neither the Company, nor any Subsidiary nor any
ERISA Affiliate has or has had any obligation with respect to
any "multiemployer plan" (as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA).  
   

      |   
---|--- 
     | (ix) No Employee Retirement Plan or Employee Benefit Plan
or any related trust or other funding medium thereunder or any fiduciary
thereof is, to the best knowledge of the Company, the subject of an
audit, investigation or examination by any governmental or quasi-
governmental agency.  
   

      |   
---|--- 
     | (x) Except as otherwise contemplated by this Agreement,
the execution of, and performance of the transaction contemplated by,
this Agreement will not (either along with or upon the occurrence of
any additional or subsequent events) constitute an event under any
Employee Retirement Plan or Employee Benefit Plan or agreement that will or
may reasonably be expected to result in any payment (whether severance pay
or otherwise), acceleration, vesting or increase in benefits with respect
to any employee, former employee or director of the Company or a
Subsidiary, whether or not any such payment would be an "excess parachute
payment" (within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code).  
   

      |   
---|--- 
     | (xi) Neither the Company nor a Subsidiary maintains any

applicable requirements of Section 601 of ERISA and Section 4980B(b) of the
Code, and the Company and its Subsidiaries are not subject to any
material liability, including without limitation, additional contributions,
fines, penalties or loss of tax deduction as a result of such administration
and operation. No Employee Benefit Plan provides health, life insurance
or death benefit coverage beyond the termination of the

the Code or any state laws requiring continuation of benefits
coverage following termination of employment.  
   

      |   
---|--- 
     | (xii) The Company (or, if applicable, a Subsidiary) may
terminate any Employee Retirement Plan or Employee Benefit Plan or may
cease contributions to any such Plan without incurring any liability
other than a benefit liability accrued in accordance with the terms of
such Plan immediately prior to such termination or ceasing of
contributions.  
   

 II.03. Employees and Employee Benefit Plans.
