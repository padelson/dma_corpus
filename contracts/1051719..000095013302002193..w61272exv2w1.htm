<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.01. <B>Maximum Merger Consideration</B>. The maximum aggregate merger
consideration to be paid by Parent and Acquisition pursuant to this Agreement
is U.S. $209&nbsp;million less the Seller Expenses (the <B>&#147;Maximum Merger
Consideration&#148;</B>), subject to adjustment as set forth in this Article&nbsp;III. In
addition, at the Effective Time, Parent shall satisfy the Company&#146;s
interest-bearing borrowings and debt obligations (other than the Company&#146;s
outstanding letters of credit) pursuant to payoff letters delivered to Parent
by the Company at least two days prior to the Closing Date.

Shares and shares described in Section&nbsp;3.02(b), shall be canceled and converted
into the right to receive cash in an amount (the <B>&#147;Per Share Amount&#148;</B>) equal to
(i)&nbsp;the Maximum Merger Consideration plus an amount equal to the amount the
Company would receive if all of the Options were exercised in full at the
exercise price set forth therein, divided by (ii)&nbsp;the total number of Shares,
including Shares issuable upon the exercise of Options, with the result of such
calculation subject to adjustment and payable as provided in this Article&nbsp;III.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;Each Share, if any, held in the Company&#146;s treasury immediately prior

therefor.

accordance with Section&nbsp;262 of the DGCL (<B>&#147;Dissenting Shares&#148;</B>) will not be
converted into the right to receive the Per Share Amount (if and as adjusted
pursuant to this Article&nbsp;III) otherwise payable with respect to such Shares at
or after the Effective Time, but instead will be converted into the right to
receive such consideration as may be determined to be due with respect to such
Dissenting Shares pursuant to the laws of the State of Delaware. If a holder
of Dissenting Shares (a <B>&#147;Dissenting Stockholder&#148;</B>) withdraws his or her demand
for such payment and appraisal or becomes ineligible for such payment and
appraisal, then, as of the Effective Time or the occurrence of such event of
withdrawal or ineligibility, whichever last occurs, such holder&#146;s Dissenting
Shares will cease to be Dissenting Shares and will be converted into the right
to receive, and will be exchangeable for, the Per Share Amount (if and as so
adjusted) in accordance with this Agreement. The Company will give Parent and
Acquisition prompt notice of any demand received by the Company from a holder
of Dissenting Shares for appraisal of Shares, and Parent shall have the right
to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demand.
The Company agrees that, except with the prior written consent of Parent, or
as required under the DGCL, it will not voluntarily make any payment with
respect to, or settle or offer or agree to settle, any such demand for
appraisal. Each Dissenting Stockholder who, pursuant to Section&nbsp;262 of the
DGCL, becomes entitled to payment of the value of the Dissenting Shares will
receive payment therefor but only after the value therefor has been agreed upon
or finally determined pursuant to such provisions. Any portion of the Per
Share Amount (if and as so adjusted) that would otherwise have been payable
with respect to Dissenting Shares if such Shares were not Dissenting Shares
will be retained by Parent.

instructions or other delivery instructions for use in connection with the
payment of the merger consideration to the Stockholders and Optionholders
hereunder. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, upon surrender to
Parent of such certificates or agreements (or affidavit of loss or destruction

by Parent in its sole discretion), duly executed and completed to Parent&#146;s
satisfaction, Parent shall make payment to the persons entitled thereto by

the Company, in the amount equal to the price to which such Person is entitled
pursuant to Section&nbsp;3.02(d) or Section&nbsp;3.04(c), as the case may be, less any
required tax withholdings and less any amounts due from such Person to the
Company. No interest will be paid or will accrue on the amount payable upon
the surrender of any such certificate or agreements. If payment is to be made
to a Person other than the registered holder of the certificate or agreement
surrendered, it shall be a condition of such payment that the certificate or
agreement so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or otherwise in proper form
for transfer and that the Person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer
or other taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the
registered holder of the certificate or agreement surrendered or establish to
the reasonable satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation or Parent that such
tax has been paid or is not applicable.
