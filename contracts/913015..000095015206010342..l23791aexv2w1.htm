 1.3 Assumption of Obligations. At the Closing, Buyer shall assume and agrees to pay, discharge and perform the following (collectively, the " _Assumed Obligations_ "):

 (c) any current liability of Seller for which Buyer has received a credit under Section 1.7. 

  

 1.4 Retained Liabilities. Unless otherwise required pursuant to the Local Marketing Agreement, Buyer does not assume or agree to discharge or perform and will not be deemed by reason of the execution and delivery of this Agreement or any agreement, instrument or documents delivered pursuant to or in connection with this Agreement or otherwise by reason of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, to have assumed or to have agreed to discharge or perform, any liabilities, obligations or commitments of Seller of any nature whatsoever whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise, other than the Assumed Obligations (the " _Retained Liabilities_ "); provided, however, the Retained Liabilities do not include any liability under Environmental Laws, except to the extent Seller has undertaken to remediate an Environmental Condition under Section 4.9 (Environmental) or Seller is obligated under Section 7.2(a)(i) to indemnify Buyer for breach of any representation or warranty in Section 2.12 (Environmental). For avoidance of any doubt, all liabilities for Taxes arising from Sellers ownership and operation of the Stations shall be Retained Liabilities, except to the extent the Local Marketing Agreement expressly provides otherwise. 

   

 1.5 Purchase Price. 

   

 (a) In consideration for the sale of the Station Assets, Buyer shall, at the Closing, in addition to assuming the Assumed Obligations, pay to Seller the sum of $125,000,000 (the " _Purchase Price_ ") by wire transfer of immediately available federal funds pursuant to wire instructions that Seller shall provide to Buyer. 

  

 (b) Buyer shall deliver to Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (the " _Escrow Agent_ ") the sum of $9,375,000 no later than three Business Days from the date hereof to be held as an earnest money deposit (" _Escrow Deposit_ ") pursuant to an Escrow Agreement among Seller, Buyer and Escrow Agent of even date herewith. In addition to any other right of Seller under this Agreement, Seller shall have the right to terminate this Agreement if the Escrow Deposit is not delivered to the Escrow Agent within three Business Days of the date of this Agreement. The Escrow Deposit (i) shall be paid to Seller as partial payment of the cash Purchase Price due at Closing to Seller (and credited against the amount to be wire transferred to Seller pursuant to Section 1.5(a)) and the interest accrued thereon shall be paid to Buyer, or (ii) shall otherwise be made available to Seller or released in accordance with Section 8.1(f) or Section 8.1(g) hereof. 

   ##### 

  

  

 1.6 Closing. Subject to Section 8.1 hereof and except as otherwise mutually agreed upon by Seller and Buyer, the consummation of the sale and purchase of the Station Assets and the assumption of the Assumed Obligations hereunder (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place (by electronic exchange of the documents to be delivered at the Closing) on the later of (a) five Business Days after the day that the FCC Consent becomes effective and (b) the date on which each of the other conditions to Closing set forth in Article V has been satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions at such time); provided, however, that the Closing shall not take place before November 22, 2006. Alternatively, the Closing may take place at such other place, time or date as the parties may mutually agree in writing but shall not occur before the FCC Consent is effective. The date on which the Closing is to occur is referred to herein as the " _Closing Date_." The effective time of the Closing shall be 12:01 a.m., local Station time, on the Closing Date (the " _Effective Time_ "). 

   

 1.7 General Proration. 

   

 (a) Except as provided in the Local Marketing Agreement, all Station Assets that would be classified as assets in accordance with GAAP, and all Assumed Obligations that would be classified as liabilities in accordance with GAAP (including accrued but unpaid commissions, but excluding equity non-cash compensation), shall be prorated between Buyer and Seller as of the Effective Time, including by taking into account the elapsed time or consumption of an asset during the month in which the Effective Time occurs (respectively, the " _Prorated Station Assets_ " and the " _Prorated Assumed Obligations_ "). Except as provided in the Local Marketing Agreement, such Prorated Station Assets and Prorated Assumed Obligations relating to the period prior to the Effective Time shall be for the account of Seller and those relating to the period on or after the Effective Time for the account of Buyer and shall be prorated accordingly. 

  

 (b) Except as provided in the Local Marketing Agreement, such prorations shall include all ad valorem and other property taxes, assessments, utility expenses, liabilities and obligations under Station Contracts, rents and similar prepaid and deferred items and all other expenses and obligations, such as accrued but unpaid commissions, deferred revenue and prepayments, attributable to the ownership and operation of the Stations that straddle the period before and after the Effective Time. If such amounts were prepaid by Seller prior to the Effective Time and Buyer will receive a benefit after the Effective Time, then Seller shall receive a credit for such amounts. If Seller was entitled to receive a benefit prior to the Effective Time and such amounts will be paid by Buyer after the Effective Time, Buyer will receive a credit for such amounts. To the extent not known, real estate and personal property taxes shall be apportioned on the basis of Taxes assessed for the preceding year, with a reapportionment as soon as the new tax rate and valuation can be ascertained even if such is ascertained after the Settlement Statement is so determined. In addition, upon the Closing Date, or as promptly thereafter as is practicable, all employee and programming bonuses and incentive compensation or fees (and the taxes related thereto) earned or accrued at or prior to the Closing Date or otherwise attributable to the fiscal or calendar year or other period during which the Closing Date falls shall be equitably prorated between Buyer and Seller, even if such amounts would not be accrued or classified as liabilities under GAAP. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (c) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 1.7 to the contrary, there shall be no proration under this Section 1.7 for Tradeout Agreements except as follows. In the event that the value of the aggregate liability of the Stations under the Tradeout Agreements as of the Effective Time exceeds the sum of (i) $20,000 _plus_ (ii) the aggregate fair value of the goods yet to be received and services yet to be used by the Stations under the Tradeout Agreements, such excess shall be treated as a Prorated Assumed Obligation.

Within 60 days after selection of the Accounting Firm, Buyer and Seller shall submit their respective positions to the Accounting Firm, in writing, together with any other materials relied upon in support of their respective positions. Buyer and Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Accounting Firm to render a decision resolving the matters in dispute within 30 days following the submission of such materials to the Accounting Firm.

   ##### 

  

    

under existing employee arrangements, (C) enter into any new employment

foregoing. 

  

 (b) Prior to Commencement of the Local Marketing Agreement. Between the date of this Agreement and the LMA Commencement Date, except as expressly permitted by this Agreement or the Local Marketing Agreement, or with the prior written consent of Buyer, which consent shall not be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed and which shall be deemed given if Buyer does not respond to Sellers request within five Business Days of receipt thereof, Seller shall: 

   

 (i) notify Buyer promptly if any of the normal broadcast transmissions of any Station are materially interrupted, interfered with or impaired, and provide Buyer with prompt written notice of the problem and the measures being taken to correct such problem; 

   

 (ii) operate the Stations in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice and with the intent of preserving the ongoing operations and assets of the Stations, including but not limited to maintaining the independent identity of each of the Stations, retaining the current format and programming (including the content thereof) of the Stations and using its commercially reasonable efforts to retain the services of all active Station Employees, consultants and agents of the Stations and preserve the operation of the Stations intact in all material respects and use commercially reasonable efforts to preserve the business of the Stations advertisers, customers, suppliers and others having business relations with the Stations and continue to conduct financial operations of the Stations, including its credit and collection and pricing policies and practices, in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practices; 

   

 (iii) use commercially reasonable efforts to preserve the business and goodwill of the Stations and the Station Assets;

 (v) maintain the Tangible Personal Property and the Real Property in normal operating condition consistent with Sellers past practices, ordinary wear and tear excepted; and 

   

 (vi) not change the call letters of the Stations. 

  

 (c) Control of Stations. Subject to the provisions of this Section 4.2 and the terms of the Local Marketing Agreement, Buyer shall not, directly or indirectly, control, supervise or direct the operations of the Stations prior to the Closing. Such operations shall be the sole responsibility of Seller and shall be in its complete discretion. 

  

 4.3 Access to Information; Inspections; Confidentiality; Publicity. 

   

 (a) Between the date hereof and the Closing Date, Seller shall furnish Buyer with such information relating to the Station Assets as Buyer may reasonably request, at 

   ##### 

  

    

Buyers expense and provided such request does not interfere unreasonably with
the business of the Stations. 

  

 (b) Between the date hereof and the LMA Commencement Date, at Buyers reasonable request and upon prior reasonable notice, Seller shall give or cause the Stations to give Buyer and Buyers counsel, accountants, engineers and other representatives reasonable access during normal business hours to all of Sellers personnel, properties, books, Station Contracts, reports and records (including, without limitation, financial information relating to the Stations and, to the extent permitted by Law, relating to the Station Employees), tax returns, if any, solely relating to the Stations, real estate, buildings and equipment relating to the Stations, and to furnish Buyer with information and copies of all documents and agreements relating to the Stations and the operation thereof that Buyer may reasonably request. 

  

 (c) Seller shall cooperate, and use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause its independent auditors to reasonably cooperate, with Buyer in order to enable Buyer, at its expense, to have independent auditors (as that term is defined in the Securities Act and the published rules and regulations thereunder) selected by Buyer prepare audited and/or reviewed financial statements for the Stations for any fiscal year-end and any interim period(s) to the extent Buyer reasonably determines such financial statements are required by the Securities Act and/or the Exchange Act. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Seller agrees that it will: (i) consent to the use or incorporation of such audited and/or reviewed financial statements in any registration statement or other document filed by Buyer or any of its Affiliates under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, (ii) execute and deliver, and cause its officers to execute and deliver, such "representation" letters as are customarily delivered in connection with audits and as Sellers or Buyers independent accountants may reasonably request under the circumstances, and (iii) cooperate, and use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause its independent auditors to reasonably cooperate, in consenting to the use or incorporation of the audited financials of Buyer or any of its Affiliates under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act whether before or after the Closing. Sellers duty to cooperate pursuant to this Section is between the date hereof and the Closing Date, as well as after the Closing Date to the extent Buyer reasonably requests Sellers cooperation. 

  

 (d) Nothing contained herein should be deemed to negate or limit the Sellers or any of its Affiliates rights or any obligations of the Buyer or any of its Affiliates under that certain letter agreement, dated April 19, 2006, by and between CBS Corporation and Regent Communications, Inc. (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ") _,_ which is incorporated herein by reference. 

  

 (e) No news release or other public announcement pertaining to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will be made by or on behalf of any party hereto without the prior written approval of the other party (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), unless the disclosing party determines, after discussion with its legal counsel, that such disclosure is otherwise required by Law or any regulation or rule of any stock exchange binding upon such party. Where any announcement, communication or circular concerning the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is required by Law or any regulation or rule of any stock exchange, it shall be made by the relevant party after consultation, where reasonably practicable, with the other party and taking into account the reasonable 

   ##### 

  

    

requirements (as to timing, contents and manner of making or dispatch of the
announcement, communication or circular) of the other party. 

  

 4.4 Risk of Loss. 

   

 (a) Seller shall bear the risk of any casualty loss or damage to any of the Station Assets prior to the LMA Commencement Date, and Buyer shall bear such risk on and after the LMA Commencement Date. In the event of any casualty loss or damage to the Station Assets prior to the LMA Commencement Date, Seller shall be responsible for repairing or replacing (as appropriate under the circumstances) any lost or damaged Station Asset (the " _Damaged Asset_ "), unless such Damaged Asset was obsolete and unnecessary for the continued operation of the Stations consistent with Sellers past practice and the FCC Licenses and applicable Law. If Seller is unable to repair or replace a Damaged Asset by the date on which the Closing would otherwise occur under this Agreement, then the proceeds of any insurance covering such Damaged Asset shall be assigned to Buyer at Closing, and to the extent such proceeds are not sufficient to cover the reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred by Buyer in repairing or replacing the Damaged Asset after the Closing, Seller shall reimburse Buyer by an amount equal to the deficiency. 

  

 (b) If a Station is off the air prior to the LMA Commencement Date, then Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to return the Station to the air as promptly as practicable in the ordinary course of business. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if on the day otherwise scheduled for commencement of the Local Marketing Agreement, a Station is off the air or operating with a material reduction in coverage, then commencement of the Local Marketing Agreement as to the affected Station shall be postponed until the date five Business Days after such affected Station returns to the air, and, if applicable, such reduction in coverage is substantially corrected, and the fee payable pursuant to paragraph 1 of Schedule 1.5 of the Local Marketing Agreement during the deferral period shall be reduced by an amount equal to (i) the fee as set forth in paragraph 1 _times_ (ii) the quotient of (x) the EBITDA for the affected Station or Stations during the first seven months of 2006 as shown on the Reference Financial Statements  _divided_ by (y) the EBITDA for the Stations, as a whole, as shown on the Reference Financial Statements during the same seven-month period; provided, however, that Buyer shall have no obligation to commence operations under the Local Marketing Agreement if WYRK(FM), WBLK(FM) or WJYE(FM) (each, a " _Material Station_ ") are off the air or operating with a material reduction in coverage, until the date five Business Days after the Material Station returns to the air or, if applicable, such coverage is substantially corrected. If Seller is unable to return a Material Station to the air without any material reduction in coverage within 30 days of the outage, Buyer shall have the right to terminate this Agreement, without incurring any liability to Seller, upon written notice to Seller, provided that Buyer delivers such notice to terminate to Seller prior to the LMA Commencement Date. For the avoidance of any doubt, Buyer shall have no termination right under this Section 4.4(b) after the LMA Commencement Date. 

  

 4.5 Consents to Assignment; Estoppel Certificates. After the execution of this Agreement and prior to Closing, Seller shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain (a) any third-party consents necessary for the assignment of any Station Contract or Real Property Lease and (b) estoppel certificates duly executed by the lessors under the Real Property 

  ##### 

  

    

Leases in the form of _Exhibit A_ attached hereto. Notwithstanding anything
in this Agreement to the contrary, this Agreement shall not constitute an
agreement to assign any Station Contract or any claim or right or any benefit
arising thereunder or resulting therefrom if such assignment, without the
consent of a third party thereto, would constitute a breach or
other contravention of such Station Contract or in any way adversely affect
the rights of Buyer or Seller thereunder. If such consent is not obtained
prior to the Closing Date, (i) Seller shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to (A) obtain such consent as soon as possible after the
Closing Date, (B) provide to Buyer the financial and business benefits of any
such Station Contract and (C) enforce, at the request of Buyer, for the
account of Buyer, any rights of Seller arising from any such Station
Contract; and (ii) Buyer shall assume the obligations under such Station
Contract in accordance with this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates shall be required to pay
consideration (except as may be specifically contemplated by the relevant
Station Contract) to any third party to obtain any consent or estoppel
certificate. 

   

 4.6 Notification. Each party shall notify the other party of the initiation or threatened initiation of any litigation, arbitration or administrative proceeding that challenges the transactions contemplated hereby, including any challenges to the FCC Application. 

   

 4.7 Employee Matters. 

   

 (a) On the LMA Commencement Date, Buyer shall offer employment to each Station Employee who is employed immediately prior to the LMA Commencement Date and who (i) is not on authorized leave of absence, sick leave, short or long term disability leave, military leave or layoff with recall rights (" _Active Employees_ ") _,_ or (ii) is on authorized leave of absence, sick leave, short or long term disability leave, military leave or layoff with recall rights who returns to active employment immediately following such absence and within six months of the Closing or such later date as required under applicable law (" _Inactive Employees_ "), except as set forth on _Schedule 4.7_ of this Agreement or Schedule 4.1 of the Local Marketing Agreement. On the Closing Date, Buyer shall offer employment to each employee listed on Schedule 4.1 of the Local Marketing Agreement. For the purposes hereof, all Station Employees who accept Buyers offer of employment are hereinafter referred to collectively as the " _Transferred Employees,_ " and the " _Employment Commencement Date_ " as referred to herein shall mean (i) as to those Transferred Employees who are listed on Schedule 4.1 of the Local Marketing Agreement, the Closing Date, (ii) as to those Transferred Employees who are Active Employees and are not listed on Schedule 4.1 of the Local Marketing Agreement, the LMA Commencement Date, and (iii) as to those Transferred Employees who are Inactive Employees and are not listed on Schedule 4.1 of the Local Marketing Agreement, the date on which the Transferred Employee begins employment with Buyer. Buyer shall offer employment to Active and Inactive Employees and employ at-will those Transferred Employees who do not have employment agreements with the Seller at a monetary compensation (or monetary compensation formula, including base salary, commission rate and bonus opportunity) at least as favorable as that provided by Seller immediately prior to the Employment Commencement Date. The initial terms and conditions of employment for those Transferred Employees who have employment agreements, including account executive agreements and bonus term sheets, with the Seller shall be dictated by such employment agreements to the extent such employment agreements are assignable and consent to assignment, if necessary, is obtained; provided, however, Buyer shall not be required to provide (i) any form of equity compensation, including but not limited to, any 

   ##### 

  

    

stock, options, warrants, phantom stock plans, or otherwise, or (ii) benefits
under specific employee benefit plans that are not otherwise offered by Buyer
immediately prior to the Employment Commencement Date. For a period of 90
days from the Employment Commencement Date, Buyer shall provide severance
benefits to the Transferred Employees on terms consistent in all
material respects with those severance benefits provided by Seller as set
forth on _Schedule 2.13_ hereto; provided Seller shall reimburse Buyer for
the first $200,000 in severance benefits actually paid to Transferred
Employees as a result of terminations during such 90-day period. 

  

 (b) Seller shall be responsible for: (i) claims for medical and dental benefits, disability benefits, life insurance benefits and workers compensation that are incurred prior to the Employment Commencement Date; and (ii) claims related to "COBRA" coverage attributable to "qualifying events" occurring prior to the Employment Commencement Date, in each case, with respect to any Transferred Employee and beneficiaries and dependents. Buyer shall be responsible, to the extent any claims are covered by the terms of Buyers plans, for: (i) claims for medical and dental benefits, disability benefits, life insurance benefits and workers compensation that are incurred on or after the Employment Commencement Date; and (ii) claims related to "COBRA" coverage attributable to "qualifying events" occurring on or after the Employment Commencement Date, in each case, with respect to any Transferred Employee and beneficiaries and dependents. For purposes of the foregoing, a medical/dental claim shall be considered when the medical services are rendered or medical supplies are provided, and not when the condition arose. A life insurance or workers compensation claim shall be considered incurred prior to a particular date if the injury or condition giving rise to the claim occurs prior to such date. A disability claim shall be deemed to be incurred when the employee is declared disabled under the terms of the applicable disability plan. 

  

 (c) Subject to the requirements of Buyers plan administrator, (i) Buyer shall cause all Transferred Employees to be eligible to participate in its "employee welfare benefit plans" (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA) and its "defined contribution plans" (as defined in Section 414(i) of the Code) to the extent Buyers similarly-situated employees are generally eligible to participate, (ii) all Transferred Employees and their spouses and dependents shall be eligible for coverage immediately after the Employment Commencement Date (and shall not be excluded from coverage under any employee welfare benefit plan that is a group health plan on account of any pre-existing condition, as long as such condition is covered under Buyers group health plan), (iii) all Transferred Employees who, immediately prior to the Employment Commencement Date, were eligible to participate in a defined contribution plan maintained by Seller or its Affiliates, shall become participants in the Regent Communications, Inc. 401(k) Profit Sharing Plan as soon as administratively feasible after their Employment Commencement Date, (iv) for purposes of any length of service requirements, waiting periods or differential benefits based on length of service in any such employee welfare benefit plans (including any severance plans or policies) and defined contribution plans for which Transferred Employees may be eligible after Closing, Buyer shall ensure, to the extent permitted by applicable Law (including ERISA and the Code), that service with Seller (as shown on _Schedule 2.13_) shall be deemed to have been service with Buyer, (v) Buyer shall cause its defined contribution plans to accept rollover contributions from the Transferred Employees of any account balances distributed to them by the Sellers 401(k) plan or any 401(k) plan of Sellers Affiliates, provided that Seller confirms that such 401(k) plan is a qualified retirement plan under Section 401(a) of 

   ##### 

  

    

the Code, and (vi) Buyer shall allow any such Transferred Employees
outstanding plan loan that is not in default to be directly rolled into
Buyers defined contribution plans. The distribution and rollover described
herein shall comply with applicable Law, and each party shall make all
filings and take any actions required of such party by applicable Law in
connection therewith. Buyer also shall ensure, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law (including ERISA and the Code) and Buyers plans, that
Transferred Employees receive credit under any welfare benefit plan of Buyer
for any deductibles or co-payments paid by Transferred Employees and their
spouses and dependents for the current plan year under a plan maintained by
Seller. 

  

 (d) Notwithstanding any other provision contained herein, Buyer shall grant credit for all unused sick leave accrued by Transferred Employees on the basis of their service during the current calendar year as employees of Seller. Sellers sick leave policy does not allow for a carry-over from year to year and is a "use it or lose it" policy. 

  

 (e) Provided that Buyer receives an appropriate proration under Section 1.7, Buyer will assume all liabilities for unpaid, accrued vacation and personal days of Transferred Employees as of the Employment Commencement Date (" _Accrued Vacation_ ") _,_ and shall permit Transferred Employees to use their Accrued Vacation entitlement until twelve (12) months from the Employment Commencement Date. Buyer will pay any Transferred Employee to the extent that such Transferred Employee has any unused Accrued Vacation at the end of such twelve (12) month period. Service with both Buyer and Seller (as shown on _Schedule 2.13)_ shall be taken into account in determining Transferred Employees vacation entitlement under the Buyers vacation policy after the Employment Commencement Date. Except as prohibited by applicable Law, after the Closing Seller shall deliver to Buyer originals or copies of all personnel files and records (excluding medical and benefit plan records) related to the Transferred Employees, and Seller shall have reasonable continuing access to such files and records thereafter. 

  

 (f) From the date hereof until the eighteen-month anniversary of the LMA Commencement Date, or the Closing Date in the case of those Transferred Employees listed on Schedule 4.1 of the Local Marketing Agreement, neither Seller nor any Affiliate of Seller shall solicit for employment any Station Employees, other than pursuant to a general solicitation not specifically targeted at any employees of the Stations, and shall not during such period hire or transfer any Station Employees, to work for any radio station under the control of CBS Corporation, other than at the Stations. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, Seller and Sellers Affiliates shall be permitted to solicit for employment and hire any Transferred Employee terminated by Buyer within 90 days of the Employment Commencement Date. 

  

 4.8 Title Insurance; Surveys. 

   

 (a) Seller shall deliver to Buyer, within 45 days of the date of this Agreement, title commitments (i) on the Owned Real Property sufficient in form to allow Buyer to obtain, at Buyers sole cost and expense, a standard form of title insurance policy insuring the fee simple interest in the Owned Real Property in the form of the commitment referenced on _Schedule 4.8_ and subject only to Permitted Liens and those matters set forth in such commitment and (ii) as to the leasehold interest in the 14 Lafayette Square, Buffalo, NY tower site. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (b) Seller shall cooperate with Buyer (provided that Seller shall not be required to pay any consideration to Buyer or any third party) so that Buyer may, at its option and at its sole cost and expense, obtain, within 45 days of the date of this Agreement, ALTA surveys of the Owned Real Property, which shall reflect (i) no encroachments upon such parcels or adjoining parcels by buildings, structures or improvements which would adversely affect title or materially interfere with or impair the use of the Owned Real Property for the purpose for which it is currently used or materially adversely affect the value of the property, and (ii) access to such parcels from a dedicated roadway or indirect practical, legal and insurable access to a dedicated roadway. 

  

 4.9 Environmental. Buyer may at its expense conduct environmental reviews of the Owned Real Property within 45 days of the date of this Agreement; provided, however, that no intrusive sampling shall be performed without Sellers prior written approval (which shall not be unreasonably withheld). If any such environmental review discloses a material violation of, or material condition that, if disclosed to the appropriate Governmental Authority, Buyer or Seller would reasonably be expected to be required to remediate under applicable Environmental Laws at any of the Owned Real Property (which violation or condition shall hereinafter be referred to as an " _Environmental Condition_ ") and such Environmental Conditions, in the aggregate, have a corrective or remediation cost estimated in reasonable good faith by Buyers consultant to be less than $500,000, then Seller shall remediate or undertake to remediate such conditions in all material respects prior to Closing, provided that the completion of such remediation shall not be a condition to Buyers obligation to close hereunder. If such Environmental Conditions, in the aggregate, have a remediation cost estimated in good faith by Buyers consultant to be $500,000 or more, then within 10 Business Days after delivery to Seller of such environmental assessment, Seller shall notify Buyer of its election to either (a) remediate or undertake to remedy such conditions in all material respects prior to Closing, provided that the completion of such remediation shall not be a condition to Buyers obligation to close hereunder, or (b) not remediate or undertake to remedy such conditions, in which event Buyer may terminate this Agreement on written notice to Seller. This Section 4.9 sets forth Buyers sole remedy if an environmental review obtained by Buyer pursuant to this Section 4.9 prior to Closing discloses an Environmental Condition. For the avoidance of any doubt, the pre-Closing discovery of such an Environmental Condition shall be deemed an exception to Sellers representations and warranties in Section 2.12, and Buyer shall have no claim against Seller pursuant to the indemnification provisions or otherwise for such an Environmental Condition except as provided in this Section 4.9. Sellers obligations under this Section 4.9 shall survive the Closing. 

   

 4.10 Further Assurances. After Closing, each party hereto shall execute all such instruments and take all such actions as any other party may reasonably request, without payment of further consideration, to effectuate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the execution and delivery of confirmatory and other transfer documents in addition to those to be delivered at Closing. 

   

 4.11 No Shop. From the date hereof, until the earlier of the Closing Date or the termination of this Agreement, Seller and its Affiliates will not, directly or indirectly, encourage, solicit, or engage in discussions or negotiations with, or provide any information to, any Person (other than Buyer and its representatives) concerning any sale or disposition of all, or 

  ##### 

  

    

substantially all, of the Station Assets or the FCC Licenses, provided that
this Section 4.11 shall not apply to any discussions or negotiations
involving the securities of Seller or any Affiliate of Seller. 

   

 4.12 No Inconsistent Action; Notice. Seller shall not take any action which is materially inconsistent with its obligations under this Agreement, or take any action which would materially hinder or delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. During the period from the date of this Agreement to the Closing Date, Seller shall notify Buyer of any action taken by Seller that, if it had been taken on or prior to the date hereof, would have caused any of the representations and warranties made by Seller in this Agreement to become false or invalid. 

   

 4.13 Sellers Actions. Seller shall complete, pay directly or reimburse Buyer for all amounts required to complete any projects or any actions set forth on _Schedule 4.13_.

   ##### 

  

    

indemnification pursuant to clause (iv) to the extent such claim would also be
indemnifiable under clauses (ii)  (iii). 

  

 7.3 Procedures. The indemnified party shall give prompt written notice to the indemnifying party of any demand, suit, claim or assertion of liability by third parties or other circumstances that could give rise to an indemnification obligation hereunder against the indemnifying party (a " _Claim_ "), but a failure to give or a delay in giving such notice shall not affect the indemnified partys right to indemnification and the indemnifying partys obligation to indemnify as set forth in this Agreement, except to the extent the indemnifying partys ability to remedy, contest, defend or settle with respect to such Claim is thereby prejudiced. The obligations and liabilities of the parties with respect to any Claim shall be subject to the following additional terms and conditions: 

    

 (a) The indemnifying party shall have the right to undertake, by counsel or other representatives of its own choosing, the defense or opposition to such Claim. 

   

 (b) In the event that the indemnifying party shall elect not to undertake such defense or opposition, or, within 20 days after written notice (which shall include sufficient description of background information explaining the basis for such Claim) of any such Claim from the indemnified party, the indemnifying party shall fail to undertake to defend or oppose, the indemnified party (upon further written notice to the indemnifying party) shall have the right to undertake the defense, opposition, compromise or settlement of such Claim, by counsel or other representatives of its own choosing, on behalf of and for the account and risk of the indemnifying party (subject to the right of the indemnifying party to assume defense of or opposition to such Claim at any time prior to settlement, compromise or final determination thereof). 

   

 (c) Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding (i) the indemnified party shall have the right, at its own cost and expense, to participate in the defense, opposition, compromise or settlement of the Claim, (ii) the indemnifying party shall not, without the indemnified partys written consent, settle or compromise any Claim or consent to entry of any judgment, unless such judgment, settlement or compromise includes the giving by the claimant to the indemnified party of a release from all liability in respect of such Claim, and (iii) in the event that the indemnifying party undertakes defense of or opposition to any Claim, the indemnified party, by counsel or other representative of its own choosing and at its sole cost and expense, shall have the right to consult with the indemnifying party and its counsel or other representatives concerning such Claim and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and their respective counsel or other representatives shall cooperate in good faith with respect to such Claim. 

  

 7.4 Computation of Indemnifiable Losses. Any amount payable pursuant to this Article VII shall be decreased to the extent of (a) any amounts actually recovered by the indemnified party from any third party (including insurance proceeds) in respect of an indemnifiable Loss, and (b) any net Tax benefit actually realized by the indemnified party arising out of an indemnifiable Loss. The indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall cooperate 

   ##### 

  

    

in good faith in providing each other the information necessary to determine
the Tax benefits, as the case may be, in each case. The indemnified party
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to pursue payment under or from
any insurer or third-party in respect of such Losses. Buyer shall not, and
shall cause the Stations not to, without the prior written consent of the
Seller, waive, release, compromise, reduce or otherwise amend in any way that
would limit coverage, any fully-paid insurance policies or coverage in effect
at the Closing that relate to Losses. 

  

 7.5 Sole Remedy. After the Closing, the right to indemnification under this Article VII shall be the exclusive remedy of any party in connection with any breach or default by another party under this Agreement, any Buyer Ancillary Agreement or any Seller Ancillary Agreement, provided that nothing in this Section 7.5 shall limit a partys right (a) to seek equitable relief in connection with the non-performance of any agreement or covenant contained in this Agreement, any Buyer Ancillary Agreement or any Seller Ancillary Agreement that contemplates performance after the Closing, and (b) to bring an Action for common law fraud or willful misconduct, regardless of whether such common law fraud or willful misconduct also included a breach of any agreement, covenant, representation or warranty; provided that such Action must be brought within the applicable survival period set forth in Section 7.1 or the applicable statute of limitations, whichever is shorter. Neither party shall have any liability to the other party under any circumstances for special, indirect, consequential, punitive or exemplary damages, or lost profits, diminution in value or any damages based on any type of multiple of any Indemnified Party. 

   

ARTICLE VIII 
  _TERMINATION RIGHTS_  

   

 8.1 Termination. 

   

 (a) This Agreement may be terminated prior to Closing by either Buyer or Seller upon written notice to the other following the occurrence of any of the following: 

   

 (i) if the other party is in material breach or default of this Agreement or does not perform in all material respects the obligations to be performed by it under this Agreement on the Closing Date such that the conditions set forth in Sections 5.1(a) and 5.2(a) _,_ as applicable, would not be satisfied and such breach or default has not been waived by the party giving such termination notice; 

   

 (ii) if there shall be any Law that prohibits consummation of the sale of the Stations or if a Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction shall have issued a final, nonappealable Government Order enjoining or otherwise prohibiting consummation of the sale of the Stations; 

   

 (iii) if the FCC denies the FCC Application; 

   

 (iv) if the Local Marketing Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.1(a) of the Local Marketing Agreement; or 

   ##### 

  

   

 (v) if the Closing has not occurred by the date that is 18 months from the date hereof (the " _Upset Date_ "), provided however, if the Closing has not occurred by the Upset Date and all other conditions precedent to Buyers obligations to close as set forth in Section 5.1 of this Agreement have been satisfied or waived by Buyer other than the grant of the FCC Consent, Buyer may, at its option, extend the Upset Date for an additional 12 months. 

  

 (b) This Agreement may be terminated prior to Closing upon written notice from Buyer to Seller as provided by Section 4.9 (Environmental). 

  

 (c) This Agreement may be terminated prior to Closing by mutual written consent of Buyer and Seller. 

  

 (d) This Agreement may be terminated prior to Closing upon written notice from Seller to Buyer as provided by Section 1.5 (Purchase Price). 

  

 (e) If either party believes the other to be in breach or default of this Agreement, the non-defaulting party shall, prior to exercising its right to terminate under Section 8.1(a)(i), provide the defaulting party with notice specifying in reasonable detail the nature of such breach or default. Except for a failure to pay the Purchase Price, the defaulting party shall have 20 days from receipt of such notice to cure such default; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the breach or default is incapable of cure within such 20-day period, the cure period shall be extended as long as the defaulting party is diligently and in good faith attempting to effectuate a cure. Nothing in this Section 8.1(e) shall be interpreted to extend the Upset Date. 

  

 (f) If this Agreement is terminated under the provisions of this Article VIII for any reason other than by Seller pursuant to Section 8.1(a)(i), then the Escrow Deposit and any interest accrued thereon shall be returned to Buyer by the Escrow Agent. In addition, if Seller contests Buyers right to the Escrow Deposit, and Buyer prevails in any Action to enforce its right to the Escrow Deposit, then Buyer shall also be entitled to payment from Seller of the reasonable attorneys fees incurred by Buyer in such Action. 

  

 (g) If this Agreement is terminated by Seller pursuant to Section 8.1(a)(i), then Seller shall be entitled to the Escrow Deposit as liquidated damages and all accrued interest thereon shall be returned to Buyer. In addition, if Buyer contests Sellers right to the Escrow Deposit, and Seller prevails in any Action to enforce its right to the Escrow Deposit, then Seller shall also be entitled to payment from Buyer of the reasonable attorneys fees incurred by Seller in such Action. The parties understand and agree that the amount of liquidated damages represents Sellers and Buyers reasonable estimate of actual damages and does not constitute a penalty. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, in the event that Seller terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(a)(i), the payment of the Escrow Deposit, together with any attorneys fees, pursuant to this Section 8.1(g), shall be Sellers sole and exclusive remedy for damages of any nature or kind that Seller may suffer as a result of Buyers breach or default under this Agreement. 

  

 (h) The parties recognize that if Seller refuses to perform under the provisions of this Agreement or Seller otherwise breaches such that the Closing has not occurred, 

   ##### 

  

    

monetary damages alone will not be adequate to compensate Buyer for its
injury, Buyer shall therefore be entitled to obtain specific performance of
the terms of this Agreement in addition to any other remedies, including but
not limited to monetary damages, that may be available to it. If any action
is brought by Buyer to enforce this Agreement, Seller shall waive the defense
that there is an adequate remedy at law. 

  

 8.2 Effect of Termination. In the event of a valid termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1, this Agreement (other than Sections 4.3(d) and 4.3(e), this Article VIII and Sections 10.1, 10.2, 10.3, 10.4, 10.5, 10.7 and 10.8, which shall remain in full force and effect) shall forthwith become null and void, and no party hereto (nor any of their respective Affiliates, directors, officers or employees) shall have any liability or further obligation, except as provided in this Article VIII; _provided,_ _however_ , that nothing in this Section 8.2 shall (subject to the limitations in Section 8.1(g)) relieve any party from liability for any breach of this Agreement prior to termination. A termination of this Agreement shall not terminate the Local Marketing Agreement nor affect the parties rights and obligations thereunder, and the Local Marketing Agreement shall terminate pursuant to its terms.

The party with primary responsibility under applicable Law for the payment of any particular Transfer Tax shall prepare and file the relevant Tax Return and notify the other party in writing of the Transfer Taxes shown on such Tax Return. Such other party shall pay an amount equal to one-half of the amount of such Transfer Taxes shown on such Tax Return in immediately available funds no later than the date that is the later of (a) five Business Days after the date of such notice or (b) two Business Days prior to the due date for such Transfer Taxes.

    ##### 

  

     

 (a) This Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns. Neither party may assign its rights under this Agreement without the other partys prior written consent, which consent may not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. 

  

 (b) Notwithstanding anything above to the contrary, either Buyer or Seller may, without the other partys consent, (i) assign any or all of its rights and obligations under this Agreement to an Affiliate, provided that such assignment does not delay the receipt of the FCC Consent or the Closing and the assigning party is not relieved of liability under this Agreement, or (ii) assign any or all of its rights but not its obligations under this Agreement to any "qualified intermediary" as defined in Treas. Reg. Sec. 1.1031(k) 1(g)(4) or to any exchange accommodation titleholder as described in Revenue Procedure 2000-37 (" _EAT_ ") (but any such assignment shall not relieve a party of its obligations under this Agreement or increase liability or obligations or result in additional expense), provided that such assignment does not delay the Closing. If Buyer or Seller gives notice of an assignment pursuant to this Section 10.2(b), the other party shall cooperate with all reasonable requests of Buyer or Seller, as the case may be, and the qualified intermediary or EAT in arranging and effecting the deferred like-kind exchange as one which qualifies under Section 1031 of the Code. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Buyer or Seller, as the case may be, shall provide the other party with a written acknowledgement of such notice prior to Closing, Buyer shall pay the Purchase Price (or such portion thereof as is designated in writing by the qualified intermediary) to or on behalf of the qualified intermediary at Closing and Seller shall convey the Station Assets (or such portion thereof as is designated in writing by the qualified intermediary) to or on behalf of the qualified intermediary at Closing.

 10.4 Entire Agreement; Waiver; Amendment. This Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement, the Buyer Ancillary Agreements, the Seller Ancillary Agreements and the exhibits and schedules hereto and thereto constitute the entire agreement of the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersede all prior agreements and undertakings, both written and oral, between Seller and Buyer with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof, except as otherwise expressly provided herein. Any matter that is disclosed in a schedule hereto in such a way as to make its relevance to the information called for by another schedule readily apparent shall be deemed to have been included in such other schedule, notwithstanding the omission of an appropriate cross reference. No amendment, waiver of compliance with any provision or condition hereof, or consent pursuant to this Agreement shall be effective unless evidenced by an instrument in writing signed by the party against whom enforcement of any waiver, amendment, change, extension or discharge is sought. No failure or delay on the part of Buyer or Seller in exercising any right or power under this Agreement shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power.
