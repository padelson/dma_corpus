form, with such other provisions as Parent and the Partnership may reasonably
agree prior to the Effective Time, including instructions for use in effecting
the surrender of Common Unit Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in
lieu thereof) and Book-Entry Common Units to the Exchange Agent in exchange

receive pursuant to _Section 2.3(h)_ out of the Exchange Fund. The Exchange
Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. The Exchange Agent shall invest
any cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent; _provided_ that
no such investment or losses thereon shall affect the Merger Consideration
payable to Holders of the Partnership Public Units and Parent shall promptly

of loss in lieu thereof), if any, or Book-Entry Common Units and such other
documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, will be

such Holder has the right to receive in accordance with the provisions of this
_Article II_ and (ii) a check in the amount of such distributions as such
Holder has the right to receive pursuant to _Section 2.3(h)_. The Merger
Consideration and such other amounts as reflected in the immediately preceding

as practicable after receipt by the Exchange Agent of the Common Unit
Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof), if any, or
Book-Entry Common Units and Letter of Transmittal from such Holder in
accordance with the foregoing. No interest shall be paid or accrued on any
Merger Consideration or on unpaid distributions payable to Holders of
Partnership Public Units pursuant to _Section 2.3(h)_. Until so surrendered,
each such Partnership Public Unit shall, after the Effective Time, represent
for all purposes only the right to receive such Merger Consideration. The
Merger Consideration paid upon surrender of a Common Unit Certificate (or
effective affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Common Unit shall
be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to
the Partnership Public Unit represented thereby.

 



 

(e) _Other Payees_. If any payment is to be made to a Person other than the
Person in whose name the applicable surrendered Common Unit Certificate (or
effective affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Common Unit is
registered, it shall be a condition of such payment that the Person requesting
such payment shall pay any transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason
of the making of such payment to a Person other than the registered Holder of
the surrendered Common Unit Certificate (or effective affidavit of loss in
lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Common Unit or shall establish to the satisfaction
of Parent and the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not
payable. If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be registered in the
name of a Person other than the Person in whose name the applicable
surrendered Common Unit Certificate (or effective affidavit of loss in lieu
thereof) or Book-Entry Common Unit is registered, it shall be a condition to
the registration thereof that any surrendered certificate shall be properly
endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the Person
requesting such delivery of the Merger Consideration shall pay to the Exchange
Agent any transfer or other similar Taxes required as a result of such
registration in the name of a Person other than the registered Holder of such
Common Unit Certificate (or effective affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or
Book-Entry Common Unit or establish to the satisfaction of Parent and the
Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

 



 

(f) _No Further Transfers_. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be
no further registration on the books of the Partnership of transfers of
Partnership Public Units. From and after the Effective Time, the Holders of
Common Unit Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or
Book-Entry Common Units outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall cease to have any rights with respect to the Partnership Public Units
represented thereby except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or by
applicable Law. If, after the Effective Time, Common Unit Certificates (or
effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or

 



     

 

 



 

Book-Entry Common Units are presented to the Exchange Agent or Parent, they
shall be canceled and exchanged for the consideration provided for, and in
accordance with the procedures set forth in, this _Article II_.

 



 

(g) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains unclaimed by the Holders of Partnership Public Units 12 months after
the Effective Time shall be returned to Parent, upon demand, and any such
Holder who has not exchanged such Holders Partnership Public Units for the
Merger Consideration in accordance with this _Section 2.3_ prior to that time
shall thereafter look only to Parent for delivery of the Merger Consideration
in respect of such Holders Partnership Public Units. Anything to the contrary
in this _Section 2.3(g)_ notwithstanding, Parent, the Partnership, and the
Surviving Entity shall not be liable to any Holder of Partnership Public Units
for any Merger Consideration duly delivered to a public official pursuant to
applicable abandoned property Laws. Any Merger Consideration remaining
unclaimed by any Holder of Partnership Public Units immediately prior to such
time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to, or become property of, any
Governmental Authority shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
become the property of Parent free and clear of any claims or interest of any
Person previously entitled thereto.

 



 

(h) _Distributions_. No distributions declared or made with respect to Parent
Common Units issued in the Merger shall be paid to the Holder of any
unsurrendered Common Unit Certificate (or effective affidavit of loss in lieu
thereof) or Book-Entry Common Unit until such Common Unit Certificate (or
effective affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Common Unit is
surrendered as provided in this _Section 2.3_. Following such surrender,
subject to the effect of escheat, Tax, or other applicable Law, Parent shall
(i) cause the Exchange Agent to pay to each Holder of a Common Unit
Certificate (or effective affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry
Unit, without interest, promptly after the time of such surrender, the amount
of all distributions, if any, not previously paid to such Holder that are
payable in respect of Parent Common Units issued with respect thereto that
have a record date after the Effective Time and a payment date on or prior to
the date of such surrender, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, pay to
each Holder of Parent Common Units issuable with respect to such Common Unit
Certificate (or effective affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry
Unit the amount of distributions payable in respect of such Parent Common
Units that have a record date after the Effective Time and prior to the date
of surrender but with a payment date subsequent to such surrender. For
purposes of distributions in respect of Parent Common Units, all Parent Common
Units to be issued pursuant to the Merger shall be entitled to distributions
pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence as if issued and outstanding as
of the Effective Time.

 



 

(i) _No Further Rights in Partnership Public Units_. All Merger Consideration
issued upon the surrender of Common Unit Certificates (or effective affidavit
of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Units in accordance with the terms of
this _Section 2.3_ shall be deemed to have been issued (and paid) in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to Partnership Public Units represented
thereby, subject, however, to Parents obligation, with respect to Partnership
Public Units outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, to pay any
distributions with a record date prior to the Effective Time that were
declared on or prior to the Effective Time by the Partnership in respect of
such Partnership Public Units in accordance with the terms of this Agreement
and that remain unpaid at the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Partnership shall deposit with the Transfer Agent the aggregate amount of all
declared but unpaid

 



     

 

 



 

distributions payable in respect of Partnership Public Units that have a
record date prior to the Effective Time but that have a payment date after the
Effective Time, and Parent shall cause the Transfer Agent to pay such
distributions to the Partnership Public Unitholder on the payment date of such
distributions.

 



 

(j) _No Fractional Units_. No certificates or scrip representing fractional
Parent Common Units shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Common
Unit Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-
Entry Common Units. Anything to the contrary in this _Article II_
notwithstanding, all fractional Parent Common Units that a Holder of
Partnership Public Units converted pursuant to the Merger would otherwise be
entitled to receive as Merger Consideration in the Merger (after taking into
account all Common Unit Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof) or Book-Entry Common Units held by such Holder) will be aggregated
and then, if a fractional Parent Common Unit results from that aggregation, be
rounded up to the nearest whole Parent Common Unit.

 



 

(k) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Common Unit Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen, or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the Person claiming such Common Unit Certificate to be lost,
stolen, or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of
a bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against
any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Common Unit
Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen,
or destroyed certificate the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the
Partnership Public Unit(s) represented by such Common Unit Certificate as
contemplated by this _Article II_ and pay any distributions pursuant to
_Section 2.3(h)_.

 



 

(l) _Withholding Taxes_. Parent, the Partnership and the Exchange Agent shall
be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to
any Person pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as are required to be
deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), and the Treasury
Regulations promulgated thereunder, or under any provision of applicable
state, local, or non-U.S. Tax Law (and to the extent deduction and withholding
is required, such deduction and withholding may be taken in Parent Common
Units). To the extent amounts are so withheld and timely paid over to the
appropriate Tax authority, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of
whom such withholding was made. If withholding is taken in Parent Common
Units, Parent or the Exchange Agent shall be treated as having sold such
Parent Common Units for an amount of cash equal to the fair market value of
such Parent Common Units at the time of such deemed sale and paid such cash
proceeds to the appropriate Tax authority.

(a) The Partnership has furnished or filed all reports, schedules, forms,
statements, certifications, and other documents (including exhibits,
amendments, and supplements thereto) required to be furnished or filed by it
with the SEC since December 31, 2017 (such reports, schedules, forms,
statements, certifications and other documents filed since December 31, 2017
and prior to the Execution Date, the " _Partnership SEC Documents_ "). As of
their respective dates, or, if amended, as of the date of the last such
amendment, each of the Partnership SEC Documents complied as to form in all
material respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act, the
Exchange Act, and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as the case may be, each as in
effect on the date so filed. As of their respective filing dates (or, if
amended or superseded by a subsequent filing prior to the date of this
Agreement, as of the date of such amendment or superseding filing), none of
the Partnership SEC Documents contained any untrue statement of a material
fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no
outstanding or unresolved comments received from the SEC staff with respect to
the Partnership SEC Documents.

 



 

(b) The audited and unaudited consolidated financial statements (including any

Partnership Group Entities at the respective dates thereof and the results of
their operations and cash flows for the periods indicated.

 



 

(c) The Partnership maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
in Rule 13a-15 and Rule 15d-15 under the Exchange Act) designed to ensure that
material information relating to the Partnership, including its consolidated
Subsidiaries, is made known to the principal executive officer and the
principal financial officer of the Partnership by others within those
entities; and such disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure
that information required to be disclosed by the Partnership in the reports
that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules
and forms. The Partnership maintains internal control over financial reporting
(as defined in Rule 13a-15 and Rule 15d-15 under the Exchange Act) sufficient
to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with GAAP. The Partnerships principal executive officer and
principal financial officer have disclosed, based on their most recent
evaluation, to the Partnerships auditors and the audit committee of the
General Partner Board (x) all significant deficiencies in the designation or
operation of internal controls which could adversely affect the Partnerships
ability to record, process, summarize and report financial data and have

controls.

circumstances that would reasonably be expected to result in any such
liabilities or obligations, whether arising in the context of federal, state
or local judicial, regulatory, administrative, or permitting agency

liabilities and/or obligations (or such facts and circumstances) (i)
incidental to the existence and status of any such Partnership Group Entity as
a corporation, limited partnership, or limited liability company, as
applicable, under the applicable Laws of its state of organization, such as
annual fees owed to such state and fees owed to any registered agent, or (ii)
which, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to
have a Partnership Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

 **Section 3.9** _Absence of Certain Changes_. Except as expressly
contemplated by this Agreement, since December 31, 2017 (a) through the
Execution Date, the Partnership Group Entities have operated their respective
businesses only in the ordinary course of business in all material respects
and consistent with past practice (except as contemplated by this Agreement)
and (b) there has been no Partnership Material Adverse Effect.

and personal property described in the Partnership SEC Documents, as owned,
leased, or used and occupied by such Partnership Group Entity, free and

 



     

 

 



 

clear of all Liens, except (a) as would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Partnership Material Adverse Effect or (b)
Permitted Liens. At and immediately following the Closing, the assets owned or

Partnership Group Entities; and (e) to the Knowledge of the Partnership, no
third party is infringing on the Intellectual Property owned by the
Partnership Group Entities.

 



 

 **Section 3.12** _Environmental Matters_. Except for matters that would not
reasonably be expected to have a Partnership Material Adverse Effect: (a) each
of the Partnership Group Entities is and, during the relevant time periods
specified in all applicable statutes of limitations, has been, in compliance

has been no Release of Hazardous Substances on, at, under, to, or from any of
the properties owned by the Partnership Group Entities, from or in connection
with the Partnership Group Entities operations or for which any of the

a manner that would reasonably be expected to give rise to any uninsured
liability pursuant to any Environmental Law.

prior to the Execution Date, none of the Partnership Group Entities is a party

applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent

 



     

 

 



 

conveyance, or other similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors

is a party will continue to be legal, valid, and binding on and enforceable

since December 31, 2017 (such reports, schedules, forms, statements,
certifications and other documents filed since December 31, 2017 and prior to
the Execution Date, the " _Parent SEC Documents_ "). As of their respective
dates, or,

 



     

 

 



 

if amended, as of the date of the last such amendment, each of the Parent SEC
Documents complied as to form in all material respects with the applicable
requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, and the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act, as the case may be, each as in effect on the date so filed. As of their
respective filing dates (or, if amended or superseded by a subsequent filing
prior to the date of this Agreement, as of the date of such amendment or
superseding filing), none of the Parent SEC Documents contained any untrue
statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under

material information relating to Parent, including its consolidated

principal financial officer of Parent by others within those entities; and
such disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that
information required to be disclosed by Parent in the reports that it files or
submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and
reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms.
Parent maintains internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule
13a-15 and Rule 15d-15 under the Exchange Act) sufficient to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
GAAP. Parents principal executive officer and principal financial officer
have disclosed, based on their most recent evaluation, to Parents auditors
and the audit committee of the Parent Board (x) all significant deficiencies
in the designation or operation of internal controls which could adversely
affect Parents ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
data and have identified for Parents auditors any material weakness in
internal controls and (y) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves
management or other employees who have a significant role in Parents internal
controls.

such facts and circumstances) (i) incidental to the existence and status of

information concerning the Partnership Group Entities or the Parent Group

untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading, and (ii) none of the information supplied or to be supplied by it
for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the joint Proxy/Information
Statement constituting a part of the Registration Statement, and any amendment

of Parent Common Units, and at the time of the Partnership Unitholder Meeting,

fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Each of the Parties
further agrees that, if it shall become aware prior to the Closing Date of any
information that would cause any of the statements in the Registration
Statement, including the joint Proxy/Information Statement constituting a part
thereof, to be false or misleading with respect to any material fact, or omit
to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not false or
misleading, it will promptly inform the

Replacement Awards from and after the Effective Time; and (ii) such number of
Parent Common Units equal to the number of Rollover Units that may be
available for awards under the Parent Long-Term Incentive Plan from and after
the Effective Time. Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to file with
the SEC one or more registration statements on Form S-8 or one or more post-
effective amendments to any Form S-8 that Parent has filed with the SEC (or

cause their respective Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be
terminated any discussions or negotiations with any Person conducted
heretofore with respect to an Acquisition Proposal and immediately prohibit
any access by any Person (other than the Parent Group Entities and their
respective Representatives) to any confidential information relating to an
Acquisition Proposal. The General Partner shall

 



     

 

 



 

not, and shall cause the Partnership and its Subsidiaries not to, and shall
use its reasonable best efforts to, and cause the Partnership and its
Subsidiaries to use their reasonable best efforts to, cause their respective
Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (A) initiate, solicit, or
knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate, the submission of any Acquisition
Proposal or any inquiries or proposals that could reasonably be expected to
lead to an Acquisition Proposal, (B) participate in any discussions or
negotiations regarding, or furnish to any Person any non-public information
regarding, the Partnership in connection with any Acquisition Proposal, (C)
approve, endorse, recommend, or enter into any confidentiality agreement,
letter of intent, option agreement, agreement in principle, or other agreement
or contract, whether written or oral, with any Person (other than a Parent
Group Entity) concerning an Acquisition Proposal (except in compliance with
_Section 5.5(a)(ii)_), (D) terminate, amend, release, modify, or fail to
enforce any provision of, or grant any permission, waiver, or request under,
any standstill, confidentiality, or similar contract entered into in
compliance with _Section 5.5(a)(ii)_ by the General Partner or one or more
Partnership Group Entities in respect of or in contemplation of an Acquisition
Proposal, (E) take any action to make the provisions of any Takeover Laws
inapplicable to any transactions contemplated by any Acquisition Proposal, or
(F) resolve or publicly propose or announce to do any of the foregoing;
_provided_ , _however_ , that to the extent any such action or failure to act
was taken or committed solely (x) by Parent or its Affiliates or its
Representatives acting solely on behalf of, or solely at the direction of,
Parent, or (y) by the General Partner or the Partnership at the direction of
Parent or its Affiliates or its Representatives acting solely on behalf of, or
solely at the direction of, Parent, such action or failure to act shall not
constitute a violation or breach of this _Section 5.5(a)_ by the Partnership
or the General Partner.

 



 

(ii) If the General Partner, any Partnership Group Entity, or any of their
respective Representatives receives a Bona Fide Acquisition Proposal, the
General Partner shall, or shall cause such Person, as applicable, to, promptly
deliver such Bona Fide Acquisition Proposal to the General Partner Board and
the Partnership Conflicts Committee. Anything to the contrary in _Section
5.5(a)(i)_ notwithstanding, prior to obtaining Partnership Unitholder
Approval, the General Partner, for and on behalf of the Partnership, may
furnish any information to and enter into or participate in discussions or
negotiations with, any Person that makes a Bona Fide Acquisition Proposal
(such Person making such a proposal, a " _Receiving Party_ "), if (A) the
General Partner Board and the Partnership Conflicts Committee, after
consultation with their respective outside legal counsel(s) and financial
advisors, determine in good faith (1) that such Acquisition Proposal
constitutes or is reasonably likely to result in a Superior Proposal and (2)
that failure to permit the General Partner to furnish information to, or enter
into or participate in discussions or negotiations with, such Receiving Party
would be inconsistent with their respective duties to the holders of
Partnership Units under applicable Law, as modified by the Partnership
Agreement, (B) prior to the General Partner furnishing any non-public
information or data pertaining to the Partnership or any of its Subsidiaries
(the " _Non-Public Information_ ") to such Receiving Party, (1) the
Partnership receives from such Receiving Party an executed Confidentiality
Agreement, (2) the Partnership furnishes a copy of such executed
Confidentiality Agreement to Parent, and (3) the Partnership notifies Parent
of the identity of such Receiving Party, and (C) such Bona Fide Acquisition
Proposal was not the result of a breach of _Section 5.5(a)(i)_.

 



 

(iii) The Partnership agrees that any breach of the restrictions or
obligations set forth in this _Section 5.5(a)_ by the General Partner Board
or the Partnership

 



     

 

 



 

Conflicts Committee or, to the extent directed by the General Partner Board or
the Partnership Conflicts Committee, as applicable, any of their respective
Representatives, shall constitute a breach of this _Section 5.5(a)_ by the
Partnership, unless such Representative is also a Representative of Parent and
is acting solely on behalf of, or at the direction of, Parent.

 



 

(iv) The General Partner, for and on behalf of the Partnership, shall, as
promptly as practicable (and in any event within 24 hours of receipt) advise
Parent orally and in writing if any proposal, offer, inquiry, or other contact
is received by, any information is requested from, or any discussions or
negotiations are sought to be initiated or continued with, the Partnership in
respect of any Acquisition Proposal, and shall, in any such notice to Parent,
indicate the identity of the Person making such proposal, offer, inquiry, or
other contact and the terms and conditions of any proposals or offers or the
nature of any inquiries or contacts (and shall include with such notice copies
of any written materials received from or on behalf of such Person relating to
such proposal, offer, inquiry, or request). The Partnership shall thereafter
keep Parent informed on a reasonably current basis of all material
developments affecting the status and terms of any such proposals, offers,
inquiries, or requests (and the Partnership shall promptly provide Parent with
copies of any additional material written materials received by the
Partnership or that the Partnership has delivered to any third party making an
Acquisition Proposal that relate to such proposals, offers, inquiries, or
requests) and of the status of any such discussions or negotiations.

 



 

(b) _Recommendation Change_. Anything to the contrary in this Agreement
notwithstanding, at any time prior to obtaining the Partnership Unitholder
Approval, either or both of the General Partner Board (upon the recommendation
of the Partnership Conflicts Committee) or the Partnership Conflicts Committee
may make a Recommendation Change if, after consultation with its or their
respective outside legal counsel(s) and financial advisor(s), the General
Partner Board (upon the recommendation of the Partnership Conflicts Committee)
and/or the Partnership Conflicts Committee (as the case may be) determines in
good faith that the failure to make a Recommendation Change would be
inconsistent with their respective duties to the holders of Partnership Units
under applicable Law, as modified by the Partnership Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (x) no such Recommendation Change shall be made
other than in response to (1) a Superior Proposal that did not result from a
breach of this _Section 5.5_ or (2) an Intervening Event and (y) neither the
General Partner Board nor the Partnership Conflicts Committee, as the case may
be, shall be entitled to exercise its right to make a Recommendation Change
pursuant to this _Section 5.5(b)_ unless:

 



 

(i) the General Partner Board or the Partnership Conflicts Committee (as the
case may be) has provided prior written notice to Parent specifying in
reasonable detail the reasons for making a Recommendation Change (including,
in the case of a Superior Proposal, the material terms of such Superior
Proposal, the identity of the Person making such Superior Proposal, and
complete copies of any written proposal or offer (including proposed
agreements), and in the case of an Intervening Event, a reasonably detailed
description of such Intervening Event) at least four days in advance of its
intention to take action with respect to a Recommendation Change, unless at
the time such notice is required to be given there are less than four days
prior to the Partnership Unitholder Meeting, in which case, the General
Partner Board or the Partnership Conflicts Committee (as the case may be)
shall provide as much notice

 



     

 

 



 

as is reasonably practicable (the period inclusive of all such days, the "
_Partnership Notice Period_ "); and

 



 

(ii) during the Partnership Notice Period, the General Partner Board and/or
the Partnership Conflicts Committee (as the case may be) has (A) negotiated
with Parent and the Parent Conflicts Committee in good faith (to the extent
Parent and the Parent Conflicts Committee desire to negotiate) to make such
adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that the failure
to effect such Recommendation Change would not be inconsistent with the
respective duties of the General Partner Board and the Partnership Conflicts
Committee to holders of Partnership Unaffiliated Units under applicable Law,
as modified by the Partnership Agreement, and (B) kept Parent and the Parent
Conflicts Committee reasonably informed with respect to, (1) if such
Recommendation Change is made in response to a Superior Proposal, the status
and changes in the material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal (it
being understood that any change in the purchase price in such Superior
Proposal shall be deemed a material amendment), and (2) if such Recommendation
Change is made in response to an Intervening Event, any changes in
circumstances related to such Intervening Event ; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that any material amendment to the terms of a Superior Proposal, if
applicable, shall require a new notice pursuant to this _Section 5.5_ and a
new Partnership Notice Period, except that such new Partnership Notice Period
in connection with any material amendment shall be for two days from the time
Parent receives such notice (as opposed to four days).

 



 

(c) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Partnership, the
General Partner, the General Partner Board, or the Partnership Conflicts
Committee from issuing a "stop, look and listen" communication pursuant to
Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act or complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule
14e-2 under the Exchange Act with respect to an Acquisition Proposal if the
General Partner Board or the Partnership Conflicts Committee determines in
good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel(s)) that its
failure to do so would be reasonably likely to constitute a violation of
applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that the General Partner
Recommendation is expressly reaffirmed in any such communication unless a
Recommendation Change has occurred in accordance with _Section 5.5(b)_.

 



 

 **Section 5.6** _Reasonable Best Efforts; Further Assurances. _From and
after the Execution Date, but subject to _Article VII_, upon the terms and
subject to the conditions hereof, each of the Parties shall use its reasonable
best efforts to (a) take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate action, and to
do or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under
applicable Laws to consummate and make effective the Transactions as promptly
as practicable and (b) defend any Proceedings, whether judicial or
administrative, challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the
Transactions or seek to have lifted or rescinded any injunction or restraining
order or other order adversely affecting the ability of the Parties to
consummate the Transactions. Without limiting the foregoing but subject to the
other terms of this Agreement, the Parties agree that, from time to time,
whether before, at, or after the Closing Date, each of them will execute and
deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, such instruments of
assignment, transfer, conveyance, endorsement, direction, or authorization as
may be necessary to consummate and make effective the Transactions.

Units on

 



     

 

 



 

the Business Day following the Execution Date, the Partnership and Parent
shall issue a joint press release with respect to the execution of this
Agreement and the Transactions, which press release shall be reasonably
satisfactory to the Partnership and Parent. Except in connection with a
Recommendation Change, if any, no Party shall issue any other press release or
make any other public announcement concerning this Agreement or the
Transactions (to the extent not previously issued or made in accordance with
this Agreement) (other than as may be required by applicable Law or pursuant
to the rules of the NYSE, in which event the Party making the public
announcement or press release shall, to the extent practicable, notify the
other Parties in advance of such public announcement or press release) without
the prior approval of Parent, if such Party is a Partnership Party, or the
Partnership, if such Party is a Parent Party, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.

 



 

 **Section 5.8** _Expenses_ _. _Except as otherwise provided in _Section
2.3(a)_, whether or not the Transactions are consummated, all costs and
expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement, including legal fees,
accounting fees, financial advisory fees and other professional and non-

costs of printing and mailing of the joint Proxy/Information Statement, and
Parent shall pay for any filing fees and other costs and expenses relating to

 **Section 5.9** _Regulatory Issues._

 



 

(a) The Parties shall cooperate fully with respect to any filing, submission
or communication with a Governmental Authority having jurisdiction over the
Transactions. Such cooperation shall include each of the Parties: (i)
providing, in the case of oral communications with a Governmental Authority,
advance notice of any such communication and, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, an opportunity for each other Party to participate; (ii)
providing, in the case of written communications, an opportunity for each
other Party to comment on any such communication and provide the other with a
final copy of all such communications; and (iii) complying promptly with any
request for information from a Governmental Authority (including an additional
request for information and documentary material), unless directed not to do
so by any other Party. All cooperation shall be conducted in such a manner so
as to preserve all applicable privileges.

 



 

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, the Parties shall
cooperate fully to (i) make an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report
Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the Transactions as promptly as
practicable, and in any event within ten Business Days after the Execution
Date (unless a later date is mutually agreed to by the Parties) and (ii)
supply as promptly as practicable any additional information and documentary
material that may be requested by any Governmental Authority pursuant to the
HSR Act and use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
other actions consistent with this _Section 5.9(b)_ necessary to cause the
expiration or termination of any applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act
as promptly as practicable (and in any event no later than the Termination
Date).

 



     

 

 



 

 **Section 5.10** _Tax Matters_. For U.S. federal income tax purposes (and
for purposes of any applicable state, local, or foreign Tax that follows the
U.S. federal income tax treatment), the Parties agree to treat the Merger (a)
with respect to Holders of Partnership Public Units, as a taxable sale of such
Partnership Public Units to Parent and (b) with respect to Parent, as a
purchase by Parent of such Partnership Public Units from the Holders thereof.
The Parties will prepare and file all Tax Returns consistent with the
foregoing and will not take any inconsistent position on any Tax Return, or
during the course of any Proceeding with respect to Taxes, except as otherwise
required by applicable Law following a final determination by a court of
competent jurisdiction or other administrative settlement with or final
administrative decision by the relevant Governmental Authority.

 



 

 **Section 5.11** _Listing of Parent Common Units_. Parent shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the Parent Common Units to be issued as
Merger Consideration pursuant to this Agreement to be approved for listing on
the NYSE (subject, if applicable, to notice of issuance) prior to the
Effective Time.

 



 

 **Section 5.12** _Termination of Trading and Deregistration of Partnership
Common Units_. The Partnership shall cooperate with Parent, and shall use
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do,
or cause to be done, all things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable

Partnership Common Units on the NYSE and the termination of trading of the
Partnership Common Units on the Closing Date and prior to the Effective Time
and (b) the deregistration of the Partnership Common Units under the Exchange
Act as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time.

 



 

 **Section 5.13** _Distributions_. After the date of this Agreement and until
the Effective Time, the General Partner shall (and the Parent shall, directly
or indirectly, cause its Representatives on the General Partner Board to)
determine, declare, and cause the Partnership to pay regular quarterly cash
distributions on the Partnership Common Units for each quarter in accordance
with the Partnership Agreement and in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice, including with respect to the timing of record
dates and payment dates; _provided_ , _however_ , that, subject to applicable
Law, any such regular quarterly distribution shall not be less than $0.39 per
Partnership Common Unit without the separate determination and approval of the
Partnership Conflicts Committee. The General Partner shall (and the Parent
shall, directly or indirectly, cause its Representatives on the General
Partner Board to) designate the record date for the quarterly cash
distribution related to the quarter immediately prior to the quarter in which
the Closing occurs so that such record date precedes the Effective Time so as
to permit the payment of such quarterly distribution to the Holders of the
Partnership Common Units. From the Execution Date until the Effective Time,
subject to the foregoing, each of Parent and the Partnership shall coordinate
with the other regarding the declaration of any distributions in respect of
Parent Common Units and Partnership Common Units, and the record dates and
payment dates relating thereto. It is the intention of the Parties that
Holders of Partnership Public Units shall not receive, for any quarter,
distributions in respect of both Partnership Public Units and Parent Common
Units that they receive upon conversion thereof in the Merger, but that
instead they shall receive, for any such quarter, either: (a) only
distributions in respect of Partnership Public Units or (b) only distributions
in respect of Parent Common Units that they receive upon conversion thereof in
the Merger.

derivative securities with respect to such Parent Common Units) resulting from
the Transactions by each individual who is subject to the reporting
requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the
Partnership, or will become subject to such reporting requirements with
respect to Parent, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the
Exchange Act.

Partner Board that is a member of the Partnership Conflicts Committee either

LLC Agreement) of any vacancies caused by the death, incapacity, or
resignation of any director.

any director of the Parent Board that is a member of the Parent Conflicts
Committee either as a member of such board or such committee. For the
avoidance of doubt, this _Section 5.15(b)_ shall not apply to the filling (in

and/or the Organizational Documents of Parent Managing Member) of any
vacancies caused by the death, incapacity, or resignation of any director.

would cause the Transactions to be subject to requirements imposed by any
Takeover Laws, and each Party shall take all necessary steps within its
control to exempt (or ensure the continued exemption of) the Transactions
from, or if necessary challenge the validity or applicability of, any rights
plan adopted by such Party or any applicable Takeover Law, as now or hereafter
in effect, including, without limitation, Takeover Laws of any state that
purport to apply to this Agreement or the Transactions.

other reasonable costs, expenses, and obligations (including experts fees,
travel expenses, court costs, retainers, transcript fees, duplicating,

interest, assessments, and other charges paid or payable in connection
therewith or in respect of any thereof) in connection with any actual or
threatened Proceeding arising from acts or omissions occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time (including the Transactions), and (B) upon receipt by
Parent of an undertaking by or on behalf of such Partnership Indemnified Party
to repay such amount if it shall be determined in a final and non-appealable
judgment entered by a court of competent jurisdiction that the Partnership
Indemnified Party is not entitled to be indemnified, provide advancement of
expenses with respect to each of the foregoing to, all Partnership Indemnified
Parties; and

 



 

(ii) honor all rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses, elimination
of liability, and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring
at or prior to the Effective Time (including the Transactions) now existing in
favor of the Partnership Indemnified Parties as provided in the Organizational
Documents of any Partnership Group Entity, under applicable Law, or otherwise,
and shall ensure that the Organizational Documents of the Partnership and the
General Partner (or their successor entities) shall, for a period of six years
following the Effective Time, contain provisions substantially no less
advantageous with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses,
elimination of liability, and exculpation of their present and former
directors than are set forth in the Organizational Documents of the
Partnership and the General Partner as of the Execution Date.

 



 

Any right of a Partnership Indemnified Party pursuant to this _Section
5.17(a)_ shall not be amended, repealed, terminated, or otherwise modified at
any time in a manner that would adversely affect the rights of such
Partnership Indemnified Party as provided herein, and shall be enforceable by
such Partnership Indemnified Party and their respective heirs and
representatives against Parent and its respective successors and assigns.

 



 

(b) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, Parent or the
Surviving Entity shall maintain officers and directors liability insurance
with a nationally reputable carrier covering each Partnership Indemnified
Party who is or at any time prior to the Effective Time was covered by the
existing officers and directors liability insurance applicable to the
Partnership Group Entities (" _D andO Insurance_"), on terms substantially no
less advantageous to the Partnership Indemnified Parties, as applicable, than
such existing insurance with respect to acts or omissions, or alleged acts or
omissions, at or prior to the Effective Time (whether claims, actions or other
Proceedings relating thereto are commenced, asserted, or claimed before or
after the Effective Time); _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent or the
Surviving Entity, as applicable, shall not be required to pay an annual
premium for the DandO Insurance for the Partnership Indemnified Parties in
excess of 300% of the current annual premium currently paid by the Partnership
Group Entities for such insurance, but shall purchase as much of such coverage
as possible for such applicable amount. Parent or the Surviving Entity shall
have the right to cause

 



     

 

 



 

such coverage to be extended under the applicable DandO Insurance by obtaining a
six-year "tail" policy on terms and conditions no less advantageous to the
Partnership Indemnified Parties than the existing DandO Insurance, and such
"tail" policy shall satisfy the provisions of this _Section 5.17_.

 



 

(c) The provisions of this _Section 5.17_ shall survive the consummation of
the Merger and the other Transactions for a period of six years and expressly
are intended to benefit each of the Partnership Indemnified Parties;
_provided_ , _however_ , that in the event that any claim or claims for
indemnification or advancement set forth in this _Section 5.17_ are asserted
or made within such six-year period, all rights to indemnification and
advancement in respect of any such claim or claims shall continue until
disposition of all such claims. The rights of any Partnership Indemnified
Party under this _Section 5.17_ shall be in addition to any other rights such
Partnership Indemnified Party may have under the Organizational Documents of
any Partnership Group Entity or applicable Law.

 



 

(d) In the event Parent or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates
with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or
surviving entity in such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then and in
either such case, Parent shall cause proper provision to be made so that its
successors and assigns, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set
forth in this _Section 5.17_.

 



 

 **Section 5.18** _Securityholder Litigation_. Each of Parent and the
Partnership shall give the other the opportunity to participate in the defense
or settlement of any securityholder litigation against any such Party and/or
its officers and directors relating to this Agreement or the Transactions;
_provided_ that the Party subject to the litigation shall in any event control
such defense and/or settlement (subject to _Section 5.1(b)(vii)_) and shall
not be required to provide information if doing so would reasonably be
expected to threaten the loss of any attorney-client privilege or other
applicable legal privilege.

to the satisfaction on or prior to the Closing Date of all of the following
conditions, any one or more of which may be waived in writing, in whole or in
part, by the Partnership Parties (in their sole discretion):

expressly made as of an earlier date, in which case, as of such date); (B) the
representations and warranties of the Parent Parties contained in _Section
4.5(a)_ shall be true and correct in all respects, other than immaterial

true and correct both when made and at and as of the Closing Date, as if made
at and as of such time (except to the extent expressly made as of an earlier

(C),_ where the failure of such representations and warranties to be so true
and correct (without giving effect to any limitation as to "materiality" or
"Parent Material Adverse Effect" set forth in any individual such
representation or warranty) does not have, and would not, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect.

material respects with all agreements and covenants required to be performed
by it hereunder on or prior to the Closing Date.

Time.

 



 

 **Section 6.4** _Frustration of Conditions. _None of Parties may rely on the
failure of any condition set forth in this _Article VI_ to be satisfied if

 **ARTICLE VII** ** 
TERMINATION**

 



 

 **Section 7.1** _Termination by Mutual Consent. _This Agreement may be

(and is then pursuing) an action seeking specific performance as permitted by
_Section 8.4_.

agreements set forth in this Agreement (or if any of their respective
representations or warranties set forth in this Agreement shall have failed to

time) and (ii) is incapable of being cured, or is not cured by the breaching
Party within 30 days following the receipt of written notice from any other

(b) _Breach_. Any of the Partnership Parties shall have breached or failed to
perform any of their respective representations, warranties, covenants, or
agreements set forth in this Agreement (or if any of their respective
representations or warranties set forth in this Agreement shall have failed to

as of the Closing Date) give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in
_Section 6.2(a)(i)_ or _Section 6.2(a)(ii)_ (with or without the passage of
time) and (ii) is incapable of being cured, or is not cured, by the breaching
Party within 30 days following the receipt of written notice from any other

VIII_, which shall survive such termination; _provided_ , _however_ , that
nothing herein shall relieve any Party from any liability for any intentional
or willful and material breach by such Party of any of its representations,
warranties, covenants, or agreements set forth in this Agreement and all
rights and remedies of a non-breaching Party under this Agreement in the case
of such intentional or willful and material breach, at law or in equity, shall
be preserved.

 



 

 **Section 7.6** _Termination Fees and Expenses. _Anything to the contrary in
this Agreement notwithstanding:

 



 

(a) _Termination Fees_. The Partnership shall pay to Parent an amount equal to
the Partnership Termination Fee in accordance with _Section 7.6(c)_ if: (i)
this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section 7.4(a)_ (
_Recommendation Change_ ); or (ii) this Agreement is terminated by the
Partnership pursuant to _Section 7.3(b)_ ( _Superior Proposal_ ).

 



 

(b) _Expense Reimbursement_.

 



 

(i) The Partnership shall reimburse to Parent an amount equal to the Parent
Reimbursement Amount if this Agreement is terminated (A) by Parent pursuant to
_Section 7.4(b)_ ( _Breach_ ) or (B) by Parent or the Partnership pursuant to
_Section 7.2(c)_ ( _No Partnership Unitholder Approval_ ) when prior to the
Partnership Unitholder Meeting a Recommendation Change occurred.

 



 

(ii) Parent shall reimburse to the Partnership an amount equal to the
Partnership Reimbursement Amount if this Agreement is terminated by the
Partnership pursuant to _Section 7.3(a)_ ( _Breach_ ).

 



 

(c) _Payment of Reimbursement_. Any payment or reimbursement required to be
made pursuant to this _Section 7.6_ shall be made by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated by the Party to be paid
or reimbursed within three Business Days after the occurrence of the event

(d) _Liquidated Damages_. The Parties acknowledge that the agreements
contained in this _Section 7.6_ are an integral part of the Transactions, and
that, without these agreements, none of the Parties would enter into this
Agreement. The Parties acknowledge that the payment of the Partnership
Termination Fee, the Parent Reimbursement Amount, or the Partnership
Reimbursement Amount by a Party, if, as, and when required pursuant to this
_Section 7.6_, shall not constitute a penalty but shall be liquidated
damages, in a reasonable

 



     

 

 



 

amount that will compensate the Party receiving such payment and its
Affiliates party hereto (collectively, the " _Payee_ ") in the circumstances
in which it is payable for the efforts and resources expended and the
opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on
this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the Transactions,
which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision.
Subject to _Section 8.4_, the Parties agree that the payment of the
Partnership Termination Fee, the Parent Reimbursement Amount, or the
Partnership Reimbursement Amount, as applicable, by a Party shall constitute
the sole and exclusive remedy of the Payee in respect of this Agreement and
the Transactions, and the Party making such payment and its Affiliates party
hereto shall have no further liability to the Payee of any kind in respect of
this Agreement and the Transactions. The Parties further agree that (i) in no
event shall the Partnership be required to pay the Partnership Termination Fee
on more than one occasion and (ii) the amount of the Partnership Termination
Fee payable by the Partnership pursuant to this _Section 7.6_ shall be
reduced by the amount of the Parent Reimbursement Amount, if any, previously
paid to the Parent.

 



 

(e) For the avoidance of doubt, this _Section 7.6_ shall survive any
termination of this Agreement.

 



 

 **Section 7.7** _Survival. _None of the representations, warranties,
agreements, covenants, or obligations in this Agreement or in any instrument
delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall survive the consummation of the
Merger, except as expressly provided in this Agreement and except for those
covenants and agreements contained herein that by their terms apply or are to
be performed in whole or in part after the Effective Time.

 **Section 8.3** _Governing Law; Venue; No Jury Trial_.

 



 

(a) This Agreement, and Proceedings of any kind (whether at law, in equity, in
contract, in tort, or otherwise) that may be based upon, arise out of, or
relate to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution, or performance of
this Agreement (including any action, cause of action, or claim of any kind
based upon, arising out of, or related to any representation or warranty made
in, in connection with, or as an inducement to this Agreement) shall be
governed by and construed in accordance with the Laws of the State of
Delaware, including Laws of the State of Delaware relating to applicable
statutes of limitation, burdens of proof, and available remedies.

 



 

(b) Each of the Parties irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of
the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, or in the event, but only in
the event, that such court does not have jurisdiction over such Proceeding, to
the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the
District of Delaware (or, in the event that such court does not have
jurisdiction over such Proceeding, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
Superior Court of the State of Delaware) (collectively, the " ** _Courts_**
"), for the purposes of any Proceeding arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or the Transactions (and agrees not to commence any Proceeding
relating hereto except in such Courts as provided herein). Each of the Parties
further agrees that service of any process, summons, notice, or document hand
delivered or sent in accordance with _Section 8.2_ to such Partys address
set forth in _Section 8.2_ will be effective service of process for any
Proceeding in Delaware with respect to any matters to which it has submitted
to jurisdiction as set forth in the immediately preceding sentence. Each of
the Parties irrevocably and unconditionally waives any objection to the laying
of venue of any Proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the
other Transaction Agreements or the Transactions or the transactions
contemplated by the other Transaction Agreements in the Courts, and hereby
further irrevocably and unconditionally waives and agrees not to plead or
claim in any such court that any such Proceeding brought in any such court has
been brought in an inconvenient forum. Anything to the contrary in this
_Section 8.3(b)_ notwithstanding, each Party agrees that a final judgment in
any Proceeding properly brought in accordance with the terms of this Agreement
shall be conclusive and may be enforced by suit on the judgment in any
jurisdiction or in any other manner provided at law or in equity.

 



 

(c) Each Party agrees that this Agreement involves at least $100,000 and that
this Agreement has been entered into in express reliance upon 6 _Del. C._ §
2708.

 



       
 

 



 

(d) WITH RESPECT TO ANY PROCEEDING IN WHICH ANY CLAIM OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER
AT LAW, IN EQUITY, IN CONTRACT, IN TORT, OR OTHERWISE) ASSERTED BASED UPON,
ARISING FROM, OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT, ANY OTHER TRANSACTION AGREEMENT,
OR THE COURSE OF DEALING OR RELATIONSHIP AMONG THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT,
INCLUDING THE NEGOTIATION, EXECUTION, AND PERFORMANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT, NO
PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY ASSIGNEE, SUCCESSOR, OR REPRESENTATIVE OF ANY
PARTY SHALL REQUEST A JURY TRIAL IN ANY SUCH PROCEEDING NOR SEEK TO
CONSOLIDATE ANY SUCH PROCEEDING WITH ANY OTHER ACTION IN WHICH A JURY TRIAL
CANNOT BE OR HAS NOT BEEN WAIVED. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT
(I) NO REPRESENTATIVE OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR
OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH PARTY WOULD NOT SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER IN
THE EVENT OF A PROCEEDING, (II) SUCH PARTY HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF
THIS WAIVER, (III) SUCH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (IV) SUCH
PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS,
THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 8.3_.

 



 

 **Section 8.4** _Specific Performance; Remedies_.

 



 

(a) The Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur and that the Parties
would not have any adequate remedy at law in the event that any of the
provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached and it is accordingly agreed that
the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement, in each case, in accordance with _Section 8.3_,
this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law
or in equity. Each of the Parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting
of an injunction, specific performance, and other equitable relief as provided
herein on the basis that (i) either Party has an adequate remedy at law or
(ii) an award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any
reason at law or equity (it being understood that nothing in this sentence
shall prohibit the Parties from raising other defenses to a claim for specific
performance or other equitable relief under this Agreement). Each Party
further agrees that no Party shall be required to obtain, furnish, or post any
bond or similar instrument in connection with, or as a condition to, obtaining
any remedy referred to in this _Section 8.4(a)_, and each Party irrevocably
waives any right it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting
of any such bond or similar instrument.

 



 

(b) Without limiting the rights of the Parties under _Section 7.6_, the
Parties agree that (i) no Party shall have any liability for monetary damages
for any breach of this Agreement, or any inaccuracy in any representation or
warranty made by such Party hereunder, except as provided in _Section 7.6_,
and (ii) (A) the enforcement of this Agreement in accordance with _Section
8.4(a)_ and (B) termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Article
VII_ and any receipt of any Partnership Termination Fee, Parent Reimbursement
Amount, or Partnership Reimbursement Amount in connection therewith pursuant
to _Section 7.6_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedies of the Parties for
a breach of this Agreement or any inaccuracy in any representation or warranty
made by a Party hereunder; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this

 



     

 

 



 

 _Section 8.4(b)_ shall relieve any Party from any liability or damages for
any failure to consummate the Transactions when required pursuant to this
Agreement, any Willful Breach by such Party, or any fraudulent act or omission
or willful misconduct of such Party. None of the provisions set forth in this
Agreement shall be deemed to be a waiver by or release of any Party of any
right or remedy that such Party may have at law or in equity based on any
other Partys failure to consummate the Transactions when required pursuant to
this Agreement, any Willful Breach by such other Party, or any fraudulent act
or omission or willful misconduct of such other Party, nor shall any such
provisions limit, or be deemed to limit, (1) the amounts of recovery sought or
awarded in any such claim for any such failure, Willful Breach, fraudulent
conduct, or willful misconduct, (2) the time period during which a claim for
any such failure, Willful Breach, fraudulent conduct, or willful misconduct
may be brought, or (3) the recourse that any such Party may seek against
another Party with respect to a claim for any such failure, Willful Breach,
fraudulent conduct, or willful misconduct. Anything to the contrary in this
Agreement notwithstanding, in no event shall a party be liable hereunder for
(x) any remote, exemplary or punitive damages or (y) any special,
consequential, incidental, or indirect damages or lost profits, except in the
case of clause (y), to the extent any such damages or lost profits would
otherwise be recoverable under applicable Law in an action for breach of
contract.

 



 

 **Section 8.5** _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement and the other Transaction
Agreements constitute the entire agreement among the Parties with respect to
the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersede all prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, among the Parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof and thereof.

 



 

 **Section 8.6** _Amendment; Supplement; Extension of Time; Waiver; Etc_.
Subject to compliance with applicable Law, prior to the Closing, any Party may
(a) waive compliance by any other Party with any of the agreements contained
herein, waive any of such Partys conditions, or waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties of such Party, (b) agree to amend, modify, or
supplement this Agreement at any time, which such amendment, modification, or
supplement must be by an agreement in writing among the Parties, (c) extend
the time for the performance of the obligations or acts of any other Party, or
(d) make or grant any consent under this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that, the Parent Board and the General Partner Board may not take or authorize
any such action unless it has first referred such action to the Parent
Conflicts Committee or Partnership Conflicts Committee, as applicable, for
their consideration, and permitted the Parent Conflicts Committee or
Partnership Conflicts Committee, as applicable, not less than two Business
Days to make a recommendation to the Parent Board or the General Partner
Board, as applicable, with respect thereto (for the avoidance of doubt, the
Parent Board and the General Partner Board shall in no way be obligated to
follow the recommendation of the Parent Conflicts Committee or Partnership
Conflicts Committee, as applicable, and the Parent Board and the General
Partner Board, as applicable, shall be permitted to take action following the
expiration of such two business day period); _provided, however_ , that in the
event the Parent Board or the General Partner Board, as applicable, takes or
authorizes any action under this _Section 8.6_ that is counter to any
recommendation by the Parent Conflicts Committee or the Partnership Conflicts
Committee, as applicable, then the Parent Conflicts Committee or the
Partnership Conflicts Committee, as applicable, may rescind its approval of
this Agreement, with such rescission resulting in the rescission of "Special
Approval" under Section 7.9(d) of the Parent Operating Agreement or Section
7.9(a) of the Partnership Agreement, as applicable; and _provided, further_ ,
that following the Partnership Unitholder

 



     

 

 



 

Approval, there shall be no amendment or change to the provisions of this
Agreement which by Law would require further approval by the Holders of
Partnership Common Units without such approval. Unless otherwise expressly set
forth in this Agreement, whenever a determination or decision of Parent or the
Parent Board or of the Partnership or the General Partner Board is required
pursuant to this Agreement, such determination or decision must be authorized
by the Parent Board or the General Partner Board, as applicable; _provided,
however_ , that the Parent Board and the General Partner Board may not take or
authorize any such action unless it has first referred such action to the
Parent Conflicts Committee or Partnership Conflicts Committee, as applicable,
for their consideration, and permitted the Parent Conflicts Committee or
Partnership Conflicts Committee, as applicable, not less than two Business
Days to make a recommendation to the Parent Board or the General Partner
Board, as applicable, with respect thereto (for the avoidance of doubt, the
Parent Board and the General Partner Board shall in no way be obligated to
follow the recommendation of the Parent Conflicts Committee or Partnership
Conflicts Committee, as applicable, and the Parent Board or the General
Partner Board, as applicable, shall be permitted to take action following the
expiration of such two business day period). The foregoing provisions of this
_Section 8.6_ notwithstanding, (i) no failure or delay by the Partnership,
the General Partner, Parent Managing Member, Parent, or Merger Sub in
exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall
any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise
thereof or the exercise of any other right hereunder and (ii) no waiver of any
provision of this Agreement shall be deemed or shall constitute a waiver of
any other provision hereof (regardless of whether similar), nor shall any such
waiver constitute a continuing waiver unless otherwise expressly provided. Any
agreement on the part of a Party to any extension, waiver, or consent
hereunder shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed
on behalf of such Party.

 



 

 **Section 8.7** _Binding Effect and Assignment_. This Agreement shall be
binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective
permitted successors and assigns, but neither this Agreement nor any of the
rights, benefits, or obligations hereunder shall be assigned or transferred,
by operation of law or otherwise. Nothing in this Agreement, express or
implied, is intended to confer upon any Person other than the Parties and
their respective permitted successors and assigns any rights, benefits, or
obligations hereunder, except for (a) the rights of the Holders of Partnership
Public Units to receive the Merger Consideration (as well as any distributions
pursuant to _Section 2.3(h)_) after the Closing and (b) the rights of third
parties under _Section 5.17_.

 



 

 **Section 8.8** _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this
Agreement is invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced by any rule of
applicable Law or public policy, all other conditions or provisions of this
Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the
economic or legal substance of the Transactions are not affected in any manner
materially adverse to any Party. Upon such determination that any term or
other provision is invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced, the
Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect
the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in a mutually
acceptable manner in order that the Transactions are consummated as originally
contemplated to the fullest extent possible.
