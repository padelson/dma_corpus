Entity is or will be a party and the consummation by such Entity of the
transactions contemplated thereby have been (or will be, prior to the
execution and delivery thereof) duly and validly authorized by all necessary

list, as of the date of this Agreement, of all Material Contracts. No Entity

materially infringed, misappropriated or otherwise conflicted with any
Intellectual Property of any other Person.

 



-23- 4.11. _Preferential Rights to Purchase_. Except as listed in _Schedule 4.11_ ,

as consultants or contractors are properly treated as independent contractors
under all applicable Laws. All employees of any Entity classified as
exempt under the Fair Labor Standards Act and state and local wage and hour
laws are properly classified. Except for Proceedings identified on _Schedule

Knowledge, threatened to be brought or filed, by or with any Governmental
Authority or arbitrator in connection with the employment of any current or
former applicant, employee, consultant, volunteer, intern or independent

(a) _Schedule_ __ _ 4.18_ sets forth a true and complete copy of (i) the
audited consolidated financial statements of HoldCo and its subsidiaries for

present, in all material respects, the financial position, results of
operation and cash flows of HoldCo as of the dates and for the periods
presented (except as may be noted therein).

(b) HoldCo and the Entities maintain a system of internal control over
financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the

4.21. _Investment Intent_. HoldCo is acquiring the Unit Consideration for its
own account, and not with a view to, or for sale in connection with, the
distribution thereof in violation of state or federal Law. HoldCo acknowledges
that the Unit Consideration has not been registered under the Securities Act
or the securities Laws of any state and that HoldCo has no obligation or
right to register the Unit Consideration except as set forth in the Limited
Partnership Agreement. Without such registration, the Unit Consideration may
not be sold, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise transferred unless it is
determined that such registration is not required. HoldCo, either itself or
through its managers, officers, employees or agents, has sufficient knowledge
and experience in financial and business matters to be capable of evaluating
the merits and risks of an investment such as an investment in the Units, and

by applicable Law. Not later than thirty (30) days prior to the due date for
filing any such Tax Return, MLP shall deliver a copy of such Tax Return,
together with all supporting documentation and workpapers, to HoldCo for its
review and approval (not to be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or

disagreements with respect to such Tax Return. If at the end of such five (5)

(b) The Parties intend that for U.S. federal income Tax purposes (i) the
Contributions are properly characterized as transactions described in Section
721(a) of the Code and (ii) each of the HoldCo Notes and any liability of an
Entity outstanding immediately prior to the Contributions shall be treated as
a "qualified liability" within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section
1.707-5(a)(6). Unless otherwise required by applicable Law, the Parties agree
to file all Tax Returns and otherwise act (and cause their Affiliates to act)
at all times in a manner consistent with such intended Tax treatment.

 

(c) For a period of four (4) years following the date of this Agreement, MLP
shall ensure (and shall cause its respective Affiliates to ensure) that the
aggregate principal amount of the HoldCo Notes and Existing MLP Debt (in each

refinances pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.707-5(c)) shall not be
less than $5,000,000,000.

(d) The Parties hereby agree that, for purposes of applying Section 704(c) of
the Code to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the remedial

for the difference between the fair market value and adjusted tax basis, as
of the Closing Date, of the assets treated as having been contributed to MLP
for U.S. federal income tax purposes (" _Built-in Gain_"). For purposes of
determining Built-in Gain pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 6.8_, the Parties shall
cooperate in good faith in the preparation of a schedule reflecting the
relative fair market value of the assets contributed to

Allocation Schedule to MLP for its review and reasonable comment. Within

shall submit any comments it may have to the draft Allocation Schedules to
HoldCo, and HoldCo shall consider such comments in good faith. Within fifteen
(15) days after receipt of such comments, HoldCo shall prepare, and submit to
MLP, the final Allocation Schedule. HoldCo and MLP shall, and shall cause
their Affiliates to, report consistently with the Allocation Schedule in all
Tax Returns, and neither HoldCo nor MLP shall take any position in any Tax
Return that is inconsistent with the Allocation Schedule, as adjusted, in each
case, unless required to do so by a final determination as defined in Section
1313 of the Code, and each of HoldCo and MLP agree to promptly advise each
other regarding the existence of any Tax audit, controversy or litigation
related to the Allocation Schedule.

Protected Asset during the Protected Asset Period, other than in connection
with a merger, business combination or transaction involving all or
substantially all of MLPs assets, (including any interest therein or in the
Person owning, directly or indirectly, the Protected Asset) in one or more
transactions that result in the recognition of taxable income or gain by
HoldCo or any of its Affiliates with respect to the Built-in Gain under
Section 704(c) of the Code (a " _Covered Transfer_ "), MLP shall pay HoldCo
an amount equal to the sum of (i) the Lost Deferral Amount and (ii) a Tax
gross up amount for the combined federal, state and local income Taxes
(calculated using the Tax Rate) resulting from the receipt of the Lost
Deferral Amount and the Tax gross up payment. Any payment by MLP to HoldCo
pursuant to this _Section 6.8(e)_ shall be made within 30 days after the
closing of the relevant Covered Transfer. Any property acquired by MLP or its
Affiliates in exchange for a Protected Asset in a transaction in which no
gain is required to be recognized by MLP or its Affiliates (including, but not
limited to, a transaction qualifying under Section 1031 or Section 721 of the
Code) (a " _Substitute Protected Asset_ ") shall remain subject to the

and unconditional release of HoldCo and the Retained Entities as promptly as
practicable after the Closing with respect to each Guaranty or Bond and (ii)
cause the beneficiary or beneficiaries of each such Guaranty or Bond to
terminate and redeliver such Guaranty or Bond to HoldCo or such Retained
Entity.

 



-34- (b) If any Guaranty or Bond is not released, terminated and returned as of the
Closing as contemplated in _Section_ _6.12(a)_ (each, an " _Outstanding
Guaranty or Bond_ "), then MLP shall (or shall cause its Affiliates to) from
and after the Closing:

complete and unconditional release of HoldCo and the Retained Entities with
respect to each Outstanding Guaranty or Bond and (ii) cause the beneficiary or

unconditional release of the obligations of HoldCo and the Retained Entities
obligations with respect to such Outstanding Guaranty or Bond.

contemplated in this  _Section_ __ _ 6.12_ within 365 days of the Closing
Date, MLP shall (or shall cause its Affiliates to) promptly upon HoldCos
request offer and deliver to the obligor of such Outstanding Guaranty or Bond
an unconditional, irrevocable standby letter of credit issued to such obligor

secure the obligations of HoldCo and the Retained Entities with respect to
such Outstanding Guaranty or Bond; (ii) have a stated amount equal to (A) the
stated amount of such Outstanding Guaranty or Bond, if the Outstanding
Guaranty or Bond is a surety or performance bond or letter of credit or (B)
the maximum liability under such Outstanding Guaranty or Bond, if the
Outstanding Guaranty or Bond is a guaranty or other security agreement or
arrangement; and (iii) contain terms and conditions that are reasonably
acceptable to such obligor.

until March 31, 2018, unless otherwise agreed by MLP, HoldCo agrees that

Worth of at least $100,000,000.

insurers of such Indemnified Party or its Affiliates under applicable
insurance policies so as to reduce the amount of any indemnifiable Losses

prevent or limit an Indemnified Partys right to make a claim under _Section_
__ _ 10.1_ or _10.2_ , as applicable. If a recovery is received by an
Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates after it receives payment or other
credit under this Agreement with respect to any Losses, then a refund equal to
the aggregate amount of the actual recovery, up to the amount received by the
Indemnified Party from the Indemnifying Party solely and specifically
attributable to such Losses, less any reasonable costs and expenses incurred
by the Indemnified Party to pursue such recovery, will be made promptly by
such Indemnified Party to the Indemnifying Party.

liability company (" _DCP Services_ "), are parties to the Services
Agreement, dated as of February 14, 2013 (the " _Original Services Agreement_
"), and the Employee Secondment Agreement, dated as of February 14, 2013
(together with the Original Services Agreement, the " _Original Agreements_
"), and will enter into the Services and Employee Secondment Agreement on or
prior to the Closing. Nothing is this Agreement is intended to affect the
rights or obligations of MLP and DCP Services under the Original Agreements
and the Services and Employee Secondment Agreement. Notwithstanding anything
contained herein to the contrary, in no event shall HoldCo be obligated under
this Agreement to indemnify (or be otherwise liable hereunder in any way
whatsoever to) any of the MLP Indemnitees with respect to any matter for which
MLP is liable, or for which DCP Services is entitled to indemnification, under
the Original Agreements or the Services and Employee Secondment Agreement.

 



-42- 10.4. _Notice of Asserted Liability; Opportunity to Defend_.

 

(a) All claims for indemnification hereunder shall be subject to the
provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 10.4_. Any Person claiming indemnification
hereunder is referred to herein as the " _Indemnified Party_ ", and any Person
against whom such claims are asserted hereunder is referred to herein as the "
_Indemnifying Party_."

 

(b) If any Claim is asserted against or any Loss is sought to be collected
from an Indemnified Party, the Indemnified Party shall with reasonable
promptness provide to the Indemnifying Party a Claim Notice. The failure to
give any such Claim Notice shall not otherwise affect the rights of the
Indemnified Party to indemnification hereunder unless the Indemnified Party
has proceeded to contest, defend or settle such Claim or remedy such Loss
with respect to which it has failed to give a Claim Notice to the Indemnifying
Party, but only to the extent the Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced
thereby. Additionally, to the extent the Indemnifying Party is materially
prejudiced thereby, the failure to provide a Claim Notice to the Indemnifying
Party shall relieve the Indemnifying Party from liability for such Claims and
Losses that it may have to the Indemnified Party, but only to the extent the
liability for such Claim or Loss is directly attributable to such failure to
provide the Claim Notice.

(c) The Indemnifying Party shall have thirty (30) days from the personal
delivery or receipt of the Claim Notice (the " _Notice Period_ ") to notify
the Indemnified Party (i) whether or not it disputes the liability to the
Indemnified Party hereunder with respect to the Claim or Loss, and in the
event of a dispute, such dispute shall be resolved in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 11.9_ hereof, (ii) in the case where Losses are asserted
against or sought to be collected from an Indemnifying Party by the
Indemnified Party, whether or not the Indemnifying Party shall at its own sole
cost and expense remedy such Losses or (iii) in the case where Claims are
asserted against or sought to be collected from an Indemnified Party, whether
or not the Indemnifying Party shall at its own sole cost and expense defend
the Indemnified Party against such Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that any
Indemnified Party is hereby authorized prior to and during the Notice Period
to file any motion, answer or other pleading that it shall deem necessary or
appropriate to protect its interests or those of the Indemnifying Party (and
of which it shall have given notice and opportunity to comment to
the Indemnifying Party) and not prejudicial to the Indemnifying Party.

(d) If the Indemnifying Party does not give notice to the Indemnified Party
of its election to contest and defend any such Claim described in _Section_ __
_ 10.4(c)(iii)_ within the Notice Period, then the Indemnifying Party shall
be bound by the result obtained with respect thereto by the Indemnified Party
and shall be responsible for all costs incurred in connection therewith.

(e) If the Indemnifying Party is obligated to defend and indemnify the
Indemnified Party, and the Parties have a conflict of interest with respect to
any such Claim, then the Indemnified Party may, in its sole discretion,
separately and independently contest and defend such Claim, and
the Indemnifying Party shall be bound by the result obtained with

 



-43-  respect thereto by the Indemnified Party and shall be responsible for all
costs incurred in connection therewith; _provided_ , _however_ , this _Section
10.4(e)_ shall not apply to any claims with respect to Taxes.

(f) If the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party within the Notice
Period that it shall defend the Indemnified Party against a Claim, the
Indemnifying Party shall have the right to defend all appropriate Proceedings,
and with counsel of its own choosing (but reasonably satisfactory to the
Indemnified Party) and such Proceedings shall be promptly settled (subject to
obtaining a full and complete release of all Indemnified Parties) or
prosecuted by it to a final conclusion. If the Indemnified Party desires to
participate in, but not control, any such defense or settlement it may do so
at its sole cost and expense. If the Indemnified Party joins in any such
Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall have full authority to determine all
action to be taken with respect thereto, as long as such action could not
create a liability to any of the Indemnified Parties, in which case, such
action would require the prior written consent of any Indemnified Party so
affected.

 

(g) If requested by the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party agrees to
use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to cooperate, at the Indemnifying Partys
expense, with the Indemnifying Party and its counsel in contesting any Claim
and in making any counterclaim against the Third Person asserting the Claim,
or any cross-complaint against any Person, to the extent that
such cooperation, counterclaim or cross-complaint could not materially
prejudice or create a liability to any of the Indemnified Parties.

(h) At any time after the commencement of defense by the Indemnifying Party
under _Section_ __ _ 10.4(f)_ above of any Claim, the Indemnifying Party may
request the Indemnified Party to agree in writing to the abandonment of
such contest or to the payment or compromise by the Indemnifying Party of the
asserted Claim, but only if (i) the Indemnifying Party agrees in writing to be
solely liable for such Claim and (ii) such payment or compromise would
not (A) include the imposition of a consent order, injunction or decree that
would restrict the future activity or conduct of the Indemnified Party or any
of its Affiliates or (B) result in a finding or admission of a violation of
Law or violation of the rights of any Person by the Indemnified Party or any
of its Affiliates; whereupon such action shall be taken unless the Indemnified
Party determines that the contest should be continued and notifies the
Indemnifying Party in writing within fifteen (15) days of such request from
the Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnified Party determines that the contest
should be continued, the amount for which the Indemnifying Party would
otherwise be liable hereunder shall not exceed the amount which the
Indemnifying Party had agreed to pay to compromise such Claim; _provided_ ,
that the other Person to the contested Claim had agreed in writing to accept
such amount in payment or compromise of the Claim as of the time
the Indemnifying Party made its request therefor to the Indemnified Party;
and _provided_ , _further_ , that under such proposed compromise, the
Indemnified Party would be fully and completely released from any further
liability or obligation with respect to the matters which are the subject of
such contested Claim.

10.5. _Materiality Conditions_. For purposes of determining whether an event
described in this _ARTICLE X_ has occurred for which indemnification under
this _ARTICLE X_ can be sought, any requirement in any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement by HoldCo or MLP, as applicable, contained in
this Agreement (other than in _Sections 4.7(c), 4.8, 4.9, 4.18,_

 



-44-   _4.19_ , and _4.23_ ) that an event or fact be "material," or have a
"Material Adverse Effect" or a "material adverse effect" (each, a "
_Materiality Condition_ ") in order for such event or fact to constitute a
misrepresentation or breach of such representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement under this Agreement, such Materiality Condition shall be
disregarded and such representations, warranties, covenants or agreements
shall be construed solely for purposes of this _ARTICLE X_ as if they did not
contain such Materiality Conditions. Notwithstanding anything in this
_Section_ __ _ 10.5_, any claim for indemnification under this _ARTICLE X_
will be subject to _Section_ __ _ 10.3_.

10.6. _Exclusive Remedy_. AS BETWEEN THE MLP INDEMNITEES AND THE HOLDCO
INDEMNITEES, AFTER THE CLOSING, EXCEPT IN THE EVENT OF FRAUD (a) THE EXPRESS
INDEMNIFICATION PROVISIONS SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT WILL BE THE SOLE AND
EXCLUSIVE RIGHTS, OBLIGATIONS AND REMEDIES OF THE PARTIES WITH RESPECT TO
THIS AGREEMENT AND THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY (OTHER THAN THE OTHER
TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS), AND (b) NO PARTY HERETO NOR ANY OF ITS RESPECTIVE
SUCCESSORS OR ASSIGNS SHALL HAVE ANY RIGHTS AGAINST ANY OTHER PARTY OR ITS
AFFILIATES WITH RESPECT TO THE TRANSACTIONS PROVIDED FOR HEREIN OTHER THAN AS
IS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS.

 

10.7. _Mitigation_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
the Indemnified Party will use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to mitigate
all Losses related to a Claim, and shall provide such documentation of the
nature and extent of the claim as may be reasonably requested by the
Indemnifying Party.

 

10.8. _Limitation on Damages_. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY IN
THIS AGREEMENT, IN NO EVENT SHALL A PARTY BE LIABLE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT FOR
ANY EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE, REMOTE, SPECULATIVE, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES OR LOSS OF PROFITS; _PROVIDED_ , _HOWEVER_ , THAT IF ANY
OF THE HOLDCO INDEMNITEES OR MLP INDEMNITEES IS HELD LIABLE TO A THIRD PERSON
FOR ANY SUCH DAMAGES AND THE INDEMNIFYING PARTY IS OBLIGATED TO INDEMNIFY SUCH
HOLDCO INDEMNITEE OR MLP INDEMNITEE, AS APPLICABLE, UNDER THIS AGREEMENT FOR
THE MATTER THAT GAVE RISE TO SUCH DAMAGES, THEN THE INDEMNIFYING PARTY SHALL
BE LIABLE FOR, AND OBLIGATED TO REIMBURSE SUCH HOLDCO INDEMNITEE OR MLP
INDEMNITEE, AS APPLICABLE, FOR, SUCH DAMAGES.

10.9. _Bold or Capitalized Letters_. THE PARTIES AGREE THAT THE BOLD OR
CAPITALIZED LETTERS IN THIS AGREEMENT CONSTITUTE CONSPICUOUS LEGENDS.

10.10.  _Consideration Adjustment_. The Parties agree to treat all payments
made pursuant to this _ARTICLE X_ as adjustments to the Consideration for Tax
purposes, except as may otherwise be required by Law following a final
determination as defined in Section 1313 of the Code or made by a
Governmental Authority with competent jurisdiction.

 



-45- 10.11. _Payment_. With respect to all payments required to be made by HoldCo
to any Transferee pursuant to this _ARTICLE X_ , HoldCo shall have the
option, in its sole and absolute discretion, to pay any such amount in cash or
in kind by delivering Common Units to such Transferee. If HoldCo elects to pay
in kind any amount due from HoldCo to any Transferee hereunder, HoldCo will
deliver to such Transferee a number of Common Units equal to the quotient of
(a) the amount of such payment, _divided by_ (b) the VWAP over the twenty (20)
trading days immediately preceding the date that such delivery of Common
Units is made. " _VWAP_ " shall mean the volume-weighted average price of a
Common Unit as displayed under the heading "Bloomberg VWAP" on Bloomberg page
"DPM <equity> AQR" (or the equivalent successor if such page is not
available), or, if Bloomberg ceases to publish such price, any successor
service reasonably agreed by the Parties. If such per-Common Unit volume-
weighted average price is unavailable or is manifestly incorrect, "VWAP" shall
mean the market price of one Common Unit determined, using a per-Common Unit
volume-weighted average method, by a nationally recognized investment banking
firm reasonably acceptable to the Parties.

thereby; _provided_ , _however_ , that (a) HoldCo shall be responsible
for the HoldCo Transaction Expenses to the extent incurred by HoldCo or any
Entity and the fees and expenses of Deloitte and Touche LLP to the extent
incurred by any Party in connection with the preparation and audit of carve-
out financial statements relating to the Contributions, and (b) MLP shall be
responsible for the fees and expenses of Andrews Kurth Kenyon LLP, Richards,
Layton and Finger, P.A. and Evercore Group, L.L.C. to the extent incurred by

11.2. _Further Assurances_. From time to time, and without further
consideration, each Party will execute and deliver to the other Party such
documents and take such actions as the other Party may reasonably request in
order to more effectively implement and carry into effect the transactions

11.3. _Transfer Taxes_. The Parties anticipate that the Contribution is exempt
from or is otherwise not subject to any sales, use, transfer or similar
Taxes. If any such sales, transfer, use or similar Taxes are due or should
hereafter become due (including penalties and interest thereon) by reason of
this transaction, such Taxes shall be borne one-half by MLP and one-half by
HoldCo, except that any interest, additions and penalties that arise as a
result of a Persons failure to timely and properly pay its portion of such
Taxes shall be borne exclusively by such Person. The Parties will, and will
cause their Affiliates to, cooperate in the preparation and filing of any Tax
Returns and other documentation with respect to Transfer Taxes.

obligations arising hereunder without the prior written consent of the other
Parties.

 



-46- 11.5. _Entire Agreement, Amendments and Waiver_. This Agreement, together with

obligations hereunder may be waived only in writing by such Party specifically
stating that it waives such term or condition hereof. No waiver by a Party of
any one or more conditions or defaults by the other Party in the performance
of any of the provisions of this Agreement shall operate or be construed as a
waiver of any future condition or default, whether of a like or
different character, nor shall such waiver constitute a continuing waiver
unless otherwise expressly provided in such waiver.

11.6. _Disclosure Schedules_. Except with respect to any Schedule Updates,
which are governed by _Section_ __ _ 6.6_, the disclosure of any matter in
any section or subsection of the HoldCo Disclosure Schedule or the MLP
Disclosure Schedule (collectively, the " _Disclosure Schedules_ "), as
applicable, shall be deemed to be a disclosure under the respective Disclosure
Schedule for all purposes of this Agreement to which such matter could
reasonably be expected to be pertinent. The mere disclosure of any matter or
item on a Disclosure Schedule as an exception to any representation or
warranty or otherwise shall not be deemed to constitute an admission by any of
the Parties, as applicable, or to otherwise imply, that any such item has had
or is reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect or otherwise represents an exception or material fact, event or
circumstance for the purposes of this Agreement, that such item meets or
