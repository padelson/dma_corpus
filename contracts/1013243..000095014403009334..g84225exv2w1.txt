         (a) Each share of CIMA Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than shares of CIMA Common Stock held by CIMA
or owned by aaiPharma, Holding Company, S MergerCo or C MergerCo, all of which
shall be canceled as provided in Section 3.02(b)) shall be converted into the
right to receive 1.3657 (the "CIMA Exchange Ratio") validly issued, fully paid
and non-assessable shares of HoldCo Common Stock (together with any cash in lieu
of fractional shares of HoldCo Common Stock to be paid pursuant to Section 3.08,
the "CIMA Merger Consideration").

         (b) Each share of CIMA Common Stock held by CIMA or owned by Holding
Company, aaiPharma, S MergerCo or C MergerCo immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall, by virtue of the CIMA Merger, cease to be outstanding and shall be
canceled, and no HoldCo Common Stock or other consideration shall be delivered
in exchange therefor.

         (c) All shares of CIMA Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall cease to be outstanding and shall be canceled and shall
cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate or certificates which
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such shares of CIMA
Common Stock ("CIMA Certificates") shall thereafter cease to have any rights
with respect to such shares of CIMA Common Stock, except as provided



                                       15
<PAGE>

herein or by Law, and each CIMA Certificate previously representing such shares
shall thereafter represent the right to receive the CIMA Merger Consideration
payable in respect of such shares of CIMA Common Stock and any dividends or
other distributions to which such holder is entitled to pursuant to Section
3.06.

         (d) Each share of C MergerCo Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one validly
issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per
share, of CIMA Surviving Corporation.

         3.03 Holding Company Common Stock. At the Effective Time, each share of
capital stock of Holding Company issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and owned by aaiPharma shall be contributed to Holding Company,
without payment of any consideration therefor, and thereupon retired.

         3.04 Certain Adjustments. If, between the date of this Agreement and
the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of HoldCo Common Stock, CIMA Common
Stock or aaiPharma Common Stock shall have been changed into, or exchanged for,
a different number of shares or a different class, by reason of any
reclassification, recapitalization, stock split, split-up, combination or
exchange of shares or a stock dividend or dividend payable in any other
securities shall be declared with a record date within such period, or any
similar event shall have occurred, the aaiPharma Exchange Ratio and the CIMA
Exchange Ratio, each to the extent affected thereby, shall be correspondingly
adjusted to provide to the holders of aaiPharma Common Stock, aaiPharma Stock
Options, CIMA Common Stock and CIMA Stock Options the same economic effect as
contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.

         3.05 Exchange Procedures.

         (a) As of the Effective Time, Holding Company shall deposit, or cause
to be deposited, with Wachovia Bank, National Association or, in the event
Wachovia Bank, National Association is unwilling or unable to serve as the
exchange agent, such other commercial bank or trust company of recognized
standing reasonably acceptable to CIMA and aaiPharma (in such capacity, the
"Exchange Agent"), for the respective benefit of the holders of the aaiPharma
Certificates and the CIMA Certificates, for exchange, in accordance with this
Article III, through the Exchange Agent, certificates representing the HoldCo
Common Stock issuable to the respective holders of aaiPharma Certificates and
CIMA Certificates and cash payable pursuant to Section 3.08. Holding Company
agrees to make available, or cause to be made available, to the Exchange Agent,
from time to time as needed, cash sufficient to pay any dividends and other
distributions pursuant to Section 3.06. Any cash and certificates representing
HoldCo Common Stock deposited with the Exchange Agent shall hereinafter be
referred to as the "Exchange Fund." The Exchange Agent shall, pursuant to
irrevocable instructions, deliver out of the Exchange Fund the aaiPharma Merger
Consideration contemplated to be paid for shares of aaiPharma Common Stock
pursuant to this Agreement and the CIMA Merger Consideration contemplated to be
paid for shares of CIMA Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement. Except as

any other purpose.



                                       16
<PAGE>

         (b) Promptly after the Effective Time, Holding Company shall cause the
Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of a aaiPharma Certificate or a
CIMA Certificate (collectively, the "Certificates") (i) a letter of transmittal
which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title
to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to
the Exchange Agent, and which letter shall be in customary form and have such
other provisions as Holding Company may reasonably specify (such letter to be
reasonably acceptable to CIMA and aaiPharma prior to the Effective Time) and
(ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of such Certificates in exchange
for the applicable aaiPharma Merger Consideration or CIMA Merger Consideration.
Upon surrender of a Certificate to the Exchange Agent together with such letter
of transmittal, duly executed and completed in accordance with the instructions
thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange
Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor (A) one or more shares of HoldCo Common Stock representing, in the
aggregate, the number of whole shares that such holder has the right to receive
pursuant to this Article III (after taking into account all shares of aaiPharma
Common Stock and CIMA Common Stock held by such holder as of the Effective Time)
and (B) a check in the amount equal to the cash that such holder has the right
to receive pursuant to the provisions of this Article III, consisting of cash in
lieu of any fractional shares of HoldCo Common Stock pursuant to Section 3.08
and any dividends or other distributions to which such holder is entitled
pursuant to Section 3.06. No interest will be paid or will accrue on any cash or
other consideration deliverable pursuant to this Article III. In the event of a
transfer of ownership of aaiPharma Common Stock or CIMA Common Stock which is
not registered in the transfer records of aaiPharma or CIMA, as applicable, one
or more certificates of HoldCo Common Stock evidencing, in the aggregate, the
proper number of shares of HoldCo Common Stock and a check in the proper amount
of cash in lieu of any fractional shares of HoldCo Common Stock pursuant to
Section 3.08 and any dividends or other distributions to which such holder is
entitled pursuant to Section 3.06, may be issued with respect to such aaiPharma
Common Stock or CIMA Common Stock, as applicable, to such a transferee if the
Certificates formerly representing such shares of aaiPharma Common Stock or CIMA
Common Stock, as applicable, are presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by
all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that
any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this Section 3.05(b), (1) each aaiPharma Certificate shall be
deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive upon such surrender the aaiPharma Merger Consideration payable in
respect of the shares of aaiPharma Common Stock formerly represented by such
aaiPharma Certificate, and any dividends or other distributions to which such
holder is entitled pursuant to Section 3.06 and (2) each CIMA Certificate shall
be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive upon such surrender the CIMA Merger Consideration payable in respect of
the shares of CIMA Common Stock formerly represented by such CIMA Certificate,
and any dividends or other distributions to which such holder is entitled
pursuant to Section 3.06.

         3.06 Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares. Whenever a
dividend or other distribution is declared by Holding Company in respect of
HoldCo Common Stock the record date for which is at or after the Effective Time,
that declaration shall include dividends or other distributions in respect of
all shares issuable pursuant to this Agreement. No dividends or other
distributions declared or made in respect of HoldCo Common Stock, with a record
date after the Effective Time, shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
Certificate, and no cash



                                       17
<PAGE>

payment in lieu of fractional shares of HoldCo Common Stock shall be paid to any
holder pursuant to Section 3.08, unless and until the holder of such Certificate
shall surrender such Certificate in accordance with this Article III. Subject to
the effect of escheat, Tax or other applicable Laws, following surrender of any
such Certificate, there shall be paid to such holder of shares of HoldCo Common
Stock issuable in exchange therefor, in addition to the appropriate aaiPharma
Merger Consideration or CIMA Merger Consideration, as the case may be, and
without interest, (i) promptly after the time of such surrender, the amount of
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of HoldCo Common Stock, and
(ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to such
surrender and a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with respect
to such whole shares of HoldCo Common Stock.

         3.07 Further Ownership Rights. All shares of HoldCo Common Stock issued
and cash paid upon conversion of shares of aaiPharma Common Stock or CIMA Common
Stock, as the case may be, in accordance with the terms of Article II and this
Article III (including any cash paid pursuant to Section 3.06 or Section 3.08)
shall be deemed to have been issued or paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to such shares of aaiPharma Common Stock or CIMA Common Stock, as the
case may be.

         3.08 No Fractional Shares of HoldCo Common Stock.

         (a) No certificates or scrip or shares of HoldCo Common Stock
representing fractional shares of HoldCo Common Stock or book-entry credit of
the same shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates and
such fractional share interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to
have any rights of a stockholder of Holding Company or a holder of shares of
HoldCo Common Stock.

         (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder
of shares of aaiPharma Common Stock exchanged pursuant to the aaiPharma Merger
who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of
HoldCo Common Stock (after taking into account all aaiPharma Certificates
delivered by such holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without
interest) in an amount equal to the product of (i) such fractional part of a
share of HoldCo Common Stock multiplied by (ii) the closing price for a share of
HoldCo Common Stock on Nasdaq (as reported in The Wall Street Journal (Eastern
Edition) or, if not reported therein, in another authoritative source), on the
first trading day on Nasdaq following the Effective Time. No holder of shares of
aaiPharma Common Stock will be entitled to receive pursuant to this Section 3.08
cash in an amount equal to or greater than the value of one full share of HoldCo
Common Stock.

         (c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder
of shares of CIMA Common Stock exchanged pursuant to the CIMA Merger who would
otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of HoldCo Common
Stock (after taking into account all CIMA Certificates delivered by such holder)
shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without interest) in an amount equal to
the product of (i) such fractional part of a share of HoldCo Common Stock
multiplied by (ii) the closing price for a share of HoldCo Common Stock on
Nasdaq (as reported in The Wall Street Journal (Eastern Edition) or, if not
reported therein, in



                                       18
<PAGE>

another authoritative source), on the first trading day on Nasdaq following the
Effective Time. No holder of shares of CIMA Common Stock will be entitled to
receive pursuant to this Section 3.08 cash in an amount equal to or greater than
the value of one full share of HoldCo Common Stock.

         (d) As promptly as practicable after the determination of the amount of
cash, if any, to be paid to holders of fractional interests, the Exchange Agent
shall so notify Holding Company, and Holding Company shall deposit, or shall
cause the deposit of, such amount with the Exchange Agent and shall cause the
Exchange Agent to forward payments to such holders of fractional interests
subject to and in accordance with the terms hereof.

         3.09 Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
which remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates for six months after
the Effective Time shall be delivered to Holding Company or otherwise on the
instruction of Holding Company, and any holders of the Certificates who have not
theretofore complied with this Article III shall thereafter look only to Holding
Company for the aaiPharma Merger Consideration or the CIMA Merger Consideration,
as the case may be, payable with respect to the shares of aaiPharma Common Stock
or CIMA Common Stock, as the case may be, formerly represented thereby to which
such holders are entitled pursuant to this Article III and any dividends or
distributions with respect to shares of HoldCo Common Stock to which such
holders are entitled pursuant to Section 3.06, in each case, without any
interest thereon. Any such portion of the Exchange Fund remaining unclaimed by
holders of Certificates five years after the Effective Time (or such earlier
date immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to
or become property of any Governmental Authority) shall, to the extent permitted
by Law, become the property of Holding Company free and clear of any claims or
interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

         3.10 No Liability. None of Holding Company, CIMA, C MergerCo, S
MergerCo, aaiPharma, aaiPharma Surviving Corporation, CIMA Surviving Corporation
or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any aaiPharma
Merger Consideration or CIMA Merger Consideration (or dividends or distributions
with respect thereto) from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.

         3.11 Investment of the Exchange Fund. The Exchange Agent shall invest
any cash included in the Exchange Fund, as directed by Holding Company, on a
daily basis; provided that no such gain or loss thereon shall affect the amounts
payable to the aaiPharma stockholders or the CIMA stockholders pursuant to
Article II and the other provisions of this Article III. Any interest and other
income resulting from such investments shall promptly be paid to Holding Company
upon the termination of the Exchange Fund pursuant to Section 3.09.

         3.12 Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen
or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
Holding Company, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount
as Holding Company may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will pay in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the applicable aaiPharma
Merger Consideration or



                                       19
<PAGE>

CIMA Merger Consideration, as the case may be, payable with respect to the
shares of aaiPharma Common Stock or CIMA Common Stock, as the case may be,
formerly represented thereby and any unpaid dividends and distributions on
shares of HoldCo Common Stock to which such holders are entitled pursuant to
Section 3.06, deliverable in respect thereof, in each case, without any interest
thereon.

         3.13 Withholding Rights. Each of Holding Company, aaiPharma Surviving
Corporation, CIMA Surviving Corporation and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled
to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any holder of shares of aaiPharma Common Stock or CIMA Common Stock
or any holder of aaiPharma Stock Options, CIMA Stock Options or any other equity
rights in aaiPharma or CIMA, such amounts as it is required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code and the
Treasury Regulations or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the
extent that amounts are so withheld by Holding Company, aaiPharma Surviving
Corporation, CIMA Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent, as the case may
be, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the holder of the shares of aaiPharma Common Stock or CIMA
Common Stock, or the holder of aaiPharma Stock Options, CIMA Stock Options or
any other equity rights in aaiPharma or CIMA, as applicable, in each case, in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Holding Company,
aaiPharma Surviving Corporation, CIMA Surviving Corporation or the Exchange
Agent, as the case may be.

         3.14 Further Assurances.

         (a) After the Effective Time, the officers and directors of aaiPharma
Surviving Corporation shall be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name
and on behalf of aaiPharma or S MergerCo, any deeds, bills of sale, assignments
or assurances and to take and do, in the name and on behalf of aaiPharma or S
MergerCo, any other actions and things to vest, perfect or confirm of record or
otherwise in aaiPharma Surviving Corporation any and all right, title and
interest in, to and under any of the rights, properties or assets acquired or to
be acquired by aaiPharma Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in connection
with, the aaiPharma Merger.

         (b) After the Effective Time, the officers and directors of CIMA
Surviving Corporation shall be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name
and on behalf of CIMA or C MergerCo, any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or

in CIMA Surviving Corporation any and all right, title and interest in, to and
under any of the rights, properties or assets acquired or to be acquired by CIMA
Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in connection with, the CIMA Merger.

         3.15 Stock Transfer Books. The stock transfer books of aaiPharma and
CIMA shall be closed immediately upon the Effective Time; and thereafter, there
shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of aaiPharma Common
Stock or CIMA Common Stock outstanding as of the Effective Time on the records
of aaiPharma or CIMA, as the case may be. On or after the Effective Time, (i)
any aaiPharma Certificates presented to the Exchange Agent or Holding Company
for any reason shall be converted into the right to receive the aaiPharma Merger
Consideration with respect to the shares of aaiPharma Common Stock formerly
represented



                                       20
<PAGE>

thereby, including any cash in lieu of fractional shares of HoldCo Common Stock
to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to Section 3.08 and any
dividends or other distributions to which the holders thereof are entitled
pursuant to Section 3.06, and (ii) any CIMA Certificates presented to the
Exchange Agent or Holding Company for any reason shall be converted into the
right to receive the CIMA Merger Consideration with respect to the shares of
CIMA Common Stock formerly represented thereby, including any cash in lieu of
fractional shares of HoldCo Common Stock to which the holders thereof are
entitled pursuant to Section 3.08 and any dividends or other distributions to
which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to Section 3.06.

         3.16 aaiPharma Stock Options.

         (a) Each option to purchase aaiPharma Common Stock (a "aaiPharma Stock
Option") that was granted pursuant to the aaiPharma Stock Plans prior to the
Effective Time, whether or not exercisable at the Effective Time, and which
remains outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall cease to
represent a right to acquire shares of aaiPharma Common Stock and shall be
appropriately adjusted and converted, at the Effective Time, into an option to
acquire HoldCo Common Stock in accordance with this Section 3.16(a). Each
aaiPharma Stock Option so converted shall continue to have, and be subject to,
the same terms and conditions as were applicable under the aaiPharma Stock
Option (but taking into account any changes thereto provided for in the
aaiPharma Stock Plans or in such option by reason of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby), and each aaiPharma Stock Option shall be
appropriately adjusted and converted into an option to acquire that number of
shares of HoldCo Common Stock determined by multiplying the number of shares of
aaiPharma Common Stock subject to such aaiPharma Stock Option by the aaiPharma
Exchange Ratio, rounded down, if necessary, to the nearest whole share of HoldCo
Common Stock, at a price per share (rounded up to the nearest cent) equal to the
per share exercise price specified in such aaiPharma Stock Option divided by the
aaiPharma Exchange Ratio; provided, however, that in the case of any aaiPharma
Stock Option to which Section 421 of the Code applies by reason of its
qualification under Section 422 of the Code, the option price, the number of
shares subject to such option and the terms and conditions of exercise of such
option shall be determined in a manner consistent with the requirements of
Section 424(a) of the Code so as not to constitute a "modification" of such
option. Each such converted aaiPharma Stock Option shall remain subject to the
terms and conditions of the aaiPharma Stock Plan pursuant to which such
aaiPharma Stock Option was granted and the agreement evidencing the grant of
such aaiPharma Stock Option. On or prior to the Effective Time, aaiPharma and
Holding Company shall take all actions necessary such that all aaiPharma Stock
Options outstanding prior to the Effective Time under the aaiPharma Stock Plans
are treated in accordance with the immediately preceding sentences.

         (b) At the Effective Time, Holding Company shall assume each aaiPharma
Stock Option in accordance with the terms of the aaiPharma Stock Plan under
which it was issued and the stock option agreement by which it is evidenced. As
soon as practicable after the Effective Time, but no later than five (5)
Business Days after the Effective Time, Holding Company shall deliver to the
holders of aaiPharma Stock Options appropriate notices setting forth such
holders' rights pursuant to the aaiPharma Stock Plans (including that, in
connection with the aaiPharma Merger and pursuant to the terms of the aaiPharma
Stock Plans, the aaiPharma Stock Options of such holders have become fully
vested and exercisable) and the agreements evidencing the grants of such
aaiPharma Stock Options shall continue in effect on the same terms and



                                       21
<PAGE>

conditions. To the extent permitted by Law, Holding Company shall comply with
the terms of the aaiPharma Stock Plans and shall take such reasonable steps as
are necessary or required by, and subject to the provisions of, such aaiPharma
Stock Plans, to have the aaiPharma Stock Options which qualified as incentive
stock options under Section 421 of the Code prior to the Effective Time continue
to qualify as incentive stock options of Holding Company under Section 421 of
the Code after the Effective Time. With respect to aaiPharma Insiders, where
applicable, Holding Company shall administer the aaiPharma Stock Plans with
respect to assumed aaiPharma Stock Options in a manner consistent with the
exemptions provided by Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

         3.17 CIMA Stock Options.

         (a) Each option to purchase CIMA Common Stock (a "CIMA Stock Option")
that was granted pursuant to the CIMA Stock Plans prior to the Effective Time,
whether or not exercisable at the Effective Time, and which remains outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall cease to represent a right to
acquire shares of CIMA Common Stock and shall be appropriately adjusted and
converted, at the Effective Time, into an option to acquire HoldCo Common Stock
in accordance with this Section 3.17(a). Each CIMA Stock Option so converted
shall continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions as were
applicable under the CIMA Stock Option (but taking into account any changes
thereto provided for in the CIMA Stock Plans or in such option by reason of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby), and each CIMA Stock Option
shall be appropriately adjusted and converted into an option to acquire that
number of shares of HoldCo Common Stock determined by multiplying the number of
shares of CIMA Common Stock subject to such CIMA Stock Option by the CIMA
Exchange Ratio, rounded down, if necessary, to the nearest whole share of HoldCo
Common Stock, at a price per share (rounded up to the nearest cent) equal to the
per share exercise price specified in such CIMA Stock Option divided by the CIMA
Exchange Ratio; provided, however, that in the case of any CIMA Stock Option to
which Section 421 of the Code applies by reason of its qualification under
Section 422 of the Code, the option price, the number of shares subject to such
option and the terms and conditions of exercise of such option shall be
determined in a manner consistent with the requirements of Section 424(a) of the
Code so as not to constitute a "modification" of such option. Each such
converted CIMA Stock Option shall remain subject to the terms and conditions of
the CIMA Stock Plan pursuant to which such CIMA Stock Option was granted and the
agreement evidencing the grant of such CIMA Stock Option. On or prior to the
Effective Time, CIMA and Holding Company shall take all actions necessary such
that all CIMA Stock Options outstanding prior to the Effective Time under the
CIMA Stock Plans are treated in accordance with the immediately preceding
sentences.

         (b) At the Effective Time, Holding Company shall assume each CIMA Stock
Option in accordance with the terms of the CIMA Stock Plan under which it was
issued and the stock option agreement by which it is evidenced. As soon as
practicable after the Effective Time, but no later than five (5) Business Days
after the Effective Time, Holding Company shall deliver to the holders of CIMA
Stock Options appropriate notices setting forth such holders' rights pursuant to
the CIMA Stock Plans and the agreements evidencing the grants of such CIMA Stock
Options shall continue in effect on the same terms and conditions. To the extent
permitted by Law, Holding Company shall comply with the terms of the CIMA Stock
Plans and shall take such reasonable steps as are necessary or required by, and
subject to the provisions of, such



                                       22
<PAGE>

CIMA Stock Plans, to have the CIMA Stock Options which qualified as incentive
stock options under Section 421 of the Code prior to the Effective Time continue
to qualify as incentive stock options of Holding Company under Section 421 of
the Code after the Effective Time. With respect to CIMA Insiders, where
applicable, Holding Company shall administer the CIMA Stock Plans with respect
to assumed CIMA Stock Options in a manner consistent with the exemptions
provided by Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

         3.18 Reservation of Shares for Stock Options. Prior to the Closing,
Holding Company shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for
issuance a sufficient number of shares of HoldCo Common Stock for delivery upon
exercise of aaiPharma Stock Options and CIMA Stock Options after the Effective
Time. Promptly after the Effective Time, but no later than five (5) Business
Days after the Effective Time, Holding Company shall file a registration
statement with the SEC on Form S-8 (or any successor or other appropriate
forms), with respect to the shares of HoldCo Common Stock subject to such
options and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the
effectiveness of such registration statement or registration statements (and
maintain the current status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained
therein), as well as comply with any applicable state securities Laws, for so
long as such options remain outstanding.

         may be, and (B) did not contain any untrue statement of a material fact
         or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or

         the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. As of the

                  (2) Each of the consolidated financial statements (including

         were prepared in accordance with GAAP as in effect on the date of such
         report applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods involved
         (except as may be indicated therein or in the notes thereto) and each
         fairly presented in all material respects the consolidated financial
         position, results of operations and cash flows of it and its
         consolidated Subsidiaries as at the respective dates thereof for the
         periods indicated therein (subject, in the case of unaudited
         statements, to normal and recurring year-end adjustments which did not
         and would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected
         to have a Material Adverse Effect on it or its Subsidiaries, taken as a
         whole). Its books and records and those of its Subsidiaries have been,
         and are being, maintained in all material respects in accordance with
         GAAP and any other applicable legal and accounting requirements.

                  (3) As of the date hereof, except as and to the extent set

         10-K for the year ended December 31, 2002 (including the notes
         thereto), or as set forth on a consolidated balance sheet (including
         the notes thereto) included in Regulatory Filings filed with the SEC
         after December 31, 2002 and prior to the date of this Agreement,
         neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries has any Liabilities of any
         nature (whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise) that would
         be required to be reflected on a balance sheet or in notes thereto
         prepared in accordance with GAAP, except for (i) Liabilities incurred
         in the ordinary course of business since December 31, 2002, (ii)
         Liabilities which are accrued or reserved against and reflected in the
         Company's consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2002,
         and (iii) Liabilities incurred in connection with this Agreement.

         (i) Absence of Certain Changes or Events. From December 31, 2002 to the

thereto) filed after December 31, 2002 and prior to the date of this Agreement),
it and its Subsidiaries have conducted their businesses in the ordinary course
of business consistent with past practice and, since December 31, 2002, there

reasonably be expected to prevent it from performing its obligations under this
Agreement or consummating the transactions contemplated hereby, (3) any
declaration, payment or setting aside for payment of any dividend or other
distribution (whether in cash, stock or property or any combination thereof) in
respect of its capital stock, other than dividends or distributions by any of
its wholly owned Subsidiaries to it or another of its wholly owned Subsidiaries,
(4) any sale, transfer, mortgage, pledge or other disposition of (or grant of
permission for any of the foregoing), or encumbrance on, any assets or
properties, real, personal or mixed, material to it and its Subsidiaries taken
as a whole, (5) any increase in any manner of the compensation of any of its or
any of its Subsidiaries' officers, directors or



                                       32

Employees, or entrance into, establishment, amendment or termination of any
Benefits Arrangement with, for or in respect of, any officer, director, or

         knowledge, none of its Employees is or has been the subject of any
         similar pending or threatened action or proceeding.

                  (4) Neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any

         action or investigation undertaken pursuant to the Generic Drug
         Enforcement Act of 1992, 21 U.S.C. Section 335(a), (b) and (c), or any
         other similar regulation of the Food and Drug Administration.

                  (5) To its knowledge, no data generated by it or any of its
         Subsidiaries that has been provided to its clients is the subject of

         Section 1320a-7(b)) and the Civil False Claims Act (31 U.S.C. Section
         3729 et seq.) and the regulations promulgated pursuant to such
         statutes. To its knowledge, neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries nor
         any of its Employees has knowingly committed any act, made any
         statement, or failed to make any statement, that would reasonably be
         expected to provide a basis for the Food and Drug Administration to
         invoke its Fraud, Untrue, Material Facts, Bribery, and Illegal
         Gratuities Final Policy or that would reasonably be expected to provide

         law as the result of the merger of a Person with and into it or any of
         its Subsidiaries.

                  (2) "Liability" means all indebtedness, obligations and other

                  (1) has all permits, licenses, authorizations, orders and
         approvals of, and has made all filings, applications and registrations

         any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, and none of their respective
         assets, businesses or operations is bound by, any contract, agreement,

         any of its Subsidiaries to compete in any line of business or with any
         Person or in any geographical area or which would so materially limit
         its freedom or the freedom of any of its Subsidiaries so to compete
         after the Effective Time (collectively, its "Material Contracts"). Each
         of its Material Contracts is valid and binding on it or its Subsidiary
         party thereto and, to its knowledge, each other Person thereto, and is
         in full force and effect and enforceable against it or such Subsidiary,
         as the case may be, in accordance with its terms, (except as

                  (2) Neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries is in violation,
         breach or default under any of its Material Contracts, and there has
         not occurred any event that, with the lapse of time or the giving of
         notice or both, would constitute such a violation, breach or default.

         (s) Customers. Since December 31, 2002, neither it nor any of its
Subsidiaries has received written notice that any material customer intends to
cancel, terminate or otherwise modify any relationship with it or any of its

is a party to, or bound by, any collective bargaining agreement or other
contract or understanding with a labor union or labor organization. There is no
(i) unfair labor practice, labor dispute (other than routine individual
grievances) or labor arbitration proceeding pending or, to its knowledge,
threatened against it or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) to its knowledge,
activity or proceeding by a labor union or representative thereof to organize
any of its employees or any employees of any of its Subsidiaries, or (iii)

         which is an "employee pension benefit plan" within the meaning of
         Section 3(2) of ERISA ("Pension Plan"), and which is intended to be
         qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code, is so qualified, and has
         received a favorable determination letter from the Internal Revenue
         Service, or the remedial amendment period under applicable Internal
         Revenue Service guidance in which to apply for such letter and make any
         amendments that are necessary to obtain a favorable determination as to
         the current qualified status of such Pension Plan has not yet expired,
         and it is not aware of any circumstances reasonably likely to result in
         revocation of any such favorable determination letter. Each Benefit
         Plan which is intended to be part of or funded through a voluntary
         employees' beneficiary association within the meaning of Section
         501(c)(9) of the Code has (i) received an opinion letter from the
         Internal Revenue Service recognizing its exempt status under Section
         501(c)(9) of the Code and (ii) filed a timely notice with the Internal
         Revenue Service pursuant to Section 505(c) of the Code, and it is not
         aware of circumstances likely to result in the loss of the exempt
         status of such Benefit Plan under Section 501(c)(9) of the Code. There
         is no material pending or, to the knowledge of CIMA or aaiPharma, as
         the case may be, threatened litigation relating to its Benefit
         Arrangements (other than a claim for benefits in the ordinary course).
         Neither it, nor to the knowledge of CIMA or aaiPharma, as the case may
         be, any plan fiduciary of any Benefit Arrangement, has engaged in any
         transaction in violation of Sections 404 or 406 of ERISA or any
         "prohibited transaction," as defined in Section 4975(c)(1) of the Code,
         for which no exemption exists under Section 408 of ERISA or Section
         4975(c)(2) or (d) of the Code, or has otherwise violated the provisions
         of Part 4 of Title I, Subtitle B of ERISA. It has not knowingly
         participated in a violation of Part 4 of Title I, Subtitle B of ERISA
         by any plan fiduciary of any Benefit Arrangement and has not been
         assessed any civil penalty under Section 502(l) of ERISA.

                  (3) No liability under Subtitle C or D of Title IV of ERISA
         has been or is reasonably expected to be incurred by it, any of its
         Subsidiaries, or any of their respective ERISA Affiliates with respect
         to any ongoing, frozen or terminated "single-employer plan," within the
         meaning of Section 4001(a)(15) of ERISA, currently or formerly
         maintained by any of them. None of it, any of its Subsidiaries, or any
         of their respective ERISA Affiliates has contributed to a
         "multiemployer plan," within the meaning of



                                       38
<PAGE>

         Section 3(37) of ERISA, at any time on or after September 26, 1980. No
         notice of a "reportable event," within the meaning of Section 4043 of
         ERISA, for which the 30-day reporting requirement has not been waived,
         has been required to be filed for any Benefit Arrangement which is an
         "employee pension benefit plan" within the meaning of Section 3(2) of
         ERISA within the 12-month period ending on the date hereof.

                  (4) All contributions required to be made under the terms of
         any of its Benefit Arrangements have been timely made or have been
         reflected on its consolidated financial statements included in its
         Regulatory Filings. No Benefit Arrangement has an "accumulated funding
         deficiency" (whether or not waived) within the meaning of Section 412
         of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA and neither it, nor any of its
         Subsidiaries or their respective ERISA Affiliates has an outstanding
         funding waiver. Neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries or their
         respective ERISA Affiliates has provided, or is required to provide,
         security to any of its Benefit Arrangements pursuant to Section
         401(a)(29) of the Code.

                  (5) There has been no amendment to, announcement by it or any
         of its Subsidiaries relating to, or change in Employee participation or
         coverage under, any Benefit Plan that would increase materially the
         expense of maintaining such Benefit Plan above the level of the expense
         incurred therefor for the most recently completed fiscal year. Neither
         its execution of this Agreement, the performance of its obligations
         hereunder, the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
         Agreement, the termination of the employment of any of its employees
         within a specified time of the Effective Time nor stockholder approval
         of the transactions covered by this Agreement, will (x) limit its
         right, in its sole discretion, to administer or amend in any respect or
         terminate any of its Benefit Plans or any related trust, (y) entitle
         any of its Employees to severance pay or any increase in severance pay,
         or (z), except as expressly contemplated hereby, accelerate the time of
         payment or vesting or trigger any payment or funding (through a grantor
         trust or otherwise) of compensation or benefits under, increase the
         amount payable or trigger any other material obligation pursuant to,
         any of its Benefit Plans. Without limiting the foregoing, as a result
         of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
         (including, as a result of the termination of the employment of any of
         its employees within a specified time of the Effective Time) neither it
         nor any of its Subsidiaries will be obligated to make a payment to an
         individual that would be a "parachute payment" to a "disqualified
         individual" as those terms are defined in Section 280G of the Code,
         without regard to whether such payment is reasonable compensation for
         personal services performed or to be performed in the future.

         (v) Related Party Transactions. Except as disclosed in Regulatory
Filings filed prior to the date of this Agreement, since December 31, 2002,
neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries has entered into any relationship or
transaction of the sort that would be required to be disclosed by it pursuant to
Item 404 of Regulation S-K promulgated under the Securities Act.

         (w) Taxes. (1) All Tax Returns that are required to be filed (taking
into account any extensions of time within which to file) by or with respect to
it and its Subsidiaries have been duly and timely filed, and all such Tax
Returns are complete and accurate in all material respects,



                                       39
<PAGE>

(2) all Taxes shown to be due on the Tax Returns referred to in clause (1) or
that are otherwise due and payable have been paid in full, except for Taxes
which are being contested in good faith and for which adequate reserves have
been established on the balance sheets contained in the financial statements
contained in the Regulatory Filings filed prior to the date hereof, (3) all
Taxes that it or any of its Subsidiaries is obligated to withhold from amounts
owing to any Employee, creditor or third party have been paid over to the proper
Governmental Authority in a timely manner, to the extent due and payable, and
(4) no extensions or waivers of statutes of limitation have been given by or
requested with respect to any of its U.S. federal income taxes or those of its
Subsidiaries. Its unpaid Taxes and those of its Subsidiaries did not, as of the
dates of the most recent financial statements contained in the Regulatory
Filings filed before the date hereof, exceed the reserve for Liabilities for
Taxes (excluding any reserve for deferred Taxes established to reflect timing
differences between book and Tax income) set forth on the face of the balance
sheets (rather than in any notes thereto) contained in such financial
statements. Since December 31, 2002, neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries has
(x) incurred any Liability for Taxes outside the ordinary course of business or
otherwise inconsistent with past custom and practice, (y) changed its Tax
elections or the Tax elections of any of its Subsidiaries or any accounting
method used by it or any of its Subsidiaries for Tax purposes, where such Tax
election or change in accounting method has had, or is reasonably likely to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect, or (z)
settled or compromised any material liability for income Taxes of it and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole. It has delivered or made available to the other
party complete and accurate copies of its federal, state and local Tax Returns
and those of its Subsidiaries and each of their predecessors for the years ended
December 31, 1999, 2000 and 2001, and complete and accurate copies of all
examination reports and statements of deficiencies assessed against or agreed to
by any of it and its Subsidiaries or any predecessors since December 31, 1999.
There are no pending or, to its knowledge, threatened audits, assessments or
other actions for or relating to any Liability in respect of Taxes (including
any deficiencies for Taxes) of any of it or its Subsidiaries, and there are no
matters under discussion with Governmental Authorities, or known to it, with
respect to Taxes that are likely to result in an additional Liability for Taxes
with respect to any of it and its Subsidiaries. As of the date hereof, neither
it nor any of its Subsidiaries has taken any action or has any reason to believe
that any conditions exist that could reasonably be expected to prevent or impede
either the aaiPharma Merger or the CIMA Merger from qualifying as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code or the Mergers,
taken together, from qualifying as an exchange described in Section 351 of the
Code. No Liens for Taxes exist with respect to any of its assets or properties
or those of its Subsidiaries, except for statutory Liens for Taxes not yet
delinquent or that are being contested in good faith and reserved for in
accordance with GAAP. Neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries has been a party to
any distribution as either a "distributing corporation" or a "controlled
corporation" in which the parties to such distribution treated the distribution
as one to which Section 355 of the Code applied (i) in the two (2) years prior
to the date of this Agreement, or (ii) which could otherwise constitute part of
a "plan" or "series of related transactions" (within the meaning of Section
355(e) of the Code) that includes the CIMA Merger or aaiPharma Merger, as
applicable. Except for the affiliated group of which it is the common parent,
each of it and its Subsidiaries is not and has never been a member of an
affiliated group of corporations within the meaning of Section 1504 of the Code
or any group that has filed a combined, consolidated or unitary Tax Return.
Neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries has liability for the Taxes of any Person
(including an individual, corporation, general or limited partnership,



                                       40
<PAGE>

limited liability company, joint venture, estate, trust, association,
organization, labor union or other entity or Governmental Authority) other than
it and its Subsidiaries (i) under Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-6 (or any
similar provision of state, local or foreign Law), (ii) as a transferee or
successor, (iii) by contract, or (iv) otherwise. Neither it nor any of its
Subsidiaries has entered into any transaction identified as a "listed
transaction" for purposes of Treasury Regulations Section 1.6011-4(b)(2) or
301.6111-2(b)(2). If either it or any of its Subsidiaries has entered into any
transaction such that, if the treatment claimed by it or its Subsidiaries were
to be disallowed, the transaction would constitute a substantial understatement
of federal income tax within the meaning of Section 6662 of the Code, then it
believes that it has either (x) substantial authority for the tax treatment of
such transaction or (y) disclosed on its Tax Return the relevant facts affecting
the tax treatment of such transaction.

         (x) Books and Records; Internal Controls. It maintains a system of
internal controls for financial reporting sufficient to provide reasonable
assurance (i) that records are maintained in reasonable detail that accurately
and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of its assets; (ii) that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with GAAP, and that its receipts and expenditures are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of its management and
directors; and (iii) regarding prevention or timely detection of any
unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of its assets that could have a
material effect on its financial statements.

         (y) Marketable Investments. Section 5.03(y) of its Disclosure Letter
lists by amount and type each available-for-sale security owned by it or any of
its Subsidiaries as of a recent date. There are no restrictions of any kind
which prevent or restrict the sale of such available-for-sale securities.

         (z) Takeover Laws and Provisions. It has taken all action required to
be taken by it in order to exempt this Agreement, the aaiPharma Voting
Agreements (in the case of aaiPharma), the CIMA Voting Agreements (in the case
of CIMA) and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby from, and this
Agreement, the aaiPharma Voting Agreements (in the case of aaiPharma), the CIMA
Voting Agreements (in the case of CIMA) and the transactions contemplated hereby
and thereby are exempt from, the requirements of any "moratorium", "control
share", "fair price", "affiliate transaction", "business combination" or other
antitakeover laws and regulations of any state (collectively, "Takeover Laws"),
other than Section 203 of the DGCL. The action of its Board of Directors in
approving this Agreement (and the transactions provided for herein) is
sufficient to render inapplicable to this Agreement (and the transactions
provided for herein) the restrictions on "business combinations" (as defined in
Section 203 of the DGCL) as set forth in Section 203 of the DGCL. It has taken
all action required to be taken by it in order to make this Agreement, the
aaiPharma Voting Agreements (in the case of aaiPharma), the CIMA Voting
Agreements (in the case of CIMA) and the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby comply with, and this Agreement, the aaiPharma Voting Agreements (in the
case of aaiPharma), the CIMA Voting Agreements (in the case of CIMA) and the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby do comply with, the requirements of
any Articles, Sections or provisions of its Constituent Documents concerning
"business combination", "fair price", "voting requirement", "constituency
requirement" or other related provisions (collectively, "Takeover Provisions").



                                       41

         (aa) Financial Advisors, Etc. None of it, its Subsidiaries or any of
their officers, directors or Employees has employed any broker or finder or
incurred any liability for any brokerage fees, commissions or finder's fees in
connection with the transactions contemplated herein, except that, in connection
with this Agreement, aaiPharma represents to CIMA that aaiPharma has retained
Banc of America Securities, LLC as its financial advisor with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and has also retained Thomas Weisel
Partners LLC solely for the purpose of providing certain advisory services in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and CIMA
represents to aaiPharma that CIMA has retained Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. as
its financial advisor with respect to the transactions contemplated by this

         received a written opinion of Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. to the

         Stock.

                  (2) aaiPharma represents to CIMA that the aaiPharma Board has

         aaiPharma Common Stock.

         (bb) Recommendations of Boards of Directors.

                  (1) CIMA represents to aaiPharma that the CIMA Board, by
         resolution adopted by vote of at least a majority of the CIMA Board
         (which resolutions have not been rescinded or amended) at a meeting
         duly called and held, at which a quorum was present and acting
         throughout, has (i) determined that this Agreement and the transactions
         contemplated hereby are advisable, fair to, and in the best interests
         of, CIMA and the stockholders of CIMA, (ii) approved this Agreement and
         transactions contemplated hereby, and any other matters required to be
         approved or adopted in order to effect the Mergers and other
         transactions contemplated by this Agreement, which approval has not
         been rescinded or modified, (iii) resolved to recommend approval and
         adoption of this Agreement by its stockholders, and (iv) directed that
         this Agreement be submitted to its stockholders for consideration in
         accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

                  (2) aaiPharma represents to CIMA that the aaiPharma Board, by
         resolution adopted by vote of at least a majority of the aaiPharma
         Board (which resolutions have not been rescinded or amended) at a
         meeting duly called and held, at which a quorum was present and acting
         throughout, has (i) determined that this Agreement and the transactions

         required to be approved or adopted in order to effect the Mergers and
         other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, which approval has
         not been rescinded or modified, (iii) resolved to recommend approval
         and adoption of this Agreement by its stockholders, and (iv)



                                       42
<PAGE>

         directed that this Agreement be submitted to its stockholders for
         consideration in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

         (cc) CIMA has amended the CIMA Rights Agreement to ensure that (i) none
of a "Distribution Date" or a "Shares Acquisition Date" (in each case as defined
in the CIMA Rights Agreement) will occur, and none of aaiPharma or any of its
stockholders or any of their "Affiliates" or "Associates" as of the date hereof
(including Holding Company) will be deemed to be an "Acquiring Person" (in each
case as defined in the CIMA Rights Agreement) by reason of the execution and
delivery of this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby; and (ii) the Rights will expire immediately prior to the Effective Time.
No "Distribution Date" or "Shares Acquisition Date" has occurred.

         5.04 Representations and Warranties With Respect to Holding Company and

                                   ARTICLE VI

                                    COVENANTS

         6.01 Reasonable Best Efforts.

         (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, aaiPharma
and CIMA will use all reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, in
good faith, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or desirable, or advisable under applicable laws, so as to permit
consummation of the Mergers as promptly as practicable and otherwise to enable
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, and each will cooperate
fully with, and furnish information to, the other party to that end.



                                       43
<PAGE>

         (b) Neither CIMA nor aaiPharma shall, nor shall they permit any of
their respective Subsidiaries (including Holding Company, C MergerCo and S
MergerCo) to, take or cause to be taken any action that would disqualify either
Merger as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.
CIMA and aaiPharma shall use their reasonable best efforts, and shall cause
their respective Subsidiaries to use their reasonable best efforts, to take or
cause to be taken each action that is required to cause each Merger to qualify
as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and the
Mergers, taken together, to qualify as an exchange described in Section 351 of
the Code.

         (c) CIMA and Holding Company shall report the CIMA Merger, and
aaiPharma and Holding Company shall report the aaiPharma Merger, as
reorganizations within the meaning of Section 368 of the Code, unless otherwise
required pursuant to a "determination" within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of
the Code.

         (d) If requested by aaiPharma, at any time Holding Company shall
execute a guarantee, supplemental indenture and such other documents as shall be
required to guarantee the payment of aaiPharma's 11% Senior Subordinated Notes
due 2010.

         (e) As soon as reasonably practicable following the execution of this
Agreement, aaiPharma, as the holder of all of the outstanding shares of HoldCo
Common Stock, will approve and adopt this Agreement and will cause Holding
Company, as the sole stockholder of each of C MergerCo and S MergerCo, to
approve the Mergers and adopt this Agreement.

         (f) At the Effective Time, Holding Company shall assume the obligations
of aaiPharma under the Registration Rights Agreement, dated as of November 17,
1995, among aaiPharma and the stockholders of aaiPharma party thereto.

         6.02 Registration Statement; Joint Proxy Statement; Stockholder
Approvals.

         (a) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date hereof,
CIMA and aaiPharma shall prepare and file with the SEC mutually acceptable joint
proxy materials relating to the CIMA Meeting and the aaiPharma Meeting (such
proxy statement, and any amendments or supplements thereto, the "Joint Proxy
Statement"), and aaiPharma shall cause Holding Company to prepare and file a
registration statement on Form S-4 with respect to the issuance of HoldCo Common
Stock pursuant to the Mergers (the "Registration Statement"; the prospectus
contained in the Registration Statement together with the Proxy Statement, the
"Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus"). Each of CIMA and aaiPharma agrees to
cooperate, and to cause its Subsidiaries to cooperate, with the other party, its
counsel and its accountants, in the preparation of the Registration Statement
and the Joint Proxy Statement. The Joint Proxy Statement shall be included in
and shall constitute a part of the Registration Statement as Holding Company's
prospectus. The Registration Statement and the Joint Proxy Statement shall
comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable provisions of the
Securities Act and the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder.
Each of CIMA and aaiPharma shall use reasonable best efforts to have the
Registration Statement declared effective by the SEC as promptly as practicable
after the date hereof and to keep the Registration Statement effective as long
as is necessary to consummate the Mergers and the other transactions
contemplated thereby. CIMA and aaiPharma shall, as promptly as practicable after
receipt thereof, provide the other party



                                       44
<PAGE>

copies of any written comments and advise the other party of any oral comments
with respect to the Joint Proxy Statement received from the SEC. CIMA and
aaiPharma shall provide the other party with a reasonable opportunity to review
and comment on any amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement and the
Joint Proxy Statement prior to filing such with the SEC, and will promptly
provide the other party with a copy of all such filings made with the SEC. CIMA
and aaiPharma shall mail the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus to their
respective stockholders, in each case, as soon as reasonably practicable after
the Registration Statement is declared effective under the Securities Act and
the Joint Proxy Statement shall have been cleared by the SEC; provided, however,
that CIMA and aaiPharma shall consult and cooperate with each other in
determining the appropriate time for mailing the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus in light of the date set for the CIMA Meeting and the
aaiPharma Meeting. aaiPharma shall cause Holding Company to take any action
(other than qualifying to do business in any jurisdiction in which it is not now
so qualified or to file a general consent to service of process) required to be
taken under any applicable federal or state securities laws in connection with
the issuance of HoldCo Common Stock pursuant to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. Each of CIMA, aaiPharma and Holding Company shall furnish all
information concerning it and the holders of its capital stock as any party
hereto may reasonably request in connection with such actions and the
preparation of the Registration Statement and the Proxy Statement.

         (b) Each of aaiPharma and CIMA will advise the other party, promptly
after it receives notice thereof, of the time when the Registration Statement
has become effective, the issuance of any stop order, the suspension of the
qualification of the HoldCo Common Stock issuable in connection with the Mergers
for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or any request by the SEC for
amendment of the Joint Proxy Statement or the Registration Statement.

         (c) aaiPharma, CIMA and Holding Company each agrees, as to itself and
its Subsidiaries, that none of the information supplied or to be supplied by it
for inclusion or incorporation by reference in (i) the Registration Statement
will, at the time the Registration Statement and each amendment or supplement
thereto, if any, becomes effective under the Securities Act, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading and
(ii) the Joint Proxy Statement and any amendment or supplement thereto will, at
the date of mailing to stockholders and at the time of the aaiPharma Meeting or
the CIMA Meeting, as the case may be, contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances
under which such statement was made, not misleading. If, at any time prior to
the Effective Time, any information relating to CIMA, aaiPharma, Holding Company
or any of their Subsidiaries, or any of their respective Affiliates, officers or
directors, should be discovered by CIMA, aaiPharma or Holding Company that
should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to any of the Registration
Statement or the Joint Proxy Statement so that any of such documents would not
include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading, the party which discovers such information
shall promptly notify the other party hereto and, to the extent required by Law,
an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be
promptly filed with the SEC and disseminated to the stockholders of CIMA and
aaiPharma.



                                       45
<PAGE>

         (d) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the
contrary, no amendment or supplement (including by incorporation by reference)
to the Joint Proxy Statement or the Registration Statement shall be made without
the approval of both aaiPharma and CIMA, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed; provided that with respect to documents filed
by a party which are incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement or
Joint Proxy Statement, this right of approval shall apply only with respect to
information relating to the other party or its business, financial condition or
results of operations; provided, further, that CIMA, in connection with a Change
in the CIMA Recommendation (as defined in Section 6.02(f)), and aaiPharma, in
connection with a Change in the aaiPharma Recommendation (as defined in Section
6.02(e)), may amend or supplement the Joint Proxy Statement or Registration
Statement (including by incorporation by reference) pursuant to a Qualifying
Amendment (as defined below) to effect such a Change, and in such event, the
right of approval shall apply only with respect to information relating to the
other party or its business, financial condition or results of operations, and
shall be subject to the right of each party to have its Board of Directors'
deliberations and conclusions accurately described. A "Qualifying Amendment"
means an amendment or supplement to the Joint Proxy Statement or Registration
Statement (including by incorporation by reference) to the extent it contains
(i) a Change in the CIMA Recommendation or a Change in the aaiPharma
Recommendation (as the case may be), (ii) a statement of the reasons of the CIMA
Board or the aaiPharma Board (as the case may be) for making such Change in the
CIMA Recommendation or Change in the aaiPharma Recommendation (as the case may
be) and (iii) additional information reasonably related to the foregoing.

         (e) Prior to the termination of this Agreement, aaiPharma shall duly
take all lawful action to call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of
its stockholders (the "aaiPharma Meeting") as soon as reasonably practicable
following the date the Registration Statement becomes effective and the Joint
Proxy Statement is cleared by the SEC and after coordination with CIMA for the
purpose of obtaining the aaiPharma Stockholder Approval; provided that subject
to applicable Law, so long as the Registration Statement becomes effective and
the Joint Proxy Statement is cleared by the SEC, in each case not later than
thirty Business Days prior to the Termination Date, the aaiPharma Meeting shall
be held not later than five Business Days prior to the Termination Date;
provided, further, that aaiPharma shall not be required to hold the aaiPharma
Meeting prior to the date of the CIMA Meeting. In connection with the aaiPharma
Meeting and the transactions contemplated hereby, aaiPharma will (i) subject to
applicable Law and this Section 6.02(e), use its reasonable best efforts
(including postponing or adjourning the aaiPharma Meeting to obtain a quorum or
to solicit additional proxies) to obtain the necessary approvals by its
stockholders of this Agreement and (ii) otherwise comply with all legal
requirements applicable to the aaiPharma Meeting. The Board of Directors of
aaiPharma shall recommend adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders of
aaiPharma as set forth in Section 5.03(bb)(2) (the "aaiPharma Recommendation"),
and shall not withdraw, modify or qualify (or propose to withdraw, modify or
qualify) (a "Change") in any manner adverse to CIMA such recommendation or take
any action or make any statement in connection with the aaiPharma Meeting
inconsistent with such recommendation (collectively, a "Change in the aaiPharma
Recommendation"); provided that the foregoing shall not prohibit accurate
disclosure (and such disclosure shall not be deemed to be a Change in the
aaiPharma Recommendation) of factual information regarding the business,
financial condition or results of operations of CIMA or aaiPharma or the fact
that an Acquisition Proposal has been made, the identity of the party



                                       46

making such proposal or the material terms of such proposal (provided that the
aaiPharma Board does not withdraw, modify or qualify (or propose to withdraw,
modify or qualify) in any manner adverse to CIMA the aaiPharma Recommendation)
in the Registration Statement or the Joint Proxy Statement or otherwise, to the
extent such information, facts, identity or terms is required to be disclosed
under applicable Law; and, provided, further, that the aaiPharma Board may make
a Change in the aaiPharma Recommendation pursuant to Section 6.03(e) hereof.
Notwithstanding any Change in the aaiPharma Recommendation, this Agreement shall
be submitted to the stockholders of aaiPharma at the aaiPharma Meeting for the
purpose of adopting this Agreement and approving the aaiPharma Merger; provided
that this Agreement shall not be required to be submitted to the stockholders of
aaiPharma at the aaiPharma Meeting if this Agreement has been terminated
pursuant to Section 8.01 hereof. For purposes of this Agreement, a Change in the
aaiPharma Recommendation shall be deemed to include a recommendation by the
aaiPharma Board of a third party Acquisition Proposal with respect to aaiPharma.

         (f) Prior to the termination of this Agreement, CIMA shall duly take
all lawful action to call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its
stockholders (the "CIMA Meeting") as soon as reasonably practicable following
the date the Registration Statement becomes effective and the Joint Proxy
Statement is cleared by the SEC and after coordination with aaiPharma for the
purpose of obtaining the CIMA Stockholder Approval; provided that, subject to
applicable Law, so long as the Registration Statement becomes effective and the
Joint Proxy Statement is cleared by the SEC not later than thirty Business Days
prior to the Termination Date, the CIMA Meeting shall be held not later than
five Business Days prior to the Termination Date; provided, further, that CIMA
shall not be required to hold the CIMA Meeting prior to the date of the
aaiPharma Meeting. In connection with the CIMA Meeting and the transactions
contemplated hereby, CIMA will (i) subject to applicable Law and this Section
6.02(f), use its reasonable best efforts (including postponing or adjourning the
CIMA Meeting to obtain a quorum or to solicit additional proxies) to obtain the
necessary approvals by its stockholders of this Agreement and (ii) otherwise
comply with all legal requirements applicable to the CIMA Meeting. The CIMA
Board shall recommend adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders of CIMA as
set forth in Section 5.03(bb)(1) (the "CIMA Recommendation"), and shall not
Change in any manner adverse to aaiPharma such recommendation or take any action
or make any statement in connection with the CIMA Meeting inconsistent with such
recommendation (collectively, a "Change in the CIMA Recommendation"); provided
that the foregoing shall not prohibit accurate disclosure (and such disclosure
shall not be deemed to be a Change in the CIMA Recommendation) of factual
information regarding the business, financial condition or results of operations
of CIMA or aaiPharma or the fact that an Acquisition Proposal has been made, the
identity of the party making such proposal or the material terms of such
proposal (provided that the CIMA Board does not withdraw, modify or qualify (or
propose to withdraw, modify or qualify) in any manner adverse to aaiPharma the
CIMA Recommendation) in the Registration Statement or the Joint Proxy Statement
or otherwise, to the extent such information, facts, identity or terms is
required to be disclosed under applicable Law; and, provided further, that the
CIMA Board may make a Change in the CIMA Recommendation pursuant to Section
6.03(e) hereof. Notwithstanding any Change in the CIMA Recommendation, this
Agreement shall be submitted to the stockholders of CIMA at the CIMA Meeting for
the purpose of adopting this Agreement and approving the CIMA Merger; provided
that this Agreement shall not be required to be submitted to the stockholders of
CIMA at the CIMA Meeting if this Agreement has been



                                       47
<PAGE>

terminated pursuant to Section 8.01 hereof. For purposes of this Agreement, a
Change in the CIMA Recommendation shall be deemed to include a recommendation by
the CIMA Board of a third party Acquisition Proposal with respect to CIMA.

         (g) Nothing in this Section 6.02 shall permit either party to terminate
this Agreement (except as specifically provided in Article VIII).

         6.03 Acquisition Proposals.

         (a) After the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time or earlier
termination of this Agreement, each of CIMA and aaiPharma agrees that neither it
nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any of the officers, directors or employees of
it or its Subsidiaries shall, and that it shall use its reasonable best efforts
to cause its and its Subsidiaries' other Representatives not to, directly or
indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit, encourage, knowingly facilitate or induce any
inquiry with respect to, or the making, submission or announcement of, any
Acquisition Proposal, (ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations
regarding, or furnish to any Person any nonpublic information with respect to,
or take any other action to facilitate any inquiries or the making of any
proposal that constitutes or may reasonably be expected to lead to, any
Acquisition Proposal (except to notify such Person as to the existence of these
provisions or to the extent specifically permitted pursuant to this Section
6.03), (iii) accept, approve, endorse or recommend any Acquisition Proposal
(except to the extent specifically permitted pursuant to this Section 6.03), or
(iv) enter into any letter of intent or similar document or any agreement,
commitment or understanding contemplating or otherwise relating to any
Acquisition Proposal or a transaction contemplated thereby (except for
confidentiality agreements specifically permitted pursuant to Section
6.03(c)(3)). Each of aaiPharma, CIMA and their officers, directors and employees
will immediately cease and cause to be terminated, and shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause its and its Subsidiaries' other Representatives to
immediately cease and terminate, any activities, discussions or negotiations
conducted before the date of this Agreement with any Persons other than CIMA or
aaiPharma, as the case may be, with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, and
will use its reasonable best efforts to enforce any confidentiality or similar
agreement relating to any such Acquisition Proposal.

         (b) aaiPharma and CIMA will as promptly as practicable (and in no event
later than within one Business Day after receipt thereof) notify the other party
in writing following receipt of any Acquisition Proposal or any request for
nonpublic information or inquiry which it reasonably believes could lead to an
Acquisition Proposal. Such notice shall set forth in reasonable detail the
substance and material terms of such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry
(including the identity of the Person making such Acquisition Proposal, request
or inquiry). aaiPharma and CIMA will keep the other party apprised of any
related developments, discussions and negotiations (including any material
changes or modifications to the terms and conditions of the Acquisition
Proposal, request or inquiry) on a current basis, and provide to the other
party, as soon as reasonably practicable, copies of all written materials
provided or made available in connection with such Acquisition Proposal, request
or inquiry (including the form of any merger agreement or acquisition agreement,
as the case may be, in connection with any such Acquisition Proposal). aaiPharma
and CIMA shall provide the other party with forty-eight (48) hours' prior notice
(or such lesser prior notice as is provided to the members of its Board of



                                       48
<PAGE>

Directors) of any meeting of its Board of Directors at which such Board of
Directors is reasonably expected to consider any Acquisition Proposal.

         (c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, each of
CIMA and aaiPharma shall be permitted to engage in discussions or negotiations
with, and provide nonpublic information to, any Person that has made unsolicited
bona fide written Acquisition Proposal with respect to it, if and only to the
extent that:

                  (1) the CIMA Stockholder Approval, in the case of CIMA, or the
         aaiPharma Stockholder Approval, in the case of aaiPharma, respectively,
         shall not have been obtained;

                  (2) (x) its Board of Directors has concluded in good faith,
         after consultation with a nationally recognized financial advisor and
         its outside legal counsel, such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a
         Superior Proposal (and continues to constitute a Superior Proposal
         after taking into account any amendment or modification to this
         Agreement proposed by the other party hereto during any three Business
         Day period referenced below in Section 6.03(d)), or (y) its Board of
         Directors concludes in good faith, after consultation with a nationally
         recognized financial advisor and its outside legal counsel, that there
         is a reasonable likelihood that such Acquisition Proposal would
         reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal;

                  (3) prior to providing any nonpublic information to any
         Person, it shall have entered into a confidentiality agreement with
         such third party on terms no less favorable to it than the
         Confidentiality Agreement; and

                  (4) prior to providing any nonpublic information to any Person
         or entering into discussions or negotiations with any Person, it has
         notified the other party to this Agreement promptly of such Acquisition
         Proposal (a "Superior Proposal Notice") and has otherwise complied with
         its obligations under Section 6.03(b).

         (d) For a period of not less than three Business Days after CIMA's or
aaiPharma's delivery of any Superior Proposal Notice to the other party, it
shall, if requested by the other party, negotiate in good faith with the other
party to revise this Agreement so that the Acquisition Proposal that constituted
a Superior Proposal no longer constitutes a Superior Proposal (a "Former
Superior Proposal"). The terms and conditions of this Section 6.03 shall again
apply to any inquiry or proposal made by any Person who withdraws a Superior
Proposal or who made a Former Superior Proposal (after withdrawal or after such
time as such proposal is a Former Superior Proposal).

         (e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, each of
CIMA and aaiPharma shall be permitted to effect a Change in CIMA Recommendation
or a Change in aaiPharma Recommendation, as the case may be, if and only to the
extent that:

                  (1) the CIMA Stockholder Approval, in the case of CIMA, or the
         aaiPharma Stockholder Approval, in the case of aaiPharma, respectively,
         shall not have been obtained;



                                       49
<PAGE>

                  (2) it shall have (x) provided written notice to the other
         party stating that it intends to change its recommendation and the
         manner in which it intends to do so, and (y) complied with its
         obligations under Sections 6.03(b) and (d); and

                  (3) its Board of Directors has concluded in good faith, after
         receipt of advice of its outside legal counsel, that the failure of the
         Board of Directors to effect a Change in CIMA Recommendation or a
         Change in aaiPharma Recommendation, as applicable, would result in a
         breach of its fiduciary obligations to its stockholders under
         applicable Law.

         (f) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit CIMA or
aaiPharma or their Board of Directors from taking and disclosing to their
stockholders a position contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated
under the Exchange Act, provided that the content of any such disclosure
thereunder shall be governed by the terms of this Agreement. Without limiting
the foregoing proviso, neither CIMA nor aaiPharma shall effect a Change in CIMA
Recommendation or a Change in aaiPharma Recommendation, respectively, unless
specifically permitted pursuant to the terms of Section 6.03(e).

         (g) Neither CIMA nor aaiPharma shall submit to the vote of its
stockholders any Acquisition Proposal, or propose to do so, prior to termination
of this Agreement.

         (h) Each of CIMA and aaiPharma agrees that it will use reasonable best
efforts to promptly inform its Representatives of the obligations undertaken in
this Section 6.03.

         6.04 Holding Company Board and Officers.

         (a) At the Effective Time, the Holding Company Board shall consist of
eight directors, four of whom shall be current members of the aaiPharma Board
designated prior to the Effective Time by aaiPharma and four of whom shall be
current members of the CIMA Board designated prior to the Effective Time by CIMA
(collectively, such designees and any replacements therefor are referred to as
the "Board Designees"). Prior to the Effective Time, CIMA shall designate two of
its Board Designees who are Independent Directors and aaiPharma shall designate
three of its Board Designees who are Independent Directors to serve on a
selection committee (the "Selection Committee") of the Holding Company Board to
select and elect certain additional members of the Holding Company Board as set
forth in Section 6.04(b). Each of CIMA and aaiPharma shall notify the other
party of its Board Designees and those Board Designees designated to serve on
the Selection Committee no later than two Business Days prior to the Effective
Time. aaiPharma and Holding Company agree to take all action necessary to elect
the Board Designees to serve as the Holding Company Board immediately prior to
the Effective Time. aaiPharma and Holding Company agree to take all action
necessary to cause the Holding Company Board to establish the Selection
Committee as a committee of the Holding Company Board, immediately prior to the
Effective Time, empowered to take all actions described in Section 6.04(b)
below. In the event that, prior to the Effective Time, any of the Board
Designees or of the designated members of the Selection Committee becomes unable
or unwilling to serve as a member of the Holding Company Board or Selection
Committee, respectively, the party designating such Board Designee or member of
the Selection Committee, as the case may be, may designate a replacement Board
Designee or member of the Selection



                                       50
<PAGE>

Committee as applicable; provided that any replacement member of the Selection
Committee must be an Independent Director.

         (b) Within 20 Business Days after the Effective Time, the Selection
Committee shall select up to three individuals (the "Additional Directors") to
serve as members of the Holding Company Board, each of whom shall have agreed so
to serve. Each of the Additional Directors shall be Independent Directors unless
the Selection Committee unanimously agrees otherwise. The Selection Committee
may meet in person or by teleconference and at such time or times as it shall
determine for such purpose. In selecting Additional Directors, the Selection
Committee shall consider all current members of the CIMA Board and the aaiPharma
Board who are not then members of the Holding Company Board, as well as any
other individuals suggested to the Selection Committee by any member of the
Holding Company Board. Concurrently with selecting the Additional Directors, the
Selection Committee shall take all action necessary to set the number of members
of the Holding Company Board at the appropriate number (nine (9), ten (10) or
eleven (11)) and then appoint the Additional Directors to the resulting
vacancies. Action by the Selection Committee pursuant to this Section 6.04(b)
shall require the affirmative vote of a majority of the members of the Selection
Committee.

         (c) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, aaiPharma and Holding
Company shall take all action necessary (i) to remove or cause the resignation
of all members of the Holding Company Board who are not Board Designees, (ii) to
remove all of the officers of Holding Company and (iii) to appoint as officers
of Holding Company the individuals identified in Exhibit 6.04(c) to the offices
set forth opposite their names in Exhibit 6.04(c), as such Exhibit may be
amended prior to the Effective Time in accordance with Section 9.02.

         6.05 Press Releases; Public Announcements. aaiPharma and CIMA shall
consult with each other before issuing, and provide each other the opportunity
to review and make reasonable comment upon, any press release, written employee
communication or other written stockholder communication with respect to the
Mergers or this Agreement and shall not issue, or allow any of their respective
Subsidiaries to issue, any such communication or make any such public statement
without the prior consent of the other party, which will not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed; provided that a party may, without the prior consent of the
other party (but after prior consultation, to the extent practicable in the
circumstances), issue such communication or make a Regulatory Filing or other
public statement that may be required by applicable Law or securities exchange
rules on which the HoldCo Common Stock, the CIMA Common Stock or aaiPharma
Common Stock is listed, as applicable; provided, further, that a party may make
any public statement in response to specific questions by the press, analysts,
investors or those attending industry conferences or financial analyst
conference calls, so long as any such statements are not inconsistent with
previous press releases, public disclosures or public statements made jointly by
CIMA and aaiPharma and do not reveal any non-public information regarding the
other party. aaiPharma and CIMA shall cooperate to develop all public
communications and make appropriate members of management available at
presentations related to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as
reasonably requested by the other party.

         6.06 Access; Information.

         (a) Each of aaiPharma and CIMA agrees that upon reasonable notice and
subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information, it shall
(and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) afford the other party, and the other
party's Representatives, such access during normal business hours, upon
reasonable notice, throughout the period before the Effective Time to the books,
records (including Tax Returns and work papers of independent accountants),
properties, personnel and to such other information as any party may reasonably
request and, during such period, it will furnish promptly to such other party
all information concerning the business, properties and personnel of it as the
other may reasonably request; provided that such investigation shall not
unreasonably disrupt the furnishing party's operations. Neither party nor any of
its Subsidiaries shall be required to afford access or disclose information that
would jeopardize attorney-client privilege or contravene any binding agreement
with any third party. The parties shall make appropriate substitute arrangements
in circumstances where the previous sentence applies.

         (b) Each party agrees that it shall hold as confidential any
information that is nonpublic and confidential to the extent required by, and in
accordance with, the Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of May 27, 2003,
between aaiPharma and CIMA (the "Confidentiality Agreement"). Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement or in any other written or
oral understanding or agreement to which the parties hereto are parties or by
which they are bound, including the Confidentiality Agreement, the parties
hereto acknowledge and agree that any obligations of confidentiality contained
herein and therein shall not apply to the Tax treatment and Tax structure of the
Mergers upon the earlier to occur of (i) the date of the public announcement of
discussions relating to the Mergers, (ii) the date of the public announcement of
the Mergers, or (iii) the date of the execution of the Agreement, all within the
meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.6011-4; provided, however, that each
party recognizes that the privilege each has to maintain, in its sole
discretion, the confidentiality of a communication relating to the Mergers,
including a confidential communication with its attorney or a confidential
communication with a federally authorized tax practitioner under Section 7525 of
the Code, is not intended to be affected by the foregoing.

         (c) No investigation by either party of the business and affairs of the
other party, pursuant to this Section 6.06 or otherwise, shall affect or be
deemed to modify or waive any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement in
this Agreement, or the conditions to either party's obligation to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

         6.07 Takeover Laws and Rights Plans.

         (a) No party shall take any action that would cause the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement to be subject to requirements imposed by any
Takeover Law, and each of them shall take all necessary steps within its control
to exempt (or ensure the continued exemption of) those transactions from, or if
necessary challenge the validity or applicability of, any applicable Takeover
Law, as now or hereafter in effect. No party shall take any action that would
cause the transactions contemplated by this Agreement not to comply with any
Takeover Provisions, and each of them shall take all necessary steps within its
control to make those transactions comply with (or continue to comply with) the
Takeover Provisions.



                                       52

         (b) The CIMA Board shall not, without the prior written consent of
aaiPharma, (i) amend the CIMA Rights Agreement or (ii) take any action to, or
make any determination under, the CIMA Rights Agreement, including a redemption
of the CIMA Rights, except upon the termination of this Agreement pursuant to
Section 8.01(i).

         (c) aaiPharma shall not adopt any stockholder rights plan or similar
agreement prior to the Effective Time.

         6.08 Nasdaq Listing. CIMA, aaiPharma and Holding Company shall use all
reasonable best efforts to cause the shares of HoldCo Common Stock to be issued
pursuant to the Mergers and to be issued upon the exercise of CIMA Stock Options
or aaiPharma Stock Options following the Effective Time to be approved for
listing on Nasdaq, subject to official notice of issuance, as promptly as
practicable, and in any event before the Effective Time.

         6.09 Regulatory and Third Party Approvals.

         (a) Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided, CIMA and
aaiPharma shall:

                  (1) as promptly as reasonably practicable make their
         respective filings under the HSR Act with respect to the Mergers, and
         thereafter promptly make any other required submissions under the HSR
         Act;

                  (2) use their reasonable best efforts to cooperate with one
         another in (A) determining which filings are required to be made prior
         to the Effective Time with, and which consents, approvals, permits or
         authorizations are required to be obtained prior to the Effective Time
         from Governmental Authorities in connection with the execution and
         delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the Mergers and the
         transactions contemplated hereby (the "Requisite Regulatory Approvals")
         and (B) timely making all such filings in respect of those Requisite
         Regulatory Approvals and timely seeking all such Requisite Regulatory
         Approvals;

                  (3) use their reasonable best efforts to prepare and file, as

                  (4) promptly notify each other as soon as is reasonably
         practicable of any material communication concerning this Agreement or
         the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Mergers) to that
         party or its Subsidiaries from any Governmental Authority and permit
         the other party to review in advance any proposed communications
         concerning this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby
         (including the Mergers) to any Governmental Authority;

                  (5) to the extent reasonably practicable, not agree to
         participate in any meeting or discussion with any Governmental
         Authority in respect of any filings, investigation or other inquiry
         concerning this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby
         (including the Mergers) unless it consults with the other party in
         advance and, to the extent reasonably practicable and permitted by such
         Governmental Authority, gives the other party the opportunity to attend
         and participate in the meeting or discussion;



                                       53
<PAGE>

                  (6) furnish the other party with copies of all material
         correspondence, filings and communications (and memoranda setting forth
         the substance thereof) between them and their Affiliates and their
         respective Representatives on the one hand, and any Governmental
         Authority or members or their respective staffs on the other hand, with
         respect to this Agreement and the Mergers;

                  (7) furnish the other party with such necessary information
         and reasonable assistance as such other party and its Affiliates may
         reasonably request in connection with their preparation of necessary
         filings, registrations or submissions of information to any
         Governmental Authority, including any filings necessary or appropriate
         under the provisions of the HSR Act; and

                  (8) not voluntarily extend any waiting period under the HSR
         Act and/or enter into any agreement with a Governmental Authority to
         delay or not to consummate the Mergers except with the prior written
         consent of the other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably
         withheld or delayed (which reasonableness shall be determined in light
         of CIMA's and aaiPharma's obligation to consummate the Mergers as
         promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this
         Agreement).

         CIMA, aaiPharma and their respective Subsidiaries may designate any
         competitively sensitive information provided to the other under this
         Section 6.09(a) as "outside counsel only." Such information shall be
         given only to outside counsel of the recipient. In addition, CIMA,
         aaiPharma and their respective Subsidiaries may redact any
         competitively sensitive information from such documents shared with the
         other party or its counsel that is not pertinent to the subject matter
         of a Requisite Regulatory Approval.

         (b) Without limiting Section 6.09(a), CIMA and aaiPharma shall:

                  (1) each use its reasonable best efforts to avoid the entry
         of, or to have vacated or terminated, any decree, order or judgment
         that would restrain, prevent or delay the Closing, including defending
         through litigation on the merits any claim asserted in any court by any
         party; and

                  (2) each use its reasonable best efforts to avoid or eliminate
         impediments under any antitrust, competition or trade regulation law
         that may be asserted by any Governmental Authority with respect to the
         Mergers so as to enable the Closing to occur as soon as reasonably
         possible (and in any event prior to the Termination Date), provided
         that nothing in this Section 6.09 shall require either CIMA or
         aaiPharma to (i) license, sell, divest or dispose of any material
         assets or businesses of CIMA or aaiPharma or any of their respective
         Subsidiaries or (ii) otherwise take or commit to take any action that
         limits in any material respect its freedom of action with respect to,
         or its ability to retain, any of the assets or businesses of CIMA or
         aaiPharma or any of their respective Subsidiaries.

         (c) Each of CIMA and aaiPharma shall give (or shall cause their
respective Subsidiaries to give) any notices to non-governmental third parties,
and use, and cause their respective Subsidiaries to use, reasonable best efforts
to obtain any non-governmental third party



                                       54
<PAGE>

consents with respect to it, (i) necessary, proper or advisable to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) required to be disclosed
in Section 5.03(g) of the CIMA Disclosure Letter or the aaiPharma Disclosure
Letter, as applicable, or (iii) required to prevent a CIMA Material Adverse
Effect or a aaiPharma Material Adverse Effect from occurring prior to or after
the Effective Time. In the event that either party shall fail to obtain any
third party consent described in the first sentence of this Section 6.09(c),
such party shall use reasonable best efforts, and shall take any such actions
reasonably requested by the other party hereto, to minimize any adverse effect
upon CIMA and aaiPharma, their respective Subsidiaries, and their respective
businesses resulting, or which could reasonably be expected to result after the
Effective Time, from the failure to obtain such consent; provided that no
obligation to make a material payment or to grant a material right shall be
imposed by this Section 6.09(c).

         6.10 Indemnification.

         (a) Following the Effective Time, Holding Company will indemnify,
defend and hold harmless, and provide advancement of expenses to, the present
and former directors and officers of CIMA or any of its Subsidiaries and the
present and former directors and officers of aaiPharma or any of its
Subsidiaries (each, an "Indemnified Party"), to the fullest extent permitted by
Law, against all costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees),
judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities (collectively, "Costs")
as incurred, in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising
out of actions or omissions occurring at or before the Effective Time (including
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement).

         (b) For a period of six years following the Effective Time, Holding
Company shall, and shall cause CIMA Surviving Corporation and aaiPharma
Surviving Corporation to, cause to be maintained in effect in the Constituent
Documents of each of CIMA Surviving Corporation and aaiPharma Surviving
Corporation, as the case may be, or any successor of either, provisions with
respect to exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses that are at
least as favorable to the intended beneficiaries as those presently contained in
the Constituent Documents of CIMA and aaiPharma, as the case may be, to the
extent permitted by Law.

         (c) For a period of six years following the Effective Time, Holding
Company shall, or shall cause aaiPharma Surviving Corporation and CIMA Surviving
Corporation, as applicable, to, provide director's and officer's liability
insurance for the benefit of the present and former officers and directors of
CIMA or any of its Subsidiaries or aaiPharma or its Subsidiaries with respect to
claims against such directors and officers arising from facts or events
occurring before the Effective Time (including the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement), which insurance will contain at least the same coverage (and
not less than $15,000,000 of coverage with respect to CIMA) and amounts, and
contain terms and conditions no less advantageous to the Indemnified Party as
that coverage currently provided to such Indemnified Party by CIMA or aaiPharma,
as the case may be; provided, however, that Holding Company, CIMA Surviving
Corporation and aaiPharma Surviving Corporation collectively shall not be
required to pay annual premiums in excess of $4,000,000, in which case Holding
Company shall, or shall cause aaiPharma Surviving Corporation and CIMA Surviving
Corporation, as applicable, to obtain in the aggregate as much comparable
insurance as is reasonably available for such amount to provide, to the extent
practicable, the same amount of coverage with respect to the present and



                                       55
<PAGE>

former officers and directors of CIMA and any of its Subsidiaries as coverage
with respect to the present and former officers and directors of aaiPharma and
any of its Subsidiaries; and provided, further, that an Indemnified Party may be
required to make application and provide customary representations and
warranties to Holding Company's insurance carrier for the purpose of obtaining
such insurance.

         (d) The rights of each Indemnified Party hereunder shall be in addition
to, and not in limitation of, any other rights such Indemnified Party may have
under the Constituent Documents of CIMA or aaiPharma, any other indemnification
arrangement, the DGCL or otherwise. The provisions of this Section 6.10 shall
survive the consummation of the Mergers.

         (e) If Holding Company, CIMA Surviving Corporation, aaiPharma Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns consolidates with
or merges into any other entity and is not the continuing or surviving entity of
such consolidation or merger or transfers all or substantially all of its assets
to any other entity, then and in each case, Holding Company will cause proper
provision to be made so that the successors and assigns of Holding Company, CIMA
Surviving Corporation or aaiPharma Surviving Corporation, as the case may be,
shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.10.

         (f) The provisions of this Section 6.10 are expressly intended to be
for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and his
or her heirs and Representatives.

         6.11 Benefit Plans.

         (a) From and after the Effective Time, Holding Company shall, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries (including CIMA Surviving Corporation and aaiPharma
Surviving Corporation), to cause the Benefit Arrangements maintained by each of
them after the Effective Time to recognize, at the least, each Continued
Employee's years of service and employment and level of seniority with any one
of them prior to the Effective Time for purposes of eligibility, vesting,
benefit accrual and benefit determination under such Benefit Arrangements (other
than benefit accruals under any defined benefit pension plan) maintained by any
one of them after the Effective Time to the same extent that such years of
service and employment and level of seniority were recognized by the Continued
Employee's employer's substantially similar Benefit Arrangement immediately
prior to the Effective Time. Moreover, from and after the Effective Time,
Holding Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries (including CIMA
Surviving Corporation and aaiPharma Surviving Corporation) to, cause each
Benefit Plan maintained by any one of them after the Effective Time that a
Continued Employee may be eligible to participate in on or after the Effective
Time to waive any preexisting condition exclusion with respect to participation
and coverage requirements applicable to Continued Employees to the extent that
such exclusion did not apply to the Continued Employee prior to the Effective
Time under any similar Benefit Plan in which the Continued Employee participated
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If after the Effective Time, Holding
Company or any of its Subsidiaries (including CIMA Surviving Corporation and
aaiPharma Surviving Corporation) provides coverage under a group health plan for
Continued Employees (including their eligible dependents) that is different from
the group health plan in which the Continued Employees participated immediately
prior to the Effective Time, then Holding Company shall cause, or shall cause
the plan sponsor to cause, such group health plan to credit such Continued
Employees, for



                                       56
<PAGE>

the current year, with any deductibles and co-payments already incurred during
such year under the group health plan in which the Continued Employees
participated immediately prior to the Effective Time.

         (b) From and after the Effective Time, Holding Company shall honor,
fulfill and discharge and shall cause CIMA Surviving Corporation and aaiPharma
Surviving Corporation to honor, fulfill and discharge, in accordance with its
terms, each Benefit Arrangement and each employment and termination agreement
(i) between aaiPharma or any of its Subsidiaries and any officer, director or
employee of any of them or (ii) between CIMA and any officer, director or
employee of CIMA, in each case in place immediately prior to the Effective Time,
including (A) all legal and contractual obligations pursuant to outstanding
retirement plans, salary and bonus deferral plans, vested and accrued benefits
and similar employment and benefit arrangements and agreements (specifically
including all of the "change in control" provisions under Benefit Arrangements
of aaiPharma or CIMA) and (B) all vacation, personal and sick days accrued by
Employees as of the Effective Time. At the Effective Time, Holding Company shall
assume the employment agreement between aaiPharma and Frederick D. Sancilio and
shall honor, fulfill and discharge all responsibilities, and accede to all
rights, of aaiPharma thereunder. From and after the Effective Time, until the
second anniversary of the Effective Time, Holding Company and its Subsidiaries
shall not adopt or modify any Benefit Arrangement that would create or enhance
any disparity in the aggregate compensation and benefits between similarly
situated regular, full time employees of CIMA Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries on the one hand and of aaiPharma Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries on the other hand, other than to reflect local and competitive
employment market conditions. However, nothing contained in any of the foregoing
provisions of this Section 6.11(b) or elsewhere in this Agreement shall (x)
require Holding Company or its Subsidiaries (including CIMA Surviving
Corporation and aaiPharma Surviving Corporation) to continue (A) any particular
compensation or benefits or compensation, benefits or employment agreement for
any particular period of time beyond that to which it is contractually bound or
(B) any Benefit Arrangement for any particular period of time beyond that to
which it is contractually or otherwise legally bound or (y) prevent the
amendment, modification or termination of any such compensation or benefits,
compensation, benefits or employment agreement or Benefit Arrangement except as
may be prohibited by the terms thereof or otherwise by law.

         (c) Prior to the Effective Time, CIMA shall take all action necessary
to terminate the CIMA Stock Purchase Plan.

         (d) Prior to the Effective Time, CIMA shall take all action necessary
to cause all CIMA Stock Options outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time to become fully vested and exercisable immediately prior to the Effective
Time.

         6.12 Notification of Certain Matters. aaiPharma and CIMA shall each
give prompt notice to the other party of any fact, event or circumstance known
to it that (i) is reasonably likely, individually or taken together with all
other facts, events and circumstances known to it, to result in any Material
Adverse Effect with respect to it or (ii) would cause or constitute a material
breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements
contained herein that reasonably could be expected to give rise, individually or
in the aggregate, to the failure of a condition in Article VII; provided,
however, that the delivery of any notice pursuant



                                       57
<PAGE>

to this Section 6.12 shall not cure any breach of any representation or
warranty, the failure to comply with any covenant, the failure to meet any
condition or otherwise limit or affect the remedies available hereunder to the
party receiving such notice.

         6.13 Exemption from Liability Under Section 16(b).

         (a) Prior to the Effective Time, (i) assuming that aaiPharma delivers
to Holding Company the Section 16 Information in a timely and accurate manner
before the Effective Time, the Holding Company Board, or a committee of
"non-employee directors" thereof (as such term is defined for purposes of Rule
16b-3(d) under the Exchange Act), as the case may be, shall adopt a resolution
consistent with the interpretive guidance of the SEC providing that the receipt
by the aaiPharma Insiders who may be a covered Person of Holding Company for
purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange Act (together with the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder, "Section 16") of HoldCo Common Stock in
exchange for shares of aaiPharma Common Stock, and of options to purchase shares
of HoldCo Common Stock upon conversion of options to purchase shares of
aaiPharma Common Stock, in each case pursuant to the transactions contemplated
hereby and to the extent such securities are listed in the Section 16
Information, are approved by the Holding Company Board, or by such committee
thereof, as the case may be, and are intended to be exempt from liability
pursuant to Section 16(b) under the Exchange Act, such that any such receipt
will be so exempt and (ii) the aaiPharma Board, or an appropriate committee of
non-employee directors thereof, shall adopt a resolution consistent with the
interpretive guidance of the SEC so that the disposition by any officer or
director of aaiPharma who is a aaiPharma Insider of shares of aaiPharma Common
Stock or aaiPharma Stock Options pursuant to this Agreement and the Mergers
shall be an exempt transaction for purposes of Section 16.

         (b) Prior to the Effective Time, (i) assuming that CIMA delivers to
Holding Company the Section 16 Information in a timely and accurate manner
before the Effective Time, the Holding Company Board, or a committee of
"non-employee directors" thereof (as such term is defined for purposes of Rule
16b-3(d) under the Exchange Act), as the case may be, shall adopt a resolution
consistent with the interpretive guidance of the SEC providing that the receipt
by the CIMA Insiders who may be a covered Person of Holding Company for purposes
of Section 16 of HoldCo Common Stock in exchange for shares of CIMA Common
Stock, and of options to purchase shares of HoldCo Common Stock upon conversion
of options to purchase shares of CIMA Common Stock, in each case pursuant to the
transactions contemplated hereby and to the extent such securities are listed in
the Section 16 Information, are approved by the Holding Company Board, or by
such committee thereof, as the case may be, and are intended to be exempt from
liability pursuant to Section 16(b) under the Exchange Act, such that any such
receipt will be so exempt and (ii) the CIMA Board, or an appropriate committee
of non-employee directors thereof, shall adopt a resolution consistent with the
interpretive guidance of the SEC so that the disposition by any officer or
director of CIMA who is a CIMA Insider of shares of CIMA Common Stock or CIMA
Stock Options pursuant to this Agreement and the Mergers shall be an exempt
transaction for purposes of Section 16.

         6.14 Affiliate Notices. Each of CIMA and aaiPharma shall, promptly
after the date hereof and prior to the mailing of the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus, deliver to the other party a list setting forth the names
of all Persons such party expects to be, at the time of the CIMA



                                       58
<PAGE>

Meeting and the aaiPharma Meeting, as the case may be, "affiliates" of such
party for purposes of Rule 145 under the Securities Act. Each of CIMA and
aaiPharma shall furnish such other information and documents as the other party
may reasonably request for the purpose of reviewing the list. Prior to the
Effective Time, each of aaiPharma and CIMA shall deliver a notice, reasonably
acceptable to the other party, to each such Person identified as an Affiliate in
such list, describing the requirements of Rule 145 applicable to such Affiliates
by reason of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

adopt and have in full force and legal effect a stockholder rights agreement
substantially identical in all material respects to the CIMA Rights Plan or in a
form reasonably acceptable to CIMA and aaiPharma, and which exempts aaiPharma as
an "Acquiring Person" prior to the Effective Time, and shall take all such
action as is necessary to declare, immediately prior to the Effective Time, a
dividend of one (1) preferred share purchase right for each outstanding share of
HoldCo Common Stock.

         6.16 Control of Other Party's Business. Nothing contained in this
Agreement shall give any party, directly or indirectly, the right to control or
direct the operations of the other party prior to the consummation of the
Mergers. Prior to the consummation of the Mergers, each of aaiPharma and CIMA
shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
complete control and supervision over its operations.

         6.17 Treasury Regulation Statement. On the Closing Date, each of
aaiPharma and CIMA shall deliver to Holding Company a properly executed
statement in accordance with the requirements of Treasury Regulation Section
1.897-2(h) and in a form reasonably acceptable to Holding Company for purposes
of satisfying Holding Company's obligations under Treasury Regulation Section

<PAGE>

by the close of business on December 31, 2003; provided that (i) in the event
that the Registration Statement has not become effective or the Joint Proxy
Statement has not been cleared by the SEC on or prior to the date (the "SEC
Deadline Date") that is thirty Business Days prior to December 31, 2003, such
December 31, 2003 date shall be extended by the number of days after the SEC
Deadline Date (not to exceed sixty calendar days) required for both the
Registration Statement to be declared effective and the Joint Proxy Statement to
be cleared by the SEC and (ii) in the event the Closing has not occurred by
December 31, 2003 solely due to the failure to obtain a Requisite Regulatory
Approval (excluding the declaration by the SEC of the effectiveness of the
Registration Statement and the clearance by the SEC of the Joint Proxy
Statement), such December 31, 2003 date shall be extended by sixty days whether
or not extended pursuant to clause (i) of this Section 8.01(f) (the December 31,
2003 date, as extended pursuant to the preceding proviso, the "Termination
Date"); provided, further, that the right to terminate this Agreement under this
Section 8.01(f) shall not be available to any party whose failure to comply with
any provision of this Agreement has been the cause of, or materially contributed
to, the failure of the Effective Time to occur on or before such date;

         (g) Stockholders Do Not Approve. By aaiPharma or CIMA, (i) if the CIMA
Stockholder Approval shall not have been obtained at a duly held meeting of the
stockholders of CIMA called for such purpose (including any adjournment or
postponement thereof) or (ii) if the aaiPharma Stockholder Approval shall not
have been obtained at a duly held meeting of the stockholders of aaiPharma
called for such purpose (including any adjournment or postponement thereof);
provided that the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 8.01(g)
shall not be available to any party whose failure to comply with any provision
of this Agreement has been the cause of, or materially contributed to, the
failure to obtain the CIMA Stockholder Approval or the aaiPharma Stockholder
Approval, as the case may be;

         (h) Denial of Regulatory Approval. By aaiPharma or CIMA, if any
Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction shall have issued an order,
judgment, decision, opinion, decree or ruling or taken any other action (which
the party seeking to terminate shall have used its reasonable best efforts to
resist, resolve, annul, quash, or lift, as applicable) permanently enjoining or
otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this



                                       63

Agreement, and such order, decree, ruling or action shall have become final and
non-appealable; provided that the right to terminate this Agreement under this
Section 8.01(h) shall not be available to any party whose failure to comply with
any provision of this Agreement has been the cause of, or materially contributed
to, such action;

         (i) CIMA Superior Proposal. By CIMA, if, prior to receipt of the CIMA
Stockholder Approval, the CIMA Board (i) concludes in good faith, following
receipt of advice of its outside legal counsel, that the failure to accept a
Superior Proposal would result in a breach of its fiduciary duties under
applicable law, and (ii) determines to accept such Superior Proposal, but only
if CIMA fulfills its obligation to pay a termination fee to aaiPharma under
Section 8.02 hereof concurrent with such termination; provided, however, that
CIMA's right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 8.01(i) shall not be
available if CIMA is then in breach of Section 6.03; or

         (j) aaiPharma Superior Proposal. By aaiPharma, if, prior to receipt of
the aaiPharma Stockholder Approval, the aaiPharma Board (i) concludes in good
faith, following receipt of advice of its outside legal counsel, that the
failure to accept a Superior Proposal would result in a breach of its fiduciary
duties under applicable law, and (ii) determines to accept such Superior
Proposal, but only if aaiPharma fulfills its obligation to pay a termination fee
to CIMA under Section 8.02 hereof concurrent with such termination; provided,
however, that aaiPharma's right to terminate this Agreement under this Section
8.01(j) shall not be available if aaiPharma is then in breach of Section 6.03.

         The party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01
(other than pursuant to Section 8.01(a)) shall give written notice of such
termination to the other parties.

aaiPharma or CIMA) or circumstance is determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remaining provisions, or
the application of such provision to Persons or circumstances other than those
as to which it has been held invalid or unenforceable, will remain in full force
and effect and will in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated thereby, so
long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby

upon a suitable and equitable substitute provision to effect the original intent
of the parties. Prior to the termination of this Agreement in accordance with
its terms, the absence of a vote, approval or adoption by the stockholders of

not specifically required to be contained in the plan of merger to be adopted by
such stockholders pursuant to the applicable provisions of the DGCL.

         9.09 Submission to Jurisdiction; Waivers. Each party hereto irrevocably

<PAGE>

to its property, generally and unconditionally, to the nonexclusive jurisdiction
of the aforesaid courts. Each party hereto hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees
not to assert, by way of motion, as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any
action or proceeding with respect to this Agreement, (a) any claim that it is
not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the above-named courts for any
reason other than the failure to lawfully serve process, (b) that it or its
property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such court or from any
legal process commenced in such courts (whether through service of notice,
attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment,
execution of judgment or otherwise), or (c) to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law, that (i) the suit, action or proceeding in any such court is
brought in an inconvenient forum, (ii) the venue of such suit, action or
proceeding is improper or (iii) this Agreement, or the subject matter hereof,
may not be enforced in or by such courts.

         9.10 Enforcement. The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur
in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms. It is accordingly agreed that the parties
shall be entitled to specific performance of the terms hereof, this being in

         9.11 Acknowledgment. EACH PARTY HERETO ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY
CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE
COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF
